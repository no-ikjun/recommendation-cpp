 Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) was a U.S. hedge fund used for trading strategies such as fixed income arbitrage , statistical arbitrage , and pairs trading , combined with high leverage . Its collapse in 1998 led to a bailout by major banks and investment houses , and resulted in massive losses for UBS at a time when it had merged with Swiss Bank Corporation . However , UBS involvement with LTCM pre @-@ dated the merger . 
 UBS had initially been reluctant to invest in LTCM , rebuffing an investment in 1994 and , again shortly thereafter . UBS , suffering criticism for its conservative business model , was looking for ways to catch up to its key Swiss rivals and viewed LTCM as the type of client that could help accelerate the bank 's growth . In 1997 , UBS entered into a financing arrangement with LTCM , and the hedge fund quickly became the bank 's largest client , generating US $ 15 million in fees for UBS . Union Bank of Switzerland sold LTCM a 7 @-@ year European call option on 1 million shares in LTCM , then valued at about US $ 800 million . It hedged this option by purchasing a US $ 800 million interest in LTCM and invested a further US $ 300 million in the hedge fund . Originally intended to provide UBS with a steady stream of income , UBS instead suffered major losses when the hedge fund collapsed . Following the merger , Swiss Bank managers were surprised to discover the massive exposure to LTCM at UBS . Ultimately , UBS was unable to sell or hedge its interest in LTCM as its value declined in the summer of 1998 . 
 By November 1998 , UBS 's losses from its exposure to LTCM were estimated at the level of approximately CHF 790 million . UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse , ultimately writing off CHF 950 million . The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US $ 3 @.@ 625 billion by the hedge fund 's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets . UBS contributed US $ 300 million to the bailout effort , which would largely be recovered . In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse , Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS , along with three other executives . 
 Following its involvement with LTCM , UBS issued a statement : " Given the developments in the international financial markets , in the future UBS will [ ... ] focus even more intensively on those areas of business likely to generate sustainable earnings with a justifiable level of risk . "

 On 3 November 2000 , UBS merged with Paine Webber , an American stock brokerage and asset management firm led by chairman and CEO Donald Marron . At the time of its merger with UBS , Paine Webber had emerged as the fourth largest private client firm in the United States with 385 offices employing 8 @,@ 554 brokers . The acquisition pushed UBS to the top wealth and asset management firm in the world . Initially , the business was given the divisional name UBS PaineWebber but in 2003 the 123 @-@ year @-@ old name Paine Webber disappeared when it was renamed UBS Wealth Management USA . UBS took a CHF 1 billion writedown for the loss of goodwill associated with the retirement of the Paine Webber brand when it integrated its brands under the unified UBS name in 2003 . 
 John P. Costas , a former bond trader and co @-@ head of Fixed income at Credit Suisse First Boston and head of Fixed Income Trading at Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998 , was appointed CEO of UBS 's investment banking division , which originated in SBC 's Warburg Dillon Read division and was renamed UBS Warburg in December 2001 . In an attempt to break into the elite bulge bracket of investment banks , in which UBS then had little success while rival Credit Suisse was establishing itself as a major player on Wall Street with the acquisition of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000 , Costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms . Costas had followed a similar approach in building out the UBS fixed income business , hiring over 500 sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from US $ 300 million in 1998 to over US $ 3 billion by 2001 . 
 The arrival of former Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banker Ken Moelis marked a major coup for Costas . Moelis joined UBS from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in 2001 shortly after its acquisition by Credit Suisse First Boston ( although Huw Jenkins claimed he had hired Moelis to the UK Parliamentary Banking commission while under oath , which is patently false ) . In his six years at UBS , Moelis ultimately assumed the role of president of UBS Investment Bank and was credited , along with Costas , with the build @-@ out of UBS 's investment banking operation in the United States . Within weeks of joining , Moelis brought over a team of 70 bankers from Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . Costas and Moelis hired more than 30 senior U.S. bankers from 2001 through 2004 . 
 It was estimated that UBS spent as much as US $ 600 million to US $ 700 million hiring top bankers in the U.S. during this three @-@ year period . Among the bank 's other major recruits during this period were Olivier Sarkozy , Ben <unk> , Blair Effron , and Jeff McDermott . 
 By 2003 , UBS had risen to fourth place from seventh in global investment banking fees , earning US $ 2 @.@ 1 billion of the US $ 39 billion paid to investment banks that year , increasing 33 % . Over the next four years , UBS consistently ranked in the top 4 in the global fee pool and established a track record of 20 consecutive quarters of rising profits . 
 However , by the end of 2006 , UBS began to experience changing fortunes . In late 2005 , Costas headed a new hedge fund unit within UBS known as Dillon Read Capital Management . His former position was taken over by Huw Jenkins , a long @-@ time legacy UBS investment banker . In 2006 , UBS bankers Blair Effron and Michael Martin announced their departures . In March 2007 , Moelis announced that he was leaving the company , and shortly thereafter founded a new business , Moelis & Company . As he had when joining UBS , Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers . Moelis 's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank 's balance sheet to pursue large transactions , particularly leveraged buyouts . The bank 's apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees . After Moelis , other notable departures included investment banking co @-@ head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and , as the financial crisis set in , other high @-@ profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben <unk> in 2009 . 
 = = = The beginning of UBS ' troubles : <unk> mortgage crisis ( 2007 ) = = = 
 At the beginning of 2007 , UBS became the first Wall Street firm to announce a heavy loss in the subprime mortgage sector as the subprime mortgage crisis began to develop . In May 2007 , UBS announced the closure of its Dillon Read Capital Management ( DRCM ) division . Before that time , there was little understanding of the troubles at DRCM or the massive expansion of risk engineered by the investment banking division under the leadership of the newly placed CEO Huw Jenkins . 
 DRCM , which was a large internal hedge fund , had been started with much publicity in 2005 and invested money both on behalf of UBS and some of its clients . DRCM had been formed in large part to keep some of the bank 's traders from defecting to hedge funds , as well as to create a position for John Costas , who had been instrumental in creating UBS 's successful investment banking business in the U.S. from 2001 – 2005 . Costas had been replaced by Huw Jenkins , a long @-@ time legacy UBS investment banker with little fixed income or mortgage experience . DRCM hired a large team of professionals , many of whom were attracted from the investment bank with large compensation packages . Although in 2006 , <unk> had generated a profit for the bank of US $ 720 million , after UBS took over DRCM 's positions in May 2007 , losses grew from the US $ 124 million recorded by DRCM , ultimately to " 16 % of the US $ 19 billion in losses UBS recorded . " The UBS investment bank continued to expand subprime risk in the second quarter of 2007 while most market participants were reducing risk , resulting in not only expanding DRCM losses but creating the 84 % of the other losses experienced by the bank . By October 2007 , UBS was indicating that the assets could not be sold given the illiquidity in the market . 
 In response to the growing series of problems at UBS , and possibly his role in spearheading Costas ' departure from the bank , Peter <unk> unexpectedly stepped down as CEO of the firm during the second quarter of 2007 . <unk> would be joined by many of his fellow managers in the next year , most notably the bank 's chairman Marcel Ospel . However , the bank 's problems continued through the end of 2007 , when the bank reported its first quarterly loss in over five years . As its losses jeopardized the bank 's capital position , UBS quickly raised US $ 11 @.@ 5 billion of capital in December 2007 , US $ 9 @.@ 7 billion of which came from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation ( GIC ) and US $ 1 @.@ 8 billion from an unnamed Middle Eastern investor . Those 2007 capital injections would initially be highly unpopular among UBS shareholders who clamored to have an opportunity to participate on the same terms . However , over time , these early investments in UBS proved to be unsuccessful for the investors involved , as the bank 's stock price remained below 2007 levels more than two years later . 
 = = = = Impact of the financial crisis ( 2008 – 2009 ) = = = = 
 After a significant expansion of fixed income risk during 2006 and 2007 under the leadership of Huw Jenkins , the UBS Investment Bank CEO , the bank 's losses continued to mount in 2008 when UBS announced in April 2008 that it was writing down a further US $ 19 billion of investments in subprime and other mortgage assets . ( Jenkins had been asked to leave in October 2007 . ) By this point , UBS 's total losses in the mortgage market were in excess of US $ 37 billion , the largest such losses of any of its peers . In response to its losses , UBS announced a CHF 15 billion rights offering to raise the additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital . UBS cut its dividend in order to protect its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio , seen by investors as a key to its credibility as the world 's largest wealth management company . Marcel Ospel , who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998 , also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer , the bank ’ s general counsel with virtually no banking experience . This ultimately proved very costly to UBS . 
 In October 2008 , UBS announced that it had placed CHF 6 billion of new capital , through mandatory convertible notes , with Swiss Confederation . The SNB ( Swiss National Bank ) and UBS made an agreement to transfer approximately US $ 60 billion of currently illiquid securities and various assets from UBS to a separate fund entity . In November 2008 , UBS put US $ 6 billion of equity into the new “ bad bank ” entity , keeping only an option to benefit if the value of its assets were to recover . Heralded as a “ neat ” package by the New York Times , the UBS structure guaranteed clarity for UBS investors by making an outright sale . 
 UBS announced in February 2009 that it had lost nearly CHF 20 billion ( US $ 17 @.@ 2 billion ) in 2008 , the biggest single @-@ year loss of any company in Swiss history . Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007 , UBS has written down more than US $ 50 billion from subprime mortgage investments and cut more than 11 @,@ 000 jobs .

 By the spring of 2009 , UBS announced another management restructuring and initiated a plan to return to profitability . <unk> Johansson , the head of the investment bank division , resigned in April 2009 and was replaced by Alex Wilmot @-@ Sitwell and Carsten Kengeter . At the same time , UBS announced the planned cut of 8 @,@ 700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan . Under the plan , no more than one @-@ third of any cash bonus would be paid out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock @-@ based incentives that would vest after three years ; top executives would have to hold 75 % of any vested shares . Additionally , the bank 's chairman , Peter Kurer , would no longer receive any extra variable compensation , only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years . In April 2009 , UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business , UBS <unk> , for approximately US $ 2 @.@ 5 billion to <unk> Investments . UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division . 
 By the summer of 2009 , UBS was showing increased signs of stabilization . The Swiss government sold its CHF 6 billion stake in UBS in late 2008 at a large profit ; Switzerland had purchased convertible notes in 2008 to help UBS clear its balance sheets of toxic assets . Taking advantage of improved conditions in the stock market in mid @-@ 2009 , UBS placed US $ 3 @.@ 5 billion of shares with a small number of large institutional investors . Oswald Grübel announced , “ We are building a new UBS , one that performs to the highest standards and behaves with integrity and honesty ; one that distinguishes itself not only through the clarity and reliability of the advice and services it provides but in how it manages and executes . " Grübel reiterated plans to maintain an integrated business model of providing wealth management , investment banking , and asset management services . 
 In August 2010 , UBS launched a new advertising campaign featuring the slogan : “ We will not rest " and signed a global sponsorship agreement with Formula 1 . 
 On 26 October 2010 , UBS announced that its private bank recorded net new funds of CHF 900 million during the third quarter , compared to an outflow of CHF 5 @.@ 5 billion in second quarter . UBS 's third quarter net profit of US $ 1 @.@ 65 billion beat analyst estimates , continuing a string of profitability . 
 After the elimination of almost 5 @,@ 000 jobs , UBS announced on 23 August 2011 that it was further cutting another 3 @,@ 500 positions in order to " improve operating efficiency " and save CHF 1 @.@ 5 to CHF 2 billion a year . 45 percent of the job cuts would come from the investment banking unit , which continued to post dismal figures since the 2008 financial crisis , while the rest would come from the wealth management and asset management divisions . The firm has seen profits fall due to the rise of the Swiss franc . 
 On 30 October 2012 , UBS announced that it was cutting 10 @,@ 000 jobs worldwide in an effort to slim down its investment banking operations , of which 2 @,@ 500 would be in Switzerland , followed by the United States and Great Britain . This 15 @-@ percent staff cut would make overall staff count come down from 63 @,@ 745 to 54 @,@ 000 . ( For comparison , the peak employment level in 2007 before the 2008 financial crisis was 83 @,@ 500 . ) UBS also announced that the investment bank would focus on its traditional strengths and exit much of its fixed income trading business that was not economically profitable . 
 On 19 December 2012 , UBS was fined $ 1 @.@ 5 billion ( $ 1 @.@ 2 billion to the United States Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , £ 160 million to the UK Financial Services Authority , and CHF 60 million to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority ) for its role in the Libor scandal over accusations that it tried to rig benchmark interest rates . US Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer described the conduct of UBS as " simply astonishing " and declared the US would seek , as a criminal matter , the extradition of traders Tom Hayes and Roger Darin . The bank stated that these and other fines would probably result in a significant fourth @-@ quarter loss in 2012 . The fine levied by the FSA , although reduced due to the bank 's cooperation , was the largest in the agency 's history . 
 In November 2014 , regulators including the FCA and <unk> hit UBS with fines , along with other banks , for currency manipulation . 
 On 6 January 2014 , it was reported that UBS had become the largest private banker in the world , with $ 1 @.@ 7 trillion in assets . 
 In May 2015 , media reports revealed UBS is planning to sell its Australian private banking division to some of its management after a review of underperforming businesses was conducted at the company .

 With Oswald Grübel 's resignation as CEO and Ermotti 's interim appointment on 24 September 2011 , The Wall Street Journal reported that the succession process appeared to be a two @-@ person race between Ermotti from EMEA and Kengeter from the investment bank .

 Previously , on 29 February 2009 , Marcel Rohner had resigned and was succeeded by Grübel . On 1 April 2009 , Grübel hired Ulrich Körner in a newly established role as Chief operating officer ( COO ) and CEO of Corporate Center . Körner 's task was to cut administrative expenses and boost profits . After the last Annual General Meeting in May 2016 , Robert W. Scully and Dieter <unk> were elected as new members of the Board . It has been decided that Martin Blessing will assume the role as President Personal & Corporate Banking and President UBS Switzerland , replacing Lukas <unk> , who himself will take the new role as Chairman of the Region Switzerland .

 In January 1997 , Christoph Meili , a night guard at the Union Bank of Switzerland ( precursor of UBS ) in Zürich , Switzerland , discovered that bank officials were destroying documents about orphaned assets , believed to be the credit balances of deceased Jewish clients whose heirs ' whereabouts were unknown , as well as books from the Nazi German Reichsbank . The books listed real @-@ estate records for Berlin property that had been seized by the Nazis , placed in Swiss accounts , and then claimed to be owned by UBS . The destruction of such documents is illegal under Swiss law . This edict was the legal basis and foundation of the <unk> commission , constituted on 19 December 1996 . Articles 4 , 5 , and 7 made the destruction or withholding of documents relating to orphaned assets illegal . 
 Meili took some of the bank files home , then handed them over to a local Jewish organization , which brought the documents to the police and eventually to the press that subsequently revealed the document destruction . Zurich 's authorities opened a judicial investigation against Meili for suspected violations of the Swiss laws on banking secrecy , which is a prosecutable offense ex officio in Switzerland . After Meili and his family reported receiving death threats , they fled to the United States and were granted political asylum . 
 After a US $ 2 @.@ 56 billion lawsuit was filed against UBS and other Swiss banks on behalf of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust , a settlement was reached between UBS and other Swiss banks that had laundered Nazi assets totaling US $ 1 @.@ 25 billion in August 1998 . 
 In his book Imperfect Justice , Stuart Eizenstat claimed the " Meili Affair " was important in the decision of Swiss banks to participate in the process of reparations for victims of Nazi looting during World War II . He wrote that the affair " did more than anything to turn the Swiss banks into international pariahs by linking their dubious behavior during and after the war to the discovery of a seemingly unapologetic attempt to cover it up now by destroying documents . " Eizenstat believes that the affair influenced the Swiss Bankers Association ( SBA ) decision to create a Humanitarian Fund for the Victims of the Holocaust , as well as being one of a series of events that influenced the calling of the 1997 London Conference on Nazi Gold .

 The Indian securities regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) alleged that UBS had played a role in the 2004 " Black Monday " stock market crash which followed the National Democratic Alliance government ’ s defeat in the general elections . SEBI 's ruling of 17 May 2005 barred UBS from issuing or renewing participatory notes for one year . The ban was later lifted on appeal , as a result of a Securities Appellate Tribunal ( SAT ) ruling on 9 September 2005 . SEBI challenged SAT 's order in the Supreme Court of India . On 9 February 2009 , the Supreme Court disposed of the case after SEBI and UBS said they had reached a settlement under which UBS agreed to pay an amount of about ₹ 50 lakh ( US $ 74 @,@ 000 ) .

 In April 2005 , UBS lost the landmark discrimination and sexual harassment case , <unk> v. UBS Warburg .

The jury found that her manager , Matthew Chapin , had denied her important accounts and mocked her appearance to co @-@ workers . She claimed that several sexist policies in place , such as entertaining clients at strip clubs , made it difficult for women to socialize and foster business contacts with clients . The jury found that UBS had destroyed relevant e @-@ mail evidence after the litigation hold had been in place . UBS was ordered to pay the plaintiff US $ 9 @.@ 1 million in compensatory damages ( including back pay and professional damage ) , and US $ 20 @.@ 2 million in punitive damages . 
 On 18 October 2005 , three African @-@ American employees filed a class action lawsuit against the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging racial discrimination in hiring , promotion , and other employment practices . The three plaintiffs in Freddie H. Cook , Sylvester L. Flaming Jr . , and Timothy J. Gandy v. UBS Financial Services , Inc . , claimed that segregation and discrimination in job assignments and compensation were widespread and the firm had done nothing to diversify its workforce . The lawsuit also claimed that offices operating in Largo , Maryland and Flushing , New York were illegally created to serve African @-@ Americans and Asian @-@ Americans respectively , and that the firm ’ s management frequently ridiculed the Largo branch office and its staff , referring to it as a “ diversity ” office . On 23 April 2007 , U.S. District Judge , Peter J. <unk> , granted plaintiff 's request to dismiss the class allegations without prejudice .

 In 2005 , Bradley Birkenfeld , a Geneva @-@ based employee who worked in the bank 's North American wealth management business , claimed that UBS 's dealings with American clients violated an agreement between the bank and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service . He said that he was disturbed by an internal legal document that he believed was prepared to give UBS legal cover should bank @-@ sanctioned illegal activities be uncovered . The bank could then shift the blame to its employees . He subsequently complained to UBS compliance officials about the bank 's " unfair and deceptive business practices " . When he received no response after three months , he wrote to UBS General Counsel Peter Kurer about the illegal practices . Subsequently , Birkenfeld resigned from UBS in October 2005 . 
 In 2007 , Birkenfeld , a U.S. citizen , decided to tell the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) what he knew about UBS 's practices . At the same time , he planned to take advantage of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 that could pay him up to 30 % of any tax revenue recouped by the IRS as a result of Birkenfeld 's information . In April 2007 , Birkenfeld 's attorney arranged for Birkenfeld to be cooperating with the DOJ , though the relationship between the department and the whistleblower were troubled . Birkenfeld also met with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the IRS , and the U.S. Senate . 
 In June 2008 , based on Birkenfeld 's revelations , the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation made a formal request to enter Switzerland to probe a multimillion @-@ dollar tax evasion case involving UBS . That same month , the United States Senate panel that Birkenfeld had communicated with accused Swiss banks , including UBS , of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through offshore accounts , and estimated the total cost of this practice to be in excess of US $ 100 billion annually . According to the findings , U.S. clients held about 19 @,@ 000 accounts at UBS , with an estimated US $ 18 billion to US $ 20 billion in assets , in Switzerland . 
 In response to the report and the FBI investigation , UBS announced that it would cease providing cross @-@ border private banking services to US @-@ domiciled clients through its non @-@ US regulated units as of July 2008 . In November 2008 , a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Raoul Weil , Chairman and CEO of UBS Global Wealth Management and Business Banking and member of UBS 's Group Executive Board , in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS 's US cross @-@ border business . UBS would eventually cut ties to Weil in May 2009 and he would face charges after UBS had settled its criminal case with the government . The U.S. issued an international arrest warrant for Weil , and he was extradited to the United States after being arrested in Italy in 2013 . In January 2014 , Weil pleaded not @-@ guilty in federal court to helping U.S. taxpayers evade taxes on $ 20 billion in offshore assets . 
 On 18 February 2009 , UBS agreed to pay a fine of US $ 780 million to the U.S. government and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement ( DPA ) on charges of conspiring to defraud the United States by impeding the Internal Revenue Service . The DPA obliged UBS to pay US $ 780 million to settle criminal charges , and criminal charges were dismissed . The figures include interest , penalties , restitution for unpaid taxes and disgorgement of profits . As part of the deal , UBS also settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges of having acted as an unregistered broker / dealer and investment adviser for Americans . 
 The day after settling its criminal case on 19 February 2009 , the U.S. government filed a civil suit against UBS to reveal the names of all 52 @,@ 000 American customers , alleging that the bank and these customers conspired to defraud the IRS and federal government of the legitimately owed tax revenue . The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority ( <unk> ) had provided to the United States government the identities of , and account information for , certain United States customers of UBS ’ s cross @-@ border business as part of its criminal investigation in 2009 . On 12 August 2009 , UBS announced a settlement deal that ended its litigation with the IRS . However , this settlement set up a showdown between the U.S. and Swiss governments over the secrecy of Swiss bank accounts . It was not until June 2010 that Swiss lawmakers approved a deal to reveal client data and account details of U.S. clients who were suspected of tax evasion . 
 In February 2015 , UBS announced to be investigated by the federal government over new charges stating that UBS facilitated tax evasion by its U.S. clients . The focus of the investigation lies on the possible sale of bearer bonds , a type of unregistered security that provides anonymity to the owner . UBS announced that it was cooperating with the investigators . 
 UBS employees allegedly discussed the legal ramifications of the use of bearer bonds with their clients , a type of security that has been virtually illegal in the U.S. The government investigation is trying to determine whether there was a criminal conspiracy to evade taxes and conceal what had allegedly already been done . The investigation , which was launched in January 2015 , also aims to determine whether bearer bonds were provided as investment vehicles to UBS clients before the expiration of its 2009 deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice . The agreement lapsed in October 2010 . Should UBS have violated the agreement , the federal government can make new allegations against UBS on charges stemming from the violation . In such a case , prosecutors would likely ask for significant fines and for UBS to be put under regulatory oversight .

 On 15 September 2011 , UBS became aware of a massive loss , originally estimated at US $ 2 billion , allegedly due to unauthorized trading by <unk> Adoboli , a then 31 @-@ year @-@ old trader on the Delta One desk of the firm ’ s investment bank . Adoboli was arrested and later charged with fraud by abuse of position and false accounting dating as far back as 2008 . 
 UBS 's actual losses were subsequently confirmed as US $ 2 @.@ 3 billion , and according to the prosecutor in Adoboli 's trial he " was a gamble or two from destroying Switzerland 's largest bank for his own benefit . " 
 The bank stated that no client positions had been affected and its CEO Oswald Grübel initially dismissed calls for his resignation , commenting that “ if someone acts with criminal intent , you can ’ t do anything . ” 
 However , UBS 's management was subsequently criticized for its " lapses " by the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation , the bank 's largest shareholder , in a rare press statement on 20 September 2011 . On 24 September 2011 UBS announced Grübel 's resignation , and the appointment of Sergio Ermotti as a Group CEO on an interim basis . 
 On 5 October 2011 , Francois <unk> and Yassine <unk> , co @-@ heads of UBS 's Global Equities franchise , also resigned . 
 The scale of UBS 's losses led to renewed calls for the global separation of commercial banking from investment banking , while media commentators suggested UBS should consider downsizing its investment bank and potentially rebranding it under the resurrected S.G. Warburg name . 
 In Switzerland , where the Government had bailed out UBS in 2008 , particular concern was voiced about the nature of the alleged trading which , it was suggested , might have been directed against the interests of the Swiss economy . Christian <unk> , the President of the SP @-@ Party said , " Should it prove true that UBS , having been rescued by the state in 2008 , has speculated against the Swiss franc , [ UBS Chairman ] Villiger must take the consequences . " 
 If found guilty , <unk> will have generated the third @-@ largest loss by a rogue trader in history , after Jerome <unk> of Société Générale ( who also worked on a Delta One desk ) and Yasuo <unk> , a copper trader at Sumitomo Corporation .

 UBS was implicated in a money laundering case involving Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and an Indian citizen introduced to UBS by Khashoggi . In 2011 , Hasan Ali Khan , owner of a Pune , India stud farm , was arrested by India 's Enforcement Directorate and charged with serving as a front man for Khashoggi . Khan and Kolkata businessman <unk> <unk> were charged under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act . Allegedly , in 2003 , Khan helped launder US $ 300 million of money Khashoggi made through arms sales via the Zurich branch of UBS . 
 Introduced to UBS by Khashoggi in 1982 , Khan enabled the arms dealer to launder funds held in American accounts through UBS Geneva . One of Khan 's accounts eventually was frozen when it was determined that the source of the funds came from Khashoggi 's arms sales . 
 India Today reported that Mr Khan allegedly had US $ 8 billion in " black money " ( laundered money ) in a UBS account . The figures were reported to be verified by India Today , based on a letter written by UBS Zurich . The government of India reportedly verified the existence of this account in UBS . 
 UBS denied Indian media reports alleging that it maintained a business relationship with or had any assets or accounts for Hasan Ali Khan . Upon formal request by the Indian and Swiss government authorities , the bank announced that the documentation corroborating such allegations was forged and numerous media reports claiming he had US $ 8 billion in black money at the bank were false .

UBS set aside approximately US $ 2 billion in expected liability for its currency rigging and French tax evasion cases . 
 UBS is facing fines of up to five billion euros for its alleged role in tax fraud , according to the French newspaper Le Temps . 
 In July 2014 , the bank was required to post a bond of 1 @.@ 1 billion euros , which UBS complied with while making multiple appeals in the French court system , finally losing its appeal at the Cour de Cassation , France 's highest court .

 UBS is one of several major banks found guilty in a scheme to manipulate foreign currencies around the world . 
 On 20 May 2015 , US authorities ruled that UBS was to pay $ 545 million in order to end an investigation into the manipulation of currency rates . UBS was the first among other fraudulent banks to report the misconduct and was thus able to escape prosecution by the US Department of Justice . 
 $ 203 million in fines is due to UBS ’ s forex activities breaching a previous deal made with the US over the rigging of the London interbank offered rate ( Libor ) . This agreement was dependent on the bank adhering to US laws and staying out of trouble with the US authorities for two years . The deal was struck in 2012 , and forex investigations started less than a year later , resulting in the non @-@ prosecution status being scrapped . On top of the $ 203 million fine , UBS has had to plead guilty to one count of wire fraud in the previous Libor case as part of the deal with the US Department of Justice to end investigations into its conduct in the current forex scandal .

 On June 2 , 2012 , Feng Jianmei ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) was forced to have an abortion in Zhenping County , Shaanxi , China , when she was seven months pregnant with her second child . Local officials had demanded that Feng and her husband pay a 40 @,@ 000 yuan fine for violating the nation 's one @-@ child policy . When they were unable to do so , authorities arrested Feng , made her sign an agreement to have an abortion , and held her down while injecting her with an <unk> . Feng was reportedly traumatized by the incident and in poor health afterwards . 
 On June 11 , Feng 's family posted graphic pictures of her stillborn child . The images soon became a viral phenomenon , sparking controversy within China and drawing international attention to the issue of forced abortions . In response to national and international attention , the Chinese government launched an investigation . On June 26 , the investigation determined that Feng was not legally entitled to a second child , but that her rights had nonetheless been violated by the local family planning bureau , and as a result , two officials were fired and five others punished . On June 27 , the National Population and Family Planning Commission announced it would send inspection teams across China to review the practices of local family planning divisions . Feng 's husband , Deng Jiyuan ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , hired a lawyer to pursue criminal charges , but ultimately the family decided to settle out of court . 
 The incident led to increased scrutiny of China 's one @-@ child policy , both nationally and internationally . Feng 's case has been cited in editorials critical of the one @-@ child policy , and has also been used as an example of how the Internet is empowering ordinary people in an environment of government censorship . On July 5 , European Parliament passed a resolution condemning both Feng 's case and forced abortion in general . On January 1 , 2016 , after months of discussion , China 's one @-@ child policy was replaced with a two @-@ child policy .

 = = = One @-@ child law = = = 
 Since 1979 , Chinese couples have been limited to one child by law in order to control the country 's population . Families living in rural areas , as well as those with an ethnic minority background , can often receive an exemption from the law and have a second child without penalty . Otherwise , couples who have two or more children are required to pay a fine to the government . According to He Yafu , an independent demographer , such fines are common and " have become a major source of profit for family planning authorities " in recent years . The demographer He adds that the fines allow wealthy families to have extra children while forcing poorer families into involuntary abortions . The fines generate an estimated 20 billion yuan per year in revenue for the government . He Yafu estimates that over 2 trillion yuan ( ~ $ 314 billion USD ) has been collected since 1980 . 
 China 's Population and Family Planning Law prohibits infringement on people 's personal rights and property for family planning purposes . Moreover , a 2001 law prohibited abortions after the sixth month of pregnancy . Nevertheless , human rights groups and critics of the one @-@ child policy say that these laws are inconsistently enforced , and the local officials in many areas still carry out forced sterilizations and / or coerced abortions , sometimes in the third trimester after the fetus has reached viability . In ten Chinese provinces , including Shaanxi , authorities are permitted to take " remedial measures " to ensure that birth quotas are not exceeded . In eight other provinces , authorities are required to terminate unauthorized pregnancies . Activists such as Chen Guangcheng have been jailed by the Chinese government for bringing to light evidence of forced abortions . In 2005 , Chen filed a class @-@ action lawsuit on behalf of women forced into sterilization or abortions and subsequently spent seven years in jail or under house arrest before emigrating to the United States in 2012 .

 In October 2011 , Feng Jianmei , who was a 22 @-@ year @-@ old woman from the small village of <unk> in Zeng Jia Township , Shaanxi province , became pregnant with her second child . She had married in 2006 and given birth to a girl in 2007 . After listening to the advice of relatives , Feng and her husband , Deng Jiyuan , had believed they would be allowed to have a second child since they had waited five years between children and lived in a rural area . According to Zhenping County officials , authorities had contacted Feng in March 2012 and told her that she needed to obtain documentation , including a new household registration ( referred to as hukou ) , in order to file an application to have the child . Her family denies this , saying that officials did not notify them until several days before the abortion was induced . 
 = = Abortion = = 
 Around May 28 , local family planning officials phoned Feng to try to persuade her to have an abortion . The attempt was unsuccessful , so on May 30 they visited the family house while Feng 's husband was away at work . At first , authorities tried to persuade her to voluntarily have an abortion . After several hours , she told the officials she was going out to buy food , and left them in her living room . Instead , she went to an aunt 's house , but around 15 officials followed her . They did not immediately arrest Feng , instead setting up shifts to keep watch over her at the aunt 's house . Early the next morning , Feng escaped , causing the guards to panic . She flagged down a van and persuaded the driver to help her . The driver let her out down the road , and Feng hid in hillside brush for the next 14 hours , waiting for the cover of darkness in the cold and rainy weather . When night came , she went to a relative 's house in the countryside , where she hid under the bed . Authorities from the family planning office found her regardless , and allegedly assaulted her . They let her get a night 's sleep before taking her to the hospital on June 2 . Several witnesses reported that four men carried Feng out of the house with a pillowcase over her head . 
 Simultaneously , family planning officials were in communication with Feng 's husband , Deng Jiyuan . On June 1 , they demanded that Deng either transfer his wife 's residency status on the next day or pay 100 @,@ 000 yuan ( US $ 15 @,@ 700 ) to the birth @-@ planning social security fund . Transferring the residency status in one day was impossible , but Deng negotiated the payment down to 30 @,@ 000 yuan before returning to Zhenping County ( he actually only had 18 @,@ 000 yuan that he had borrowed from work , but hoped an IOU would cover the balance ) . On his way back , Deng received a text message that demanded that he immediately pay the fee , which was now 40 @,@ 000 yuan , and " not a penny less . " Other family members received similar text messages . 
 At the hospital , two men forced Feng to apply her thumbprint to a consent form and sign a document authorizing the abortion . She was taken into an operating room and restrained by two men as she was injected with a poison to kill the fetus . Feng later told All Girls Allowed , an American group campaigning against the one @-@ child policy , " I could feel the baby jumping around inside me all the time , but then she went still . " She had been seven months pregnant at the time , so the abortion , voluntary or not , was illegal under Chinese law . No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure . After the child died of hypoxia , Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4 . Feng later told All Girls Allowed : " It was much more painful than my first childbirth . The baby was lifeless , and she was all purple and blue . " The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived . 
 Feng was traumatized by the procedure and smashed the door and cabinetry of a nurse 's office in a fit of rage . A week later , Deng told The South China Morning Post , " My wife is not well . She is sad and distressed . Sometimes she becomes emotional and confused . " Feng reportedly had a severe headache for several weeks after the abortion and attempted suicide multiple times . On June 15 , an uncle told reporters Feng was in poor health and unable to eat . On June 26 , Feng was still in the hospital and suffering from headaches . She told reporters that she wanted to go home , but that hospital staff would not allow her to leave . On June 29 , her family reported that Feng would be released the next day . However , her condition worsened , and she did not return home until July 10 . 
 Deng filed an official complaint with Ankang 's petition office . A deputy mayor allegedly told Deng that they would investigate , but when nothing appeared to be happening , Deng posted his family 's story <unk> later telling CNN that " I 'm angry and want justice . " Meanwhile , the township officials had prepared a statement that said Feng was of sound mind and body when she signed the consent form authorizing the abortion .

 Feng 's sister @-@ in @-@ law and Deng Jiyuan 's sister , Deng Jicai ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , came back from Hubei the day after the abortion and brought a video camera with her to film Feng . A family planning official , who discovered the tape , then demanded that it be erased . However , Jicai was able to capture several pictures with her cell phone . On June 11 , a picture of Feng lying in a hospital bed " staring at the ceiling with dull eyes " next to the bloody corpse was posted on Chinese social media website Sina Weibo , along with an image of a threatening text message sent by authorities . The images prompted outrage , and news of the event spread quickly . Angry comments from around China poured in , with people calling the authorities ' actions " an atrocity " , " the same as murder . " Many comments called for an end to the one @-@ child policy , or tied the case to other controversial topics such as the corruption of local officials or the country 's rural @-@ urban divide . Many posts were quickly deleted by government censors . Nonetheless , by June 13 , more than 40 @,@ 000 comments about the photos were present on Sina Weibo , and by June 15 , images of Feng were among the most forwarded . " Seven @-@ months pregnant forced abortion " was the website 's top search term , and more than one million user comments were logged on the topic . Discussion also spread to other social media outlets , including <unk> , where threads critical of the government were quickly locked to prevent further discussion . 
 Zhang Kai ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , a lawyer known for his representation of the disadvantaged , posted the story on his blog . Li <unk> , a Chinese blogger with more than five million followers , learned of the story and wrote " the purpose of family planning was to control population , but now it has become murder population ... If this evil policy is not stopped , this country will have no humanity . " Zhao Chu , a writer decried the one @-@ child policy as a " profit @-@ oriented activity that everyone hates , " writing " this is not about enforcing the policy , it is about depriving someone ’ s right to live . " Liang <unk> , chief executive of <unk> , called Feng 's case " outrageous and violent " and " not unique to Shaanxi , " saying that " abolition of the absurd family @-@ planning policy is the only way to root out this kind of evil . " 
 Local newspaper Hua Shang Bao ran a story on <unk> June 12 , human rights activist Huang Qi also posted the story and images . The story was then picked up by major media outlets throughout China . On June 14 , state @-@ backed newspaper Global Times reported that " online posts about Feng 's forced abortion had triggered a torrent of criticism directed at the Zhenping government and sparked debate about the national family planning policy .

 After the story of Feng Jianmei 's abortion gained widespread domestic and international exposure , Zhenping County officials denied the allegations , saying that the abortion was legal and that Feng had requested it . " Feng agreed to go through an operation to end the pregnancy on June 2 following repeated mediation by the township officials , " read the county 's website . They further stated that she did not have a local hukou registration and that the couple was not entitled to a second child . The statement was later removed , with a search for Feng 's name causing an " error " message . A few days later , local family planning official Yuan Fang stated the request for 40 @,@ 000 yuan was " a deposit " that would have been returned after Feng filed the necessary paperwork . 
 A hospital employee acknowledged that Feng was staying there and that the hospital " implements " family planning policy and " provides services " to that effect , but denied that forced abortion was a part of what they do . He said he didn 't know the details of Feng 's case but stated that " she is probably just exaggerating things on the Internet . " It was soon revealed that the Zeng Jia Township had failed to reach its enforcement quotas under the one @-@ child policy for the past two years , so it had received a " yellow card " warning . Desiring to remove the warning , town officials decided to crack down on enforcement in June 2012 . 
 Approximately ten days after the forced abortion occurred , the Shaanxi Provincial Population and Family Planning Commission launched an investigation . On June 13 , Yu <unk> , the deputy head of Ankang , visited the Deng household . Two days later , the commission concluded that Feng had indeed been forced into an illegal abortion , writing , " Such practice has seriously violated the relevant policies ... harmed the image of our family planning work , and caused extremely poor effects in society . " Three officials , including the head of the local family @-@ planning department , were suspended from their jobs on June 14 . An employee of the Ankang Family Planning Bureau said that " grass @-@ roots comrades aren 't stupid , but this is what they 're forced to do ... This is a problem with the entire system . " 
 The Ankang city government promised to " pursue strict legal and disciplinary action " once the investigation was finished . On June 14 , the city issued a formal apology . " Since the illegal actions by some officials have seriously hurt Feng Jianmei and her family , we want to offer our deep apologies to them and to the generic public , " read the statement . The same day , deputy mayor Du <unk> visited Feng in the hospital to express the city 's " sincere apologies . " " I hope we can earn your forgiveness , " he said in a statement published on the city 's webpage . The Chinese government also said it had released a pamphlet emphasizing that late term abortion is prohibited and that the legal rights of pregnant women should be maintained . 
 On June 26 , the results of the investigation were announced . The investigation concluded that Feng was not entitled to have a second child due to her non @-@ agricultural hukou , and that she had been told to fix her registration in March . However , Feng 's rights were violated by county officials and there was no legal basis for the demanded 40 @,@ 000 yuan fee . " The incident showed that some officials at the grassroots level have a weak sense of the law and show little concern for the well @-@ being of the people , " the report said . The head of the family planning bureau of Zhenping , Jiang <unk> , and one other official were fired . Five other government and hospital employees received some form of punishment . Additionally , the county government was ordered to provide Feng with a living stipend .

 Of the government 's actions , Deng Jicai said , " Of course we 're not satisfied with the result . " She added , " all they 've done is punish a few leaders , but they haven 't done anything to the people directly responsible for dragging my sister @-@ in @-@ law [ Feng ] in to have an abortion . They haven 't pursued a single person for criminal liability . " Jicai also noted that no mention was made of the people who later harassed the family , nor was there any mention of an incident where her brother was attacked and beaten . 
 Zhang Kai , a lawyer from Beijing , told Deng Jiyuan he would look into filing a lawsuit against the township government . " To force a woman who is seven months pregnant to have an abortion is a serious violation of the law , " he said . " At the very least it should be considered willful and malicious injury . " Zhang said he hoped the case would cause people to rethink China 's population control policies . On June 29 , he announced that he was officially representing the family and would seek the help of other lawyers to get the case heard in criminal court . However , he acknowledged that doing so would be difficult . " China 's family planning departments are above the law , " he explained . " Even when they do something illegal it is rare for them to be held responsible . " In response to the lawsuit threats , local officials cancelled a planned meeting to discuss the living stipend , saying they would wait for Jiyuan 's return to Zeng Jia Township . 
 Judge Xie Xue told reporters that forced abortion would not be classified as homicide or kidnapping , but could qualify as an intentional injury crime . In cases where complications arose after the abortion , such as Feng 's , the injury could be considered a serious offense bearing a possible penalty of three to ten years in prison . However , The Wall Street Journal said a legal remedy was unlikely , noting that a 2008 decision by the Supreme People 's Court indicated that litigation could not be based on specific provisions of the constitution . Furthermore , family planning law does not have any provision for damages awarded to victims of abuse by government officials . 
 On July 2 , Zhang submitted an official request for the Ankang police to file a case and investigate the officials involved . Subsequently , Deng returned home and decided to negotiate with local authorities . On July 10 , the family agreed to settle out of court for 70 @,@ 600 yuan ( ~ $ 11 @,@ 200 USD ) . Additionally , the township agreed to pay Feng 's medical bills if she contracted a disease from the abortion . " I 've given up legal appeals and agreed to take the compensation offered by the township government , " Deng remarked . " We just want our normal life back . " He added , " It has never been about the money . As ordinary people , we can no longer take the pressure from all sides of the society " . Zhang said the family gave up on pursuing criminal charges because local law enforcement was uncooperative , explaining that " if the prosecutors don 't fulfill their responsibilities [ to press charges ] , it 's impossible to do . " An official told Xinhua , China 's official state news agency , that the government was committed to providing for the family 's financial needs if they should encounter future financial difficulties and that the government would also provide medical care for the <unk> ' ailing mother . 
 Zhang said the compensation could not make up for a lifetime of " spiritual pain " and remarked that 70 @,@ 000 yuan could not compensate for a lost life . " In terms of compensation , the word satisfaction doesn ’ t even enter the equation , " Jiyuan remarked . " But this is the result , so we just have to accept it . " Reactions on Chinese social media were mixed , and some commented that the government had gotten too lenient a consequence . International activists said the settlement of Feng 's case was just the beginning of the fight to end the one @-@ child policy , with Bob Fu of <unk> remarking , " The bottom line is there are hundreds and thousands of [ cases like ] Feng Jianmei . " As of July 13 , the family had not received the promised compensation and Jiyuan told reporters he was not sure if it would ever come . 
 = = = Harassment and surveillance of family members = = = 
 In the weeks after Feng Jianmei 's story went public , the family suffered from what Zhang called " state @-@ backed harassment . " The harassment started when Deng Jiyuan attempted to go to Beijing to talk with a lawyer and do a television interview . Jiyuan 's travel attempt was stopped by " more than 100 people and a dozen cars , " according to Deng Jicai . Then , " a man suddenly appeared and kicked my brother in the stomach . " After Jiyuan was interviewed by Stern magazine on June 22 , the harassment from the government became worse , with Jiyuan stating that he was subsequently followed by " local officials and thugs " everywhere he went , even the bathroom . He then disappeared from public sight on June 24 , only phoning home on June 26 to say he was safe , but his whereabouts remained unknown . 
 On June 29 , Jiyuan reappeared in Beijing , telling reporters , " I came to Beijing in search of help . " He said that he had made two unsuccessful attempts to flee from custody before succeeding on his third try . While his official monitors were on the phone , Jiyuan fled to a friend 's home , where he remained for two days . He removed the sim card and battery from his cell phone to prevent being tracked . " I did not sleep or get any new clothes , I could not risk being arrested , " he recalled . They rented a car and drove to Beijing , and Jiyuan recalled that " I assumed there would be government people at the train station . " Whenever they neared police officers , he would get out of the car and walk to prevent being spotted . 
 Other family members were also reportedly followed and harassed by government officials . Protestors converged outside the hospital where Feng was staying , carrying a banner that read " severely beat the traitors and expel them . " Local media reported that the local government had organized the protest . About a dozen guards patrolled outside Feng 's hospital room for two weeks , following family members wherever they went . " We feel like prisoners , " remarked Deng Jicai . Supporters of the family allege that local officials were also engaged in an online smear campaign against the family . " The whole family feels very depressed and pressured , " said Jicai . On June 26 , a visiting family member had their tires slashed . A spokesperson for the Shaanxi provincial government called the allegations of harassment unfounded rumors . However , Liang <unk> , an independent researcher , said it was common for people who seek outside help to be harassed by local governments . He speculated that the township government was trying to prevent further media coverage of the case . On July 13 , Jiyuan said that he remained concerned over his family 's future safety , noting : " There are rumors on the street that after this thing calms down , when people are not paying attention to us anymore , they [ the officials who were punished for approving the abortion ] will kill my family . " 
 Later , when asked if she still wanted to have another child , Feng told The New York Times , " That depends on how my body recovers . Yes , if I can get my health back . "

 On June 27 , the National Population and Family Planning Commission announced it would conduct a review of family planning enforcement country @-@ wide . As part of the review , ten inspection teams would be sent to nineteen different provinces to review the practices of local offices , and that the teams would be charged with settling disputes and would distribute contraceptives . Commission director Wang Xia said the inspection was of great importance , remarking that " even slight carelessness in law enforcement [ damages ] the image of the Party and the country . " Xia said the review would aim to " strengthen the day @-@ to @-@ day management of services , avoid the use of violence and prevent abuses of administrative enforcement " ; he placed a special emphasis on the " social maintenance fees " collected from policy violators . Simultaneously , the commission declared that fines collected for future violations could no longer be spent at the local level , but instead would go into a general fund . He Yafu described the campaign as an attempt by the commission to restore public trust that had been badly damaged by Feng 's forced abortion . 
 On July 3 , 2012 , an open letter by three members of the Development Research Center of the State Council , a think tank that advises the Chinese ruling cabinet , was published in the group 's newspaper , China Economic Times . In the letter they called for " adjustments " to be made to the one @-@ child policy " as soon as possible " . The group advised that " an opening up of the two @-@ child option to all should be considered . " <unk> Liang <unk> said the letter was likely the start of a gradual shift in policy , but that a sudden shift was very unlikely . Although there was no explicit mention of Feng Jianmei in the letter , multiple news sources drew a connection between the timing of the two events . Writing for The New Yorker , Evan Osnos said that " pressure for change of China ’ s one @-@ child policy seems to be mounting " in the wake of Feng 's case . On July 5 , a group of fifteen scholars released an own open letter to the National People 's Congress arguing that change to family planning law was " imperative " . The letter mentioned research indicating economic consequences of continuing the one @-@ child policy , but focused on human rights issues , mentioning Feng by name . " Behind these incidents are clear limitations and defects in the nation 's family planning laws , " read the letter . Liang <unk> , one of the letter 's signers , told a reporter " From an economic perspective , the one @-@ child policy is irrational . From a human @-@ rights perspective , it 's even less rational . "

 Feng Jianmei 's ordeal brought increased scrutiny to China 's abortion and population @-@ control policies . International commentators were highly critical of the government 's role in Feng 's abortion . " Feng Jianmei 's story demonstrates how the One @-@ Child Policy continues to sanction violence against women every day , " said Chai Ling of the NGO All Girls Allowed . Women 's Rights Without Frontiers ' president Reggie Littlejohn stated " no legitimate government would commit or tolerate such an act . Those who are responsible should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity . " In a press release , the Christian Alliance Defense Fund called Feng 's case " nothing less than a crime against humanity " and asked American political leaders to formally condemn the act . The World Evangelical Alliance said it was " outraged " by the incident and asked the Chinese government to " ensure that these tragic incidents are prevented from happening in the future . " 
 On July 5 , European Parliament passed a resolution condemning both the treatment of Feng and forced abortions in general , " especially in the context of the one @-@ child policy . " The resolution also requested that forced abortion be added the agenda for the next bilateral human rights dialogue with China . Additionally , some Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) requested an independent investigation into forced abortion and infanticide in China . A few days later , MEP Lojze Peterle opined that Chinese family planning law violates provisions outlined by the United Nations in the International Conference on Population and Development . He said the resolution passed by parliament gives the European Commission a " clear mandate " to withdraw funds from any organization potentially involved in aiding coercive practices in China , citing the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International as two potential targets . 
 On July 9 , the Human Rights Subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives convened a hearing on the one @-@ child policy prompted by Feng 's story . In his opening remarks , chairman Chris Smith called the one @-@ child policy " a nightmarish ' brave new world ' ... where women are psychologically wounded , girls fall victim to sex @-@ selective abortion ... and most children grow up without brothers or sisters , aunts or uncles or cousins . " He said that because of Feng , people were " finally seeing the gruesome reality of China ’ s one @-@ child policy . " Congressman Joseph R. Pitts agreed , saying " It now seems that consensus in China is building towards reforming the policy . " Committee witnesses called for a number of responses such as restricting United Nations Population Fund outlays and encouraging U.S. corporations doing business in China to reject the country 's family @-@ planning practices at their facilities . 
 = = = International media coverage = = = 
 Feng 's case became a focal point for newspaper editorials against China 's one @-@ child policy and abortion in general . Opponents of the one @-@ child policy said the case is a potential turning point in the efforts to end the rule . On June 26 , Reuters said the story had sparked " a firestorm domestically and around the world , " explaining that " Feng Jianmei 's abortion was portrayed in the Chinese and international press as an example of the extreme measures some officials would take to control China 's population , even if it meant breaking Chinese law . " A story in The Wall Street Journal remarked that the case " dramatize [ s ] the harshness of the one @-@ child policy . " The incident prompted Evan Osnos , the New Yorker writer , to create a feature piece titled " Abortion and Politics in China . " Osnos said that " the Feng case is emblematic of some of the most inflammatory issues on Chinese public life , " including money , government corruption , the household registration system , and of course family planning , and that " the case is a dramatic demonstration of exactly why the Communist Party had reason to be afraid of the Internet . " 
 On June 23 , The Economist featured a story on China ’ s one @-@ child policy , focusing on Feng 's forced abortion and how the internet was changing power dynamics in China . " Three years ago , Ms. Feng ’ s suffering might have gone unnoticed ... But her relatives uploaded the graphic pictures onto the internet , and soon microblogs had flashed them to millions of people across the country , " writes the article 's author . Wang <unk> , a researcher for Chinese Human Rights Defenders , said it was certain that the internet had made discussion of Feng 's case possible , but she called the officials ' punishments " isolated " and said " government officials are virtually immune in using violence and carrying out the policy by force . We 've not seen any significant [ change ] in holding officials accountable . " 
 A June 22 editorial in The Australian argued against the one @-@ child policy , stating that Feng 's case " one small example of the terrible costs of China 's longstanding population control regime . " A June 25 editorial in the Herald Sun , which examined family planning in general , said that Feng " personifies the end game of forced population limits . " 
 Several commentators have compared Feng Jianmei to Liu Yang , who was in the news at roughly the same time for becoming the first Chinese female in space . On June 17 , the Tea Leaf Nation blog published a story entitled " <unk> Reflect As One Chinese Woman Touches Heaven , Another Hell . " The story , focused on a widely distributed Sina Weibo post , features pictures of Feng and Liu side by side , and the blogger wrote in the caption " The stark contrast between the fates of [ the ] two women ... is the clearest illustration of the torn state of this nation . " The post was quickly re @-@ tweeted by famous blogger Han Han . By the time the government deleted both posts , the information had already been shared 70 @,@ 000 times in the first 24 hours . The International Herald Tribune immediately picked up the story , stating , " The gruesome abortion incident was cast this weekend against China ’ s successful launching of its first female astronaut . The sad irony of the two women ’ s situations was not lost on Chinese netizens . " Two days later , the Global Post published the story and commented , " leave it to Sina Weibo to point out what 's important , " explaining that the juxtaposition of the two new stories " [ highlights ] China 's current troubled and contradictory state ... Some Chinese women get launched into space , others receive injections that kill their unborn child . " 
 Journalist Andrew Bolt used Feng 's case to <unk> against abortion in Australia , writing , " Deng Jiyuan has shamed the tyrants of Beijing . But ... he shames us here as well . " He compared Feng 's abortion to famous cases in Australia and concluded that the main difference was the graphic pictures of Feng 's baby . 
 Asia Times Online featured Feng 's story in an editorial titled " China 's addiction to birth planning " . Author Peter Lee remarked that it was " disturbing " how many resources the township devoted to persuading Feng , quoting an official as saying " On that day , pretty much all of the township leadership and relevant staff all went [ to get Feng to the hospital ] . " He concluded that the way the case was handled provides strong evidence that at least some of China 's leaders are anxious to end the one @-@ child policy . In contrast , an editorial published in The Peninsula argued that the case showed China 's leaders were losing their ability to control local authorities . 
 He Yafu says the controversy has damaged the public image of one @-@ child policy in China . Journalist Fareed Zakaria suggested there were signs that the Chinese government was softening its rules , noting the large number of prominent citizens who spoke out against Feng 's abortion . Zakaria wrote , " Even a few years ago , it would have taken a very brave Chinese thinker to pose that question in public . " However , he said that formal change would be impossible before a change in leadership occurred , and even then would " take much courage " . 
 A July 17 piece in The Huffington Post said that the case " captured the public imagination in China because it exemplifies broader systemic issues . " Feng 's case had been cited by both pro @-@ life and pro @-@ choice advocates in the United States in support of their causes ; for pro @-@ life advocates , the case represented " the kind of ' federally endorsed ' abortions that they fear may lie in store for the United States , " while for pro @-@ choice advocates , " [ Feng ] should have been granted a choice in the first place .

 = Neither Here nor There ( Fringe ) = 
 " Neither Here nor There " is the fourth season premiere of the Fox science fiction drama television series Fringe . The episode depicts the aftermath of the third season finale in which Peter Bishop disappears from his timeline . In the new , altered timeline , Olivia Dunham is joined by FBI agent Lincoln Lee after the latter 's partner is murdered . The two work to investigate his death , which revolves around shape @-@ shifting technology . 
 The episode was co @-@ written by J.H. Wyman , Jeff Pinkner , and Akiva Goldsman . Joe Chappelle directed the installment . Wyman and Pinkner approached it as a new pilot and used the character of Lee to help introduce viewers to the series . As a result of Lee 's inclusion , " Neither Here nor There " is the first episode to introduce his portrayer Seth Gabel , formerly a recurring actor , as a main cast member . Joe Flanigan guest @-@ starred as his partner , Robert Danzig . The episode is also the first to briefly feature recurring actress Michelle Krusiec as Nadine Park . 
 " Neither Here nor There " was originally broadcast on September 23 , 2011 on the Fox network to an estimated 3 @.@ 5 million viewers . It scored a 1 @.@ 5 / 5 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49 . Critical reception towards the episode was mixed , with several praising its special effects and Anna Torv 's acting but criticizing elements of its story . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the end of " The Day We Died " , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) uses the Machine to create a " bridge " between the prime and parallel universe allowing the two sides to work together to resolve the instabilities in both universes ; but in doing so , Peter vanishes . Because of this , Observer September ( Michael Cerveris ) says Peter never existed . Despite this , the Observers are aware of changes in the original timeline , with echoes of Peter appearing . December ( Eugene Lipinski ) charges September with assuring that the last memories of Peter are wiped out . Both universes have created a secure airlock @-@ like system around the shared room housing the Machine within the bridge . At the start of the episode , the two Olivias ( Anna Torv ) , still somewhat distrusting of the other , help to share relevant Fringe files between the two universes . 
 FBI agent Lincoln Lee ( Seth Gabel ) and his partner of five years , Robert Danzig ( Joe Flanigan ) , are pursuing an arms dealer ; while Lee apprehends the man , his partner is killed by a second , mysterious man with translucent skin and seemingly superhuman abilities . The skin of Danzig 's body also becomes translucent after he dies . When forensics comes on the scene , Olivia and Astrid ( Jasika Nicole ) appear and take the agent 's body without revealing their intentions . Lincoln follows Olivia to the lab , where he is introduced to the Fringe division . Despite Olivia attempting to keep Lincoln away , he continues to follow the investigation as they discover another victim killed in a similar manner . From a witness , they learn about the appearance of the killer , but are unable to identify him by name . 
 Olivia agrees to bring Lincoln onto the case , and shows him that there have been roughly thirty victims in the last several days , who have had no obvious connection or signs of death , other than that their hearts stopped . Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn 's disease and was taking iron supplements , which leads Walter ( John Noble ) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning , and that their killer extracted substances from their blood . Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail , Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station . She and her team are then informed of the suspect 's location , and after a chase , in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg , Olivia is able to kill the suspect , who also had translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself . Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition . As the FBI cleans up the area , a woman ( Michelle Krusiec ) , also with translucent skin , watches from afar . 
 In examining the bodies , Walter discovers a bio @-@ mechanical module similar to those they had previously seen in the shapeshifters that Walternate used . Olivia and Lincoln take the module to the Machine room . As Lincoln is stunned by the technology , Olivia gives the module to Fauxlivia , who promises to take it to Walternate to investigate . 
 During the episode , Walter is shown to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia arranged his release from a mental asylum . He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man , Peter , in the lab ; Olivia attributes this to Walter lacking any foothold in reality . That evening , Walter is preparing for bed while September , outside , readies a device he has assembled to wipe out the remains of Peter 's existence . But at the last moment September disarms the device and walks away . Later Walter sees yet another image of Peter on his television and is terrified .

 The episode was co @-@ written by co @-@ showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner , and consulting producer Akiva Goldsman . Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed . Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode " like a new pilot " to draw in viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start . They used Lincoln Lee as a tool to acquaint viewers with the new changes . Former guest actor Seth Gabel , who played Lee , joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season . He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective . He explained , " You need a layman 's perspective from time to time . The show has gotten so deep into this crazy , surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common experience . You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you ’ ve gone , so you don 't become desensitized to it . I think Lincoln serves that for a while . " 
 The showrunners had the episode center around the idea that " Peter no longer exists " , and intended it to " set up the season arc from numerous characters ' perspectives " to show viewers what to expect from the season . When discussing the season 's arc , Fox and Warner Brothers wished to have Peter return as soon as possible , as they knew he was popular with fans . Pinkner and Wyman responded that to " really establish his absence [ it ] will take a little while " , but knew that a longer wait would lead to audience frustration . 
 The fourth season premiere was initially called " A Sort of Homecoming " , also the name of a song by rock band U2 . The episode 's opening credits featured a new amber @-@ tinted sequence , which listed new fringe science terms like " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " Existence " . Pinkner said the new color of the credits " clearly [ indicates ] a universe without Peter in it . " " Neither Here nor There " marked the first appearance of recurring guest actress Michelle Krusiec . Her casting was confirmed in July 2011 . The episode also featured a one @-@ time guest appearance by actor Joe Flanigan , who played Lee 's partner Robert Danzig . Flanigan shot his scenes in July 2011 .

 Writing for The Onion 's A.V. Club , Noel Murray gave the episode a " B " , remarking that he " enjoyed the episode overall — largely because it 's just such a treat to have be [ sic ] back in this world with these people — I 'm not sure it was wholly successful in its attempt to play by the old rules . " He added that after the opening exchange between Olivia and Fauxlivia , the episode " settles into a fairly typical " Fringe formula involving a " villain of the week " and a freakish event . Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times praised Anna Torv 's two performances and believed " the containment built around ' the Machine ' " may " have been my favorite part of the episode . " 
 Den of Geek selected the episode 's special effects as a positive element , but was more critical of the episode as a whole . " As Fringe goes , " the website explained , " this ended up a rather lightweight narrative , which was more about getting Lincoln established with Fringe , and providing a few new plotlines that the subsequent stories can expand on . " IGN 's Ramsey Isler was equally ambivalent , and gave the episode a score of 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 . He observed , " It isn 't a bad episode . It 's a good addition to the Fringe lore . It 's well @-@ written , has plenty of action , and the actors are great as usual . But it just doesn 't feel like a fulfilling continuation of last season 's cliffhanger , nor does it strike me as a fantastic new direction for the season . " 
 Richard Edwards of SFX gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars , writing that it " chooses to mostly ignore exploring the implications [ of Peter 's disappearance ] on the overall story arc in favour of a fairly run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill ( by Fringe standards , at least ) case of the week . Even the potentially scintillating scenes between the alternate incarnations of the characters fail to materialise , aside from a couple of stilted encounters between the two Olivias . " Edwards did however praise the premiere for its special effects , and for doing an effective job presenting the characteristics of a world without Peter , especially highlighting Lincoln 's newcomer role as a lens for the audience . 
 = Bix Beiderbecke = 
 Leon Bismark " Bix " Beiderbecke ( March 10 , 1903 – August 6 , 1931 ) was an American jazz cornetist , jazz pianist , and composer . 
 With Louis Armstrong and Muggsy Spanier , Beiderbecke was one of the most influential jazz soloists of the 1920s . His turns on " Singin ' the Blues " and " I 'm Coming , Virginia " ( both 1927 ) , in particular , demonstrated an unusual purity of tone and a gift for improvisation . With these two recordings , especially , he helped to invent the jazz ballad style and hinted at what , in the 1950s , would become cool jazz . " In a Mist " ( 1927 ) , one of a handful of his piano compositions and one of only two he recorded , mixed classical ( Impressionist ) influences with jazz syncopation . 
 A native of Davenport , Iowa , Beiderbecke taught himself to play cornet largely by ear , leading him to adopt a non @-@ standard fingering some critics have connected to his original sound . He first recorded with Midwestern jazz ensembles , The Wolverines and The Bucktown Five in 1924 , after which he played briefly for the Detroit @-@ based Jean Goldkette Orchestra before joining Frankie " Tram " Trumbauer for an extended gig at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis . Beiderbecke and Trumbauer joined Goldkette in 1926 . The band toured widely and famously played a set opposite Fletcher Henderson at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City in October 1926 . He made his greatest recordings in 1927 ( see above ) . In 1928 , Trumbauer and Beiderbecke left Detroit to join the best @-@ known and most prestigious dance orchestra in the country : the New @-@ York @-@ based Paul Whiteman Orchestra . 
 Beiderbecke 's most influential recordings date from his time with Goldkette and Whiteman , although they were generally recorded under his own name or Trumbauer 's . The Whiteman period also marked a precipitous decline in Beiderbecke 's health , brought on by the demand of the bandleader 's relentless touring and recording schedule in combination with Beiderbecke 's persistent alcoholism . A few stints in rehabilitation centers , as well as the support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family in Davenport , did not check Beiderbecke 's decline in health . He left the Whiteman band in 1930 and the following summer died in his Queens apartment at the age of 28 . 
 His death , in turn , gave rise to one of the original legends of jazz . In magazine articles , musicians ' memoirs , novels , and Hollywood films , Beiderbecke has been reincarnated as a Romantic hero , the " Young Man with a Horn " . His life has been portrayed as a battle against such common obstacles to art as family and commerce , while his death has been seen as a martyrdom for the sake of art . The musician @-@ critic Benny Green sarcastically called Beiderbecke " jazz 's Number One Saint , " while Ralph Berton compared him to Jesus . Beiderbecke remains the subject of scholarly controversy regarding his true name , the cause of his death , and the importance of his contributions to jazz . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Beiderbecke was born on March 10 , 1903 , in Davenport , Iowa , the son of Bismark Herman and Agatha Jane ( Hilton ) Beiderbecke . There is disagreement over whether Beiderbecke was christened Leon Bismark ( and nicknamed " Bix " ) or Leon Bix . His father was nicknamed " Bix " , as , for a time , was his older brother , Charles Burnette " Burnie " Beiderbecke . Burnie Beiderbecke claimed that the boy was named Leon Bix and subsequent biographers have reproduced birth certificates to that effect . However , more recent research — which takes into account church and school records in addition to the will of a relative — has suggested that he was originally named Leon Bismark . Regardless , his parents called him Bix , which seems to have been his preference . In a letter to his mother when he was nine years old , Beiderbecke signed off , " <unk> your Leon Bix Beiderbecke not Bismark <unk> [ sic ] " . 
 Beiderbecke 's father , the son of German immigrants , was a well @-@ to @-@ do coal and lumber merchant , named after the Iron Chancellor of his native Germany . Beiderbecke 's mother was the daughter of a Mississippi riverboat captain . She played the organ at Davenport 's First Presbyterian Church , and encouraged young Bix 's interest in the piano . Beiderbecke was the youngest of three children . His brother , Burnie , was born in 1895 , and his sister , Mary Louise , in 1898 . He began playing piano at age two or three . His sister recalls that he stood on the floor and played it with his hands over his head . Five years later , he was the subject of an admiring article in the Davenport Daily Democrat that proclaimed : " Seven @-@ year @-@ old boy musical wonder ! Little <unk> Beiderbecke plays any selection he hears . " 
 At age ten , his older brother Burnie recalled that he stopped coming home for supper , instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard one or another of the excursion boats to play the Calliope . A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn 't interest him much , but as soon as the lights came on he would rush home to see if he could duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action . 
 When his brother Burnie returned to Davenport at the end of 1918 after serving stateside during World War I , he brought with him a Victrola phonograph and several records , including " Tiger Rag " and " Skeleton Jangle " by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band . From these records , Bix first learned to love hot jazz ; he taught himself to play cornet by listening to Nick LaRocca 's horn lines . Beiderbecke also listened to jazz music off the riverboats that docked in downtown Davenport . Louis Armstrong and the drummer Baby Dodds claimed to have met Beiderbecke when their New @-@ Orleans @-@ based excursion boat stopped in Davenport . Historians disagree over whether that is true . 
 Beiderbecke attended Davenport High School from 1919 to 1921 . During this time , he sat in and played professionally with various bands , including those of Wilbur Hatch , Floyd Bean and Carlisle Evans . In the spring of 1920 he performed for the school 's Vaudeville Night , singing in a vocal quintet called the Black Jazz Babies and playing his horn . He also performed , at the invitation of his friend Fritz <unk> , in Neal Buckley 's Novelty Orchestra . The group was hired for a gig in December 1920 , but a complaint was lodged with the American Federation of Musicians , Local 67 , that the boys did not have union cards . In an audition before a union executive , Beiderbecke was forced to sight read and failed . He did not earn his card . 
 On April 22 , 1921 , a month after he turned 18 , Beiderbecke was arrested by two Davenport police officers on a charge brought by the father of a young girl . According to biographer Jean Pierre Lion , " Bix was accused of having taken this man 's five @-@ year @-@ old daughter into a garage and committing on her an act qualified by the police report as ' lewd and lascivious . ' " Although Beiderbecke was briefly taken into custody and held on a $ 1 @,@ 500 bond , the charge was dropped after the girl was not made available to testify . According to an affidavit submitted by her father , this was because " of the child 's age and the harm that would result to her in going over this case . " It is not clear from the father 's affidavit if the girl had identified Beiderbecke . Until recently , biographers have largely ignored this incident in Beiderbecke 's life , and Lion was the first , in 2005 , to print the police blotter and affidavit associated with the arrest . He dismissed the seriousness of the charge , but speculated that the arrest nevertheless might have led Beiderbecke to " feel abandoned and ashamed : he saw himself as suspect of perversion . " 
 Beiderbecke 's parents enrolled him in the exclusive Lake Forest Academy , north of Chicago in Lake Forest , Illinois . While historians have traditionally suggested that his parents sent him to Lake Forest to discourage his interest in jazz , others have begun to doubt this version of events , believing that he may have been sent away in response to his arrest . Regardless , Mr. and Mrs. Beiderbecke apparently felt that a boarding school would provide their son with both the necessary faculty attention and discipline to improve his academic performance . His interests , however , remained limited to music and sports . In pursuit of the former , Beiderbecke took the train into Chicago to catch the hot jazz bands at clubs and speakeasies , including the infamous Friar 's Inn , where he listened to and sometimes sat in with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings . He also traveled to the predominantly African @-@ American South Side to listen to what he called " real " jazz musicians . " Don 't think I 'm getting hard , Burnie , " he wrote to his brother , " but I 'd go to hell to hear a good band . " On campus , he helped organize the Cy @-@ Bix Orchestra with drummer Walter " Cy " <unk> and almost immediately got into trouble with the Lake Forest headmaster for performing <unk> at a school dance . 
 Beiderbecke often failed to return to his dormitory before curfew , and sometimes stayed off @-@ campus the next day . In the early morning hours of May 20 , he was caught on the fire escape to his dormitory , attempting to climb back into his room . The faculty voted to expel him the next day , due both to his academic failings and his extracurricular activities , which included drinking . The headmaster informed Beiderbecke 's parents by letter that following his expulsion school officials confirmed that Beiderbecke " was drinking himself and was responsible , in part at least , in having liquor brought into the School . " Soon after , Beiderbecke began pursuing a career in music . 
 He returned to Davenport briefly in the summer of 1922 , then moved to Chicago to join the Cascades Band , working that summer on Lake Michigan excursion boats . He gigged around Chicago until the fall of 1923 , at times returning to Davenport to work for his father .

 = = = Wolverines = = = 
 Beiderbecke joined the Wolverine Orchestra late in 1923 , and the seven @-@ man group first played a speakeasy called the Stockton Club near Hamilton , Ohio . Specializing in hot jazz and recoiling from so @-@ called sweet music , the band took its name from one of its most frequent numbers , Jelly Roll Morton 's " Wolverine Blues . " During this time , Beiderbecke also took piano lessons from a young woman who introduced him to the works of Eastwood Lane . Lane 's piano suites and orchestral arrangements were both self @-@ consciously American and influenced by the French Impressionists , and it is said to have greatly influenced Beiderbecke 's style , especially on " In a Mist . " A subsequent gig at Doyle 's Dance Academy in Cincinnati became the occasion for a series of band and individual photographs that resulted in the most famous image of Beiderbecke — sitting fresh @-@ faced , his hair perfectly combed , his horn resting on his right knee . 
 On February 18 , 1924 , the Wolverines first recorded at Gennett Records in Richmond , Indiana . Their two sides that day included " <unk> Feet " , written by Nick LaRocca and Larry Shields from the Original Dixieland Jazz Band , and " Jazz Me Blues . " Beiderbecke 's solo on the latter suggested something new and significant in jazz , according to biographers Richard M. Sudhalter and Philip R. Evans : 
 Both qualities — complementary or " correlated " phrasing and cultivation of the vocal , " singing " middle @-@ range of the cornet — are on display in Bix 's " Jazz Me Blues " solo , along with an already discernible inclination for unusual accidentals and inner chordal voices . It is a pioneer record , introducing a musician of great originality with a pace @-@ setting band . And it astonished even the Wolverines themselves . 
 The Wolverines recorded 15 sides for Gennett Records between February and October 1924 . The titles revealed a tough and well @-@ formed cornet talent . His lip had toughened from earlier , more tentative years ; on nine of the Wolverines ' recorded titles he proceeds <unk> from lead to opening solo without any need for a respite from playing . 
 Beiderbecke made his first recordings 21 months before Armstrong recorded as a leader with the Hot Five . Beiderbecke 's style was very different from that of Louis Armstrong according to The Oxford Companion to Jazz : 
 Where Armstrong 's playing was bravura , regularly optimistic , and openly emotional , Beiderbecke 's conveyed a range of intellectual alternatives . Where Armstrong , at the head of an ensemble , played it hard , straight , and true , Beiderbecke , like a <unk> , invented his own way of phrasing " around the lead . " Where Armstrong 's superior strength delighted in the sheer power of what a cornet could produce , Beiderbecke 's cool approach invited rather than commanded you to listen . 
 Where Armstrong emphasized showmanship and virtuosity , Beiderbecke emphasized melody , even when improvising , and — different from Armstrong and contrary to how the Bix Beiderbecke of legend would be portrayed — he rarely strayed into the upper reaches of the register . Paul Mares of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings insisted that Beiderbecke 's chief influence was the New Orleans cornetist Emmett Hardy , who died in 1925 at the age of 23 . Indeed , Beiderbecke had met Hardy and the clarinetist Leon <unk> in Davenport in 1921 when the two joined a local band and played in town for three months . Beiderbecke apparently spent time with them , but the degree to which Hardy 's style influenced Beiderbecke 's is difficult to know because Hardy never recorded . In some respects , Beiderbecke 's playing was sui generis , but he nevertheless listened to and studied the music around him : from Armstrong and Joe " King " Oliver to the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and the New Orleans Rhythm Kings to Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel . 
 Soon , he was listening to Hoagy Carmichael , too . A law student and aspiring pianist and songwriter , Carmichael invited the Wolverines to Bloomington , Indiana , late in April 1924 . Beiderbecke had met Carmichael a couple of times before and the two became friends . On May 6 , 1924 , the Wolverines recorded a tune Carmichael had written especially for Beiderbecke and his colleagues : " Riverboat Shuffle " . 
 Beiderbecke left the Wolverines in October 1924 for a spot with Jean Goldkette in Detroit , but the job didn 't last long . Goldkette recorded for the Victor Talking Machine Company , whose musical director , Eddie King , objected to Beiderbecke 's hot @-@ jazz style of soloing ; it wasn 't <unk> with the commercial obligations that came with the band 's recording contract . King also was frustrated by the cornetist 's inability to deftly sight read . After a few weeks , Beiderbecke was bounced from the Goldkette band , but soon arranged a recording session back in Richmond with some of its members . On January 26 , 1925 , Bix and His Rhythm Jugglers set two tunes to wax : " Toddlin ' Blues " , another number by LaRocca and Shields , and Beiderbecke 's own composition , " Davenport Blues " . Beiderbecke biographer Lion has complained that the second number was marred by the alcohol consumed by the musicians . In subsequent years , " Davenport Blues " has been recorded by musicians from Bunny <unk> to Ry Cooder to Geoff Muldaur . 
 The following month , Beiderbecke enrolled at the University of Iowa in Iowa City , Iowa . His stint in academia was even briefer than his time in Detroit , however . When he attempted to pack his course schedule with music , his guidance counselor forced him instead to take religion , ethics , physical education , and military training . It was an institutional blunder that Benny Green described as being , in retrospect , " comical , " " fatuous , " and " a parody . " Beiderbecke promptly began to skip classes , and after he participated in a drunken bar fight , he was expelled . That summer he played with his friends Don Murray and Howdy <unk> at a lake resort in Michigan . The band was run by Goldkette , and it put Beiderbecke in touch with another musician he had met before : the C @-@ melody saxophone player Frankie Trumbauer . The two hit it off , both personally and musically , despite Trumbauer having been warned by other musicians : " Look out , he 's trouble . He drinks and you 'll have a hard time handling him . " They were inseparable for much of the rest of Beiderbecke 's career , with Trumbauer acting as a father figure to Beiderbecke . When Trumbauer organized a band for an extended run at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis , Beiderbecke joined him . There he also played alongside the clarinetist Pee Wee Russell , who praised Beiderbecke 's ability to drive the band . " He more or less made you play whether you wanted to or not , " Russell said . " If you had any talent at all he made you play better . " 
 = = = Goldkette = = = 
 In the spring of 1926 , Trumbauer closed up shop in St. Louis and , with Beiderbecke , moved to Detroit , this time to play with Goldkette 's headline ensemble . They played the summer at Hudson Lake , a resort in northern Indiana , and split the next year between touring , recording , and performing at Detroit 's Graystone Ballroom . In October 1926 , Goldkette 's " Famous Fourteen " , as they came to be called , opened at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City opposite the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra , one of the East Coast 's outstanding African American big bands . The Roseland promoted a " Battle of the Bands " in the local press and , on October 12 , after a night of furious playing , Goldkette 's men were declared the winners . " We [ … ] were amazed , angry , morose , and bewildered , " Rex Stewart , Fletcher 's lead trumpeter , said of listening to Beiderbecke and his colleagues play . He called the experience " most humiliating " . 
 Although the band recorded numerous sides for Victor during this period , none of them showcases Beiderbecke 's most famous solos . Much of Goldkette 's money was made through these records , but they were subject — as Eddie King had well understood — to the forces of the commercial market . As a result , their sound was often " sweeter " than what many of the hot jazz musicians would have preferred . In addition to their sessions with Goldkette , Beiderbecke and his friends recorded under their own names for the Okeh label . For instance , on February 4 , 1927 , Frank Trumbauer and His Orchestra recorded " <unk> " , " Clarinet Marmalade " , and " Singin ' the Blues " , all three of which featured some of Beiderbecke 's best work . Again with Trumbauer , Beiderbecke re @-@ recorded Carmichael 's " Riverboat Shuffle " in May and delivered two of his best known solos a few days later on " I 'm Coming , Virginia " and " Way Down Yonder in New Orleans " . Beiderbecke earned co @-@ writing credit with Trumbauer on " For No Reason at All in C " , recorded under the name Tram , Bix and Eddie ( in their Three Piece Band ) . Beiderbecke switched between cornet and piano on that number , and then in September played only piano for his recording of " In A Mist " . This was perhaps the most fruitful year of his short career . 
 Under financial pressure , Goldkette folded his premier band in September in New York . Paul Whiteman hoped to snatch up Goldkette 's best musicians for his traveling orchestra , but Beiderbecke , Trumbauer , Murray , Bill Rank , Eddie Lang , Joe Venuti , Chauncey Morehouse , and Frank Signorelli instead joined the bass saxophone player Adrian <unk> at the Club New Yorker . When that job ended sooner than expected , in October 1927 , Beiderbecke and Trumbauer signed on with Whiteman . They joined his orchestra in Indianapolis on October 27 . 
 = = = Whiteman = = = 
 The Paul Whiteman Orchestra was the most popular and highest paid band of the day . In spite of Whiteman 's nickname , " The King of Jazz " , his was not a jazz ensemble , but a popular music outfit that played bits of jazz and classical music according to the demands of its record @-@ buying and concert @-@ going audience . Whiteman was perhaps best known for having premiered George Gershwin 's Rhapsody in Blue in New York in 1924 , and the orchestrator of that piece , <unk> <unk> , continued to be an important part of the band in 1928 . At three hundred pounds , Whiteman was huge both physically and culturally — " a man flabby , virile , quick , coarse , untidy and sleek , with a hard core of shrewdness in an envelope of sentimentalism , " according to a 1926 New Yorker profile . And many Beiderbecke partisans have turned Whiteman into a villain in the years since . 
 Benny Green , in particular , derided Whiteman for being a mere " mediocre vaudeville act , " and suggesting that " today we only tolerate the horrors of Whiteman 's recordings at all in the hope that here and there a <unk> fragment will redeem the mess . " Richard Sudhalter has responded by suggesting that Beiderbecke saw Whiteman as an opportunity to pursue musical ambitions that did not stop at jazz : 
 Colleagues have testified that , far from feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra , as Green and others have suggested , Bix often felt a sense of exhilaration . It was like attending a music school , learning and broadening : formal music , especially the synthesis of the American vernacular idiom with a more classical orientation , so much sought @-@ after in the 1920s , were calling out to him . 
 The education that Beiderbecke did not receive from the University of Iowa , in other words , he sought through Whiteman . In the meantime , Beiderbecke played on four number @-@ one records in 1928 , all under the Whiteman name : " Together " , " Ramona " , " My Angel " , and " Ol ' Man River " , which featured Bing Crosby on vocals . This accomplishment says less about the jazz excellence of these records than it does about the tastes of the largely white , record @-@ buying public to which Whiteman ( and Goldkette before him ) catered . 
 For Beiderbecke , the downside of being with Whiteman was the relentless touring and recording schedule , exacerbated by Beiderbecke 's alcoholism . On November 30 , 1928 , in Cleveland , Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms " a severe nervous crisis " and Sudhalter and Evans suggest " was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens , " presumably triggered by Beiderbecke 's attempt to curb his alcohol intake . " He cracked up , that 's all , " trombonist Bill Rank said . " Just went to pieces ; broke up a <unk> of furniture in the hotel . " 
 In February 1929 , Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as " the world 's hottest cornetist . " He then spent the summer with Whiteman 's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture , The King of Jazz . Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film , leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily . By September , he was back in Davenport , where his parents helped him to seek treatment . He spent a month , from October 14 until November 18 , at the Keeley Institute in Dwight , Illinois . 
 While he was away , Whiteman famously kept a chair empty in Beiderbecke 's honor . But when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930 , the renowned soloist did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly . On his last recording session , in New York , on September 15 , 1930 , Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael 's new song , " Georgia on My Mind " , with Carmichael doing the vocal , Eddie Lang on guitar , Joe Venuti on violin , Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto saxophone , Jack <unk> on trombone , and Bud Freeman on tenor saxophone . The song would go on to become a jazz and popular music standard . In 2014 , the 1930 recording of " Georgia on My Mind " was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame . 
 Two years earlier , Beiderbecke had influenced another Carmichael standard , " Star Dust " . A Beiderbecke riff caught in Carmichael 's head and became the tune 's chorus . Bing Crosby , who sang with Whiteman , also cited Beiderbecke as an important influence . " Bix and all the rest would play and exchange ideas on the piano , " he said . 
 With all the noise [ of a New York pub ] going on , I don 't know how they heard themselves , but they did . I didn 't contribute anything , but I listened and learned [ … ] I was now being influenced by these musicians , particularly horn men . I could hum and sing all of the jazz choruses from the recordings made by Bix , Phil Napoleon , and the rest . 
 Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , the once @-@ booming music industry contracted and work became more difficult to find . For a while , Beiderbecke 's only income came from a radio show booked by Whiteman , The Camel Pleasure Hour . However , during a live broadcast on October 8 , 1930 , Beiderbecke 's seemingly limitless gift for improvisation finally failed him : " He stood up to take his solo , but his mind went blank and nothing happened , " recalled a fellow musician , Frankie Cush . Whiteman finally let Beiderbecke go . The cornetist spent the rest of the year at home in Davenport and then , in February 1931 , he returned to New York one last time . 
 = = Death = = 
 Beiderbecke died in his apartment , No. 1G , 43 @-@ 30 46th Street , in Sunnyside , Queens , on August 6 , 1931 . The week had been quite hot , making sleep difficult , and late into the evenings , Beiderbecke had played piano , both to the annoyance and to the delight of his neighbors . On the evening of August 6 , at about 9 @.@ 30 pm , his rental agent , George <unk> , heard noises coming from across the hallway . " His hysterical shouts brought me to his apartment on the run , " <unk> told Philip Evans in 1959 . 
 He pulled me in and pointed to the bed . His whole body was trembling violently . He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers . To humor him , I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there , he staggered and fell , a dead weight , in my arms . I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor , Dr. <unk> , to examine him . She pronounced him dead . 
 Historians have disagreed over the identity of the doctor who pronounced Beiderbecke dead . The official cause of death , meanwhile , was lobar pneumonia , with scholars continuing to debate the extent to which his alcoholism was also a factor . Beiderbecke 's mother and brother took the train to New York and brought his body home to Davenport . He was buried there on August 11 in the family plot at Oakdale Cemetery .

 At the time of his death Beiderbecke was little known except among fellow musicians , and for several years critics paid little attention to his music . As Jean Pierre Lion has pointed out , " The only serious and analytical obituary to have been published in the months " after his death was by a Frenchman , Hugues <unk> . The notice appeared in October 1931 and began with a bit of hyperbole and an incorrect fact , two hallmarks of much of the subsequent writing about Beiderbecke : " The announcement of Bix Beiderbecke 's death plunged all jazz musicians into despair . We first believed it was a false alarm , as we had heard so often before about Bix . Unfortunately , precise information has been forthcoming , and we even know the day — August 7 — when he passed away . " 
 The New Republic critic Otis Ferguson wrote two short articles for the magazine , " Young Man with a Horn " ( July 29 , 1936 ) and " Young Man with a Horn Again " ( November 18 , 1940 ) , that worked to revive interest not only in Beiderbecke 's music but also in his biography . Beiderbecke " lived very briefly [ … ] in what might be called the servants ' entrance to art , " Ferguson wrote . " His story is a good story , quite humble and right . " The romantic notion of the short @-@ lived , doomed jazz genius can be traced back at least as far as Beiderbecke , and lived on in Glenn Miller , Charlie Parker , Billie Holiday , Jaco Pastorius and many more . 
 Ferguson 's sense of what was " right " became the basis for the Beiderbecke Romantic legend , which has traditionally emphasized the musician 's Iowa roots , his often careless dress , his difficulty sight reading , the purity of his tone , his drinking , and his early death . These themes were repeated by Beiderbecke 's friends in various memoirs , including The Stardust Road ( 1946 ) and Sometimes I Wonder ( 1965 ) by Hoagy Carmichael , Really the Blues ( 1946 ) by Mezz Mezzrow , and We Called It Music ( 1947 ) by Eddie Condon . Beiderbecke was portrayed as a tragic genius along the lines of Ludwig van Beethoven . " For his talent there were no conservatories to get stuffy in , no high @-@ trumpet <unk> to be learned doggedly , note @-@ perfect as written , " Ferguson wrote , " because in his chosen form the only writing of any account was traced in the close shouting air of Royal Gardens , Grand Pavilions , <unk> , etc . " He was " this big overgrown kid , who looked like he 'd been snatched out of a cradle in the cornfields , " Mezzrow wrote . " The guy didn 't have an enemy in the world , " recalled Beiderbecke 's friend Russ Morgan , " [ b ] ut he was out of this world most of the time . " According to Ralph Berton , he was " as usual gazing off into his private astronomy , " but his cornet , Condon famously quipped , sounded " like a girl saying yes . " 
 In 1938 , Dorothy Baker borrowed the titles of her friend Otis Ferguson 's two articles and published the novel Young Man with a Horn . Her story of the doomed trumpet player Rick Martin was inspired , she wrote , by " the music , but not the life " of Beiderbecke , but the image of Martin quickly became the image of Beiderbecke : His story is about " the gap between the man 's musical ability and his ability to fit it to his own life . " In 1950 , Michael Curtiz directed the film Young Man with a Horn , starring Kirk Douglas , Lauren Bacall , and Doris Day . In this version , in which Hoagy Carmichael also plays a role , the Rick Martin character lives . 
 In Blackboard Jungle , a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier , Beiderbecke 's music is briefly featured , but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution . 
 In 1971 , on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke 's death , the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport , Iowa , to honor the musician . In 1974 , Sudhalter and Evans published their biography , Bix : Man and Legend , which was nominated for a National Book Award . In 1977 , the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places . 
 Beiderbecke 's music was featured in three British comedy drama television series , all written by Alan Plater : The Beiderbecke Affair ( 1984 ) , The Beiderbecke Tapes ( 1987 ) , and The Beiderbecke Connection ( 1988 ) . In 1991 , the Italian director <unk> <unk> released Bix : An Interpretation of a Legend . Filmed partially in the Beiderbecke home , which <unk> had purchased and renovated , Bix was screened at the Cannes Film Festival . 
 At the beginning of the 21st century , Beiderbecke 's music continues to reside mostly out of the mainstream and some of the facts of his life are still debated , but scholars largely agree — due in part to the influence of Sudhalter and Evans — that he was an important innovator in early jazz ; jazz <unk> , including Sudhalter ( before his death in 2008 ) , and Tom Pletcher , closely emulate his style . In 2003 , to mark the hundredth anniversary of his birth , the Greater Astoria Historical Society and other community organizations , spearheaded by Paul <unk> and The Bix Beiderbecke Sunnyside Memorial Committee , erected a plaque in Beiderbecke 's honor at the apartment building in which he died in Queens . That same year , Frederick Turner published his novel 1929 , which followed the facts of Beiderbecke 's life fairly closely , focusing on his summer in Hollywood and featuring appearances by Al Capone and Clara Bow . The critic and musician Digby Fairweather sums up Beiderbecke 's musical legacy , arguing that " with Louis Armstrong , Bix Beiderbecke was the most striking of jazz 's cornet ( and of course , trumpet ) fathers ; a player who first captivated his 1920s generation and after his premature death , founded a dynasty of distinguished followers beginning with Jimmy <unk> and moving on down from there . "

 = = = Style and influence = = = 
 Bix Beiderbecke and Louis Armstrong were among jazz 's first soloists . In New Orleans , jazz had been ensemble playing , with the various instruments weaving their parts into a single and coherent aural tapestry . There had been soloists , to be sure , with the clarinetist Sidney Bechet the best known among them , but these players " lacked the technical resources and , even more , the creative depth to make the solo the compelling centerpiece of jazz music . " That changed in 1924 when Beiderbecke and Armstrong began to make their most important records . According to the critic Terry Teachout , they are " the two most influential figures in the early history of jazz " and " the twin lines of descent from which most of today 's jazz can be traced . " 
 Beiderbecke 's cornet style is often described by contrasting it with Armstrong 's markedly different approach . Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument , and his solos often took advantage of that fact . Beiderbecke was largely , although not completely , self @-@ taught , and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music . While Armstrong often soared into the upper register , Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range , more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience . Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing , while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing , uninterested in personally engaging his listeners . Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues , while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow <unk> . 
 Beiderbecke 's most famous solo was on " Singin ' the Blues " , recorded February 4 , 1927 . It has been hailed as an important example of the " jazz ballad style " — " a slow or medium @-@ tempo piece played gently and sweetly , but not cloyingly , with no loss of muscle . " The tune 's laid @-@ back emotions hinted at what would become , in the 1950s , the cool jazz style , personified by Chet Baker and Bill Evans . More than that , though , " Singin ' the Blues " has been noted for the way its improvisations feel less improvised than composed , with each phrase building on the last in a logical fashion . Benny Green describes the solo 's effect on practiced ears : 
 When a musician hears Bix 's solo on ' Singing the Blues ' , he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist knows exactly what he is doing and that he has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution . He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all , a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce . The listening musician , whatever his generation or his style , recognizes Bix as a modern , modernism being not a style but an attitude . 
 Like Green , who made particular mention of Beiderbecke 's " amount of teaching , " the jazz historian Ted Gioia also has emphasized Beiderbecke 's lack of formal instruction , suggesting that it caused him to adopt " an unusual , dry embouchure " and " unconventional fingerings , " which he retained for the rest of his life . Gioia points to " a characteristic streak of obstinacy " in Beiderbecke that provokes " this chronic disregard of the tried @-@ and @-@ true . " He argues that this stubbornness was behind Beiderbecke 's decision not to switch from cornet to trumpet when many other musicians , including Armstrong , did so . In addition , Gioia highlights Beiderbecke 's precise timing , relaxed delivery , and pure tone , which contrasted with " the dirty , rough @-@ edged sound " of King Oliver and his protégé Armstrong , whose playing was often more energetic and whose style held more sway early in the 1920s than Beiderbecke 's . Gioia further wonders whether the many hyperbolic and quasi @-@ poetic descriptions of Beiderbecke 's style — most notably Condon 's " like a girl saying yes " — may indicate that Beiderbecke 's sound was muddled on recordings . 
 Eddie Condon , Hoagy Carmichael , and Mezz Mezzrow , all of whom hyperbolically raved about his playing , also saw Beiderbecke play live or performed alongside him . Condon , for instance , wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke 's piano playing : " All my life I had been listening to music [ … ] But I had never heard anything remotely like what Beiderbecke played . For the first time I realized music isn 't all the same , it had become an entirely new set of sounds " " I tried to explain Bix to the gang , " Carmichael wrote , but " [ i ] t was no good , like the telling of a vivid , personal dream [ … ] the emotion couldn 't be transmitted . " 
 Mezzrow described Beiderbecke 's tone as being " pickled in alcohol [ … ] I have never heard a tone like he got before or since . He played mostly open horn , every note full , big , rich and round , standing out like a pearl , loud but never irritating or jangling , with a powerful drive that few white musicians had in those days . " 
 Some critics have highlighted " Jazz Me Blues " , recorded with the Wolverines on February 18 , 1924 , as being particularly important to understanding Beiderbecke 's style . Although it was one of his earliest recordings , the hallmarks of his playing were evident . " The overall impression we get from this solo , as in all of Bix at his best , " writes the trumpeter Randy <unk> , " is that every note is spontaneous yet inevitable . " Richard Hadlock describes Beiderbecke 's contribution to " Jazz Me Blues " as " an ordered solo that seems more inspired by clarinetists Larry Shields of the <unk> and Leon <unk> of the <unk> than by other trumpet players . " He goes on to suggest that clarinetists , by virtue of their not being tied to the melody as much as <unk> and trumpet players , could explore harmonies . 
 " Jazz Me Blues " was also important because it introduced what has been called the " correlated chorus " , a method of improvising that Beiderbecke 's Davenport friend Esten Spurrier attributed to both Beiderbecke and Armstrong . " Louis departed greatly from all cornet players in his ability to compose a close @-@ knit individual 32 measures with all phrases compatible with each other " , Spurrier told the biographers Sudhalter and Evans , " so Bix and I always credited Louis as being the father of the correlated chorus : play two measures , then two related , making four measures , on which you played another four measures related to the first four , and so on ad infinitum to the end of the chorus .

 Beiderbecke plays piano on his recordings " Big Boy " ( October 8 , 1924 ) , " For No Reason at All in C " ( May 13 , 1927 ) , " <unk> ' and Twistin ' " ( September 17 , 1927 ) — all with ensembles — and his only solo recorded work , " In a Mist " ( September 8 , 1927 ) . Critic Frank Murphy argues that many of the same characteristics that mark Beiderbecke on the cornet mark him on the keyboard : the uncharacteristic fingering , the emphasis on inventive harmonies , and the correlated choruses . Those inventive harmonies , on both cornet and piano , eventually helped point the way to bebop , which abandoned melody almost entirely .

 " In the Dark " ( 1931 ) 
 " <unk> " , " Flashes " , and " In the Dark " are piano compositions transcribed with the help of Bill Challis but never recorded by Beiderbecke . Two additional compositions were attributed to him by two other jazz composers : " Betcha I Getcha " , attributed to Beiderbecke as a co @-@ composer by Joe Venuti , the composer of the song , and " Cloudy " , attributed to Beiderbecke by composer Charlie Davis as a composition from circa 1924 .

 = Voltaire P. Twombly = 
 Voltaire Paine Twombly ( February 21 , 1842 – February 24 , 1918 ) was a Union veteran of the American Civil War and a recipient of the Medal of Honor . He received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15 , 1862 , when he picked up and carried his company 's colors after three other members of his regiment were killed or incapacitated by Confederate fire while attempting to secure the flag . Twombly also participated in a number of other engagements in the Civil War , including the Siege of Corinth and Sherman 's March to the Sea . 
 After being mustered out of service in 1865 , Twombly attended business school and entered into a number of business ventures . In 1880 , he entered politics upon being selected to be the treasurer of Van Buren County , Iowa . He served as the mayor of Keosauqua , Iowa from 1884 to early 1885 , and as the treasurer of Iowa from 1885 to 1891 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Twombly was born to Samuel Twombly and Dorothy Twombly ( nee Wilder ) on February 21 , 1842 , near Farmington , Van Buren County , Iowa Territory . His father died in September of 1842 , leaving Twombly 's mother responsible for raising him . While growing up , Twombly was educated at several common schools and at the Lane Academy of Keosauqua . 
 = = Civil War = = 
 Twombly enlisted in the Union Army on April 24 , 1861 , after President Abraham Lincoln had called for soldiers to counter the secessionist Confederate States . On May 27 , 1861 , he was mustered into Company F of the 2nd Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a private in Keokuk , Iowa . The 2nd Iowa Regiment left for Northern Missouri on June 13 , 1861 , and was stationed at St. Joseph , Missouri to protect the city 's railroad lines . On July 21 , 1861 , the 2nd Iowa regiment was transferred to Bird 's Point , Missouri . The regiment would continue to be transferred throughout Missouri during the remainder of the year , but saw little combat . In October , Twombly was promoted to the rank of corporal and assigned to the color guard . In February of 1862 , the Second Iowa Infantry Regiment was incorporated into the Army of the Tennessee , which was under the command of Major General Ulysses S. Grant . 
 On February 15 , 1862 , the Army of the Tennessee attacked Fort Donelson in Tennessee . During the battle , Twombly picked up and carried his company 's flag after the color sergeant and two other corporals had been killed or injured by the enemy . Twombly was knocked to the ground by cannon fire , but managed to carry the flag for the duration of the battle . For his actions during the battle , Twombly was promoted to sergeant and later awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1897 . His citation reads : 
 Took the colors after 3 of the color guard had fallen , and although most instantly knocked down by a spent ball , immediately arose and bore the colors to the end of the engagement . 
 Twombly carried his company 's flag during the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh and participated in the Siege of Corinth , Mississippi as an acting second lieutenant . In October of 1862 , Twombly received a knee injury during the Second Battle of Corinth . He was hospitalized and placed on leave for six weeks to help him recover from the injury . In 1863 , Twombly 's regiment was formally stationed in Corinth , and engaged in numerous actions against the cavalry forces of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest . 
 In October 1863 , Major General William Tecumseh Sherman replaced Grant as the commander of the Army of the Tennessee . In November of 1863 , Twombly and the Army of the Tennessee marched northeast into Tennessee ; his regiment spent the winter of 1863 – 1864 in Pulaski , Tennessee . Twombly went on to participate in the Atlanta Campaign and Sherman 's March to the Sea . He was promoted to first lieutenant in July of 1864 and to captain in November of 1864 . While stationed in Savannah , Georgia in January 1865 , Twombly was made the assistant inspector general of the Third Brigade of his division . 
 In early 1865 , Twombly and the Army of the Tennessee marched North through the Carolinas and fought Confederate forces in Columbia , South Carolina and Bentonville , North Carolina . Twombly reached Goldsboro , North Carolina by the end of March and was present at the surrender of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston near Raleigh , North Carolina . Following the surrender , the Army of the Tennessee headed north to Washington , D.C. , where Twombly and the 2nd Iowa Infantry participated in the Grand Review of the Armies . Twombly was mustered out of service on July 12 in Louisville , Kentucky and formally discharged on July 20 in Davenport , Iowa .

 From August to December 1865 , Twombly attended Bryant & Stratton 's Business College , a commercial school in Burlington , Iowa . After completing his education , he entered into a number of business ventures . From his graduation until December 1867 , Twombly worked as a flour merchant in Ottumwa , Iowa . He opened a milling company in Pittsburg , Van Buren County in January of 1868 , which he ran until April of 1876 . He later moved to Keosauqua , Iowa where he worked as a merchant until 1880 . 
 Twombly , who had consistently supported the Republican Party since reaching voting age , accepted the position of treasurer of Van Buren County in 1880 . He served in that position until 1884 , when Twombly became the Mayor of Keosauqua . In January 1885 , Twombly was elected the Treasurer of Iowa . He served three terms in the position before stepping down in January of 1891 . 
 After his term as Treasurer of Iowa had concluded , Twombly assisted with the creation of the Home Savings Bank of Des Moines . He became the director and president of the bank in June of 1891 , and maintained the two positions until January of 1901 . In October of 1891 , Twombly became the half @-@ owner of the Capital Hill Granite & Marble Works . Twombly stepped down from the position and retired from business in June of 1905 . 
 Twombly spent the last years of his life in retirement . He died in his home in Des Moines , Iowa on February 24 , 1918 , after having suffered from an illness for several months .

 = Sd.Kfz. 10 = 
 The Sd.Kfz. 10 ( Sonderkraftfahrzeug - special motorized vehicle ) was a German half @-@ track that saw very widespread use in World War II . Its main role was as a prime mover for small towed guns such as the 2 cm FlaK 30 , the 7 @.@ 5 cm <unk> , or the 3 @.@ 7 cm PaK 36 anti @-@ tank gun . It could carry eight troops in addition to towing a gun or trailer . 
 The basic engineering for all the German half @-@ tracks was developed during the Weimar @-@ era by the Reichswehr 's Military Automotive Department , but final design and testing was farmed out to commercial firms with the understanding that production would be shared with multiple companies . Demag was chosen to develop the smallest of the German half @-@ tracks and spent the years between 1934 and 1938 perfecting the design through a series of prototypes . 
 The chassis formed the basis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light armored personnel carrier . Approximately 14 @,@ 000 were produced between 1938 and 1945 , making it one of the most widely produced German tactical vehicles of the war . It participated in the Invasion of Poland , the Battle of France , the Balkans Campaign and fought on both the Western Front and the Eastern Front , in North Africa and in Italy . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Sd.Kfz. 10 was unique among German half @-@ track designs as it used a hull rather than a frame . Power was provided by a Maybach 6 @-@ cylinder , water @-@ cooled , 3 @.@ 791 litres ( 231 @.@ 3 cu in ) NL 38 TRKM gasoline engine of 90 horsepower ( 91 PS ) . It had a semi @-@ automatic Maybach <unk> @-@ transmission SRG <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) with seven forward and three reverse gears . The driver selected the desired gear and initiated the shift by depressing the clutch . It could attain 75 km / h ( 47 mph ) , but the driver was cautioned not to exceed 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . In 1942 the Luftwaffe limited its vehicles to a non @-@ tactical speed of only 30 km / h ( 19 mph ) to extend the life of the rubber track pads ( <unk> ) . 
 Both tracks and wheels were used for steering . The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels , but brakes would be applied to the tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned . The drive sprocket had the track @-@ saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth . The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels , overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout , mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars . An idler wheel , mounted at the rear of the vehicle , was used to control track tension . The front wheels had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers , the only ones on the vehicle , to dampen impacts . 
 The upper body had a baggage compartment separating the driver 's compartment from the crew compartment . Bench seats on the sides of the vehicle , with under @-@ seat storage , could accommodate six men . The windshield could fold forward and was also removable . A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body . It fastened to the windshield when erected . Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 Preliminary design of all the German half @-@ tracks of the early part of the war was done by Dipl.Ing. Ernst Kniepkamp of the Military Automotive Department ( Wa Prüf 6 ) before the Nazis took power in 1933 . His designs were then turned over to commercial firms for development and testing . Demag was assigned to develop the " <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> ( smallest cross @-@ country tracked towing vehicle ) with the first D ll 1 prototype produced in 1934 . It had a six @-@ cylinder , 28 horsepower ( 28 PS ) BMW Type 315 engine mounted in the rear and only had three roadwheels per side . The D ll 2 followed in 1935 and kept the same engine , but added an extra roadwheel . It weighed 2 @.@ 56 tonnes ( 2 @.@ 52 long tons ; 2 @.@ 82 short tons ) . 
 While the first two vehicles were only automotive prototypes , the 3 @.@ 4 tonnes ( 3 @.@ 3 long tons ; 3 @.@ 7 short tons ) D ll 3 had a 42 horsepower ( 43 PS ) BMW Type 316 engine mounted in the front , 5 roadwheels and a troop compartment that could fit six . The D 4 prototype never left the drawing board . There was no D 5 . It was succeeded by eight trial series ( <unk> @-@ Serie ) D 6 prototypes in 1937 . This weighed 3 @.@ 85 tonnes ( 3 @.@ 79 long tons ; 4 @.@ 24 short tons ) , had a 83 horsepower ( 84 PS ) Maybach NL 38 <unk> engine and a different transmission , but otherwise differed only in detail from the D ll 3 . Several D 6s and the D ll 3 were used as prototypes for the models intended for service with the Chemical Troops ( Nebeltruppen ) and the Air Defense Troops ( <unk> ) . A series of 60 pre @-@ production ( 0 @-@ serie ) D 6s were ordered in 1937 from Demag , Adler and <unk> Werke Cottbus ( MWC ) which differed only in details from the trial series . They were all delivered by November 1938 . On 17 March 1937 the vehicle was renamed as the <unk> Zugkraftwagen 1 to ( Sd.Kfz. 10 ) ( light 1 ton semi @-@ tracked towing vehicle ) . 
 The D 7 was the mass @-@ production model and differed mainly from the D 6 by having different tracks and a NL 38 TRKM engine . The NL 38 <unk> had proven to have too much compression for the 74 octane ( OZ 74 ) gasoline decreed for use after 1 October 1938 and had to be modified with new cylinder heads and shorter pistons than the TRKM , but this did not change the engine 's power . Deliveries began in October 1938 with one of the first machines off the production line demonstrated for the army on 11 October 1938 . Early machines had two fuel tanks , one of 58 litres ( 15 US gal ) and the other of 31 litres ( 8 @.@ 2 US gal ) , but they were replaced by a single 110 litres ( 29 US gal ) tank early in the production run . The NL 38 TRKM engine was replaced in late 1939 by the HL 42 TRKM which differed little other than it had been bored out to 4 @.@ 192 litres ( 255 @.@ 8 cu in ) to increase its power to 100 horsepower ( 100 PS ) . During 1940 the hull rear was reinforced to allow the vehicle to tow heavier loads like the 7 @.@ 5 cm PaK 40 anti @-@ tank gun , 15 cm <unk> 33 infantry gun and the 10 @.@ 5 cm leFH 18 howitzer . An air compressor was added later for loads equipped with air brakes . These were designated as Model ( <unk> - Ausf . ) B. In 1943 the semi @-@ automatic transmission was replaced by a manual transmission . During 1943 – 44 the original metal upper bodies were replaced with wood to conserve steel . 
 The D 7p chassis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light armored personnel carrier was based on that of the D 7 with a shortened suspension , but actually shared very few components with it other than the engine . 
 Demag was contracted to design a new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 in 1944 with ten road wheels , a strengthened front axle , a strengthened idler crank arm , an improved track tensioner and increased ground clearance . Three prototypes were completed ; two were delivered in September 1944 , but the third was retained at the factory . Development , however , did not proceed any further . Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver 's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945 . 
 = = Production = = 
 Seven factories assembled the various models of the Sd.Kfz. 10 . Demag built approximately 1 @,@ 075 from 1938 to November 1942 . <unk> completed 3 @,@ 414 between 1938 and December 1943 . <unk> @-@ <unk> built 750 between 1938 and December 1942 . MWC assembled 4750 between 1939 and November 1944 . <unk> @-@ Industrie A.G. ( <unk> ) completed 324 between 1939 and 1941 . Maschinenfabrik <unk> Hannover ( <unk> ) built about 600 between 1939 and November 1942 . <unk> <unk> completed about 3 @,@ 075 from 1940 to December 1943 . Both Demag and MWC were producing the D 7p chassis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light APC in 1945 when a shortage of armored bodies meant that 276 had to be completed with wooden upper bodies . Eighty of these are known to have been delivered by 1 March 1945 . These numbers may include 310 chassis built for Sd.Kfz. 252 armored ammunition carriers and Sd.Kfz. 253 <unk> vehicles .

 The Sd.Kfz. 10 / 1 was a chemical detection vehicle . Before the outbreak of World War II only ninety were intended to be delivered in 1940 – 42 to equip the Chemical Troops ( Nebeltruppen ) , but the 3 May 1940 production plan mentions that was to be produced at a rate of thirty per month until a total of 400 have been built and thereafter at ten per month . The last mention is a report that MWC was to complete ten vehicles by 15 January 1943 . Production may have continued after that , but definitely not after 1943 . 
 = = = Sd.Kfz. 10 / 2 = = = 
 The Sd.Kfz. 10 / 2 was a chemical decontamination vehicle fitted with a 200 kg ( 440 lb ) capacity spreader and space for eight 50 kg ( 110 lb ) barrels of decontamination chemicals . This left room for only two crewmen who had a bench seat between the barrels in front of the rear chassis wall . Each barrel could cover an area 1 by 160 metres ( 1 @.@ 1 by 175 @.@ 0 yd ) . The barrels were stowed on platforms over the tracks with foldable outer rails . The 10 / 2 had a significant number of differences from the standard model , including two fuel tanks totaling 86 litres ( 23 US gal ) , one of which had a tunnel to accommodate the auxiliary driveshaft which powered the spreader . This reduced the road range to only 250 kilometres ( 160 mi ) . The 10 / 2 was 4 @.@ 83 metres ( 15 @.@ 8 ft ) long , 1 @.@ 9 metres ( 6 @.@ 2 ft ) wide , and 1 @.@ 95 – 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 6 @.@ 4 – 5 @.@ 6 ft ) high , depending if the top was up or down . It weighed 3 @,@ 890 kilograms ( 8 @,@ 580 lb ) empty and 4 @,@ 900 kilograms ( 10 @,@ 800 lb ) loaded . While spreading its top speed was only 10 – 20 km / h ( 6 @.@ 2 – 12 @.@ 4 mph ) . Sixty to seventy were built in 1938 – 39 . 
 = = = Sd.Kfz. 10 / 3 = = = 
 The Sd.Kfz. 10 / 3 was equipped with a 500 litres ( 130 US gal ) tank and spray system to lay down poison gas barriers . The spray nozzle swung back and forth to cover a width of 16 metres ( 52 ft ) . Approximately 67 were built in 1938 – 39 . On 15 April 1942 the Army High Command ( Oberkommando des Heeres - OKH ) ordered the tanks on the 65 vehicles in storage dismounted , the spray system disabled and the vehicles modified to carry 216 rounds of anti @-@ tank ammunition . The vehicles were to be issued to rebuilding Nebeltruppen units . By this stage of the war they were equipped with Nebelwerfer rocket launchers and had organic anti @-@ tank guns . 
 = = = Sd.Kfz. 10 / 4 and 10 / 5 = = = 
 The Sd.Kfz. 10 / 4 carried the 2 cm FlaK 30 mount on a special platform with fold @-@ down side and rear panels . This platform was specifically designed for the Flak 30 mount and could not readily accept a Flak 38 mount or vice versa . To accommodate the gun mount the vehicle was both wider and taller than normal , namely 2 @.@ 02 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) wide and 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) and weighed 4 @,@ 075 kilograms ( 8 @,@ 984 lb ) empty . Four folding seats were fitted on the platform for the crew . Some of these gun mounts had a gun shield fitted . The ready ammunition bins fastened to the side and rear panels ( four on each side and two in the rear ) contained one 20 @-@ round magazine each . It usually towed an ammunition trailer ( <unk> 51 - <unk> — special single @-@ axle trailer ) with 640 more rounds , the gun 's sights and its rangefinder . 
 Vehicles built in 1940 ( only ) were fitted with removable loading ramps , cable rollers to act as pulleys , and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30 , mounted on a <unk> 51 trailer , to be quickly dismounted . From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather . Flak 38s were mounted on 10 / 4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn 't widened until later . As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields . 
 The Sd.Kfz. 10 / 5 carried the 2 cm FlaK 38 whose mount was wider , and lighter , than that of the Flak 30 , and the platform was enlarged to accommodate it from 1942 . Vehicle width increased to 2 @.@ 156 metres ( 7 @.@ 07 ft ) , but the height returned to that of the normal vehicle . Initially , vehicles modified with the wider platform for the Flak 38 did not have a special designation , but they were given one sometime in 1943 . The earliest known use is 1 September 1943 , but the older name lingered until 1 December 1944 . The Luftwaffe ordered 293 sets of armor plate ( <unk> ) for its vehicles in 1943 . These plates covered the radiator , windshield and both sides of the driver 's compartment and were fitted to both versions . 
 Production began in 1939 for deliveries to the Army and Luftwaffe , although the exact numbers will never be known as they were often not broken out separately in the production reports . At any rate Adler built 1054 between 1939 and February 1943 , although some of these were completed as 10 / 5s beginning in 1942 . MWC was awarded two contracts for 975 10 / 5s to be delivered in 1943 – 44 , but 13 of these were delivered as ordinary Sd.Kfz. 10s in 1944 . 
 = = = Field modifications = = = 
 Some vehicles were fitted with a 3 @.@ 7 cm PaK 36 or 5 cm PaK 38 anti @-@ tank gun . Sometimes they had the cab and engine compartment armored as well . The Pak 36 was usually carried complete , but the Pak 38 was usually mounted without its wheels on a pivot mount . In the end of the war some vehicles were equipped with a triple @-@ mount ( " Drilling " in German ) of <unk> autocannon on a conical pivot . It was the same mount as was used in Sd.Kfz. 251 / 21 .

 Initially it was planned to use the Sd.Kfz. 10 as a towing vehicle for various light guns and trailers , but it was authorized as a substitute for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light armored personnel carrier in 1939 . The Ausf . B model saw its use broadened to tow heavier weapons like the 5 cm PaK 38 as well as their ammunition trailers . They also served in the maintenance and supply companies of motorized and tank units . Nine were delivered to Romania in 1942 as tractors for anti @-@ tank guns . 
 For the Chemical Troops ( Nebeltruppen ) each decontamination battery ( <unk> @-@ Batterie ) was authorized six Sd.Kfz. 10 / 1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10 / 2 . Eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10 / 3 were held at the battalion level for issue to the batteries in lieu of their Sd.Kfz. 10 / 2s if needed . If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type . When the decontamination units were authorized to be re @-@ equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10 / 1s were used to tow the 28 / 32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another was used by the platoon leader to tow an anti @-@ tank gun . Similarly decontamination units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10 / 2s and used them just like the 10 / 1s after removing their special equipment . However , it seems that the 10 / 3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized . 
 An early @-@ war Army anti @-@ aircraft company ( <unk> @-@ Kompanie ) was organized in three platoons with a total of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10 / 4s , twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition . When the four @-@ barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10 / 4s towing the guns and another for ammunition . Later these companies were reorganized with a total of eight Sd.Kfz. 10 / 4s carrying guns , two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition . These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period . Sd.Kfz. 10 / 5s were substituted for 10 / 4s on a one for one basis . Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti @-@ aircraft units , but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns . 
 = = = Usage in Sweden = = = 
 When war broke out in September 1939 , Sweden maintained a policy of neutrality . To support this policy a rapid upgrade of aging military equipment was necessary . Guns , vehicles and aircraft was both manufactured domestically and purchased abroad . Artillery guns , 10 @.@ 5 cm leFH 18 and towing vehicles was purchased from Germany in the winter of 1939 / 1940 and deliveries started in 1940 . The towing vehicles were partly Klöckner @-@ Deutz A330 4x4 trucks and partly Demag D7 halftracks . The halftracks were would be used in sub @-@ arctic climate and all twelve <unk> were , in the autumn of 1940 , delivered along with twelve guns to the 8th Artillery regiment ( A8 ) in the northern city of Boden , close to the arctic <unk> . Noteworthy is that the 10 @.@ 5 cm leFH 18 ( " <unk> m / 39 " in Swedish terms ) is a significantly heavier gun than the ones the German army towed with this vehicle . In Sweden the Demag was called " <unk> m / 40 " or " <unk> m / 40 " for short . 
 Already in 1941 Sweden tried to purchase more <unk> , but the ongoing war made this impossible . Orders then went to Volvo to make a " copy " ( the " <unk> m / 43 " or " Volvo HBT " ) , were the only specific requirement from the Swedish army was that the track links had to be interchangeable with the Demag . This Volvo was never in use at A8 . 
 After the war another twelve Sdkfz 10 , bought as surplus from Norway and elsewhere , were delivered to A8 . The total of 24 Sdkfz 10 were used in training gun crews all through the 1950s and early 1960s . 1966 all were sold to the highest bidders at <unk> airfield and they ended up in the villages surrounding <unk> and Boden . In the mid 1970s they were traced down and sold abroad . The last known one left Sweden in 1992 . Of the 24 sold in 1966 , as of 2014 fourteen have known locations with collectors and in museums all over the world . 
 = The Wife of His Youth = 
 " The Wife of His Youth " is a short story by American author Charles W. Chesnutt , first published in July 1898 . It later served as the title story of the collection The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color @-@ Line . That book was first published in 1899 , the same year Chesnutt published his short story collection The Conjure Woman . 
 " The Wife of His Youth " features an upwardly mobile , light @-@ skinned mulatto man , a respected member of the Blue Veins Society in a Midwestern city . He is preparing to marry another light @-@ skinned mulatto woman when a much darker woman comes to him seeking her husband , whom she has not seen in 25 years . The story , which was met positively upon its publication , has become Chesnutt 's most anthologized work . 
 The story has been read as an analysis of race relations , not between black and white but within the black community , exploring its own color and class prejudices . The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being black and the full history of African Americans in the United States . The ending of the story , however , has been called ambiguous and leaves several questions unanswered . 
 = = Plot = = 
 " The Wife of His Youth " follows Mr. Ryder , a bi @-@ racial man who was born and reared free before the Civil War . He heads the " Blue Veins Society " , a social organization for colored people in a northern town ; the membership consists of people with a high proportion of European ancestry , who look more white than black . The organization 's name stemmed from the joke that one would have to be so white ( to be a member ) that veins could be seen through the skin . 
 Ryder is sought after by the town 's women but begins courting a very light mixed @-@ race woman from Washington , DC named Molly Dixon . He plans to propose to her at the next Blue Vein ball , for which he is giving a speech . Before the talk , he meets an older , plain @-@ looking black woman . Her name is ' Liza Jane , and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor , whom she has not seen in 25 years . She says she was married to Sam before the Civil War , when she was enslaved and he was a hired apprentice to the family of her master . Despite Taylor 's being a free black , the family tried to sell him into slavery . She assisted Sam in escaping , and he promised to return and free her , but she was sold to a different master . Ryder says that Taylor could have died , may have outgrown her , or could have remarried . However , she persists in saying that her husband has remained faithful , and refuses to stop looking . Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war ; marriages had to be officially made legal . She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves . 
 At the ball Ryder addresses the members and tells them ' Liza Jane 's story . At the conclusion , he asks the attendees whether or not they think the man should acknowledge his wife . Everyone urges yes . He brings out ' Liza and says , " Ladies and gentlemen , this is the woman , and I am the man , whose story I have told you . Permit me to introduce to you the wife of my youth . " 
 = = Publication and response = = 
 " The Wife of His Youth " was first published in the July 1898 issue of The Atlantic Monthly , without reference to the author 's own racial background ( he was African American , with majority @-@ white ancestry ) . Reviews were positive . After Chesnutt read several compliments from friends and in various newspaper reviews , he wrote to editor Walter Hines Page , " taking it all in all , I have had a slight glimpse of what it means , I imagine , to be a successful author . " 
 One later review by influential critic William Dean Howells particularly praised Chesnutt . In " The Wife of His Youth " , Howells was impressed that the main character offered up a Christ @-@ like sacrifice , unimpeded by his being African American . In the 20th century , " The Wife of His Youth " became Chesnutt 's most anthologized short story . 
 Chesnutt had published " The <unk> Grapevine " in the August 1887 issue of the Atlantic during the editorship of Thomas Bailey Aldrich . It was his first nationally distributed story . He published two others under Aldrich , marking the beginning of a 20 @-@ year association with the magazine . In 1891 , Chesnutt contacted Aldrich 's successor Horace Scudder about publishing a book of his tales and revealed his African @-@ American heritage . Scudder advised against trying a book at that time , and suggested Chesnutt wait until he earned a broader reputation . Seven years later , Scudder endorsed Chesnutt to Page , who had taken his role as editor of the Atlantic . 
 With the support of both Scudder and Page , Houghton Mifflin published The Wife of his Youth and Other Stories of the Color Line in 1899 , which included " The Passing of Grandison " , which turned slave narratives around . That year , he also published his The Conjure Woman , a collection of his dialect or local color stories . The next year , Chesnutt 's first novel The House Behind the Cedars was published by the same company . Chesnutt advised his editor Harry D. Robins of his intentions with The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color Line : 
 " The book was written with the distinct hope that it might have its influence in directing attention to certain aspects of the race question which are quite familiar to those on the unfortunate side of it ; and I should be glad to have that view of it emphasized if in your opinion the book is strong enough to stand it ; for a sermon that is labeled a sermon must be a good one to get a hearing " . 
 Many years later , Carl Van Vechten , who corresponded with Chesnutt , included a character in his novel , Nigger Heaven ( 1926 ) , who reads " The Wife of His Youth " and its accompanying stories . The character despairingly realizes he will never write as well as Chesnutt . From the book : 
 He lifted The Wife of his Youth from its place on the table and opened its pages for the hundredth time . How much he admired the cool deliberation of its style , the sense of form , but more than all the civilized mind of this man who had surveyed the problems of his race from an Olympian height and had turned them into living and artistic drama . Nothing seemed to have escaped his attention , from the lowly life of the worker on the Southern plantation to the snobbery of the near whites of the north . Chesnutt had surveyed the entire field , calmly setting down what he saw , what he thought and felt about it . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 In " The Wife of His Youth " , Charles Chesnutt does not explore the relationship between whites and mulattoes ; instead , the story is concerned with race consciousness among those of mixed race , both from the North and South . Scholar William L. Andrews notes that this story , and others like it including " A Matter of Principle " , were unprecedented . Chesnutt " broke the ice in the American fiction of manners . " Like the other Blue Veins , Ryder has idealized whiteness and dreams of becoming white or , as Chesnutt writes it , " [ his ] absorption by the white race . " This is symbolized by his reading " A Dream of Fair Women " by Alfred , Lord Tennyson when his wife first appears in the story . 
 White readers , such as William Dean Howells , considered this a realistic portrayal of mixed @-@ race Americans , revealed by Chesnutt as an " insider " , much as Paul Laurence Dunbar had shown whites the lyrical side of blacks . Howells wrote : 
 We had known the <unk> world of the grotesque and comical negro and the terrible and tragic negro through the white observer on the outside , and the black character in its lyrical moods we had known from such an inside witness as Mr. Paul Dunbar ; but it had remained for Mr. Chesnutt to acquaint us with those regions where the paler shades dwell as hopelessly , with relation to ourselves [ i.e. whites ] , as the blackest negro . 
 Ultimately , Chesnutt is challenging the idea of two " races . " The story serves as an allegory of the changing relationship of freeborn and freedmen , mixed race and blacks , in a post @-@ Reconstruction Era . Such differences are expressed in language used by the characters , which also reflects differing education and class levels . Ryder speaks in the high rhetoric of " white " English ( emulating the Tennyson he reads ) while ' Liza uses a thick black dialect . That difference is further emphasized by Ryder 's writing ' Liza 's address in the flyleaf of his Tennyson book and , when recounting her story , switching into his own " soft dialect " . Ann <unk> suggests the story questions the legality of marriage during enslavement . Ryder / Taylor 's decision is about choosing to accept or negate " the old plantation past " , or , as <unk> writes , " between moral obligation and romantic desire " . 
 Cynthia <unk> considers the story as a social satire . Ryder is pretentious and uppity , concerned about the delineations in class based on skin color , and promotes advancement of lighter @-@ skinned people , some of whom were already educated before the war . That his wife is revealed to be a dark @-@ skinned , unrefined cook is his " just desserts [ sic ] " . Dean McWilliams notes the ambiguity about whether Ryder really is Sam Taylor . Certainly , writes McWilliams , the drawing room image of Ryder at the beginning of the story seems nothing like the plantation worker described by ' Liza . 
 Even if he is Taylor , Tess <unk> questions if the reader should be certain that Ryder has made the " right " decision . There is an uncomfortable tension in his attempt to abandon the past and racial definitions in order to move into the future . Though the story has been traditionally read as having a happy ending , <unk> emphasizes that ' Liza has no final lines which show her response to the husband who had forgotten her . Henry B. <unk> notes a significance to Ryder 's referring to ' Liza not simply as wife but " the wife of my youth " , as if dissociating from her even as he acknowledges her . 
 = Australian cricket team in England in 1884 = 
 The Australia national cricket team toured England in 1884 . The team is officially termed the Fourth Australians , following three previous tours in the 1878 , 1880 and 1882 seasons . The 1884 tour was a private venture by the thirteen players who each invested an agreed sum to provide funding , none of Australia 's colonial cricket associations being involved . Billy Murdoch captained the team and George Alexander acted as player @-@ manager . The Australians played a total of 32 matches in England , 31 of which are recognised by CricketArchive as first @-@ class . 
 1884 was the first English season to feature more than a single Test match . A three @-@ match series was scheduled which included the inaugural Tests at both Old Trafford and Lord 's . The third Test was played at the Oval which had staged the Tests in 1880 and 1882 . England won the Test series 1 – 0 with an innings victory in the second Test at Lord 's , while the first and third Tests were drawn . The 1884 series was the first Ashes series in England , following publication of the mock " ashes " obituary after the 1882 Test . 
 The tour was dogged by financial controversy with the Australians accused by the British press of being interested only in money . The allegations were refuted by the Australian press but it later became clear , when an England team arrived in Australia the following winter , that there had been a financial dispute between Alexander and the English team manager James Lillywhite , resulting in the two teams at first boycotting each other . The dispute was never evident while Murdoch 's team was in England as they completed all their scheduled fixtures , winning eighteen matches and losing seven with seven drawn . 
 = = Australian squad = = 
 Australia had a 13 @-@ man squad captained by Billy Murdoch while George Alexander was player @-@ manager . Squad details below state the player 's colonial team at the time , his age at the beginning of the tour , his batting hand and his type of bowling : 
 The 1884 squad was very similar to the 1882 squad with Alexander , Cooper , Midwinter and Scott replacing Tom Garrett , Tom Horan , Sammy Jones and Hugh Massie . Cooper and Scott were making their first visit to England . 
 Australia used the same eleven players in all three Tests , Scott making his debut in the first Test , and in the majority of their first @-@ class matches as Alexander was effectively a reserve who made only five appearances on the tour and Cooper , who also made just five appearances , suffered a long @-@ term injury . 
 = = England Test selections = = 
 England selected a total of 16 players in the three Tests . Six players ( Barlow , Grace , Peate , Shrewsbury , Steel and Ulyett ) played in all three matches . O 'Brien ( first Test ) and Christopherson ( second Test ) made their Test debuts . Hornby captained England in the first Test and Harris in the other two . 
 Details of the England players include their ages at the beginning of the 1884 season , their batting and bowling styles , and the county club they represented in 1884 : 
 = = Tour preparations and voyages = = 
 The Fourth Australian team was selected after Christmas 1883 at which time Victoria were playing New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) in a match which ended on New Year 's Eve with a three wicket win by Victoria . Another match was arranged to start on New Year 's Day , also at the MCG , between the Fourth Australians and a Combined XI . All the tour selections except Spofforth were playing , though Scott played for the Combined XI . Murdoch scored a career @-@ high 279 not out and McDonnell 111 in a total of 619 , the result being a draw . A return match with the Combined XI was arranged in February at the Association Ground in Sydney . Scott played for the Fourth Australians , replacing Alexander , and Spofforth played for the Combined XI , the Fourth Australians winning by 9 wickets . 
 Unlike other Australian touring teams , the 1884 team organised the project themselves and so it was a private business venture which involved none of the Australian colonial cricket associations . The players invested agreed sums to fund their travel and cover any losses . 
 After one final match in Adelaide , which was the last time South Australia needed odds ( i.e. , extra men ) to compete , the tourists left Melbourne on 11 March 1884 aboard the P & O steamer Sutlej and arrived at Plymouth on 29 April . With a programme of 32 fixtures arranged , the first game in England began on 12 May at Sheffield Park , Uckfield and the last game against the South of England was completed on 12 September . The team travelled home on the SS <unk> and reached Melbourne again in early November . Murdoch enjoyed a shipboard romance on the return voyage with an heiress called Jemima Watson whom he married at Fitzroy , Victoria in December , only a few weeks after the <unk> berthed . 
 The outward bound voyage had a short stopover at Colombo where the Australians played a drawn game on Galle Face Green against a Ceylon XVIII in a one @-@ day match on 1 April . The return voyage also stopped off in Colombo and the team played another odds match , again on Galle Face Green and drawn , on 23 October .

 The following is a list of the matches played by the Fourth Australians , all but one of which are recognised by CricketArchive as first @-@ class fixtures : 
 = = Test series = = 
 = = = First Test = = = 
 This was the inaugural Old Trafford Test and , as Chris Harte described it , " the first time that a match of such importance had been staged outside of London " . Selection of an England home Test team in the 19th century was the privilege of the host club and Lancashire selected five local players in their squad of twelve , although Jack Crossland missed out and was made twelfth man . Barlow , Hornby , Pilling and Steel all played as it was believed their presence would boost the gate receipts . 
 Chris Harte commented that the match was also the origin of Old Trafford 's " reputation for wet weather " , the game being drawn after rain had made the first day unplayable . The match was therefore reduced to two days play and it was reported that the wicket dried much quicker than expected and conditions were never difficult for batting . Even so , England were all out for 95 in their first innings , Boyle taking six wickets for 42 runs conceded ( i.e. , 6 / 42 ) with his medium @-@ paced spin and Spofforth 4 / 42 . Shrewsbury , displaying " masterly technique " , scored 43 to save his team from real embarrassment . In their first innings , Australia " hit with more vigour and confidence than their opponents " and scored 182 , a lead of 87 . Their top scorer was Midwinter with 37 . The wicket had dried out on the final day and England were able to bat out time and secure the draw , scoring 180 for the loss of 9 wickets ( i.e. , 180 / 9 ) . Grace was top scorer with a patient 31 and Joey Palmer was the best of the Australian bowlers " with his controlled off- and leg @-@ cutters " . 
 = = = Second Test = = = 
 This was the inaugural Lord 's Test and England won by an innings after a century by A. G. Steel and fine bowling by Ted Peate and George Ulyett . The game ended just after lunch on the third day . 
 Wisden recorded that the main elements of England 's success were " the magnificent batting of A. G. Steel and the bowling of Ulyett " . Batting first , Australia were reduced to 160 / 9 despite an innings of 63 by Giffen ; but then Scott and Boyle added 69 for the final wicket , Wisden reporting that Scott played " cool , confident , skilful cricket " in an innings of 75 . At close of play on the first day , England were 90 / 3 so the match was evenly poised , with Lucas on 28 and Shrewsbury on 27 . Steel commenced his innings on the second morning and shared successful partnerships with Ulyett , Barlow and Lyttelton . While Steel was in , 261 runs were added and he made 148 including thirteen boundaries . It was the highest score made against the Australians during the season . By close of play , Australia had lost four wickets in their second innings for only 73 runs . Barlow later recorded that the score was 135 / 5 when he went out to join Steel and recalled Lord Harris , the England captain , saying to him : " For Heaven 's sake , Barlow , stop this rot ! " Barlow and Steel added 98 for the sixth wicket . Despite another good effort by Scott on the final day , Australia failed to avoid the innings defeat . Ulyett bowled very well but may have been helped by the state of the ground . However , Ulyett is best remembered in this match for taking what Pelham Warner called " one of the historic catches of cricket " when he caught and bowled Bonnor , noted for his powerful hitting . Warner recorded of Steel 's innings that George Giffen talked about it most enthusiastically as late as 1911 , when the two were in conversation at Adelaide . When Scott was dismissed for 75 in the Australian first innings , he was caught by his own captain Murdoch off the bowling of Steel . Murdoch was on as a substitute for an injured English player and this was the first time in Test cricket that a batsman was dismissed by a catch taken by a substitute fielder . 
 Soon afterwards , the London press reported that the entire proceeds of the match , a sum of £ 1 @,@ 334 , had been awarded to the Australians . This had been agreed beforehand by Alexander and Harris to enable the tourists to cover their costs , but the press disapproved and accused the Australians of being mercenary and acting outside the spirit of the game . Harte commented on the extreme bias of the press as , in all their other games , the Australians received only a share of the gate money , " an arrangement appreciated by the county clubs as the visitors ' popularity always boosted takings " . 
 = = = Third Test = = = 
 The final Test at the Oval was played in hot weather and Murdoch created a then @-@ record score of 211 , the first double @-@ century in Test cricket . Murdoch was helped by three missed chances off the bowling of Ulyett when he had made 46 , 171 and 205 . England followed on but had only lost two wickets when time ran out and the match was drawn . 
 After McDonnell had made 103 out of 158 , Murdoch and Scott completed the first double @-@ century partnership in Test cricket . England , as the score mounted , used 11 bowlers : the first time in Test cricket that an entire team including the wicketkeeper was called upon to bowl . On this occasion , the wicketkeeper Lyttelton was the most successful bowler , taking 4 / 19 . Grace , keeping wicket to Lyttelton , took a catch to dismiss Midwinter . 
 The two main features of England 's first innings were Scotton 's " stonewalling " and Read 's ( batting at number ten ) " hard and rapid hitting " . Scotton 's 90 in six hours and Read 's 117 in two enabled England to reach a respectable 346 but they still had to follow on , 205 runs behind . But the time taken by Scotton 's innings left Australia with not enough time to bowl England out again and the result was a draw . 
 = = Other matches = = 
 The tour began well for the Australians with an innings victory in their opening match at Uckfield against a team chosen by Lord Sheffield which included W. G. Grace , George Ulyett , Billy Barnes , Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury . Although Fred Spofforth , Harry Boyle and Billy Midwinter were all playing , the Australian bowling was performed by George Giffen and Joey Palmer only , and they both took ten wickets in the match . However , the key performance in conditions that helped the bowling was Alick Bannerman 's innings of 94 which alone outscored the Sheffield XI 's first innings total of 86 . 
 The Australians had mixed success in their next five matches , winning against Surrey and an All @-@ England XI but losing to Oxford , MCC and the Gentlemen . An innings of 71 by Tup Scott in a low @-@ scoring match was the key to defeating Surrey by 8 wickets . Centuries by Grace , A. G. Steel and Barnes gave MCC an innings victory at Lord 's and Warner described this feat as " remarkable " . 
 The next ten matches prior to the Old Trafford Test were played mainly in the north of England and the Australians did very well in this period , through June and into early July . They lost only to the North by an innings at Old Trafford when their batting struggled against Ted Peate and Ulyett while good scores by A. N. Hornby and Barnes ensured the North 's victory . Giffen had a memorable game when the Australians played Lancashire at Old Trafford , taking a hat trick in the Lancashire innings and then scoring 113 . That match was drawn but the Australians defeated both Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire by the same three @-@ wicket margin . Spofforth , Palmer , Peate and Tom Emmett dominated the match at Bradford in which only 255 runs were scored in total . At Trent Bridge , the bowling of Giffen and Palmer enabled the Australians to recover from a first innings deficit of 39 and win . In the return match against the Gentlemen at the Oval , the last three English batsmen including Lord Harris were all stumped by Jack Blackham . 
 Between the first and second Tests , the Australian victory over Middlesex , whose batting could not cope with Spofforth , was their only win in four matches at Lord 's . The Australians struggled in a drawn game against Sussex for whom George Wyatt and Henry Phillips both scored centuries . Spofforth with 14 wickets and George Bonnor with an innings of 68 in a low @-@ scoring match put the Australians back on track when they easily defeated a strong Players XI at the Oval . 
 An innings of 60 by Lord Harris helped Kent recover from a first innings deficit before the Australians , batting last , collapsed to lose by 96 runs at Canterbury . The first match against Gloucestershire was drawn , W. G. Grace scoring 116 not out for his county . The Australians won the second match convincingly with an innings total of 402 ( Giffen 91 , Billy Murdoch 89 ) before dismissing Gloucestershire for only 83 . This began a good finish to the tour as the Australians won five of the last seven matches following the third Test . They twice defeated the South by an innings , Spofforth taking a total of 24 wickets in these two matches , but were again beaten by the North , for whom Dick Barlow scored a century and took ten wickets in the match . 
 = = Statistical summary = = 
 Murdoch , Percy McDonnell and Giffen all scored 1 @,@ 000 runs for the Australians in the 1884 season while Scott , Bannerman and Bonnor topped 900 . Murdoch scored two centuries including his 211 at the Oval ; Giffen , McDonnell and Scott one apiece . The outstanding bowler , as on previous tours , was Spofforth who took 205 wickets for the Australians at an average of 12 @.@ 50 with a best performance of 8 / 62 . Palmer took 130 wickets at 16 @.@ 14 and the other main bowlers were Giffen ( 81 wickets ) and Boyle ( 62 ) . Midwinter took 15 wickets while the other players bowled occasionally only . Blackham was the wicket @-@ keeper in 28 out of the 31 first @-@ class matches , Murdoch standing in for him in the other three . Blackham held 23 catches and completed 16 stumpings . Eight fielders held more than twenty catches each , the most being Bonnor 's 31 . 
 Putting the Australian performances into perspective , only eight Englishmen made 1 @,@ 000 runs and only Harris scored more than Murdoch . Louis Hall with four completed the most centuries while Harris , Grace , Ulyett and Billy Bates made three apiece . Spofforth was easily the highest wicket @-@ taker , beating the best English bowler Ted Peate by 70 while Palmer was third overall . Seven other Englishmen managed 100 wickets in the season . 
 In his history , Harry Altham wrote that the 1884 Australians have been equated with the 1882 team but he himself disagreed with that assessment . He added that George Giffen considered England 's team in the final Test to have been the strongest of the nineteenth century . 
 = = Controversy and aftermath = = 
 The bad feeling about the proceeds from the Lord 's Test lingered and , at the end of their tour , the Fourth Australians faced more recriminations from the British press . Among other things , they were accused of " introducing a bloodthirsty spirit " and " playing too obviously for money 's sake " . This criticism was countered by The Australasian of 11 October , whose cricket writer Tom Horan , though himself no supporter of Murdoch 's team , objected to the " spiteful criticism from certain portions of the English press " and pointed out the " narrow @-@ minded and insulting abuse levelled at the Australian cricketers " . However , in his history of Lord 's , Warner stated that the Australians had " evidently come into favour " and that " the rows and <unk> of the past were happily over and done with " . 
 The problems spilled over into the next Australian season when an English team formed by Alfred Shaw , James Lillywhite and Arthur Shrewsbury toured . A disagreement between Alexander and Lillywhite led to members of the Fourth Australians refusing to play against the tourists in certain matches and then being banned by the colonial authorities from playing in others . Having agreed contracts for matches with the colonial authorities , Lillywhite offered Alexander 30 % of the gate receipts from the first two Tests , but Murdoch and the rest of the team insisted on 50 % . One outcome was that Australia had to make eleven changes to their team for the second Test after terms could not be agreed with the Fourth Australians . The Fourth Australians had made up the team in the first Test but refused to play in the second Test in which nine debutants were necessary alongside Tom Horan and Sammy Jones . 
 When the Fifth Australians toured England in 1886 , the team was selected and managed by the Melbourne Club which was mindful of the past controversy . As a result , Murdoch , McDonnell and Bannerman were omitted despite still being leading batsmen . Boyle was unavailable , as were Horan and Massie who had toured in 1882 , while Alexander , Cooper and Midwinter were no longer in contention for places . Scott was appointed captain and the other survivors of 1884 were Blackham , Bonnor , Giffen , Palmer and Spofforth . 
 = Appaloosa = 
 The Appaloosa is an American horse breed best known for its colorful spotted coat pattern . There is a wide range of body types within the breed , stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history . Each horse 's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors . The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics , as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation ( LP ) . Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness ; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex . 
 Artwork depicting prehistoric horses with leopard spotting exists in prehistoric cave paintings in Europe . Images of domesticated horses with leopard spotting patterns appeared in artwork from Ancient Greece and Han dynasty China through the early modern period ; the Nez Perce people of what today is the United States Pacific Northwest developed the original American breed . Appaloosas were once referred to by settlers as the " Palouse horse " , possibly after the Palouse River , which ran through the heart of Nez Perce country . Gradually , the name evolved into " Appaloosa " . 
 The Nez Perce lost most of their horses after the Nez Perce War in 1877 , and the breed fell into decline for several decades . A small number of dedicated breeders preserved the Appaloosa as a distinct breed until the Appaloosa Horse Club ( ApHC ) was formed as the breed registry in 1938 . The modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing to the foundation bloodstock of the registry ; its partially open stud book allows the addition of some Thoroughbred , American Quarter Horse and Arabian blood . 
 Today , the Appaloosa is one of the most popular breeds in the United States ; it was named the official state horse of Idaho in 1975 . It is best known as a stock horse used in a number of western riding disciplines , but is also a versatile breed with representatives seen in many other types of equestrian activity . Appaloosas have been used in many movies ; an Appaloosa is the mascot for the Florida State Seminoles . Appaloosa bloodlines have influenced other horse breeds , including the Pony of the Americas , the Nez Perce Horse , and several gaited horse breeds . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 The Appaloosa is best known for its distinctive , preferred leopard complex spotted coat . Spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized base coat colors . There are three other distinctive , " core " characteristics : mottled skin , striped hooves , and eyes with a white sclera . Skin mottling is usually seen around the muzzle , eyes , anus , and genitalia . Striped hooves are a common trait , quite noticeable on Appaloosas , but not unique to the breed . The sclera is the part of the eye surrounding the iris ; although all horses show white around the eye if the eye is rolled back , to have a readily visible white sclera with the eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds . Because the occasional individual is born with little or no visible spotting pattern , the ApHC allows " regular " registration of horses with mottled skin plus at least one of the other core characteristics . Horses with two ApHC parents but no " identifiable Appaloosa characteristics " are registered as " non @-@ characteristic , " a limited special registration status . 
 There is a wide range of body types in the Appaloosa , in part because the leopard complex characteristics are its primary identifying factors , and also because several different horse breeds influenced its development . The weight range varies from 950 to 1 @,@ 250 pounds ( 430 to 570 kg ) , and heights from 14 to 16 hands ( 56 to 64 inches , 142 to 163 cm ) . However , the ApHC does not allow pony or draft breeding . 
 The original " old time " or " old type " Appaloosa was a tall , narrow @-@ bodied , rangy horse . The body style reflected a mix that started with the traditional Spanish horses already common on the plains of America before 1700 . Then , 18th @-@ century European bloodlines were added , particularly those of the " pied " horses popular in that period and shipped en masse to the Americas once the color had become unfashionable in Europe . These horses were similar to a tall , slim Thoroughbred @-@ Andalusian type of horse popular in Bourbon @-@ era Spain . The original Appaloosa tended to have a convex facial profile that resembled that of the warmblood @-@ Jennet crosses first developed in the 16th century during the reign of Charles V. The old @-@ type Appaloosa was later modified by the addition of draft horse blood after the 1877 defeat of the Nez Perce , when U.S. Government policy forced the Indians to become farmers and provided them with draft horse mares to breed to existing stallions . The original Appaloosas frequently had a sparse mane and tail , but that was not a primary characteristic as many early Appaloosas did have full manes and tails . There is a possible genetic link between the leopard complex and sparse mane and tail growth , although the precise relationship is unknown . 
 After the formation of the Appaloosa Horse Club in 1938 , a more modern type developed after the addition of American Quarter Horse and Arabian bloodlines . The addition of Quarter Horse lines produced Appaloosas that performed better in sprint racing and in halter competition . Many cutting and reining horses resulted from old @-@ type Appaloosas crossed on Arabian bloodlines , particularly via the Appaloosa foundation stallion Red Eagle . An infusion of Thoroughbred blood was added during the 1970s to produce horses more suited for racing . Many current breeders also attempt to breed away from the sparse , " rat tail " trait , and therefore modern Appaloosas have fuller manes and tails . 
 = = Color and spotting patterns = = 
 The coat color of an Appaloosa is a combination of a base color with an overlaid spotting pattern . The base colors recognized by the Appaloosa Horse Club include bay , black , chestnut , palomino , buckskin , cremello or <unk> , roan , gray , dun and <unk> . Appaloosa markings have several pattern variations . It is this unique group of spotting patterns , collectively called the " leopard complex " , that most people associate with the Appaloosa horse . Spots overlay darker skin , and are often surrounded by a " halo " , where the skin next to the spot is also dark but the overlying hair coat is white . 
 It is not always easy to predict a grown Appaloosa 's color at birth . Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair . In addition , Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics . Patterns sometimes change over the course of the horse 's life although some , such as the blanket and leopard patterns , tend to be stable . Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth , developing more visible spotting as they get older . 
 The ApHC also recognizes the concept of a " solid " horse , which has a base color " but no contrasting color in the form of an Appaloosa coat pattern " . Solid horses can be registered if they have mottled skin and one other leopard complex characteristic . 
 Base colors are overlain by various spotting patterns , which are variable and often do not fit neatly into a specific category . These patterns are described as follows : 
 = = = Color genetics = = = 
 Any horse that shows Appaloosa core characteristics of coat pattern , mottled skin , striped hooves , and a visible white sclera , carries at least one allele of the dominant " leopard complex " ( LP ) gene . The use of the word " complex " is used to refer to the large group of visible patterns that may occur when LP is present . LP is an autosomal incomplete dominant mutation in the TRPM1 gene located at horse chromosome 1 ( ECA 1 ) . All horses with at least one copy of LP show leopard characteristics , and it is hypothesized that LP acts together with other patterning genes ( <unk> ) that have not yet been identified to produce the different coat patterns . Horses that are heterozygous for LP tend to be darker than homozygous horses , but this is not consistent . 
 Three single @-@ nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the TRPM1 gene have been identified as closely associated with the LP mutation , although the mechanism by which the pattern is produced remains unclear . A commercially available DNA based test is likely to be developed in the near future , which breeders can use to determine if LP is present in horses that do not have visible Appaloosa characteristics . 
 Not every Appaloosa exhibits visible coat spotting , but even apparently solid @-@ colored horses that carry at least one dominant LP allele will exhibit characteristics such as vertically striped hooves , white sclera of the eye , and mottled skin around the eyes , lips , and genitalia . Appaloosas may also exhibit sabino or pinto type markings , but because pinto genes may cover @-@ up or obscure Appaloosa patterns , pinto breeding is discouraged by the ApHC , which will deny registration to horses with excessive white markings . The genes that create these different patterns can all be present in the same horse . The Appaloosa Project , a genetic study group , has researched the interactions of Appaloosa and pinto genes and how they affect each other . 
 = = History = = 
 Recent research has suggested that Eurasian prehistoric cave paintings depicting leopard @-@ spotted horses may have accurately reflected a phenotype of ancient wild horse . Domesticated horses with leopard complex spotting patterns have been depicted in art dating as far back as Ancient Greece , Ancient Persia , and the Han Dynasty in China ; later depictions appeared in 11th @-@ century France and 12th @-@ century England . French paintings from the 16th and 17th centuries show horses with spotted coats being used as riding horses , and other records indicate they were also used as coach horses at the court of Louis XIV of France . In mid @-@ 18th @-@ century Europe , there was a great demand for horses with the leopard complex spotting pattern among the nobility and royalty . These horses were used in the schools of horsemanship , for parade use , and other forms of display . Modern horse breeds in Europe today that have leopard complex spotting include the Knabstrupper and the <unk> , or Noriker horse . 
 The Spanish probably obtained spotted horses through trade with southern Austria and Hungary , where the color pattern was known to exist . The Conquistadors and Spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses to the Americas when they first arrived in the early 16th century . One horse with snowflake patterning was listed with the 16 horses brought to Mexico by Cortez , and additional spotted horses were mentioned by Spanish writers by 1604 . Others arrived in the western hemisphere when spotted horses went out of style in late 18th @-@ century Europe , and were shipped to Mexico , California and Oregon . 
 = = = Nez Perce people = = = 
 The Nez Perce people lived in what today is eastern Washington , Oregon , and western Idaho , where they engaged in agriculture as well as horse breeding . The Nez Perce first obtained horses from the Shoshone around 1730 . They took advantage of the fact that they lived in excellent horse @-@ breeding country , relatively safe from the raids of other tribes , and developed strict breeding selection practices for their animals , establishing breeding herds by 1750 . They were one of the few tribes that actively used the practice of gelding inferior male horses and trading away poorer stock to remove unsuitable animals from the gene pool , and thus were notable as horse breeders by the early 19th century . 
 Early Nez Perce horses were considered to be of high quality . Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition wrote in his February 15 , 1806 , journal entry : " Their horses appear to be of an excellent race ; they are lofty , <unk> [ sic ] formed , active and durable : in short many of them look like fine English <unk> [ sic ] and would make a figure in any country . " Lewis did note spotting patterns , saying , " ... some of these horses are <unk> [ pied ] with large spots of white irregularly scattered and intermixed with the black brown bey [ sic ] or some other dark colour " . By " pied " , Lewis may have been referring to leopard @-@ spotted patterns seen in the modern Appaloosa , though Lewis also noted that " much the larger portion are of a uniform colour " . The Appaloosa Horse Club estimates that only about ten percent of the horses owned by the Nez Perce at the time were spotted . While the Nez Perce originally had many solid @-@ colored horses and only began to emphasize color in their breeding some time after the visit of Lewis and Clark , by the late 19th century they had many spotted horses . As white settlers moved into traditional Nez Perce lands , a successful trade in horses enriched the Nez Perce , who in 1861 bred horses described as " elegant chargers , fit to mount a prince . " At a time when ordinary horses could be purchased for $ 15 , non @-@ Indians who had purchased Appaloosa horses from the Nez Perce turned down offers of as much as $ 600 . 
 = = = Nez Perce War = = = 
 Peace with the United States dated back to an alliance arranged by Lewis and Clark , but the encroachment of gold miners in the 1860s and settlers in the 1870s put pressure on the Nez Perce . Although a treaty of 1855 originally allowed them to keep most of their traditional land , another in 1863 reduced the land allotted to them by 90 percent . The Nez Perce who refused to give up their land under the 1863 treaty included a band living in the Wallowa Valley of Oregon , led by <unk> <unk> , widely known as Chief Joseph . Tensions rose , and in May 1877 , General Oliver Howard called a council and ordered the non @-@ treaty bands to move to the reservation . Chief Joseph considered military resistance futile , and by June 14 , 1877 , had gathered about 600 people at a site near present @-@ day Grangeville , Idaho . But on that day a small group of warriors staged an attack on nearby white settlers , which led to the Nez Perce War . After several small battles in Idaho , more than 800 Nez Perce , mostly non @-@ warriors , took 2000 head of various livestock including horses and fled into Montana , then traveled southeast , dipping into Yellowstone National Park . A small number of Nez Perce fighters , probably fewer than 200 , successfully held off larger forces of the U.S. Army in several skirmishes , including the two @-@ day Battle of the Big Hole in southwestern Montana . They then moved northeast and attempted to seek refuge with the Crow Nation ; rebuffed , they headed for safety in Canada . 
 Throughout this journey of about 1 @,@ 400 miles ( 2 @,@ 300 km ) the Nez Perce relied heavily on their fast , agile and hardy Appaloosa horses . The journey came to an end when they stopped to rest near the Bears Paw Mountains in Montana , 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the Canadian border . Unbeknownst to the Nez Perce , Colonel Nelson A. Miles had led an infantry @-@ cavalry column from Fort Keogh in pursuit . On October 5 , 1877 , after a five @-@ day fight , Joseph surrendered . The battle — and the war — was over . With most of the war chiefs dead , and the noncombatants cold and starving , Joseph declared that he would " fight no more forever " . 
 = = = Aftermath of the Nez Perce War = = = 
 When the U.S. 7th Cavalry accepted the surrender of Chief Joseph and the remaining Nez Perce , they immediately took more than 1 @,@ 000 of the tribe 's horses , sold what they could and shot many of the rest . But a significant population of horses had been left behind in the Wallowa valley when the Nez Perce began their retreat , and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along the way . The Nez Perce were ultimately settled on reservation lands in north central Idaho , were allowed few horses , and were required by the Army to crossbreed to draft horses in an attempt to create farm horses . The Nez Perce tribe never regained its former position as breeders of Appaloosas . In the late 20th century , they began a program to develop a new horse breed , the Nez Perce horse , with the intent to resurrect their horse culture , tradition of selective breeding , and horsemanship . 
 Although a remnant population of Appaloosa horses remained after 1877 , they were virtually forgotten as a distinct breed for almost 60 years . A few quality horses continued to be bred , mostly those captured or purchased by settlers and used as working ranch horses . Others were used in circuses and related forms of entertainment , such as Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show . The horses were originally called " Palouse horses " by settlers , a reference to the Palouse River that ran through the heart of what was once Nez Perce country . Gradually , the name evolved into " <unk> " , and then " Appaloosa " . Other early variations of the name included " <unk> " , " <unk> " and " <unk> " . In one 1948 book , the breed was called the " <unk> horse " , described as a " hardy tough breed of Indian and Spanish horse " used by backwoodsmen of the late 18th century to transport goods to New Orleans for sale . By the 1950s , " Appaloosa " was regarded as the correct spelling . 
 = = = Revitalization = = = 
 The Appaloosa came to the attention of the general public in January 1937 in Western Horseman magazine when Francis D. Haines , a history professor from Lewiston , Idaho , published an article describing the breed 's history and urging its preservation . Haines had performed extensive research , traveling with a friend and Appaloosa aficionado named George Hatley , visiting numerous Nez Perce villages , collecting history , and taking photographs . The article generated strong interest in the horse breed , and led to the founding of the Appaloosa Horse Club ( ApHC ) by Claude Thompson and a small group of other dedicated breeders in 1938 . The registry was originally housed in Moro , Oregon ; but in 1947 the organization moved to Moscow , Idaho , under the leadership of George Hatley . The Appaloosa Museum foundation was formed in 1975 to preserve the history of the Appaloosa horse . The Western Horseman magazine , and particularly its longtime publisher , Dick Spencer , continued to support and promote the breed through many subsequent articles . 
 A significant crossbreeding influence used to revitalize the Appaloosa was the Arabian horse , as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian @-@ Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC . For example , one of Claude Thompson 's major herd sires was Ferras , an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England . Ferras sired Red Eagle , a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988 . Later , Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse lines were added , as well as crosses from other breeds , including Morgans and Standardbreds . In 1983 the ApHC reduced the number of allowable <unk> to three main breeds : the Arabian horse , the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred . 
 By 1978 the ApHC was the third largest horse registry for light horse breeds . From 1938 to 2007 more than 670 @,@ 000 Appaloosas were registered by the ApHC . The state of Idaho adopted the Appaloosa as its official state horse on March 25 , 1975 , when Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus signed the enabling legislation . Idaho offers a custom license plate featuring an Appaloosa horse , the first state to offer a plate featuring a state horse . 
 = = Registration = = 
 Located in Moscow , Idaho , the ApHC is the principal body for the promotion and preservation of the Appaloosa breed and is an international organization . Affiliate Appaloosa organizations exist in many South American and European countries , as well as South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , Canada , Mexico and Israel . The Appaloosa Horse Club has 33 @,@ 000 members as of 2010 , circulation of the Appaloosa Journal , which is included with most types of membership , was at 32 , ; 00 in 2008 . The American Appaloosa Association was founded in 1983 by members opposed to the registration of plain @-@ colored horses , as a result of the color rule controversy . Based in Missouri , it has a membership of more than 2 @,@ 000 as of 2008 . Other " Appaloosa " registries have been founded for horses with leopard complex genetics that are not affiliated with the ApHC . These registries tend to have different foundation breeding and histories than the North American Appaloosa . The ApHC is by far the largest Appaloosa horse registry , and it hosts one of the world 's largest breed shows . 
 The Appaloosa is " a breed defined by ApHC bloodline requirements and preferred characteristics , including coat pattern " . In other words , the Appaloosa is a distinct breed from limited bloodlines with distinct physical traits and a desired color , referred to as a " color preference " . Appaloosas are not strictly a " color breed " . All ApHC @-@ registered Appaloosas must be the offspring of two registered Appaloosa parents or a registered Appaloosa and a horse from an approved breed registry , which includes Arabian horses , Quarter Horses , and Thoroughbreds . In all cases , one parent must always be a regular registered Appaloosa . The only exception to the bloodline requirements is in the case of Appaloosa @-@ colored geldings or spayed mares with unknown pedigrees ; owners may apply for " hardship registration " for these non @-@ breeding horses . The ApHC does not accept horses with draft , pony , Pinto , or Paint breeding , and requires mature Appaloosas to stand , <unk> , at least 14 hands ( 56 inches , 142 cm ) . If a horse has excessive white markings not associated with the Appaloosa pattern ( such as those characteristic of a pinto ) it cannot be registered unless it is verified through DNA testing that both parents have ApHC registration . 
 Certain other characteristics are used to determine if a horse receives " regular " registration : striped hooves , white sclera visible when the eye is in a normal position , and mottled ( spotted ) skin around the eyes , lips , and genitalia . As the Appaloosa is one of the few horse breeds to exhibit skin mottling , this characteristic " ... is a very basic and decisive indication of an Appaloosa . " Appaloosas born with visible coat pattern , or mottled skin and at least one other characteristic , are registered with " regular " papers and have full show and breeding privileges . A horse that meets bloodline requirements but is born without the recognized color pattern and characteristics can still be registered with the ApHC as a " non @-@ characteristic " Appaloosa . These solid @-@ colored , " non @-@ characteristic " Appaloosas may not be shown at ApHC events unless the owner verifies the parentage through DNA testing and pays a supplementary fee to enter the horse into the ApHC 's Performance Permit Program ( PPP ) . Solid @-@ colored Appaloosas are restricted in breeding . 
 = = = Color rule controversy = = = 
 During the 1940s and 1950s , when both the Appaloosa Horse Club ( ApHC ) and the American Quarter Horse Association ( AQHA ) were in their formative years , minimally marked or roan Appaloosas were sometimes used in Quarter Horse breeding programs . At the same time , it was noted that two solid @-@ colored registered Quarter Horse parents would sometimes produce what Quarter Horse aficionados call a " cropout " , a foal with white coloration similar to that of an Appaloosa or Pinto . For a considerable time , until DNA testing could verify parentage , the AQHA refused to register such horses . The ApHC did accept cropout horses that exhibited proper Appaloosa traits , while cropout <unk> became the core of the American Paint Horse Association . Famous Appaloosas who were <unk> included <unk> , Joker B , Bright Eyes Brother and Wapiti . 
 In the late 1970s , the color controversy went in the opposite direction within the Appaloosa registry . The ApHC 's decision in 1982 to allow solid @-@ colored or " non @-@ characteristic " Appaloosas to be registered resulted in substantial debate within the Appaloosa breeding community . Until then , a foal of Appaloosa parents that had insufficient color was often denied registration , although non @-@ characteristic Appaloosas were allowed into the registry . But breeder experience had shown that some solid Appaloosas could throw a spotted foal in a subsequent generation , at least when bred to a spotted Appaloosa . In addition , many horses with a solid coat exhibited secondary characteristics such as skin mottling , the white sclera , and striped hooves . The controversy stirred by the ApHC 's decision was intense . In 1983 a number of Appaloosa breeders opposed to the registration of solid @-@ colored horses formed the American Appaloosa Association , a breakaway organization . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Appaloosas are used extensively for both Western and English riding . Western competitions include cutting , reining , roping and O @-@ Mok @-@ See sports such as barrel racing ( known as the Camas Prairie Stump Race in Appaloosa @-@ only competition ) and pole bending ( called the Nez <unk> Stake Race at breed shows ) . English disciplines they are used in include eventing , show jumping , and fox hunting . They are common in endurance riding competitions , as well as in casual trail riding . Appaloosas are also bred for horse racing , with an active breed racing association promoting the sport . They are generally used for middle @-@ distance racing at distances between 350 yards ( 320 m ) and 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) ; an Appaloosa holds the all @-@ breed record for the 4 @.@ 5 furlongs ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ; 910 m ) distance , set in 1989 . 
 Appaloosas are often used in Western movies and television series . Examples include " <unk> Rojo " in the Marlon Brando film The Appaloosa , " Zip Cochise " ridden by John Wayne in the 1966 film El Dorado and " Cowboy " , the mount of Matt Damon in True Grit . An Appaloosa horse is part of the controversial mascot team for the Florida State Seminoles , Chief Osceola and Renegade , even though the Seminole people were not directly associated with Appaloosa horses . 
 = = = Influence = = = 
 There are several American horse breeds with leopard coloring and Appaloosa ancestry . These include the Pony of the Americas and the Colorado Ranger . Appaloosas are crossbred with gaited horse breeds in an attempt to create a leopard @-@ spotted ambling horse . Because such crossbred offspring are not eligible for ApHC registration , their owners have formed breed registries for horses with leopard complex patterns and gaited ability . In 1995 the Nez Perce tribe began a program to develop a new and distinct horse breed , the Nez Perce Horse , based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa with the Akhal @-@ Teke breed from Central Asia . Appaloosa stallions have been exported to Denmark , to add new blood to the <unk> breed . 
 = = Health issues = = 
 = = = Genetically linked blindness = = = 
 Appaloosas have an eightfold greater risk of developing Equine Recurrent <unk> ( ERU ) than all other breeds combined . Up to 25 percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas . <unk> in horses has many causes , including eye trauma , disease , and bacterial , parasitic and viral infections , but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis , rather than a single incident . If not treated , ERU can lead to blindness , which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds . Eighty percent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light @-@ colored coat patterns , little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at @-@ risk individuals . Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease . 
 Appaloosas that are homozygous for the leopard complex ( LP ) gene are also at risk for congenital stationary night blindness ( CSNB ) . This form of night blindness has been linked with the leopard complex since the 1970s , and in 2007 a " significant association " between LP and CSNB was identified . CSNB is a disorder that causes an affected animal to lack night vision , although day vision is normal . It is an inherited disorder , present from birth , and does not progress over time . Studies in 2008 and 2010 indicate that both CSNB and leopard complex spotting patterns are linked to TRPM1 . 
 = = = Drug rules = = = 
 In 2007 the ApHC implemented new drug rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide , known by the trade name of Lasix , and acetazolamide . Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition , and is widely used in horse racing . Acetazolamide ( " <unk> " ) is used for treating horses with the genetic disease <unk> periodic paralysis ( HYPP ) , and prevents affected animals from having seizures . <unk> is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers . The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP , and owners have the option to choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers . Foals of AQHA @-@ registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1 , 2007 that carry HYPP will be required to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers . 
 Both drugs are controversial , in part because they are considered drug <unk> and diuretics that can make it difficult to detect the presence of other drugs in the horse 's system . On one side , it is argued that the United States Equestrian Federation ( USEF ) , which sponsors show competition for many different horse breeds , and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports ( FEI ) , which governs international and Olympic equestrian competition , ban the use of furosemide . On the other side of the controversy , several major stock horse registries that sanction their own shows , including the American Quarter Horse Association , American Paint Horse Association , and the Palomino Horse Breeders of America , allow acetazolamide and furosemide to be used within 24 hours of showing under certain circumstances . 
 = Abantiades latipennis = 
 Abantiades latipennis , known as the Pindi moth , is a species of moth in the Hepialidae family . It may also be referred to as a swift moth or a ghost moth , as this is a common name associated with Hepialidae . Endemic to Australia and identified in 1932 , it is most populous in temperate rainforest where <unk> are prevalent , as the larvae feed primarily on the roots of these trees . Females lay eggs during flight in a scattering fashion . The larvae live for over eighteen months underground , while adult moths survive for approximately one week , as they have no mouthparts with which to feed . The moths are preyed upon by a number of predators , including bats and owls . Brown in colour overall , males are paler and the identifying silver bars of the male 's wings are more prominent than those of the female 's , with dark margins . Male adults are generally smaller . 
 Established clearfelling practices have been shown to favour the Pindi moth , and could lead to it being considered a pest due to opportunistic proliferation of the species . The resulting damage caused to the trees on which it feeds may be considered significant . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 Abantiades latipennis is one of fourteen species currently identified within the genus Abantiades , all of which are found exclusively in Australia . The species was first described in 1932 by Norman Tindale , an Australian entomologist and anthropologist . Tindale described the species , under its current name , but provided no etymology for the specific epithet latipennis . He based the species description on specimens from Lorne ( including the holotype male and <unk> female ) , <unk> and Mount Mistake ( in the <unk> <unk> State Park ) , Victoria , and from <unk> , <unk> Neck and Launceston , Tasmania . 
 Being a member of the <unk> family , A. latipennis is considered phylogenetically primitive , possessing several features that are indicative of earlier evolutionary development . The jugum on the forewings of the adult is an archaic wing coupling mechanism ; further primitive characteristics include , as adults , the lack of mouthparts , large spacing between the fore- and hindwings , and the arrangement of the female genitalia . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 A. latipennis is endemic to the Australasian region . More specifically , the moths inhabit New South Wales , Tasmania , Victoria , and Australian Capital Territory . As with other Abantiades species , the moth 's habitat is temperate rainforest , both primary and secondary . During its larval stage , the moth feeds on the roots of trees , and its prospering is thought to have an economic impact on the timber industry . 
 = = Life cycle and behaviour = = 
 Female moths " lay " their eggs by scattering them during flight ; up to 10 @,@ 000 eggs are released at once . Larvae then hatch from the eggs in the leaf litter on the forest floor and begin tunnelling , in search of suitable host roots . The number of instars and the period of the larval stage is yet unknown , with field observations suggesting a larval stage of more than eighteen months . 
 The phytophagous larvae of A. latipennis feed primarily on the root systems of two species of tree , Eucalyptus obliqua ( messmate stringybark ) and Eucalyptus regnans ( mountain ash ) . Both of these species are present in old growth forests and dominant in regrowth forests , contributing to the moth 's success in its own habitat . Forming simple and vertical tunnels , lined with silk , the caterpillars are subterranean before and during pupation , emerging for their metamorphosis . The tunnel entrances , 6 to 10 millimetres in diameter , are covered with silk webbing and leaf litter , and can be up to 60 centimetres ( 2 ft ) deep , although depth is more usually 12 to 35 cm . 
 By chewing the tap and lateral roots of trees , caterpillars feed on the cambium growth , produced by the tree at the site of the injury . The larvae may girdle a root , thereby causing its death , or the lesions may be only partial , allowing the root to continue functioning , albeit with some deformity . 
 The subterranean habitat of the larvae generally provides protection from predation , but the larvae are sometimes parasitised by <unk> flies . The parasitoid larvae of the tachinid <unk> <unk> , usually hosted by scarab beetles , have been discovered infecting A. latipennis . 
 Adult A. latipennis are crepuscular and males are strongly attracted to lights , forming leks at dusk , most notably after rains in autumn and late summer . Females use pheromones to attract males for mating . As a primitive species , they lack mouthparts as adults and are therefore unable to feed . Their lifespan as winged creatures is understandably short , lasting approximately a week , barring predation . Predation is commonly by bats , owls , and possums , though several other animals , from spiders to cats , occasionally consume them and contribute to the brief lifespan of the metamorphosed moths . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 As part of a study measuring the impact that the practice of clearfelling has on biodiversity in the Weld Valley of Tasmania , it was found that A. latipennis was one of the few species that thrived in regrowth forests that were previously clearfelled . An earlier study , conducted in other regions of southern Tasmania , examined the relationship between the moth and Eucalyptus regnans and E. obliqua and reached the same conclusion . The tunnelling and feeding habit of A. latipennis larvae on the roots of these two eucalypt species is mostly responsible for its abundance in clearfelled forests , as the trees are the typical regrowth of logged areas . This success may also be due in part to the caterpillar 's lack of dependence on decaying vegetation , a characteristic of the Abantiades genus and dissimilar to other Tasmanian genera — such as <unk> and Barea — that have not fared as well in clearfelled forest . 
 The crowns of the eucalypts infected by A. latipennis have exhibited no consistent indication of root disturbance , with most trees studied appearing healthy and of average size for secondary forest . E. regnans and E. obliqua have demonstrated slow growth in regrowth stands , but this tendency has been attributed to significant root and crown competition . Some trees appeared chlorotic ( a yellowing effect in plants , caused by a reduction in chlorophyll ) , but this was not a reliable indicator of root infestation , and may be the result of other influences . Well @-@ established clearfelling practices in Tasmania could exacerbate the favouring of this species , and its proliferation could lead to extensive eucalypt damage and pest concerns , though the potential effect of this threat is as yet undetermined . 
 Lesions on the roots caused by the larval feeding provide ideal sites for the establishment of root rot @-@ causing fungi , once the larvae depart the root system for pupation . Areas on the roots with past feeding damage were found to have Armillaria sp. flourishing in the lesions . In rarer cases , the pathogen <unk> medulla @-@ <unk> was also found attacking the roots at the damaged locations . Other cases of decay and discolouration were noted , but attributed to unidentified microorganisms .

 A. latipennis larvae vary in size and colour during growth , but can be grouped small and large . The small caterpillars are generally 12 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 47 inches ) long and an overall milky grey , with a light brown head capsule that is about 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) wide . Large caterpillars may be milky grey or a dark green @-@ brown , 60 to 90 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 5 in ) long , with a 6 to 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 to 0 @.@ 35 in ) wide brown head capsule . 
 Females are larger than males , with the wingspan of the male adult approximately 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) . A female specimen collected in 1979 had a wingspan of 108 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) , but Tindale recorded female wingspans at 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in 1932 . The forewings of both males and females feature silvery @-@ white bars , although the bars of the male moth 's wings are more prominent and with dark margins . The female 's body colour is usually a darker brown than the male 's pale brown , as noted by Tindale , although a grey @-@ brown female was collected in 1979 . 
 Hepialidae have short , pectinate antennae and , unusually primitive for Lepidoptera , lack a functional proboscis or retinaculum and are therefore non @-@ feeding . The moths possess several other morphological features that are considered phylogenetically primitive . The gap between the fore- and hindwing is distinct and the wings are covered in scale @-@ like hairs . At the base of the forewing is a jugum , a small lobe that joins the fore- and hindwings during flight . In females , the configuration of the genitalia is exoporian , typified by an external groove along which spermatophores are transferred after mating , from the copulatory opening ( the ostium bursae ) , to the ovipore for fertilisation . 
 = Bayan @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Bayan class was a group of four armored cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy around the beginning of the 20th century . Two of the ships were built in France , as Russian shipyards had no spare capacity . The lead ship , Bayan , was built several years earlier than the later three . The ship participated in several of the early naval battles of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 , and provided naval gunfire support for the Imperial Russian Army until she struck a mine . Bayan was trapped in harbor during the subsequent Siege of Port Arthur , and was sunk by Japanese artillery . She was salvaged and put into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy with the name of Aso . She mostly served as a training ship before she was converted into a minelayer in 1920 . The ship was sunk as a target in 1932 . 
 Her three sisters were all assigned to the Baltic Fleet . Pallada was the first ship lost by the Russians during World War I when she was sunk by a German submarine in October 1914 . The two surviving ships were modified to lay mines , and participated in the Battle of Åland Islands in 1915 and the German invasion of the Estonian islands in 1917 . They were decommissioned in 1918 and sold for scrap in 1922 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Bayan class marked a departure from the previous Russian armored cruisers , as they were smaller ships designed to serve as scouts for the fleet rather than as commerce raiders . Authorized in the 1896 – 1902 building program , the design was outsourced to a French shipyard , Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée , because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity . Negotiations began in March 1897 , and a contract was signed in May 1898 for one ship with delivery in 36 months . 
 The Navy was reasonably pleased with the first ship , Bayan , and decided to order another cruiser after the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in February 1904 . Russian shipyards were still unavailable , so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war experience . This was an attempt to minimize the work load on the Naval Technical Committee ( <unk> <unk> komitet ) , but they proved to require more attention than planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905 . The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg , using newly available slipways . These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate , although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Bayan @-@ class ships were 449 feet 7 inches ( 137 @.@ 0 m ) long overall and 443 feet ( 135 @.@ 0 m ) between perpendiculars . They had a maximum beam of 57 feet 6 inches ( 17 @.@ 5 m ) , a draft of 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) and displaced 7 @,@ 750 – 7 @,@ 802 long tons ( 7 @,@ 874 – 7 @,@ 927 t ) . The ships had a crew of 573 officers and men . 
 They had two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft , using steam provided by 26 Belleville boilers . Designed for a total of 16 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 304 kW ) intended to propel the cruisers at 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) , the engines actually developed 17 @,@ 400 – 19 @,@ 320 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 980 – 14 @,@ 410 kW ) during their sea trials and drove the ships to maximum speeds of 20 @.@ 9 – 22 @.@ 55 knots ( 38 @.@ 71 – 41 @.@ 76 km / h ; 24 @.@ 05 – 25 @.@ 95 mph ) . They could carry a maximum of 1 @,@ 100 – 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 1 @,@ 118 – 1 @,@ 219 t ) of coal , which gave the first Bayan a range of 3 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 200 km ; 4 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) .

 The main armament of the Bayan @-@ class ships consisted of two 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) 45 @-@ caliber guns in single @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The guns fired a 194 @-@ pound ( 87 @.@ 8 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 920 ft / s ( 891 m / s ) . At an elevation of + 15 ° , they had a range of 12 @,@ 208 yards ( 11 @,@ 163 m ) . The ships ' eight 45 @-@ caliber 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Canet Model 1891 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns were mounted in casemates on the sides of the ship 's hull . They fired shells that weighed 91 pounds ( 41 @.@ 4 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 792 @.@ 5 m / s ) . They had a range of 12 @,@ 602 yards ( 11 @,@ 523 m ) when fired at an elevation of + 20 ° . 
 A number of smaller guns were carried for close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . These included twenty 50 @-@ caliber 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) Canet Model 1891 QF guns . Eight of these were mounted in casemates in the side of the hull and in the superstructure . The remaining guns were located above the 6 @-@ inch gun casemates in pivot mounts with gun shields . The gun fired 10 @.@ 8 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 91 kg ) shells to a range of about 8 @,@ 606 yards ( 7 @,@ 869 m ) , at an elevation of + 20 ° degrees with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 830 ft / s ( 862 m / s ) . The Bayan class also mounted eight ( Bayan ) or four 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns in the three later ships . They fired a 3 @.@ 2 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) shell . In addition , Bayan was fitted with two 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns that fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 540 ft / s ( 470 m / s ) .

 Bayan was assigned to the First Pacific Squadron after completion , and based at Port Arthur from the end of 1903 . She suffered minor damage during the Battle of Port Arthur at the beginning of the Russo @-@ Japanese War and participated in the action of 13 April 1904 , when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov 's flagship , the battleship Petropavlovsk . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships , he turned back for Port Arthur , and Petropavlovsk struck a minefield and quickly sank after a mine detonated one of her magazines . After bombarding Imperial Japanese Army positions on 27 July , Bayan struck a mine and was under repair for the next month or so . She was subsequently trapped in Port Arthur and sunk at her mooring by Japanese howitzer shells on 8 December . 
 The ship was refloated by Japanese engineers the following year ; repairs , re @-@ <unk> , and the replacement of her armament with Japanese weapons took until 1908 to complete . Renamed Aso in Japanese service , she initially served as a training ship before she was converted into a minelayer in 1920 . Aso was decommissioned on 1 April 1930 and renamed Hai Kan No. 4 . She was sunk as a target on 4 August 1932 by two submarine torpedoes . 
 All three of the later ships were assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion , although Admiral Makarov was detached to the Mediterranean several times before the start of World War I in 1914 . During the first month of the war , Pallada captured codebooks from the German cruiser Magdeburg that had run aground . She was torpedoed by the German submarine SM U @-@ 26 on 11 October 1914 and was lost with all hands . Her wreck was discovered in 2000 . 
 The surviving sisters were modified to lay mines shortly after the war began . They laid mines themselves during the war and provided cover for other ships laying minefields . Admiral Makarov and Bayan fought several inconclusive battles with German ships during the war , including the Battle of Åland Islands in mid – 1915 , and they also defended Moon Sound during the German invasion of the Estonian islands in late 1917 , where Bayan was badly damaged . Their 75 mm guns were removed in 1916 – 17 and replaced by one 8 @-@ inch and four 6 @-@ inch guns . A pair of anti @-@ aircraft guns were also added . Admiral Makarov was in Helsingfors when Finland declared independence in March 1918 , and was forced to evacuate even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over . She reached Kronstadt after what became known as the " Ice Voyage " . The sisters were decommissioned in 1918 and sold for scrap in 1922 . 
 = Lê Duẩn = 
 Lê Duẩn ( 7 April 1907 – 10 July 1986 ) was a Vietnamese communist politician . He rose in the party hierarchy in the late 1950s and became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam ( VCP ) at the 3rd National Congress in 1960 . He continued Hồ Chí Minh 's policy of ruling through collective leadership . From the mid @-@ 1960s , when Hồ 's health was failing , until his own death in 1986 , he was the top decision @-@ maker in Vietnam . 
 He was born into a lower @-@ class family in Quảng Trị Province , in the southern part of French Indochina as Lê Văn Nhuận . Little is known about his family and childhood . He first came in contact with Marxist literature in the 1920s through his work as a railway clerk . Lê Duẩn was a founding member of the Indochina Communist Party ( the future Communist Party of Vietnam ) in 1930 . He was imprisoned in 1931 and released in 1937 . From 1937 to 1939 he climbed the party ladder . He was rearrested in 1939 , this time for fomenting an uprising in the South . Lê Duẩn was released from jail following the successful communist @-@ led August Revolution . 
 During the First Indochina War , Lê Duẩn was an active communist cadre in the South . He headed the Central Office of South Vietnam , a party organ , from 1951 until 1954 . During the 1950s Lê Duẩn became increasingly aggressive towards the South and called for reunification through war . By the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1950s Lê Duẩn had become the second @-@ most powerful policy @-@ maker within the Party , eclipsing former party First Secretary Trường Chinh . By 1960 , he was officially the second @-@ most powerful party member , after party chairman Hồ . Throughout the 1960s Hồ 's health declined and Lê Duẩn assumed more of his responsibilities . On 2 September 1969 , Hồ died and Lê Duẩn became the most powerful figure in the North . 
 Throughout the Vietnam War , Lê Duẩn took an aggressive posture . He saw attack as the key to victory . When the North finally won the war in 1975 , Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly optimistic about the future . The Second Five @-@ Year Plan ( 1976 – 1980 ) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis . Vietnam was then headed by a gerontocracy ( in which the rulers are much older than the average adult ) . Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn 's rule . In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted Pol Pot , fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid . Lê Duẩn died in 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh in July . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Lê Duẩn was born in Dai Hao village , Quảng Trị Province on 7 April 1907 ( although some sources cite 1908 ) as Lê Văn Nhuận . Little is known about his family and <unk> from his generation say that Duan 's parents were metal scrap collectors and blacksmiths . The son of a railway clerk , he became active in revolutionary politics as a young man . He received a French colonial education before working as a clerk for the Vietnam Railway Company in Hanoi during the 1920s . Through his job , he came into contact with several communists . In this period he became a Marxist . 
 Lê Duẩn became a member of the Revolutionary Youth League in 1928 . He cofounded the Indochina Communist Party in 1930 . Lê Duẩn was imprisoned the next year . He was released six years later , in 1937 . From 1937 to 1939 he advanced in the party hierarchy and at the 2nd National Congress , he joined its Central Committee . He was imprisoned again the following year for fomenting an uprising . After five years he was released , shortly after the 1945 August Revolution , in which the Indochinese Communist Party took power . Following his release , he became a trusted associate of Hồ Chí Minh , the leading Vietnamese communist . 
 During the First Indochina War Lê Duẩn served as the Secretary of the Regional Committee of South Vietnam , at first in Cochinchina in 1946 , but was reassigned to head the Central Office of South Vietnam from 1951 until 1954 . The Viet Minh 's position in the South became increasingly tenuous by the early to mid @-@ 1950s and in 1953 Lê Duẩn was replaced by his deputy Lê Đức Thọ and moved to North Vietnam . 
 = = = The road to the South = = = 
 In the aftermath of the 1954 Geneva Accords , which indirectly split Vietnam into North and South , Lê Duẩn was responsible for reorganising the combatants who had fought in South and Central Vietnam . In 1956 , he wrote " The Road to the South " , calling for a non violent revolution to achieve reunification . His thesis became the blueprint for action at the 11th Central Committee Plenum in 1956 . Although " The Road to the South " was formally accepted , its implementation waited until 1959 . 
 In 1956 Lê Duẩn was appointed to the Secretariat . Lê Duẩn was ordered by the Politburo in August 1956 to guide the revolutionary struggle in South Vietnam . The same month he traveled from U Minh to Bến Tre and instructed the southern communists to stop fighting in the name of religious sects . Throughout the year , the party had been split by factional rivalry between party boss Trường Chinh and President Hồ , who was supported by Võ Nguyên Giáp . This rivalry focused on the issue of land reform in the North . Lê Duẩn remained neutral , allowing him to act as the First Secretary ( head of the Communist Party ) on Hồ 's behalf in late 1956 . In 1957 , he was given a seat in the Politburo . 
 At the 1957 May Day parade , Trường Chinh was still seated as the country 's second most powerful figure . Lê Duẩn was gradually able to place his supporters , notably Lê <unk> Thọ , in top positions and outmaneuver his rivals . He visited Moscow in November 1957 and received approval for his war plans . In December 1957 , Hồ told the 13th Plenary Session of a " dual revolution " ; Trường Chinh became responsible for the socialist transformation of the north , while Lê Duẩn focused on planning the offensive in the south . 
 By 1958 , Lê Duẩn ranked second only to Hồ in the party hierarchy , although Trường Chinh remained powerful . Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government . He made a brief , secret visit to South Vietnam in 1958 , writing a report , The Path to Revolution in the South , in which he stated that the North Vietnamese had to do more to assist the southern fighters . The Central Committee decided to initiate the revolution in January 1959 . 
 = = = First Secretary = = = 
 Lê Duẩn was informally chosen as the party 's First Secretary ( later known as the General Secretary ) by Hồ in 1959 , at the January plenum of the Central Committee and was elected to the post de jure at the 3rd National Congress . Lê Duẩn was not Hồ 's original choice for First Secretary according to Bùi Tín ; his preferred candidate was Võ Nguyên Giáp , but since Lê Duẩn was supported by the influential Lê Đức Thọ , the Head of the Party Organisational Department , Lê Duẩn was picked for the post . Lê Duẩn was considered a safe choice because of his time in prison during French rule , his thesis The Road to the South and his strong belief in Vietnamese reunification . Hoàng Văn Hoan claimed , after being sent into exile , that the 3rd National Congress also purged several party members . Indeed , three former ambassadors lost their Central Committee seats .

 = = = Political infighting and power = = = 
 Lê Duẩn was officially named party leader in 1960 , leaving Hồ a figurehead . Hồ maintained influence in the government : Lê Duẩn , <unk> Hữu , Trường Chinh and Phạm Văn Đồng often shared dinner with him . Later , throughout and after the war , they all remained important figures . In 1963 , Hồ purportedly corresponded with South Vietnamese President Ngô Đình Diệm in the hope of achieving a negotiated peace . Together with Lê Đức Thọ , Head of the Party Organisational Department and Nguyễn Chí Thanh , a military general , Lê Duẩn tried to monopolise the decision @-@ making process – this became even more evident following Hồ 's death . In 1964 , Hồ 's health began to fail and Lê Duẩn , as his trusted underling , more visibly took on day @-@ to @-@ day decision @-@ making responsibilities . Some analysts claim that by 1965 Hồ and Lê Duẩn had split and that " for all intents and purposes " Lê Duẩn had sidelined Hồ . Lê Duẩn , Lê Đức Thọ and Phạm Hùng " progressively tried to neutralise Hồ Chí Minh " and Phạm Văn Đồng . 
 By the late @-@ 1960s , Hồ 's declining health had weakened his position within the leadership . While Hồ was still consulted on important decisions , Lê Duẩn dominated the party . When Hồ died on 2 September 1969 , the collective leadership he had espoused continued , but Lê Duẩn was first among equals . The Central Committee 's first resolution following Hồ 's death pledged to uphold the collective leadership . Lê Duẩn chaired Hồ 's funeral committee and gave the event 's final speech . 
 From the beginning the party leadership had split into pro @-@ Soviet , pro @-@ Chinese and moderate factions . Under Hồ the party had followed a policy of neutrality between the Soviet Union and the People 's Republic of China in the aftermath of the Sino – Soviet split . This policy continued until reunification . In the aftermath of the war , a power struggle began between Lê Duẩn 's pro @-@ Soviet and its rival pro @-@ Chinese factions . Former rivals Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ formed a coalition and purged the pro @-@ Chinese faction . Their first victims were Hoàng Văn Hoan and Chu Văn Tấn . While the Politburo made decisions through consensus , Lê Duẩn , through his post as General Secretary , was the most powerful figure and was able to increase his power via his alliance with Lê Đức Thọ , Trần Quốc <unk> and Võ Nguyên Giáp . Together with Lê Đức Thọ , Lê Duẩn controlled personnel appointments in the Ministry of Internal Affairs , the State Planning Commission , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the General Political Directorate of the Vietnam People 's Army ( VPA ) , the General Logistics Department of the VPA and the Ministry of Transport . 
 To strengthen their hold on power , Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ established a patronage network . For instance Lê Đức Thọ 's brother , Đinh Đức Thiện was appointed Minister of Communications and Transport ; in April 1982 Đồng <unk> Nguyên , a protégé of Lê Duẩn , became Minister of Transport . Mai Chí Thọ , brother of Lê Đức Thọ , was Chairman of the People 's Committee of Hồ Chí Minh City ( equivalent to a Mayor ) from 1978 to 1985 . Several of Lê Duẩn 's relatives were appointed to offices in the propaganda and culture sector . However , with the exception of Mai Chí Thọ none of these figures reached the pinnacles of power in Vietnamese politics . 
 = = = Vietnam War = = = 
 At the 3rd National Congress , Lê Duẩn called for the establishment of a South Vietnamese people 's front . The Central Committee supported the proposal . A Central Committee resolution stated that " The common task of the Vietnamese revolution at present is to accelerate the socialist revolution in North Vietnam whilst at the same time stepping up the National People 's Democratic Revolution in South Vietnam . " On 20 December 1960 , three months later , the National Front for the Liberation of the South , better known as Việt Cộng , was established . Lê Duẩn claimed that the Việt Cộng would " rally ' all patriotic forces ' to overthrow the Diệm government [ in the South ] and thus ensure ' conditions for the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland ' " . 
 After the Sino – Soviet split , the Vietnamese communist leadership divided into pro @-@ China and pro @-@ Soviet factions . Initially Lê Duẩn was labeled pro @-@ China , because of his hawkish policies towards South Vietnam . After reunification he was referred to as pro @-@ Soviet . From 1956 – 63 , Lê Duẩn played a moderating role between the two factions , but with the death of Diệm and the Gulf of Tonkin incident , he became considerably more radical . The Chinese continued to support them throughout the war , with Liu Shaoqi , the President of the People 's Republic , in 1965 stating , " it is our policy that we will do our best to support you . " Unlike Hồ , who wanted a peaceful resolution , Lê Duẩn was far more militant . He wanted , in his own words , " final victory " . He dismissed Hồ 's position , as did the majority of the Politburo , calling him " naive " . When Hồ called for the establishment of a neutral South Vietnamese state in 1963 , Lê Duẩn responded by making overtures to the Chinese , who rejected the Soviet position of peaceful coexistence . 
 With the increased involvement of the United States military in 1965 , the North 's military strategy was forced to change . As Lê Duẩn noted in a letter to Nguyễn Chí Thanh , the war would become " fiercer and longer " . He believed the fundamentals of the conflict had not changed ; the South Vietnamese regime 's unpopularity remained its " Achilles ' heel " and he continued to advocate a combination of guerrilla warfare and NVA offensives . The communist commanders in the South were to avoid large attacks on the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) , but instead focus on many small attacks to demoralize the enemy . Lê Duẩn believed that the key to victory was for the NVA had to keep the initiative . He dismissed the possibility of an attack against North Vietnam by American forces , claiming that an attack on North Vietnam would be an attack on the entire socialist camp . 
 By July 1974 , following the cut @-@ off of US aid to the South , the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to abrogate the ceasefire and to invade in 1975 , instead of 1976 as previously planned , because they believed an earlier Vietnamese unification would put Vietnam in a stronger position against Chinese and Soviet influence . In his victory speech , Lê Duẩn stated : " Our party is the unique and single leader that organised , controlled and governed the entire struggle of the Vietnamese people from the first day of the revolution . " In his speech he congratulated the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam ( PRGRSV ) , the underground South Vietnamese government established in 1969 , for liberating South Vietnam from imperialism . PRGRSV @-@ ruled South Vietnam did not last long however and in 1976 the reunified Socialist Republic of Vietnam was established . Lê Duẩn purged South Vietnamese who had fought against the North , imprisoning over one million people and setting off a mass exodus and humanitarian disaster ( see Vietnamese boat people ) . A 1983 United States Department of State annual human rights survey called Vietnam under Lê Duẩn " the single most repressive government in the world . " 
 = = = Economy = = = 
 Vietnam developed little during the war years ; industry was nearly non @-@ existent in both North and South and both countries were dependent on foreign donor countries . Worse , the country 's critical agricultural infrastructure had been badly damaged . The South had roughly 20 @,@ 000 bomb craters , 10 million refugees , 362 @,@ 000 war invalids , 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 widows , 880 @,@ 000 orphans , 250 @,@ 000 drug addicts , 300 @,@ 000 prostitutes and 3 million unemployed . 
 Having won the war and defeated South Vietnam , Lê Duẩn 's mood in April 1975 was optimistic . As one Central Committee member put it , " Now nothing more can happen . The problems we face now are trifles compared to those in the past . " Lê Duẩn promised the Vietnamese people in 1976 that each family would own a radio set , refrigerator and TV within ten years ; he seemed to believe he could easily integrate the South Vietnamese consumer society with agrarian North Vietnam . In 1976 the 4th National Congress declared Vietnam would complete its socialist transformation within twenty years . This optimism proved unfounded ; instead Vietnam staggered from one economic crisis to another . 
 After the war , per @-@ capita income stood at US $ 101 ; it decreased to $ 91 in 1980 and then increased to $ 99 by 1982 , according to United Nations figures . Phạm Văn Đồng admitted that per @-@ capita income " had not increased compared to what it was ten years ago " . Physical health declined and malnutrition increased under Lê Duẩn , according to the Ministry of Health . According to the The International Herald Tribune , an estimated 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 Vietnamese were suffering from malnutrition , leading the government to request aid from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization . Lê Duẩn 's policies led to an abrupt decline in the standard of living ; monthly per capita income in the North declined from $ 82 in 1976 to $ 58 in 1980 . 
 The main goals of the Second Five @-@ Year Plan ( 1976 – 80 ) , which was initiated at the 4th National Congress , were as follows ; 
 " Concentrate the forces of the whole country to achieve a leap forward in agriculture ; vigorously develop light industry " . 
 " [ T ] urn to full account existing heavy industry capacity and build many new industrial installations , especially in the machine industry , so as to support primary agriculture and light industry " . 
 " [ V ] irtually complete socialist transformation in the South " . 
 The Vietnamese leadership expected to reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ( COMECON ) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world . The 4th National Congress made it clear that agriculture would be socialised ; however , during the Second Five @-@ Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công , a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture , claimed it would be impossible to meet the targets set by the plan by 1980 . An estimated 10 @,@ 000 out of 13 @,@ 246 socialist cooperatives , established during the plan , had collapsed in the South by 1980 . Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower @-@ level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation . The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978 , leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party 's agricultural policies . 
 With regard to heavy industry , the leadership 's position was muddled . In his Fourth Political Report Lê Duẩn stated that during the transition to socialism , priority would be given to heavy industry " on the basis of developing agriculture and light industry " . In another section of the report , Lê Duẩn stated that light industry would be prioritised ahead of heavy industry . The position of Phạm Văn Đồng , the Chairman of the Council of Ministers ( the head of government ) , was just as confused as Lê Duẩn 's . In practice Lê Duẩn prioritised heavy industry : 21 @.@ 4 % of state investment was in heavy industry in the Second Five @-@ Year Plan and 29 @.@ 7 percent in the Third Five @-@ Year Plan ( 1981 – 85 ) . Light industry only received 10 @.@ 5 and 11 @.@ 5 , respectively . From 1976 to 1978 industry grew , but from 1979 to 1980 industrial production fell substantially . During the Second Five @-@ Year Plan industry grew just 0 @.@ 1 percent . The 6th Plenum of the Central Committee criticised the policy that the state had to own everything . 
 Before the 5th Central Committee Plenum , Lê Duẩn believed that Vietnam was in a perilous position , although no talk of reforms followed . Beginning in 1979 , Lê Duẩn acknowledged that economic policy mistakes had been made by the national Party and State leadership . 
 Until the 6th plenum , the planners prevailed . That plenum condemned the old ways and promised that from then on the economy would be governed by " objective laws " . The roles of the plan and the market were openly discussed for the first time and the roles of the family and the private economy were enhanced and certain market prices were officially supported by the Party . Lê Duẩn endorsed the reforms at the 1982 5th National Congress . Lê Duẩn talked about the need to strengthen both the central planned economy and the local economy at once . In his report Lê Duẩn admitted that the Second Five @-@ Year Plan had been a failure economically . 
 At the beginning these changes had little practical effect , possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres . From 1981 – 84 agricultural production grew substantially , but the government did not use this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer , pesticide and fuel , nor of consumer goods . By the end of Lê Duẩn 's rule , in 1985 – 1986 , inflation had reached over 100 % annually , complicating economic policy @-@ making .

 Lê Duẩn visited the Soviet Union in October 1975 . The result of the visit was an official communique , which stated that the Soviets would send qualified experts to the country to educate and train economic , scientific , technical and cultural personnel . The Soviet Union gave Vietnam economic assistance and supported several national economic projects on most favoured terms . The communique stated that cooperation was within the " frameworks of multilateral cooperation of socialist countries . " Such a statement would normally have meant membership in COMECON , but Vietnam was not a member , wanting to establish its sovereignty . Phạm Văn Đồng snubbed the Soviet ambassador during the anniversary of the October Revolution and rejected key Soviet foreign policies . Despite continued pressure from the Soviets to join COMECON , Vietnam declined . Instead Vietnam joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , moves the Soviet Union opposed . 
 Vietnam relented in 1978 , seeking economic aid to fund the Second Five @-@ Year Plan . In 1978 Lê Duẩn and Phạm Văn Đồng signed a 25 @-@ year Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Cooperation with the USSR . Under Soviet protection , Vietnam invaded Kampuchea . In reaction China invaded Vietnam . Vietnam leased several bases to the Soviet Union to protect its territory from China . It was rumored that one of China 's demands for peace was the ending of Soviet assistance to Vietnam . In Asia Vietnam played a role similar to Cuba 's in Latin America : it supported local revolutionary groups and was a headquarters for Soviet @-@ style communism . Vietnam supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and received $ 3 million a day in military aid . 
 At the 5th National Congress , Lê Duẩn reaffirmed Vietnam 's relations with the USSR . He stated , " Solidarity and co @-@ operation with the USSR : such is the corner stone of the external policy of our Party and of our State . " He further noted that their alliance was " a guarantee of the victory of the defense of the motherland and the socialist edification of our people . " Soviet official Mikhail Gorbachev echoed Lê Duẩn 's sentiments and said " Vietnam can count on the solidarity and the support of the USSR . " 
 Lê Duẩn 's foreign policy was criticised by Hoàng Văn Hoan , who accused him of sacrificing the country 's sovereignty . A delegation led by Vitaly <unk> , visited Vietnam during its National Day , the holiday that celebrated the establishment of North Vietnam after the August Revolution and met with Lê Duẩn . Lê Duẩn attended the 27th Communist Party Congress and later met with Gorbachev . Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Anatoly Dobrynin attended Lê Duẩn 's funeral . 
 = = = = Relations with China = = = = 
 During the Vietnam War , the Chinese claimed that the Soviet Union would betray Vietnam . Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai told Lê Duẩn that the Soviets would lie to them to improve its relationship with the United States . According to Zhou this policy was enacted following Alexei Kosygin 's departure from Vietnam in 1965 . Lê Duẩn did not accept this view and at the 23rd Party Congress ( which China boycotted ) he referred to the Soviet Union as a " second motherland " . Because of his statement , China immediately began to cut its aid to Vietnam . According to the first secretary at the Soviet embassy to China , the Vietnamese saw the Chinese actions as an attack on them . At the Chinese Communist Party 's 45th anniversary , instead of a communique by Hồ Chí Minh , Phạm Văn Đồng and Lê Duẩn as had happened at the 44th anniversary , the Vietnamese Central Committee offered official greetings , but without signatures from top @-@ level officials . 
 Relations between the two countries further deteriorated following the China / US rapprochement . The Vietnamese , who were still fighting the Americans , felt betrayed . At the CPV Politburo meeting on 16 July 1971 , the Vietnamese agreed that Chinese policy towards the United States was like a " torpedo " directed against Vietnam . Zhou was told by Phạm Văn Đồng and Lê Duẩn that US President Richard Nixon 's , upcoming visit to China was " against the interests of Vietnam " . Later , in November , Phạm asked the Chinese to cancel Nixon 's visit ; the Chinese refused . The Vietnamese began to doubt China and they hid information about Vietnam 's next planned military offensive . The Sino / US rapprochement did not hurt Sino / Vietnamese relations in the long run , because the Soviet Union also eventually reconciled with the US . 
 Chinese and Vietnamese documents state that relations between them worsened in 1973 – 75 . A Vietnamese document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification , while Chinese documents claimed that the source of the conflict was Vietnamese policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands . However , the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam 's cooperation with the Soviets . Increasing Soviet / Vietnamese cooperation left China ambivalent about reunification . 
 During Lê Duẩn 's China visit in June 1973 , Zhou told him that Vietnam should adhere to the Paris Peace Accords . Following the signing , Lê Thanh Nghị stated that the direction of Vietnam 's communism was directly linked to its relations with the Soviet Union . The Chinese opposed immediate reunification and to that end , began making economic agreements with the Provisional Revolutionary ( Communist ) Government of South Vietnam ( PRGSV ) . PRGSV head Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was treated well by the Chinese . This policy further damaged relations . China and Vietnam drifted further apart ; eventual Chinese aid did not improve relations . 
 Lê Thanh , unsuccessfully visited China in August 1975 to seek aid . On 22 – 28 September , Lê Duẩn and Lê Duẩn Thanh visited China in a second attempt . During the visit the Vietnamese wanted to assure the Chinese they were interested in maintaining good relations with both China and the Soviet Union . Deng Xiaoping stated that both superpowers acted as imperialists and sought hegemony . Lê Duẩn in a speech did not mention the Soviet Union by name , but noted that Vietnam had succeeded because of help from other socialist countries , meaning the Eastern bloc . Two agreements were signed , but no non @-@ refundable aid agreement was made . No joint communique was issued and Lê Duẩn left earlier than planned . According to Anne Gilks , the Sino / Vietnamese alliance effectively ended with the Fall of Saigon . Relations with China further deteriorated ; several leading pro @-@ Chinese communists were purged from the party . 
 Lê Duẩn visited China from 20 – 25 November 1977 to seek aid . CPC Chairman Hua Guofeng stated that Sino / Vietnamese relations had deteriorated because they held different principles . Hua insisted that China could not help Vietnam because of its own economic difficulties and differences in principles . Lê Duẩn countered that the only difference was how they viewed the Soviet Union and the United States . Following his visit , China ( Xinhua ) condemned COMECON . China halted all economic development projects between May and July 1978 . During this period total Chinese aid to Vietnam amounted to $ 300 million .

 On 17 February 1979 , the Chinese People 's Liberation Army crossed the Vietnamese border , withdrawing on 5 March after a two @-@ week campaign which devastated northern Vietnam and briefly threatened Hanoi . Both China ( 40 @,@ 000 ) and Vietnam ( over 20 @,@ 000 ) suffered heavy losses . Peace talks broke down in December 1979 and both China ( 400 @,@ 000 ) and Vietnam ( 600 @,@ 000 ) began a major build @-@ up of forces along the border . Sporadic fighting on the border occurred throughout the 1980s and China threatened to force Vietnam 's exit from Kampuchea .

 The independent Kampuchean Communist Party ( KCP ) was established alongside the Vietnamese and Laotian parties following the dissolution of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1955 . The Kampuchean movement was the weakest of the three . When the Vietnamese began formal military aid to the Khmer Rouge in 1970 , the Khmer leadership remained skeptical . On the orders of Võ Chí Công two regiments were sent into Kampuchea . Võ Chí Công promised Khmer leader Ieng Sary that Vietnamese troops would withdraw when the conflict had been won by the communists . The entry of Vietnamese troops led many Vietnamese officials to believe that Khmer Rouge officials had begun " to fear something " . In a conversation with Phạm Hùng , Lê Duẩn told him that despite some differences in opinions , the " authentic internationalism and attitude " of the sides would strengthen their party @-@ to @-@ party relations . However , by reading reports by Võ Chí Công , Lê Duẩn probably concluded that " authentic internationalism " in Kampuchea was in trouble . At the time , the Vietnamese leadership hoped this situation would change , but privately they understood that the Kampuchean situation was different from the Lao situation . 
 After Pol Pot and his supporters seized control of KCP in 1973 , KCP / VCP relations deteriorated sharply . North Vietnamese formations that were active in Kampuchea during the civil war were thereafter regularly attacked by their allies . By 1976 while it appeared that Kampuchea / Vietnam relations were normalizing , private suspicions within the respective leaderships grew . Lê Duẩn , Tôn Đức Thắng , Trường Chinh and Phạm Văn Đồng sent messages congratulating the ascension of Pol Pot , Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea as Premier , President of the Presidium and President of the Assembly of the People 's Representative , respectively . In turn , KCP sent a congratulatory message to the PRGRSV on its seventh anniversary . On 21 September 1976 a Vietnamese women 's delegation visited Kampuchea and the KCP sent public greetings to the 4th National Congress . The Vietnamese leadership hoped that pro @-@ Vietnamese elements would develop within the KCP . When Kampuchean radio announced Pol Pot 's resignation , Lê Duẩn and the Vietnamese leadership took it seriously . During a meeting with the Soviet ambassador , Lê Duẩn told him that Pol Pot and Ieng Sary had been removed from the KCP leadership . The change was welcome to Vietnam , since the two were a " pro @-@ Chinese sect conducting a crude and severe policy . " Lê Duẩn added that " these were bad people [ the KCP leadership headed by Pol Pot ] " , but that Nuon Chea was " our man and is my personal friend . " However , all @-@ out confrontation was not planned and Lê Duẩn still believed that state @-@ to @-@ state relations could improve . He further noted that Kampuchea would eventually become like Laos , a socialist state and value its relationship with Vietnam and the Soviet Union . 
 On 30 April 1977 Democratic Kampuchea attacked several Vietnamese villages in An Giang Province , most notably in the Ba <unk> massacre . The Vietnamese leadership was shocked by this unprovoked attack and counterattacked . Vietnam still sought improved relations and when Pol Pot , on 27 September 1977 , announced the existence of the KCP , Vietnam sent a congratulatory note . In a conversation with the Soviet ambassador on 6 October , Lê Duẩn had no explanation for Kampuchea 's actions . He described the leadership as " strongly nationalistic and under strong influence of Peking [ China ] . " Lê Duẩn called Pol Pot a Trotskyist while claiming that Ieng Sary was " a fierce nationalist and pro @-@ Chinese . " He , however , erroneously believed that Nuon Chea and Son Sen harbored pro @-@ Vietnamese views . 
 On 31 December 1977 Kampuchea broke relations with Vietnam , stating that the " aggressor forces " from Vietnam sent had to be withdrawn . This was needed to " restore the friendly atmosphere between the two countries . " While they accused Vietnam of aggression , the real problem all along was the Vietnamese leadership ' plan , or ideal , of establishing a Vietnamese @-@ dominated Indochinese Federation . Vietnamese troops withdrew from the country in January , taking thousands of prisoners and civilian refugees . While the point of the Vietnamese attack had been to dampen the Kampuchean leadership 's aggressive stance , it had the opposite effect – the Kampuchean leadership treated it as a major victory over Vietnam , matching their victory over the Americans . Kampuchea did not respond to diplomatic overtures and began another attack . In response Vietnam began to promote an uprising against Pol Pot 's rule and invaded . 
 On 15 June 1978 the VCP Politburo sent a request to the Soviet Union to allow a delegation headed by Lê Duẩn to meet with Leonid Brezhnev and the Soviet leadership in general . In a meeting with the Soviet ambassador in September , Lê Duẩn said that Vietnam intended " to solve fully this question [ of Kampuchea ] by the beginning of 1979 . " Lê Duẩn did not believe that China would retaliate because it would have to send its forces by sea . However , China did attack in 1979 , but chose Vietnam as its target . He further claimed that Vietnam had little time and that waiting would benefit China . He further claimed that Vietnam had established nine battalions of Khmer deserters and that it was seeking Sao <unk> to lead them . However , he had been dead for three months . Lê Duẩn still believed that Nuon Chea was a friend of Vietnam , despite his largely anti @-@ Vietnam speech . Nuon Chea and Son Sen remained staunch Pol Pot supporters until the 1990s . 
 Vietnam sent 13 divisions into the country on 25 December 1978 , with an estimated 150 @,@ 000 soldiers supported by heavy artillery and air power . Kampuchea attempted a conventional defense , but this tactic led to the loss of half of its army within two weeks . The defeats prompted much of the Kampuchean leadership to evacuate towards the western region of the country . On 7 January 1979 , the Vietnamese Army entered Phnom Penh along with the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation . On the following day , a pro @-@ Vietnamese state , known as the People 's Republic of Kampuchea ( PRK ) , was established , with Heng Samrin as head of state and Pen Sovan as General Secretary of the Kampuchean People 's Revolutionary Party . The struggle between the Khmer Rouge and the PRK ended only with Vietnam 's withdrawal in 1989 .

 By the time of the 5th National Congress , the party leadership had turned into a veritable gerontocracy . The five most powerful Politburo members were all over the age of 70 ; Lê Duẩn was 74 , Trường Chinh was 75 , Phạm Văn Đồng was 76 , Phạm Hùng was 70 and Lê Đức Thọ was 72 . Lê Duẩn is believed to have been in bad health during this period ; he had travelled to the Soviet Union on several occasions for medical treatment during the late @-@ 1970s and early 1980s . It was reported that Lê Duẩn did not lead the party delegates of the 5th National Congress to the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum because of his deteriorating health . Lê Duẩn looked both feeble and old ; he had problems reading his report to the Congress . 
 At the 5th National Congress , the Lê Duẩn / Lê Đức Thọ clique amassed considerable power by staffing the 5th Central Committee , the 5th Secretariat and the 5th Politburo with their own supporters . Several moderates and old companions of Hồ Chí Minh , as well as pro @-@ Chinese communists ( labelled dismissively as Maoists ) and followers of Trường Chinh , were removed from the Politburo and the Central Committee . The most prominent ouster was that of Võ Nguyên Giáp , the commander at the Battle of <unk> Biên Phu . Giáp 's removal signaled more the defeat of a rival than of an ideological tendency . Nguyễn Duy Trinh and Lê Thanh Nghị were removed from the Politburo because of their moderate stances , while Trần Quốc <unk> , Lê Văn Lương and Nguyễn Văn Linh were removed because of their alignment with Trường Chinh . In their place Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ appointed military men , including Đỗ Mười , Lê Đức Anh and General Đồng <unk> Nguyên . The appointment of Nguyễn Đức Tâm and Nguyễn <unk> Thach strengthened Lê Đức Thọ . The Lê Duẩn / Lê Đức Thọ clique thereafter had a clear majority within the 5th Secretariat . 
 Lê Duẩn 's report to the 5th National Congress was a biting self @-@ criticism of his leadership and the party 's management . He criticised political and economic corruption and the gerontocracy itself . The 5th Central Committee contained only one member under 60 . During this period the Central Committee was disrupted by factional infighting between pragmatists and conservatives . This struggle would lead to economic reform . Lê Duẩn and his supporters began the effort to open the economy . 
 Apparently Lê Duẩn suffered a heart attack after the Congress and was hospitalized in the Soviet Union . He remained General Secretary until on 10 July 1986 at age 79 , he died of natural causes in Hanoi . He was temporarily succeeded by Trường Chinh , who was deposed and replaced by Nguyễn Văn Linh at the December 6th National Congress . 
 = = Political beliefs = = 
 Lê Duẩn was a nationalist and during the war he claimed that the " nation and socialism were one " . He stressed the importance of building socialism politically , economically and culturally and of defending the socialist fatherland . Ideologically he was often referred to as a pragmatist . He often broke with Marxism – Leninism to stress Vietnam 's uniqueness , most notably in agriculture . Lê Duẩn 's view of socialism was statist , highly centralised and managerial . 
 In one of his own works , Lê Duẩn talked about " the right of collective mastery " , but in practice he opposed this . For instance , party cadres who presented the peasants ' demands for higher prices for their products at the National Congress were criticised by Lê Duẩn . His ideas of collective mastery were hierarchical : " Management by the state aims at ensuring the right of the masses to be the collective masters of the country . How then will the state manage its affairs so as to ensure this right of collective mastery ? " His answer to this problem was managerial and statist . 
 Lê Duẩn 's concept of " collective mastery " was featured in the 1980 Vietnamese Constitution as was his concept of " collective mastery " of society . The concept was Lê Duẩn 's version of popular sovereignty that advocated an active role for the people , so that they could become their own masters as well as masters of society , nature and the nation . It stated that the people 's collective mastery in all fields was assured by the state and was implemented by permitting their participation in state affairs and in mass organisations . On paper , these organisations , to which almost all citizens belong , play an active role in government and have the right to introduce bills before the National Assembly . 
 Lê Duẩn said that land ownership entailed a " struggle between the two roads – collective production and private production ; large @-@ scale socialist production and small scattered production . " This quote could easily have been taken from Joseph Stalin , Mao Zedong or Trường Chinh in his radical years . His views had a direct impact on Vietnam . Since it was believed that collective ownership was the only alternative to capitalism , it was introduced without controversy by the country 's leadership . 
 <unk> cooperatives to peasants became the norm by the late @-@ 1970s and was legalised in 1981 . For conservatives this policy was similar to that of Lenin 's New Economic Policy , a temporary break from hardline socialist development . However , those who supported reforms saw subcontracting as another way of implementing socialism in agriculture , which was justified by the ideological tenet of the " three interests " . This was an important ideological innovation and broke with Lê Duẩn 's " two roads " theory . 
 Lê Duẩn departed from Marxist / Leninist orthodoxy when it came to practical policy and stated that the country had to " carry out agricultural cooperation immediately , even before having built large industry . " While he acknowledged that his view was heresy , Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation ; " It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours . We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism , without waiting for a developed industry , though we know very well that without the strong impact of industry , agriculture cannot achieve large @-@ scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated ... To proceed from small @-@ scale production to large @-@ scale production is a new one . " According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation , but a new division of labour . He also believed that cooperatives did not need to be autarkic , but rather " organically connected , through the process of production itself , with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector . " Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control . He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined . 
 In his victory speech after the 1976 parliamentary election , Lê Duẩn talked about perfecting socialism in the North by eliminating private ownership and the last vestiges of capitalism and of the need to initiate socialist transformation in the South . In the South the Party , according to Lê Duẩn , would focus on abolishing the <unk> bourgeoisie and the last " remnants of the feudal landlord classes " . " <unk> bourgeoisie " was their term for the bourgeois classes , who made a living by financial dealings and through transactions with Westerners . Lê Duẩn did not reveal that in addition to removing the <unk> bourgeoisie and the feudal landlord classes from the South , he intended to obliterate the entire bourgeois class .

 SMS Sankt Georg was the third and final armored cruiser of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . She was built at the Pola Arsenal ; her keel was laid in March 1901 , she was launched in December 1903 , and completed in July 1905 . Her design was based on the previous armored cruiser Kaiser Karl VI , with the primary improvement being a stronger armament . Sankt Georg , named for Saint George , was armed with a main battery of two 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns , five 19 cm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and four 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns . 
 Sankt Georg served in the training and reserve squadrons during her peacetime career , usually alternating with Kaiser Karl VI . In April – May 1907 , Sankt Georg participated in the Jamestown Exposition in the United States , to commemorate the first English colony in North America . During World War I , the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet largely remained inactive as a fleet in being , though she did bombard the Italian coast in May 1915 following the latter 's declaration of war on Austria @-@ Hungary . In 1917 , she supported the Austro @-@ Hungarian forces that raided the Otranto Barrage ; in the ensuing Battle of the Strait of Otranto , Sankt Georg 's arrival on the scene was sufficient to force the Anglo @-@ Italian forces to break off the engagement and retreat . 
 By February 1918 , the crews of Sankt Georg and several other warships grew weary of the war and the long periods of inactivity , which led to the Cattaro Mutiny . The mutiny was quickly suppressed , but Sankt Georg and several other ships were subsequently decommissioned . Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , Sankt Georg was awarded as a war prize to Britain . In 1920 , she was sold to Italian ship breakers and scrapped thereafter . 
 = = Design = = 
 In the 1890s , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy began to build armored cruisers to support the battle fleet and to perform some of the roles then reserved only for battleships . The first vessel , Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia , was built as an enlarged version of the protected cruiser Kaiserin Elisabeth , with a more powerful armament and heavier armor . She was followed by an improved cruiser , Kaiser Karl VI , which provided the basis for an even larger ship , which was named Sankt Georg . Each iteration carried a heavier armament and had a higher top speed than the preceding design . 
 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 Sankt Georg was 123 @.@ 23 meters ( 404 ft 4 in ) long at the waterline and was 124 @.@ 3 m ( 407 ft 10 in ) long overall . She had a beam of 19 @.@ 01 m ( 62 ft 4 in ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 83 m ( 22 ft 5 in ) . She displaced 7 @,@ 289 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 174 long tons ) as designed and up to 8 @,@ 070 t ( 7 @,@ 940 long tons ) at full load . Her crew numbered 630 officers and men . Sankt Georg was fitted with two pole masts for observation . 
 The ship 's propulsion system consisted of two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion engines that drove a pair of screw propellers . Steam was provided by eight coal @-@ fired water @-@ tube boilers that were trunked into three funnels on the centerline . The engines were rated at 15 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 000 kW ) and produced a top speed of 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . On her full power trials , she reached 15 @,@ 271 ihp ( 11 @,@ 388 kW ) and 22 @.@ 01 kn ( 40 @.@ 76 km / h ; 25 @.@ 33 mph ) . Steering was controlled by a single rudder .

 Sankt Georg was armed with a main battery of two large @-@ caliber guns and several medium @-@ caliber pieces . She carried two 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) G. L / 40 S. guns in single gun turret on the centerline forward . These guns fired a 229 @-@ kilogram ( 505 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 725 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 380 ft / s ) , at a maximum range of 10 @,@ 000 m ( 11 @,@ 000 yd ) . Each gun , manufactured by Škoda Works , was supplied with forty high @-@ explosive and forty armor @-@ piercing shells . The guns were housed in electrically trained turrets that allowed elevation to 20 ° and depression to − 4 ° . Five 19 cm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) G. L / 42 guns and four 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 40 guns , all mounted individually in casemates with one of the 19 cm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) G. L / 42 on a single turret aft , rounded out her offensive armament . Sankt Georg carried 120 rounds for each of the 19 cm guns and 180 rounds for the 15 cm pieces . 
 A battery of nine 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) L / 45 guns , six 4 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) L / 44 quick @-@ firing guns ( QF ) and two 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) L / 33 QF guns provided close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . The 7 cm guns had an actual caliber of 6 @.@ 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) . They had a rate of fire of twenty rounds per minute , and each gun was supplied with 400 rounds of ammunition . The 4 @.@ 7 cm guns had a rate of fire of 25 rounds per minute , and were typically stocked with 500 rounds . She carried several smaller weapons , including a pair of 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine guns and two 7 cm landing guns . One 7 cm L / 50 antiaircraft gun was installed in 1916 . Sankt Georg was also equipped with a pair of 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes , one on each broadside . 
 The ship was protected by a main armored belt that was 210 mm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) thick in the central portion that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces , and reduced to 165 mm ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) on either end . Transverse armored bulkheads that were 190 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) thick capped the armored belt on either end . She had an armored deck that was 36 – 50 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . Her two gun turrets had 210 mm thick faces , and the conning tower had 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides .

 On 11 March 1901 , the keel for Sankt Georg was laid down at the Pola Arsenal . She was launched on 8 December 1903 , and completed on 21 July 1905 . Starting from her commissioning , Sankt Georg frequently served in the training squadron , along with the three Habsburg @-@ class battleships , though she alternated in the squadron with the armored cruiser Kaiser Karl VI . Once the summer training schedule was completed each year , the ships of the training squadron were demobilized in the reserve squadron , which was held in a state of partial readiness . 
 In April 1907 , Sankt Georg and the light cruiser Aspern were sent to the United States to represent Austria @-@ Hungary at the Jamestown Exposition , the commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown colony , the first permanent English settlement in the Americas . In addition to the celebration at Jamestown , Sankt Georg also visited Annapolis and New York City while on the trip . In addition to the Austro @-@ Hungarian delegation , the international fleet consisted of warships from Great Britain , Japan , Germany , France , Italy , and several other nations . The event started on 26 April , and over the following two weeks , the crews from many of the ships , including Sankt Georg , competed in various sailing and rowing races . Of eighteen races , Sankt Georg 's crew placed in six , winning two . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 On 28 June 1914 , Archduke Franz Ferdinand , the heir to the Austro @-@ Hungarian throne , was assassinated in Sarajevo ; the assassination sparked the July Crisis and ultimately the First World War , which broke out a month later on 28 July . The German battlecruiser SMS Goeben , which had been assigned to the Mediterranean Division , sought the protection of the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet , and so Admiral Anton Haus sent the fleet , including Sankt Georg , south on 7 August to assist his German ally . Goeben 's commander , Admiral Wilhelm Souchon , intended to use the Austro @-@ Hungarian move as a feint to distract the British Mediterranean Fleet which was pursuing Goeben ; Souchon instead took his ship to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire . Their decoy mission complete , Sankt Georg and the rest of the fleet returned to port without engaging any British forces . 
 Following the Italian declaration of war against the Central Powers on 23 May 1915 , the entire Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet sortied to bombard Italian coastal targets . Sankt Georg took part in the operation ; escorted by a pair of torpedo boats , she shelled the city of Rimini . She damaged a railroad bridge and was not engaged by Italian forces . Thereafter , the Austro @-@ Hungarians returned to their strategy of serving as a fleet in being , which would tie down Allied naval forces . Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought . For most of the war , Sankt Georg was assigned to the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro , though she was too slow to operate with the newer Novara @-@ class cruisers that carried out the bulk of offensive operations .
