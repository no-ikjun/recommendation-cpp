 The 1984 Cubs were the best team Smith pitched for in his career . While they finished with the franchise 's best record and had their first postseason appearance since 1945 , Smith compiled his worst ERA of the decade — although he saved more than 30 games for the first time in his career . In Game 2 of the NL Championship Series , Smith recorded two outs for the save to give Chicago a 2 – 0 lead in the best @-@ of @-@ five series against the San Diego Padres , putting them one win away from the World Series . In Game 4 , the score was tied when Smith began the eighth inning . After a scoreless eighth and a strikeout to start the bottom of the ninth , Smith allowed a one @-@ out ninth @-@ inning single to Tony Gwynn , and Steve Garvey followed with a two @-@ run homer to force Game 5 . The Cubs led that game in the seventh inning , but the underdog Padres scored four runs and won a trip to the World Series . It would be the Cubs ' only winning season in Smith 's eight years with the team . 
 In 1985 , Smith for the first time dominated the league in strikeouts as a relief pitcher . After averaging fewer than eight strikeouts per nine innings in each prior season , he improved to 10 @.@ 32 in 1985 . He finished the season with a career @-@ high 112 strikeouts in only 97 @.@ 2 innings . Meanwhile , the Cubs were in first place until a 13 @-@ game losing streak from June 12 to June 25 from which they never recovered . 
 Smith saved more than 30 games while the Cubs had losing records in 1985 , 1986 and 1987 . In 1987 , he was chosen for his second All @-@ Star Game . When the midsummer classic went into extra innings , Smith pitched the 10th , 11th and 12th innings , striking out four and getting credit for the win when the NL scored the only two runs of the game in the 13th . 
 With his 30th save in 1987 , Smith became only the second pitcher ( joining Dan Quisenberry ) to reach the mark in four consecutive seasons . Even before then , he was known as one of the most feared relief pitchers in the game . One player told writers Bruce Nash and Allan <unk> for their book , Baseball Confidential , that one of the most daunting sights in the majors was Smith throwing " pure gas from the shadows " of Wrigley Field , which didn 't have lights at the time . 
 Despite his numbers , rumors were swirling about his weight and its effect on his knees and his request for a trade out of Chicago . On December 8 , Smith , the team 's career leader in saves , was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi . Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors , and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30 . Smith , meanwhile , registered nearly 300 saves after the trade . The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons , which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame . 
 = = = Boston Red Sox ( 1988 – 90 ) = = = 
 After losing the 1986 World Series to the New York Mets , the Red Sox compiled a winning percentage below .500 for 1987 . One of the main problems was a weak bullpen , and Smith was brought in to rectify the relief problems . 
 Despite giving up a game @-@ winning home run in his 1988 opening day Fenway Park debut , Smith posted his best ERA in five years . The Red Sox had the good fortune of being in the American League 's Eastern division ; in September , they caught the Detroit Tigers and held off every other team to clinch Smith 's second and last trip to the postseason . In Game 2 of the 1988 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics , Smith gave up three singles , including Walt Weiss ' game @-@ winning RBI single , in the ninth inning of a tied game . Boston had a 0 – 2 series deficit going to Oakland . After Boston lost Game 3 , Smith surrendered two insurance runs after entering Game 4 with the score 2 – 1 to complete the four @-@ game sweep . 
 Smith 's salary rose to over $ 1 @.@ 4 million , but he followed his 1988 season with a mediocre 1989 , finishing with his worst ERA in five years . For the seventh consecutive season , his number of innings pitched decreased or remained the same . However , he compiled 12 @.@ 23 strikeouts per nine innings , nearly two higher than any other season of his career . It was also the last of his four seasons with more than 10 strikeouts per nine innings . 
 Smith 's statistics for the 1980s gave him a valid claim as the best reliever of the decade , although he was rivaled by Jeff Reardon . While Smith had four consecutive 30 @-@ save seasons , Reardon finished the decade with five consecutive . Smith saved 234 games by the end of 1989 , and Reardon had 266 . Reardon was also a member of the 1987 World Series @-@ winning Minnesota Twins . On December 6 , 1989 , the Red Sox had both closers on their roster when they signed Reardon as a free agent . Two of the past decade 's most dominating closers in history were even pitching in games together for Boston for the first month of 1990 with Reardon setting up Smith for a save on April 18 — a game started by a third famous pitcher , Roger Clemens . The unusual double @-@ closer situation lasted less than a month before Smith was traded to St. Louis for slugging outfielder Tom <unk> on May 4 , 1990 . 
 = = = St. Louis Cardinals ( 1990 – 93 ) = = = 
 As was the case in Boston , Lee Smith 's first game with St. Louis went poorly as he gave up two runs in his only inning of pitching . He recovered quickly , registered a 0 @.@ 00 ERA for the entire month of July , and finished his partial season with St. Louis with a 2 @.@ 10 ERA and 27 saves . The Cardinals , however , were at a low point in 1990 , finishing in last place for the only time since 1918 . In 1991 , St. Louis righted their ship , and Smith accumulated saves at a record pace . With his salary roughly doubled to nearly $ 2 @.@ 8 million , Smith reached 40 saves for the first time in his career . On September 28 , he picked up save number 45 to tie Bruce Sutter 's National League record from 1984 ( Coincidentally , when Sutter and Smith reached 45 saves in their respective seasons , both were ex @-@ Cubs pitching for St. Louis against the Cubs ) . Smith claimed the league record for himself three days later and finished the season with a career @-@ high 47 saves . One difference for him in 1991 was walks as he surrendered only 1 @.@ 60 walks per nine innings , by far the best in his career to that point . Smith won his first Rolaids Relief Award , received the most significant consideration for league MVP in his career , and finished second in Cy Young Award voting behind only Tom Glavine , who had a breakout 20 @-@ win season in 1991 . 
 In the early 1990s , records were falling quickly for closers . Lee Smith set the single @-@ season National League record for saves in 1991 and was on pace to break his own record in 1992 . However , he fell four short of his record , which was broken the following season by Rod Beck . In 1992 , Smith 's former teammate , Jeff Reardon , broke the career saves record held for over a decade by Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers . However , Smith was registering saves at a faster pace than Reardon and by the end of 1992 , he was not far behind him on the career list . Just two weeks into the 1993 season , Smith passed Reardon with career save number 358 . At age 37 , Reardon was slowing down , and Smith was well in front of him when Reardon retired in 1994 . The day after setting the career major league record , he saved his 301st National League game to break that record as well . ( As had been the case with the single @-@ season NL record , the career NL record was held by Bruce Sutter ) . Smith had 15 saves in June 1993 , the most ever in one month for a pitcher until John Wetteland and Chad Cordero tied him in June 1996 and June 2005 , respectively . He reached 30 saves in only the 83rd game of the season , tying the record set by Bobby Thigpen in 1990 for the earliest any pitcher had reached 30 saves . ( Éric Gagné broke the record in 2002 ) . While only in August , Smith logged his 40th save for the third consecutive year , but his ERA had ballooned to a career @-@ worst 4 @.@ 50 . Also , the Cardinals were ten games behind Philadelphia , seemingly out of contention , and Smith was poised to become a free agent after the season . On August 31 , 1993 , the Cardinals traded Smith to the Yankees for Rich Batchelor . Smith left the team as their all @-@ time save leader until Jason Isringhausen passed him on June 13 , 2006 . 
 = = = Final years ( 1993 – 97 ) = = = 
 The Yankees were just 1 ½ games behind the Toronto Blue Jays when they acquired Lee Smith , and he pitched nearly perfectly for the last month of the season . In eight games , Smith did not allow a single run and picked up three saves and 11 strikeouts . The Yankees as a team , however , did poorly during the remainder of the season , and Toronto easily pulled away to win the division . Smith 's New York career lasted just those eight games as he filed for free agency after the season . He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $ 1 @.@ 5 million plus incentives . 
 At age 36 , Smith started 1994 pitching better than ever . In his first 12 games , he had 12 saves and a 0 @.@ 00 ERA . After nearly two months , his ERA was still under 1 @.@ 00 and it was still under 2 @.@ 00 in mid @-@ July . Smith had been selected for the All @-@ Star Game in 1991 , 1992 and 1993 but had not played . After his sixth selection in 1994 , Smith was brought into the game to hold a two @-@ run American League lead in the ninth inning . Instead , he gave up a game @-@ tying two @-@ run home run to Fred McGriff , and the AL lost in ten innings . Smith 's bad streak continued for the next several weeks until the 1994 – 95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season . He filed for free agency again and signed a two @-@ year contract with the California Angels for over $ 2 @.@ 5 million while the strike was still in progress . 
 In 1995 , Smith registered a save in every appearance from April 28 to June 25 . On June 11 , he saved his 16th consecutive game to break the major league record set by Doug Jones in 1988 . He ran his streak to 19 games before finally blowing a save on June 28 . ( John Wetteland broke the record the next year by saving 24 straight ) . After keeping his ERA at 0 @.@ 00 through the first two months of the season , he was selected to his seventh and final All @-@ Star Game , thereby becoming only the fourth player to be an All @-@ Star for four different teams ( after Walker Cooper , George Kell and Goose Gossage ) . Smith did not fare well for the next month , pushing his ERA all the way up to 5 @.@ 40 . Regardless , the Angels held a double @-@ digit lead in the division and seemed set for the postseason . Instead , California suffered one of the worst collapses in major league history , blowing the entire double @-@ digit lead in less than six weeks . While the rest of the team was reeling , Smith reverted to his early @-@ season form and pitched fantastically for the last two months , only blowing one save attempt in that span . He finished the season with 37 saves and a 3 @.@ 47 ERA , which was more than a point higher than the league average . 
 For 1996 , the Angels replaced Smith in the closer role with second @-@ year pitcher Troy Percival . After only eight games as a setup pitcher , Smith , who was unhappy in California , was traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27 . He resumed setup duty for the Reds — this time for Jeff Brantley , who was in the midst of his best season — but did not fare as well in his return to the National League . His ERA was nearly as high as the league average , his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years , and the Reds granted him free agency after the season . 
 He was picked up by the Montreal Expos in the following season for only $ 400 @,@ 000 and had the worst season of his career . His last game of the season was two innings of relief during extra innings of an all @-@ Canada interleague game ( sometimes called the Pearson Cup ) won by Toronto on July 2 . It turned out to be the last game of his major league career . On July 15 , 1997 , Lee Smith announced his retirement . 
 After posting career @-@ worsts in ERA ( 5 @.@ 82 ) , hits per nine innings ( 11 @.@ 63 ) and several other statistics and then announcing his retirement in mid @-@ July , Smith was released by the Expos on September 25 , 1997 . Regardless , the Kansas City Royals signed Smith as a free agent and invited him to spring training for 1998 . When he refused to start the season in the minor leagues , the Royals released him . Later in 1998 , he signed a minor league deal with the Houston Astros , but with an ERA near 7 @.@ 00 at Triple @-@ A , he retired from the majors again . 
 = = Post @-@ retirement = = 
 Two years after his retirement in 1998 , Smith went to work as a roving minor league pitching instructor for the San Francisco Giants . A former teammate , Dick <unk> , and the manager of the Double @-@ A Shreveport Captains , Jack Hiatt , offered the job to Smith , who gladly agreed , since it was right in his hometown . Smith still held this job with the Giants as of 2009 . 
 In the 2006 World Baseball Classic , Smith served as the pitching coach of the South Africa national baseball team , which was given 20 @,@ 000 to 1 odds of winning the tournament . In 2007 , Smith participated as a coach in the second annual European Baseball Academy for Major League Baseball International in <unk> , Italy . The Academy provides instruction to young players from Europe and Africa , several of whom have signed professional contracts . 
 Lee Smith became the father of twins , Nicholas and Alanna , in October 2003 . He also has three children from a previous marriage , Nikita ( born c . 1987 ) , Lee Jr . ( born c . 1989 ) and Dimitri ( born c . 1993 ) . 
 = = Hall of Fame candidacy = = 
 In 1995 , Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning sportswriter Jim Murray selected Lee Smith as the active player most likely to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame , describing him as " the best one @-@ inning pitcher the game ever saw " , and " the best at smuggling a game into the clubhouse in history . " Since his retirement two years later , much speculation has centered on Smith 's specific chances of becoming a member of the Hall of Fame as well as the criteria for relief pitchers and closers in general . Only Hoyt Wilhelm , Rollie Fingers , Dennis Eckersley , Goose Gossage , and Bruce Sutter have been inducted into the Hall of Fame @-@ based primarily on their relief pitching , and only Sutter has been inducted with fewer innings or starting appearances than Smith . In addition , Fingers and Eckersley – the only two to be elected in fewer than eight tries – won MVP awards , and Sutter captured a Cy Young Award , but Smith was rarely a serious contender for either trophy . He pitched in a transitional era , when closers began to be expected to pitch only a single inning ; although Smith and Goose Gossage each pitched in slightly over 1 @,@ 000 games , Gossage ended his career with over 500 more innings . Sutter was the first pitcher ever elected to the Hall with fewer than 1 @,@ 700 innings pitched ; Smith , who pitched fewer innings every year from 1982 through 1989 and never pitched more than 75 innings after 1990 , ended his career with fewer than 1 @,@ 300 . In 2005 , statistician Alan Schwarz described Smith as a long shot for election despite the career record , and used <unk> data to compare the saves of several top relievers including Smith , Eckersley , Fingers , Gossage and Sutter . While Smith 's save percentage ( 82 % ) , outs per save ( 3 @.@ 72 ) and average of inherited runners per game ( .50 ) compared well with Eckersley 's marks ( 84 % , 3 @.@ 33 , <unk> ) , his figures in the last two categories sharply trailed those of the others ; Fingers , Gossage and Sutter all averaged between 4 @.@ 72 and 4 @.@ 82 outs per save , with Sutter inheriting <unk> runners per game and the other two <unk> , suggesting their saves were harder to achieve . Smith started his career earning multiple @-@ inning saves , but the strategy in baseball for closers changed , and he was later used as a one @-@ inning pitcher . He had a higher career save percentage than Fingers , Gossage and Sutter . Trevor Hoffman and Mariano Rivera both exceeded Smith 's former record of 478 saves , and the two are now widely considered the best one @-@ inning closers ever . 
 At Sutter 's July 2006 induction to the Hall , Smith talked with reporters about his chances for election . Like many others , he commented that he was puzzled that he had not yet been selected . " This confuses the hell out of me . But I 've always been baffled by it " , he said . Smith 's candidacy may have been hampered by the number of outstanding relievers on the ballot ; Sutter had earned increasing vote totals for nine years before Smith appeared on the ballot , and Gossage — who first appeared on the ballot three years before Smith — has received greater support in each year from 2004 until his induction in 2008 . 
 To be eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame , a candidate needs to receive votes on 75 percent of the total ballots cast by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America . However , if the candidate receives less than 5 percent , he is no longer eligible for future Hall of Fame consideration by the BBWAA . Smith was first eligible for the ballot five years after he retired , and is allowed to be on the ballot through 2017 if he continues to meet the minimum vote threshold . Should he fail to be elected by the BBWAA , he will remain eligible for consideration by the Veterans Committee ; under current rules , his first chance for consideration by that body would be in 2019 for the induction class of 2020 . In his first year of eligibility , 2003 , Smith received 210 votes , or 42 percent of the 496 total ballots cast . The following year , Smith only received 185 votes , or 37 percent of the 506 total ballots cast . In 2005 , Smith improved from the previous year 's results , and received a total of 200 votes , or 39 percent of the 516 total cast . Smith came closer to joining the Hall of Fame in 2006 by receiving 45 percent of the ballots cast , or 234 votes . In 2007 , Smith 's received only 217 votes , just 40 percent of the 545 total ballots cast . Smith increased his total in 2008 , with 235 votes , 43 @.@ 3 % of the total ballots cast . He received 44 @.@ 5 % of the vote in 2009 and 47 @.@ 3 % of the vote in 2010 . In 2011 , he received 45 @.@ 3 % of the vote . He peaked at a new high of 50 @.@ 6 % in 2012 , but dropped down to 47 @.@ 8 % the following year . In 2014 , he dropped to 29 @.@ 9 % , but received 30 @.@ 2 % of the vote in 2015 . 
 Smith is the last player to be on 15 BBWAA ballots after the Hall of Fame reduced eligibility to ten years . His final year of eligibility is 2017 . 
 = Anglo @-@ Norman horse = 
 The Anglo @-@ Norman horse is a warmblood horse breed developed in Lower Normandy in northern France . A major center of horse breeding , the area had numerous regional types that were bred to one another and then crossed with Thoroughbreds to form the Anglo @-@ Norman . Various body types developed within the Anglo @-@ Norman breed , two of which were split off to form the Norman Cob and French Trotter . The remaining types were eventually standardized , although there remained some criticism of the " hybrid " nature of the breed 's conformation . However , it is successful as an international sport horse , especially in the sport of show jumping . The Anglo @-@ Norman also contributed to the development of several other breeds in Europe and Asia . 
 The Anglo @-@ Norman was developed in the early 19th century , and along with Thoroughbred and local Norman blood , influences were seen from other breeds , including British and Russian trotting horses . By the mid @-@ 19th century , the Anglo @-@ Norman was a popular breed throughout France , and in 1864 a breed association was founded . While often purchased by the French army and used as cavalry and artillery horses , there was controversy over whether the Anglo @-@ Norman was the best choice for the military . The late 19th century saw significant improvements in breeding programs , although there remained a dispute between the goals of breeders and the needs of the military . Mechanization in the early 20th century significantly reduced demand for the breed , and fighting during World War II and the German occupation of France resulted in major damage to breeding centers and the deaths of many horses . While rebuilding their herds , breeders turned away from draft and carriage horses and began breeding sport horses for equestrian competition . 
 A stud book was created for the Anglo @-@ Norman in 1950 , and during that decade the breed became successful in international competition . In 1958 , the Anglo @-@ Norman is combined with other French types to create the Selle Français , the national French saddle horse . Despite active government support for Selle Français breeding programs , variations remained , and Anglo @-@ Norman bloodlines continued to be distinguishable for decades after the merge . In the 1990s and 2000s , a movement began to reopen the Anglo @-@ Norman stud book and recreate it as a separate breed from the Selle Français . The plan , which remains open , has been presented to the French Stud Book Commission and Ministry of Agriculture , and created controversy within the French breeding community . In 2015 , the Anglo @-@ Norman Stud Book is open again 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 The conformation of the Anglo @-@ Norman reflected its multiple influences . By 1861 , the French government attempted to standardize the look of various historic Norman horse types by adding large amounts of Thoroughbred blood . The resulting offspring gave rise to the Anglo @-@ Norman . However , in spite of these breeding programs , by 1909 when author Alfred <unk> studied the Anglo @-@ Norman , he described members of the breed as " hybrids from various crosses " . He distinguished three types : trotting horses used for harness racing , carriage horses , and military horses . He subdivided the military type further into heavy cavalry , light cavalry , " cavalry of the line " ( a specific type used by the French ) and artillery horses . Anglo @-@ Norman trotters were the fastest in France , and were reputed to be patient and hard @-@ working . The first official trotting races in France took place in 1836 , in Cherbourg , at the instigation of Ephrem Houël , an officer of the National Stud . He believed that trotting races were the best way to select breeding stock for producing saddle horses . The best of the Anglo @-@ Norman trotting horses emerged between 1820 and 1870 , with five major stallions becoming the foundation bloodstock for the French Trotter breed , which officially split from the Anglo @-@ Norman breed in 1906 . The continuing breeding goal of the Anglo @-@ Norman was to maintain a balanced breed with input from Thoroughbred stallions and heavier mares of the original Norman type . 
 By 1966 , the Anglo @-@ Norman breed had been further standardized and was described as averaging 15 @.@ 1 to 16 @.@ 3 hands ( 61 to 67 inches , 155 to 170 cm ) high , although sometimes taller . The facial profile was convex , the neck long , and the shoulders and hindquarters powerful . The breed had a tendency to have a too @-@ upright shoulder angle and one author still criticized the horses as " ... [ consisting ] of two inharmonious and badly united pieces , one being Norman ; the other , English " , suggesting that better results would occur if breeders used higher @-@ quality broodmares . Despite this criticism , Anglo @-@ Normans were known for their jumping abilities , with many successful horses competing at the international level . 
 = = History = = 
 The original horses in Normandy and Brittany were small horses called bidets , introduced by the Celts , who settled in ancient Gaul beginning about the third century BC . Later , the Romans crossed them with larger mares . By the 6th century , the practice of horse racing was documented in the region , and beginning in the 10th century , these " Norman horses " were desired throughout Europe . During the 16th century , Norman horses were known to be heavy and strong , able to pull long distances , and used to pull artillery and diligences . Barb and Arabian blood was added during the reign of Louis XIV . 
 The development of the modern Anglo @-@ Norman horse is similar to that of many other French regional equine populations of the 19th century , when government @-@ run national studs transformed indigenous French horses by introducing foreign stallions . Arabians and Thoroughbreds were major influences . The most common crossbreeding was between native mares used by the military or for pulling carriages and Thoroughbred stallions , and by 1914 these types were recognized as " demi @-@ sang " or " half @-@ blood " horses . Half @-@ blood horses were found in many French regions , and different types were usually named after the regions in which they were bred . The origin of the Anglo @-@ Norman was in Lower Normandy , known for horse breeding , thanks to its climate and soil . The breed developed region @-@ specific specializations . Le Merlerault is the oldest area of origin , and mainly produced saddle horses , while the Cotentin and Auge valleys produced carriage horses . The main center for breeding , especially during the Second French Empire ( 1852 @-@ 1870 ) , was the plains around Caen , where young foals were placed on pasture . The National Studs at Saint @-@ Lô and du Pin , originally military studs for the breeding of cavalry horses , also participated in the breeding of Anglo @-@ Norman horses . At the end of the 19th century , in the Orne , the Anglo @-@ Norman arose almost exclusively in the district of Alençon , specifically Merlerault , with a few being bred in the department of Calvados . Today , Normandy , still a horse breeding center , is home to 20 percent of all mares of the Selle Français breed , the national French sport horse developed in large part from the Anglo @-@ Norman . The region has produced numerous Selle Français that have been successful in international competition . 
 During its early development , the Norman horse , also known as the Carrossier Normand , had several distinct types : the Merlerault ; the horse from the plains of Caen ; the Cotentin , from the area of the same name ; the horse of La Hague ; and other , more minor , variations . From Alençon , the Merlerault was developed from the Thoroughbred and was very popular at the end of the Ancien Régime , which lasted until the late 18th century . It was a mid @-@ sized type , particularly suited for riding and pulling small carriages . The Cotentin was the oldest type of Carrossier Normand from which the Anglo @-@ Normans were in large part developed , and was also the ancestor of the Norman Cob . Intended for the luxury carriage trade , <unk> horses were larger and slower than trotting horses bred for racing . Standing 14 @.@ 3 to 15 @.@ 3 hands ( 59 to 63 inches , 150 to 160 cm ) , the type was almost always black in color , allowing drivers to easily form matched teams . Until 1775 , Cotentin horses were unrivaled in popularity in France and some other parts of Europe as carriage horses , and remained one of the most popular carriage horse breeds in the world until the early 19th century , when they disappeared due to unchecked crossbreeding . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 After the Napoleonic Wars , there were almost no saddle horses remaining in France . This situation was exacerbated by improvements to the roads , resulting in a large demand for carriage horses , further reducing demand for riding horses . Between 1815 and the 1850s , only the wealthy and the army continued to purchase riding horses . Early in the 19th century , in Lower Normandy , breeders focused on the Carrossier Normand , the ancestor of the Anglo @-@ Norman and the French Trotter , which was mainly used as a carriage horse . When the Carrossier Normand was crossed with Thoroughbreds , a practice which likely started around 1830 , the resulting mix was called the " Anglo @-@ Norman " . When other local native mares were crossed with Thoroughbreds and Arabians , however , the early results were disappointing . However , despite very low population numbers of riding horses , in the early 1850s , author Ephrem Houël noted a type of Norman saddle horse still extant in Le Merlerault . 
 Beginning in the early 1850s , with the arrival of the Second French Empire , the Anglo @-@ Norman became a popular breed in France , competing with the Thoroughbred . It was reputed to be a versatile horse , appropriate for riding and pulling light carriages . From 1840 to 1860 , the breed was further influenced by part @-@ Thoroughbred trotting horses from England . Local Norman mares were crossed with imported Thoroughbreds , Norfolk Trotters , Orlov Trotters and other crossbred horses , which themselves had Norfolk and <unk> blood . By 1855 , the quality of the resulting animals had ensured the breed 's success , and the Anglo @-@ Norman spread throughout France , especially supplanting another type of riding horse from the south , the Limousin horse . In 1864 , the Société du cheval français de demi @-@ sang ( Society of French Half @-@ Blood Horses ) was founded , which later became the Société d 'encouragement à l 'élevage du cheval français ( Society to <unk> French Horse Breeding ) . The breeders spread the description of Norman horses , particularly Anglo @-@ Normans , as versatile horses that could be used for both riding and driving . 
 The French conquest of Algeria ( 1830 @-@ 1847 ) brought the Anglo @-@ Norman into competition with the Barb horse . In 1873 , the <unk> law was passed , which established premiums for French horse breeders , while taxing imported horses . The protectionism was the result of the desire of native French breeders to protect their interests against imports from the French colonies . The law was named after Edward <unk> , a politician from Calvados , who argued that the law was supportive of French agriculture , and especially the Anglo @-@ Norman breed . He called the Anglo @-@ Norman a " horse of the time ... suitable for all services . " He said that they were useful for both riding and driving , and sought after by both military and commercial interests . The law significantly increased national breeding standards and encouraged the production of half @-@ blood horses , especially Anglo @-@ Normans , for military use . The development of the Anglo @-@ Norman saddle horse breed had long been delayed by a focus on the production of fashionable carriage horses . This resulted in the military imposing major breeding changes on breeders , who were often unaware of the jobs their horses performed for the military . However , conflict between breeders and the military often resulted from disagreements over breeding aims . 
 From the 1830s to the interwar period ( 1919 – 1939 ) , the Anglo @-@ Norman was one of the main horses used by the French cavalry . Although author Alfred <unk> stated that it was a good breed for this use , many opposing scholars argued that this was not the case . Military requirements conflicted with Norman breeders , as the carriage horses preferred by the breeders were very different from the style sought by the military , which required fast horses with stamina and agility . According to military equestrian Denis Bogros , the economic weight of the Norman horse breeders was such as they negatively influenced the effectiveness of the French army until the early 20th century , producing only large , overweight trotters that became fatigued more easily than Barbs or Arabians . Bogros states that breeders of Norman horses managed to deceive the French government , through powerful lobbying groups , by selling the military rejects from the breeding programs . The Anglo @-@ Norman was a commercial success as carriage horses , but proved worthless for the cavalry . This led to the creation of the Société du cheval de guerre ( Society of the War Horse ) , which in 1906 severely criticized the use of the Anglo @-@ Norman . Bogros considered the Anglo @-@ Arabians bred near Tarbes to be much more useful for the military . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 With the mechanization of transport and the military in the 20th century , the Anglo @-@ Norman was no longer in demand as a carriage and military horse . In addition , World War II and the German occupation of France caused significant damage to the Norman homeland of the breed as fighting destroyed farms and killed half of the horses at the National Stud at Saint @-@ Lô . Most of the surviving were of the Norman Cob breed , and horses lost their status as animals of luxury and leisure . Many farms were left in ruins , and breeders were left rethinking their breeding aims . Certain provisions of the Marshall Plan convinced them not to focus on breeding draft horses , and that type began to disappear . Instead , emphasis shifted toward producing horses for equestrian sports , and a stud book was created for the Anglo @-@ Norman breed on December 7 , 1950 , at Saint @-@ Lô . In the 1950s and 1960s , the Anglo @-@ Norman became a major force in international equine competition . At the 1964 Summer Olympics , the Anglo @-@ Norman <unk> B won a gold medal in show jumping . 
 In 1958 , the Anglo @-@ Norman studbook was combined with other regional warmblood saddle horses such as the Demi @-@ sang du Centre and the Vendéen in order to create a unified national warmblood studbook for the Selle Français or French saddle horse . The French government actively supported the merger of regional types and breeds with a large financial appropriation . In spite of this merger , for decades afterwards , horses from Anglo @-@ Norman bloodlines were clearly identifiable within the Selle Français due to differences in conformation . 
 In August 1996 , breeder Fernand <unk> , of the " Haras des Rouges " stud farm , developed the idea of the Cheval de Sport Anglo @-@ Normand ( <unk> , or Anglo @-@ Norman Sport Horse ) , to preserve the genetic heritage of four generations of Anglo @-@ Norman horses still extant within the Selle Français breed . The plan moved forward in August 2008 with the support of other professional breeders . Their argument was that the Selle Français had become increasingly crossed with other European breeds since the advent of artificial insemination in 1980 and the opening of the stud book to horses of foreign breeds in 2000 ; the theory of jus soli allowed horses of foreign bloodlines to be called Selle Français if they were born in France . The breeders allying themselves with <unk> prefer to return to the original French Anglo @-@ Norman as a regional sport horse . However , when Anglo @-@ Norman breeders as a whole were asked to vote , they rejected the idea of amending the studbook . 
 The idea for the new stud book was presented in December 2009 and November 2011 to the Commission des livres <unk> ( Stud Book Commission ) and on May 24 , 2013 , to the Ministry of Agriculture . The president of the Association nationale du selle français ( French Saddle Horse Association ) , Bernard Le Courtois , publicly spoke out against the idea on June 18 , 2013 , arguing that competition from other countries is already strong in the world of sport horse breeding , and that creating competition within France should be avoided . He described the proposed re @-@ opening of an Anglo @-@ Norman stud book as " criminal " , saying it would be a step backwards led by a " small group of unscrupulous and fanciful breeders " . In response , the Syndicat des Éleveurs et Cavaliers <unk> de chevaux et <unk> de sport ( Union of Breeders and Professional Riders of Horses and Sport Ponies ) defended the project by stating that the breeder behind the Anglo @-@ Norman stud book project is one of the top in his field in the world , while the Selle Français stud book is " the largest and the most in decline in Europe " . In August 2014 , this new stud book was approved by the French government , and made official on May 27 , 2015 , submitted for publication in the <unk> edition of June 4 , 2015 . As of September 2015 , this stud @-@ book has no horses registered in it yet . 
 = = Influence on other breeds = = 
 The Anglo @-@ Norman was used to create several other breeds of horses throughout Europe and Asia . These included the Greek Andravida , which was created by crossing native Greek mares with Anglo @-@ Norman stallions , and the Swiss Freiberger , a blend of Anglo @-@ Norman lines with Thoroughbreds and native horses from the Jura Mountains . The Hungarian Nonius breed stems from an Anglo @-@ Norman stallion named Nonius Senior , and Anglo @-@ Norman blood was also used to add refinement to the German Oldenburg , through the stallions Condor ( born 1950 ) and Furioso II , a Selle Français . The Anglo @-@ Norman was used to create the Polish Sokolsky horse and the Chinese <unk> breed .

 Lindsay Lohan 's Indian Journey is a 2010 British documentary film directed and produced by <unk> Sahota . It is presented and narrated by American actress Lindsay Lohan . In the hour long documentary , Lohan talks to victims of human trafficking in Delhi , Kolkata and a village in West Bengal . She also talks to a former trafficker , parents of trafficked children and visits the Sanlaap women 's and children 's shelter in Kolkata . The documentary was filmed in India over a period of a week in December 2009 .

 = = Synopsis = = 
 In Lindsay Lohan 's Indian Journey , Lohan meets and interviews victims of human trafficking in Delhi , Kolkata and a village in West Bengal . They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced , describing sexual slavery , physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice . She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children . One trafficked boy says that he can not go back home because his mother is ill . A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food , and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter 's work , at least she was fed . 
 Lohan visits the Sanlaap centre , a women 's and children 's shelter in Kolkata . The centre offers dance therapy as part of their treatment and a group of girls perform a dance they have rehearsed . She talks to girls who had been held at a brothel and they describe being raped and drugged . The director of the Sanlaap centre describes how Lohan taking an interest in trafficking might inspire other young people to get involved in counteracting exploitation . Bharti Ali , director of the Non @-@ governmental organization Centre for Child Rights , criticizes the government for not prioritizing child protection . Returning home , Lohan and the film crew are chased by paparazzi photographers at the airport . Two months later , Lohan is in London , England talking to Kate Redman , from Save the Children UK , who describes how one of the issues with government intervention is that only sex and drug trafficking is illegal . She also advocates raising awareness of the issues with trafficking .

 Lohan spent a week in December 2009 in India filming Lindsay Lohan 's Indian Journey with a BBC crew consisting of four people . Lohan became involved in the documentary after meeting Sahota at a social event and expressing her interest in doing it . Sahota stated that he was under the impression that Lohan chose to participate in the documentary " as a result of working in an adult world since she was ten , she feels childhood is precious , and when you lose one you can never replace those years " . He also stated that the people they met in rural India were not previously familiar with Lohan . 
 On the second day of filming the documentary , Lohan posted a message on her Twitter account stating : " Over 40 children saved so far ... Within one day 's work " . Indian non @-@ governmental organization , Bachpan Bachao Andolan , said she had not been part of the raid mentioned and threatened legal action over the post . BBC said Lohan was " misinterpreted " and that " she was merely referring to a raid that happened connected to child trafficking " . A few days later Lohan posted again on Twitter praising the work of Bachpan Bachao Andolan . She was originally scheduled to be present for the raid , but due to rescheduling arrived in the country too late . Lohan had also been scheduled to interview a representative for UNICEF for the documentary , but failed to show up . The BBC failed to ensure that Lohan had a proper work visa , which might lead to her being added to an immigration blacklist in India . Of her experience working on the film , Lohan said : " [ t ] he strength of the young boys and girls I met has been truly humbling " and " I hope my presence in India will bring awareness to the really important issues raised in making this film " .

 According to John Plunkett of The Guardian : " Few BBC3 programmes have generated quite so much media attention in such a short space of time . But the controversy generated by Lindsay Lohan 's Indian Journey ... was not quite matched by its ratings " . In its original broadcast on BBC Three on Thursday , 1 April 2010 , the documentary was viewed by 224 @,@ 000 households . It had a 0 @.@ 9 % share of the audience between 9pm and 10pm . 
 Critics complimented Lindsay Lohan 's Indian Journey for being well researched and compelling , but they also found Lohan 's presence to be odd . In her Lost in Showbiz column in The Guardian , Marina Hyde repeatedly criticized the documentary , in particular the choice to include Lohan , since its inception . She mentions Lohan 's then recent conviction for " drink @-@ driving and drug possession " , describing her as a " trainwreck star " with a " [ career ] ... in foreclosure " and goes on to question if BBC was doing " image @-@ laundering services " and whether the decision to hire Lohan was " symptomatic of a wider cultural malaise " . Salon.com 's Mary Elizabeth Williams likewise criticized BBC3 's decision to have Lohan , whom she called a " disaster @-@ prone starlet " , front the programme , though she also said that " an effort that raises awareness of a global epidemic – even one that employs a crazy hot chick – is still an effort . " 
 Amelia Gentleman of The Guardian described Lohan as " better known for what is euphemistically termed a party lifestyle " and said that while her participation did bring publicity to the project , the attention was uniformly negative and about her person , not the issues . Of the documentary she said that " the material is potent and persuasive " , but that Lohan was a " constant , distracting presence " . Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote a satirical , mocking letter ostensibly from the point of view of Lohan : " Some of these kids are sent to work when they 're so young . Which I can relate to because I started out working as a child model aged three , and got into movies when I was 11 . I can , like , so totally understand where these people are coming from " . 
 Andrew Billen of The Times described the documentary as " a crash @-@ course sentimental education " and " a rush job " . He said that rather than highlight the crime of trafficking , " the spotlight was effectively turned on Lohan and under it she wilted " . In a review in The Times , Caitlin Moran wrote that the juxtaposition of Lohan with the human suffering of trafficking made for " an odd , disconcerting programme " . Alice @-@ Azania Jarvis of The Independent found the documentary " very well put @-@ together , very thoroughly researched , and very compelling " and she said that the inclusion of Lohan was " definitely not a terrible choice . Just a very , very odd one . " 
 = Sydney punchbowls = 
 The Sydney punchbowls , made in China during Emperor Chia Ch 'ing 's reign in 1796 – 1820 , are the only two known examples of Chinese export porcelain hand painted with Sydney scenes and dating from the Macquarie era . The bowls were procured in Canton about three decades after the First Fleet 's arrival at Port Jackson where the British settlement at Sydney Cove was established in 1788 . They also represent the trading between Australia and China via India at the time . Even though decorated punchbowls were prestigious items used for drinking punch at social gatherings during the 18th and 19th centuries , it is not known who originally commissioned these bowls or what special occasion they were made for . 
 The punchbowls are a ' harlequin pair ' , similar but not exactly matching . The bowls have been donated independently , one to the State Library of New South Wales ( <unk> ) in 1926 and the other to the Australian National Maritime Museum ( ANMM ) in 2006 . The Library bowl is the more widely known of the pair . Its earliest provenance places it in England in the late 1840s , where it is said to originally have been commissioned for William Bligh ; another source suggests Henry Colden Antill . It passed through several owners in Britain before it was presented to the State Library . The Museum bowl 's first provenance is from England in 1932 and it has been suggested that it was made to the order of Arthur Phillip . Its whereabouts were unknown until it appeared in the Newark Museum , United States , in 1988 , on loan from Peter Frelinghuysen Jr .. Through donations , the Maritime Museum later acquired the punchbowl from Frelinghuysen . 
 The punchbowls are of polychrome famille rose with gilding , adorned with panoramic views from opposite vantage points of early 19th century Sydney , combined with traditional Chinese porcelain decorations and each features a rare , lively tondo grouping of Aboriginal figures . The panoramas are detailed and show a number of landmarks in and around Sidney Cove at the time . The motifs have probably been taken from artwork by several artists working in Australia during the 18th and early 19th century .

 Hand painted Chinese porcelain dinner wares became the height of fashion in Europe and North America during the 18th century as a way showing off wealth and status in society . The porcelain was ordered through different East India Companies and later independent American traders ; all Western trading companies with ships sailing to China . The porcelain was decorated with a combination of Chinese patterns and Western motifs selected by its commissioner . The Chinese manufacturers sent porcelain samples of decorations to their prospective clients in Europe and the United States and their clients provided the porcelain painters in China with paintings , drawings or sketches for their orders . These dinner wares are categorized into familles ( French for " families " ) mainly by the colors they are painted in such as famille <unk> , noire , jaune and rose . 
 These sets of tableware included all the dishes necessary to set a grand table for a gala dinner . A 1766 order form from the Swedish East India Company stated that " small services " contained 224 pieces and a " larger service " 281 pieces . <unk> however , were not included in these sets , they were ordered separately as showcase pieces . The bowls were used to serve hot or cold drinks at special occasions in clubs , at social gatherings and in wealthy homes , or before or after grand dinners . 
 After the British settlement at Sydney Cove was established in 1788 , a significant part of the Chinese porcelain shipped to Australia came via British traders living in India . Operating under licences issued by the British East India Company , who held a commercial monopoly in the Far East , this trade was known as the ' Country Trade ' , the Indian ships were called ' Country Ships ' and their captains ' Country Captains ' . Examination of the cargo of ships wrecked during the early colonisation of Australia show that the Country Trade played an important role in getting supplies , including Chinese porcelain traded via India often in Indian @-@ built vessels , to the early Australian colonies . 
 The two Sydney punchbowls are the only known examples of Chinese export porcelain hand painted with Sydney scenes and dating from the Macquarie era , lasting 1810 – 1821 . The bowls were procured in China sometime between 1796 and 1820 ; about three decades after the First Fleet 's arrival at Port Jackson in Sydney Cove . By 1850 Chinese @-@ made porcelain imports had been replaced with British <unk> transfer @-@ printed with decoration of Chinese derivation . 
 = = = Function = = = 
 Whilst the drinking of punch from punchbowls was an actual social practice of the times , the Sydney Cove punchbowls were specially commissioned and expensive items which had other purposes . Such punchbowls were prestigious items owned by individuals of high rank in society , such as John Hosking Sydney 's first elected Mayor , and New York 's fourth Governor Daniel Tomkins , who also acquired a punchbowl . The two punchbowls , previously owned by Hosking , are the first Chinese objects acquired by the Australiana Fund . The bowls could also have been commissioned as commemorative gifts , like the 1812 Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania Union Lodge punchbowl <unk> and the New York City punchbowl presented to the City of New York on 4 July 1812 . It has also been suggested that , given the Aboriginal marriage motif , the Sydney punchbowls may have been a marriage gift . <unk> were also regarded as exotic souvenirs at the time . 
 It is also possible the Sydney punchbowls may have had other purposes – to promote the fledgling settlement and to encourage new settlers . In 1820 , artist John William Lewin 's patron , merchant Alexander Riley , looking for ways to promote the New South Wales colony , stated : " It has long been a subject of our consideration in this Country that a Panorama exhibited in London of the Town of Sydney and surrounding scenery would create much public interest and ultimately be of service to the Colony " . This purpose is clearly set forth even in the title of William Charles Wentworth 's tome on New South Wales , which contained the engraving of Lewin 's Sydney Cove painting . The full title ends " ... With a Particular <unk> of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration , and Their Superiority in Many <unk> Over Those Possessed by the United States of America " . The punchbowls were also an opportunity to present the art of topographical panoramas in the form of a high status object and to portray the new colony in a more glamorous way than that of simply a remote convict colony as perceived at the time . 
 = = = Commissioning = = = 
 The gilded monogram initials on the Library punchbowl are perhaps the only current clue as to the original commissioner of the punchbowls . The initials are difficult to decipher because of partial loss of the gilt <unk> script . Possibilities include HCA or HA , TCA or FCA over B. Several candidates have been suggested including Henry , 3rd Earl of Bathurst , and Sir Thomas Brisbane , New South Wales Governor in 1821 – 1825 after Lachlan Macquarie , but the most likely is Henry Colden Antill ( 1779 – 1852 ) . Antill was appointed aide @-@ de @-@ camp to the fifth New South Wales Governor , Macquarie who was in office 1810 – 1821 , on his arrival in Sydney on 1 January 1810 . He was promoted to Major of Brigade in 1811 and retired from the British Army in 1821 . Antill settled on land first at Moorebank near Liverpool and then in 1825 on his estate near Picton — named <unk> in honour of Macquarie 's first wife , Jane Jarvis . He was buried at <unk> on 14 August 1851 . Antill had subdivided part of the estate in 1844 , making possible the founding of the town of Picton . When the State Library acquired its punchbowl in 1926 , the Antill family of Picton — Henry 's antecedents — had no knowledge of the punchbowl 's provenance . 
 = = = 20th @-@ century provenance = = = 
 = = = = The Library punchbowl = = = = 
 The State Library 's punchbowl was the earlier of the two to become more widely known . It was presented to the Library by Sydney antiques dealer , auctioneer and collector , William Augustus Little , in November 1926 , an event reported in the Sydney Evening News on 3 November 1926 . The punchbowl discovery itself was reported in several Australian newspapers earlier in March , including the The Sydney Morning Herald on 4 March 1926 , with the title Bookshop Find : Relic of Early Sydney . These newspaper articles state that Little bought the punchbowl from London antiquarian bookseller , Francis Edwards Ltd of 83 Marylebone High Street and that Little subsequently had it appraised by experts from the Victoria and Albert Museum ( V & A ) in February 1926 . The newspapers report that the V & A wished to keep the bowl . The articles also state that the bowl had " paintings of Sydney in 1810 , executed to the order of Major Antill who was Governor Macquarie 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp " . Among the clientele of Francis Edwards Ltd were some of the noted Australiana collectors of the day , including William Dixon , James Edge @-@ Partington , David Scott Mitchell and the Mitchell Library itself . 
 Before Little 's purchase , the punchbowl had been the property of Sir Timothy Augustine Coghlan , New South Wales Agent @-@ General in London , who bought the bowl for ₤ 40 in 1923 from one Miss Hall for his own collection . The bowl was subsequently in the possession of Francis Edwards Ltd before Coghlan 's unexpected death in London on 30 April 1926 . Coghlan had personally collected the bowl from a Miss Hall at ' Highfield ' , 63 Seabrook Rd , Hythe ( Kent ) , England , a few months after she had decided to offer the bowl to the New South Wales Government for ₤ 50 . Earlier , a visit to Miss Hall by a Sydney schoolteacher , Jessie Stead , on 6 August 1923 , resulted in the proposal that the bowl ought to be the property of the City of Sydney . Jessie Stead later indicated that she was informed by Miss Hall that her father had acquired the bowl in the late 1840s – the earliest dating for the punchbowls ' provenance – and that Miss Hall believed the bowl was commissioned for William Bligh , New South Wales 's fourth Governor ( in office 1806 – 1808 ) . In 2002 , the State Library of New South Wales digitised the punchbowl images with the support of the Nelson Meers Foundation , a philanthropic foundation supporting Australian arts , and the bowl became one of the 100 extraordinary library objects to be exhibited as part of Mitchell Library 's centenary celebrations in 2010 .

 The second Sydney punchbowl had a much more circuitous journey to the present . The bowl first appeared in May 1932 , when Sir Robert Witt , chairman of the British National Art Collections Fund , wrote to James MacDonald , Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales , inquiring if a Sydney museum would be interested in acquiring the second punchbowl . The Gallery Director referred the offer to William Herbert Ifould , Principal Librarian of the Public Library of New South Wales , in August 1932 . Ifould wrote directly to Sir Robert Witt indicating that the bowl was not required by the Library as a very similar one was already held . Ifould received a reply dated 31 October 1932 , stating that during the intervening months the owner of the bowl in England – whose name was undisclosed – had since sold the bowl to another undisclosed buyer . The bowl 's subsequent whereabouts was unknown until 1988 . In the original offer by Sir Robert – who had also co @-@ founded the Courtauld Institute of Art in London – a suggestion was made that this bowl had been made to the order of Arthur Phillip , the first Governor of New South Wales ( in office 1788 – 1795 ) who established the settlement at Sydney Cove . However , no evidence to support this view was given in Witt 's letter . 
 1988 was the bicentenary of non @-@ indigenous settlement in Australia and , as such , there was renewed interest in the ' lost ' second Sydney punchbowl . The bowl eventually turned up in a catalogue for a Chinese export porcelain exhibition at Newark Museum , New Jersey , United States , titled Chinese Export Porcelain : A Loan Exhibition from New Jersey Collections . The bowl had been lent by Peter Frelinghuysen Jr . , a former United States Congressman ( in office 1953 – 1975 ) . The discovery was made by Terry Ingram , a Sydney journalist specialising in antiques and art , who wrote about it in his <unk> column , titled Newark Museum packs Aussie punch , in The Australian Financial Review on 25 August 1988 . It transpired that in the early 1930s , the bowl was acquired by Frelinghuysen 's parents in a private negotiation with the owner at the time the National Art Collections Fund was attempting to raise interest from Sydney 's cultural institutions . This discovery drew the attention of Paul Hundley , senior curator of the Australian National Maritime Museum ( ANMM ) ' s USA Gallery , the Gallery itself a bicentennial gift of the American people to Australia . In May 2006 , the ANMM announced it had acquired the bowl as a part gift from Frelinghuysen through the American Friends of the ANMM , a charitable organisation recognised by the US Internal Revenue Service which enabled Frelinghuysen to receive appropriate taxation benefits . The Australian Financial Review reported the acquisition in its <unk> column , titled Museum bowled over , on 18 May 2006 . The punchbowl has been on display in the Museum 's USA Gallery ever since . It also features as one of the 100 Stories from the ANMM , has digitised images in the ANMM catalogue and can be viewed on YouTube . At the time the ANMM acquired the punchbowl in 2006 , the bowl was valued at $ <unk> . 
 = = Ceramic origin = = 
 The notes accompanying the State Library 's acquisition of its punchbowl indicate that on 25 February 1926 , William Bowyer Honey , Keeper , Department of Ceramics , Victoria & Albert Museum , had appraised this particular punchbowl . Honey concluded that the bowl was made in China during Emperor Chia Ch 'ing 's reign in 1796 – 1820 . In 1757 , foreign trade had been restricted to Canton . Chinese exports , consisting largely of tea , porcelain and silk , had to be paid for in silver . The European ( and soon the American ) presence was restricted to the Thirteen Factories known as <unk> on the harbour of Canton ( now known as Guangzhou ) . The Canton <unk> themselves are frequently illustrated on punchbowls , known as hong bowls , whereas the portrayal of ports that traded with Canton – such as Sydney and New York – are extraordinarily rare . The Canton System lasted until the defeat of China 's Qing dynasty by the British Empire in the first of the Opium Wars in 1842 . Virtually no Chinese export porcelain was produced from 1839 to 1860 because of the Opium Wars . Canton hong trade was subsequently overshadowed by the rise of Hong Kong as a trading centre – territory ceded to the British as a consequence of China 's military defeats – and the subsequent establishment of 80 Treaty ports along China 's coast . The punchbowls therefore are a product made just before China 's eclipse , commissioned in Canton , where they were painted and glazed by Chinese ceramic artists . The unpainted bowls , however , would have first been manufactured in <unk> , a town 800 km ( 500 mi ) by road from Canton , where pottery factories have operated for nearly 2 @,@ 000 years , and still do today . 
 = = Similarities and differences = = 
 The punchbowls can be considered a harlequin pair as they are similar but not exactly matching . They are both Chinese ceramics ware of Cantonese origin , made of clear glaze on hard @-@ paste porcelain and painted with polychrome famille rose <unk> enamel and gilding . They are similar in size , each approximately 45 cm ( 18 in ) in diameter , 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) high and weighing about 5 @.@ 4 kg ( 12 lb ) , footring 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 in ) high and 22 @.@ 5 cm ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter . Whilst the indigenous Australian groups painted within the inner centre of both bowls are identical , the outer panoramic views of Sydney Cove are not . The Library punchbowl has a view from the eastern side of Sydney Cove whilst the view on the Museum bowl is from Dawes Point on the western shore . This pairing follows a standard convention in late 18th @-@ and early 19th @-@ century topographical art of painting two views of the same scene from opposite vantage points . 
 Whilst the Cantonese ceramic painters would have worked from images of Sydney Cove and the Aboriginal group provided by the customer commissioning the punchbowls , the border and edge trims were generally left to the choice of the ceramic painters . The traditional floral motif of such Chinese flowers as chrysanthemums , peonies , cherry and plum blossom has been applied to the internal borders of both bowls in a similar pattern . However , the external borders differ considerably . The Library bowl has a more traditional Chinese outer border design in vermilion , rose and gilt , whilst the Museum bowl has a trim of looped circles on a cobalt blue ground , edged with narrow gold bands . There are other differences . The Library bowl has large , gilded monogram initials on the outside and the footring has a single narrow gold band and gilded lower edge . However , the Museum bowl has no visible monogram but the footring does have " View of the Town of Sydney in New South Wales " lettered in black . 
 = = Illustration sources = = 
 = = = Sydney Cove = = = 
 The sources of the two illustrations of Sydney Cove and the Aboriginal group are not known . The ceramic colouring bears a general resemblance to contemporary Sydney Cove images which implies that an original watercolour or hand coloured engraving was used for copying rather than black and white images . In the case of the Library punchbowl , the depiction of Sydney Cove is most likely done from an engraving after a now lost drawing by Lewin , which may date to 1814 . This Sydney Cove engraving appeared as a full @-@ page illustration in the second edition of A Statistical , Historical and Political Description of New South Wales and its dependent settlements in Van Diemen 's Land etc ( London , 1820 ) by Wentworth , with a later , smaller , version as one of ten Port Jackson harbour views illustrated on Map of Part of New South Wales ( London , 1825 ) by publisher and engraver , Joseph Cross . As Australia 's first professional artist , Lewin produced many paintings for Macquarie and his senior officers . He also made a number of commissions for Riley . Lewin had a close association with Antill and both were part of Governor Macquarie 's 50 @-@ strong excursion party to inspect land and the new road over the Blue Mountains from 25 April to 19 May 1815 . The road had been built by convicts in 1814 , after the first European crossing by Gregory Blaxland , William Lawson and Wentworth in May 1813 . 
 Unlike the Library punchbowl , the Sydney Cove image on the Museum punchbowl is not known in its entirety in any other version so it is assumed that the original artwork provided by the commissioner to the ceramic artists in China has been lost . The only similar Sydney Cove view of the period is an original watercolour by convict artist Joseph Lycett , which first appeared in an engraved version as page 86 in Views in New South Wales , 1813 – 1814 [ and ] An Historical Account of the Colony of NSW , 1820 – 1821 ( Sydney , 1819 ) by soldier , James Wallis . A second engraved version appeared on page 74 of a similar folio edition Album of original drawings by Captain James Wallis and Joseph Lycett , ca 1817 – 1818 etc by publisher Rudolph Ackermann in London , 1821 . However , the Dawes Point fortifications — designed by the convict architect Francis Greenway — and its gun emplacements , dominate the foreground of both engravings . The Museum punchbowl view pre @-@ dates this as it has , instead , a grassy slope and figures of an Aboriginal man and woman in the equivalent location . The Lycett version has other major differences , including a less extensive vista of the eastern side of the Harbour . 
 = = = Aboriginal group = = = 
 The Aboriginal group forms the inner centre piece in the tondo of both bowls . As the same image was used for both bowls , the implication is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time . The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club , shield and spears , one woman with a baby on her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away from the rest of the figures – and another woman cowed by the men . This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony . As with the Museum bowl 's Sydney Cove image , no directly related , surviving , version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group . The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now @-@ lost original sketch by Nicolas @-@ Martin Petit , artist on the 1800 – 1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin . Research made around 2009 – 2012 , indicated that during Baudin 's expedition , a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove . As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia , Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples . The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25 April 1802 . Petit 's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : <unk> par <unk> du roi ( Paris , 1825 ) , regarding a voyage around the world ( 1817 – 1820 ) led by Louis @-@ Claude de <unk> de Freycinet . The engraving is entitled Port Jackson , <unk> Hollande . <unk> <unk> d 'un mariage , chez les sauvages ( ceremony before a marriage among the natives , Port Jackson , New Holland ) . Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin .

 The panorama on the Library punchbowl begins with a view of the eastern shore of Sydney Cove . In the foreground is an octagonal two @-@ storey , yellow , sandstone house ① , built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff , Billy or William Blue . The drawing of this little house – now the site of the Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size . To the left of the house is a sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves now stand . Facing the beach is First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated . 
 On the western shore is the Rocks district , the convicts ' side of the town , with two windmills on the ridge . The buildings were simple vernacular houses . Newly arrived convicts often found lodging in the district and in the 1790s a large number of the inhabitants were also Aborigines . To the left of The Rocks area is a long , low , military barracks <unk> , built between 1792 and 1818 around Barracks Square / the Parade Ground – which is now Wynyard Park . It was from here that , in 1808 , the New South Wales Corps marched to arrest Macquarie 's predecessor William Bligh , an event later known as the Rum Rebellion . Heading east is St. Philip 's Church ④ – the earliest Christian church ( Church of England ) in Australia – erected in stone in 1810 on Church Hill – now Lang Park . In 1798 , the original wattle and daub church – on what is now the corner of Bligh and Hunter Streets – was burnt down , allegedly by disgruntled convicts in response to a decree by the second New South Wales Governor ( 1795 – 1800 ) , John Hunter , that all colony residents , including officers and convicts , attend Sunday services . The jail had earlier suffered a similar fate . 
 Further along the ridge to the east is Fort Phillip , flying the Union Jack , on Windmill ( later Observatory ) Hill where the Sydney Observatory is now located . It was the highest point above the colony , affording commanding views of the Harbour approaches from east and west . On the waterfront below Fort Phillip is the yellow , four @-@ storey , Commissariat Stores , <unk> , constructed by convicts for Macquarie in 1810 and 1812 . One of the largest buildings constructed in the colony at the time , it is now the site of the Museum of Contemporary Art . The foreshore buildings on the extreme right are the warehouse and " Wharf House " residence of merchant , Robert Campbell <unk> who was to become one of the colony 's biggest landholders . This is now the site of the Sydney Harbour Bridge pylons and is just to the left of Dawes Point . Three British sailing ships , flying either the Red Ensign of the Merchant Navy or ( more likely ) the White Ensign of the Royal Navy , are anchored in the Cove along with four sailboats and five canoes .

 The Sydney Cove panorama on the Museum punchbowl is dated between 1812 and 1818 . The vantage point is from beneath Dawes Point , shown with its flagstaff and before the Dawes Point fortifications built 1818 – 1821 <unk> . Looking directly into Campbell 's Cove , the immediate focal points are Robert Campbell 's warehouse and the " Wharf House " roof of his residence <unk> . To the right of Campbell 's Wharf are extensive stone walls marking boundaries between properties in this part of the Rocks district <unk> . First Government House can be seen at the head of Sydney Cove in the distance ② and around the eastern shore a small rendition of Billy Blue 's 1812 @-@ house ① . The Governor and civil personnel lived on the more orderly eastern slopes of the Tank Stream , compared to the disorderly western side where convicts lived . The Tank Stream was the fresh water course emptying into Sydney Cove and supplied the fledgling colony until 1826 . Further along is <unk> Point – with no sign of Fort Macquarie built from December 1817 – and Garden Island – the colony 's first food source . The distant vista of the eastern side of the Harbour goes almost as far as the Macquarie Lighthouse – Australia 's first lighthouse – built between 1816 and 1818 on South Head . There are seven sailing ships flying the white ensign of the British Royal Navy in the Harbour , along with three sailboats and two canoes . 
 = Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre = 
 The inaugural games were held , on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus , to celebrate the completion in AD 80 ( 81 according to some sources ) of the Colosseum , then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre ( Latin : <unk> <unk> ) . Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian 's death in AD 79 . Titus ' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius , a fire in Rome , and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days , perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods . 
 Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting ( ludi ) . They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games : animal entertainments in the morning session , followed by the executions of criminals around midday , with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles . The animal entertainments , which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire , included extravagant hunts and fights between different species . Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events . Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians . 
 Only three contemporary or near @-@ contemporary accounts of the games survive . The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events , while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive : the fight between Verus and Priscus . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Construction of the amphitheatre = = = 
 Construction of the Colosseum started under Vespasian in a low valley surrounded by the <unk> , Esquiline and Palatine hills . The site became available to Nero by the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 and redeveloped for his personal enjoyment with the construction of a huge artificial lake in the Domus Aurea , and a colossal statue of himself . 
 Vespasian started his own redevelopment of the site around AD 70 to 72 , possibly funding the construction with booty seized after the Roman victory in the First Jewish @-@ Roman War in AD 70 . The lake was in @-@ filled and the site designated as the location for the Flavian Amphitheatre . Reverting the private use by Nero to a more popular social purpose of a <unk> raised Vespasian 's popularity . <unk> schools ( ludi ) and other support buildings were later constructed within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea , much of which had been torn down . 
 Vespasian died just as the structure had reached the third story . Titus was able to finish construction within a year of Vespasian 's death of the amphitheatre and the adjacent public baths ( which were to be called the Baths of Titus ) . 
 = = = Reign of Titus = = = 
 By the time the amphitheatre was completed , Titus 's short reign had already endured a series of disasters : two months after he had succeeded Vespasian , Mount Vesuvius had erupted , destroying Pompeii , Herculaneum , Stabiae , and <unk> ; a fire had burned in the city of Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian ; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured . To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths , and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods , Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days . 
 = = Animal entertainments = = 
 Animal entertainments formed a central part of the games and normally took place in the morning . Dio says that over the course of the inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence . This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote , in the later part of the fourth century , that 5 @,@ 000 animals were slain during the games . 
 Dio and Martial record some of the animals that were exhibited . Dio notes a hunt involving cranes and another involving four elephants , and Martial mentions elephants , lions , leopards , at least one tiger , hares , pigs , bulls , bears , wild boar , a rhinoceros , buffalo and bison ( most likely the wisent ) . Other exotic animals may have been used but are not mentioned ; ostriches , camels and crocodiles were commonly used in the games . Giraffes are unlikely to have been featured ; Julius Caesar had brought a single giraffe to Rome in 46 BC . Another is not recorded in Europe until the Medici giraffe in 1486 , although they were first seen in Rome in 58 BC , and were impressive enough to be detailed in the games of Augustus and Commodus , there is no mention of hippopotami at Titus ' games . 
 Martial reports a contest between an elephant and a bull , and the elephant , having won , knelt before Titus . This may have formed part of its training , but Martial attributed it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor 's power . He also mentions a bull enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by an elephant , but there is nothing to indicate that these two epigrams are about the same events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration . 
 From Martial 's account it appears that some of the animals were would not react in the manner expected of them for the crowds which Martial commented on as an opportunity for Titus to exhibit his command of the beasts ; the lions ignored their intended prey : 
 ... Caesar 's lions are won over by their prey and the hare plays safely in the massive jaws . 
 The rhinoceros , too , proved difficult to handle . It was initially paraded around the arena , but became infuriated and attacked a bull , to the apparent delight of the crowd . Later , when it was supposed to fight , it had calmed down . Intended to face a company of men armed with spears and a host of other animals , it had to be goaded by " trembling trainers " until it would engage the other combatants : 
 ... at length the fury we once knew returned . For with his double horn he tossed a heavy bear as a bull tosses dummies from his head to the stars . [ With how sure a stroke does the strong hand of Carpophorus , still a youth , aim the <unk> spears ! ] He lifted two steers with his mobile neck , to him yielded the fierce buffalo and the bison . A panther fleeing before him ran headlong upon the spears . 
 Carpophorus was a skilled <unk> , specializing in fighting animals in the arena , and is mentioned again by Martial , who compares him to Hercules and praises his abilities in dispatching a bear , a leopard and a lion of " unprecedented size " . A frieze from the Temple of Vespasian and Titus ( Templum Divi <unk> ) in the Roman Forum shows events similar to those described by Martial . Two separate sets of decoration show a rhinoceros confronting a bull and a <unk> , possibly Carpophorus , with a spear , facing a lion and a leopard . Carpophorus was not the only beast slayer worthy of mention : another of Martial 's epigrams refers to a woman equalling Hercules 's feat of slaying the Nemean Lion . 
 While the trainers of the rhinoceros may have trembled in fear at the fate that awaited them if their animal failed to perform , and another trainer was savaged by his lion , some were more successful . One trainer was noted for his tigress which , though tame enough to lick his hand , had torn a lion to pieces , " a novelty unknown in any times " . It also appears that the crowd was pleased when a bull ( perhaps ridden by a <unk> ) was hoisted aloft in the arena , but Martial gives little clue as to the nature of this entertainment . 
 = = Executions = = 
 Executions were a common feature of the Roman games . They took place around midday as an interlude between the animal entertainments of the morning sessions and the gladiatorial combat in the afternoon . Although the executions were seen as symbolizing Rome 's power , the higher classes normally took advantage of this interval to leave the arena to dine ; the Emperor Claudius was criticised by some authors for not doing so , so it is unlikely that Titus would have watched this part of the show . The executions of deserters , prisoners @-@ of @-@ war , and criminals from the lower classes were normally crucifixions or damnatio ad <unk> in which they would face wild animals . Scipio Aemilianus had been the first to execute criminals in this way when he had deserters from his army exposed to wild beasts in 146 BC . These executions often took the form of the re @-@ creation of some tragic scene from history or mythology with the criminal cast in the role of the victim killed by wild beasts . Martial records one such execution , a version of the mime <unk> by Catullus , in which a notorious bandit was executed by crucifixion . For the games this was adapted as a version of the legend of Prometheus , who each day would have his liver devoured by an eagle . The element of crucifixion from Catullus ' mime remained , but a wild bear was substituted for the eagle from the Prometheus legend : 
 As Prometheus , bound on a Scythian crag , fed the tireless bird with his too abundant breast , so did <unk> , hanging on no sham cross , give his naked flesh to a Caledonian bear . His lacerated limbs lived on , dripping gore , and in all his body , body there was none . Finally he met with the punishment he deserved ; the guilty wretch had plunged a sword into his father 's throat or his master 's , or in his madness had robbed a temple of its secret gold , or laid a cruel torch to Rome . The criminal had outdone the misdeeds of ancient story ; in him , what had been a play became an execution . 
 Another execution was staged as a cruel twist on the story of Orpheus , who supposedly charmed the plants and flowers with his song after he lost Eurydice . In the version presented at the inaugural games , the tree and animals were charmed just as in the story , except for an " unappreciative " bear which tore the minstrel to pieces . It is likely that the harmless creatures were released first to give the impression of the story proceeding as planned before the bear was released to dispatch the unfortunate criminal forced into the role of Orpheus , whose probable restraint prevented him fleeing . Ironic reinterpretations of the myths may have been popular : in addition to Orpheus ' failure to charm the beasts , Martial mentions " Daedalus " being torn apart by another bear , mocking him with the words " how you must wish you had your feathers now " . 
 Martial also suggests the rape of a woman by a bull in a re @-@ creation of the myth of Pasiphaë . Nero had provided a similar entertainment at an event he had staged using an actor dressed in the costume of a bull , though Martial claims that the act performed at the inaugural games was authentic . 
 = = Combat , hunting and racing = = 
 Dio , Suetonius and Martial all record naumachiae , the commonly used Greek term for what the Romans also called <unk> <unk> , re @-@ creations of famous sea battles . While Dio claims that both the purpose @-@ built naumachia of Augustus and the amphitheatre itself were flooded for two separate shows , Suetonius states only that the event took place on the old artificial lake ( which would have been that of Augustus ) . Martial does not specify where the naumachiae took place , but he is clear that whatever location he is discussing could be flooded and drained at will : 
 If you are here from a distant land , a late spectator for whom this was the first day of the sacred show , let not the naval warfare deceive you with its ships , and the water like to a sea : here but lately was land . Don 't you believe it ? Watch while the waters weary Mars . But a short while hence you will be saying " But here lately was sea . " 
 It appears it would have been difficult to flood the amphitheatre , but , because few records survive on the operation of the Colosseum , it is impossible to say for certain where the naval battles took place . Suetonius writes that Titus ' brother and successor , Domitian , staged sea @-@ fights in the amphitheatre , but he had made alterations to the structure , which probably included adding the <unk> — a complex of underground passages that may have allowed the arena to be quickly flooded and emptied . While Suetonius only records that Titus ' recreations of naval battles took place , Dio gives some details : 
 For Titus suddenly filled this same theatre with water and brought in horses and bulls and some other domesticated animals that had been taught to behave in the liquid element just as on land . He also brought in people on ships , who engaged in a sea @-@ fight there , impersonating the <unk> and Corinthians ; and others gave a similar exhibition outside the city in the grove of Gaius and Lucius , a place which Augustus had once excavated for this very purpose . 
 Both Dio and Suetonius agree that gladiatorial contests and a wild @-@ beast hunt , the <unk> , also took place at the lake area , but they again disagree on the details . Dio states this took place on the first day , with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it , while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had been let out . Suetonius writes that 5 @,@ 000 animals were killed there in a single day . Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives ( Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location ) , larger exotic animals were popular , notably elephants , big cats and bears , though smaller game such as birds , rabbits and goats also featured . 
 Suetonius writes that when Domitian staged his games there were other entertainments aside from the " usual two @-@ horse chariot races " , which indicates these races probably formed part of Titus ' games , and Dio tells us that there was a horse race on the second day though he gives no details of the type of race . 
 Only Dio 's record extends to detail of the third day specifically , during which he says : 
 … there was a naval battle between three thousand men , followed by an infantry battle . The " Athenians " conquered the " Syracusans " ( these were the names the combatants used ) , made a landing on the islet and assaulted and captured a wall that had been constructed around the monument . 
 This may again suggest the amphitheatre was flooded , as the monument referred to could be an altar of Diana , or Pluto , or of Jupiter <unk> that may have been present in the centre of the arena , but Pliny the Elder mentions a bridge in connection with the lake of Augustus , suggesting there may have been an island there as well . 
 = = Verus and Priscus = = 
 Details of most of the gladiatorial combats are not recorded . Suetonius writes that they were lavish and Dio that there were both single combats and fights between groups . One fight , between the gladiators Verus and Priscus , was recorded by Martial : 
 While Priscus continued to draw out the contest , and Verus likewise , and for a long time the struggle was evenly balanced on both sides , discharge was demanded for the stout fighters with loud and frequent shouting ; but Caesar obeyed his own law ( the law was that once the palm had been set up the fight had to proceed until a finger was raised ) : he did as he was allowed , making frequent awards of plate . Still , a resolution was found for the contest , equal they fought , equal they yielded . To both Caesar awarded the wooden sword and the palm : thus courage and skill received their reward . This has happened under no emperor but you , Caesar : two men fought and two men won . 
 As usual , the tone of the epigram is somewhat fawning toward his patron , Titus , but it gives more detail than any other account of the games . It seems to imply that a draw was uncommon in gladiatorial combat at this level , but that Titus eventually yielded to the wishes of the crowd , declared the match equal , and granted both men their freedom ( with the traditional presentation of the wooden sword ) . The traditional way of acknowledging defeat was for the yielding gladiator to raise a finger ( ad <unk> ) , and it is possible that in this case both men raised their fingers , but Martial 's emphasis here is on Titus ' even @-@ handedness and generosity in granting a reprieve ( <unk> ) to the crowd 's two favourites . His reference to this only happening under Titus probably alludes to the declaration of both as victors , as there is evidence that neither ties nor the survival of both gladiators in a contest were uncommon : it was expensive to train and keep a gladiator and they were not despatched lightly . There is some evidence for the existence of both Priscus and Verus , at least as names of gladiators , outside of Martial 's account . A first @-@ century graveyard in Smyrna contains the grave of a gladiator named Priscus , and Verus ' name is etched on a marble slab from <unk> , recording a gladiatorial contest . The details of Verus ' fights are unfortunately not legible . While neither of these may be the Priscus and Verus mentioned by Martial they do attest to the use of these names by gladiators . 
 Martial 's mention of gift @-@ giving is repeated in the account by Dio , who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box at the north end of the arena . These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift , either food , clothing , slaves , pack animals , horse , cattle , or gold or silver vessels . Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return . This was not unusual : Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same , giving 1 @,@ 000 birds daily , as well as food parcels , and vouchers for various extravagant gifts . 
 = = Later events = = 
 Some of Suetonius ' other comments on Titus ' reign mention the baths and events in the amphitheatre . Since Titus did not survive long after the end of the opening games , it is likely that these events took place during the days of the inauguration . Suetonius says that Titus promised for one day to forgo his own preferences and allow the crowd to decide the fate of the gladiators competing in the arena . He admired the Thracian gladiators , and while arguing passionately with the crowd on the subject , did not let his preferences sway him from his promise . He had some informers and their managers whipped and paraded in the arena . Some were sold as slaves in an auction and others sent away to " the most forbidding islands " . Suetonius also records that Titus invited some senators , whom he had pardoned for plotting against him , to sit with him during one of the days of the games , and to inspect the swords of the gladiators , a statement that is reinforced to some degree by Dio who remarks that Titus had no senators put to death during his reign . 
 On the last day of the games , Titus wept openly in view of the public in the amphitheatre . According to Dio , Titus died the following day , after officially dedicating the amphitheatre and the baths . Suetonius says that he had set out for the Sabine territories after the games but collapsed and died at the first posting station . 
 = Congregation Beth Israel ( New Orleans ) = 
 Congregation Beth Israel ( Hebrew : בית ישראל ) is a Modern Orthodox synagogue located in Louisiana . Founded in 1903 or 1904 , though tracing its roots back to 1857 , it is the oldest Orthodox congregation in the New Orleans region . Originally located on Carondelet Street in New Orleans ' Central City , it constructed and moved to a building at 7000 Canal Boulevard in Lakeview , New Orleans in 1971 . 
 At one time the largest Orthodox congregation in the Southern United States , its membership was over 500 families in the 1960s , but fell to under 200 by 2005 . That year its Canal Boulevard building was severely flooded by the 2005 New Orleans levee failure disaster during Hurricane Katrina . Despite attempts to save them , all seven of its Torah scrolls were destroyed , as were over 3 @,@ 000 prayer @-@ books . The building suffered further flooding damage caused by the theft of copper air @-@ conditioning tubing in 2007 . 
 In the wake of Katrina another 50 member families left New Orleans , including the rabbi 's . The congregation began sharing space with Gates of Prayer , a Reform synagogue in Metairie , a suburb of New Orleans . In 2009 , the congregation purchased land from Gates of Prayer , and by 2012 had built a new synagogue next to it at 4000 West Esplanade Avenue . As of 2016 the rabbi was Gabriel Greenberg . 
 = = Early history = = 
 Beth Israel is the oldest Orthodox congregation in the New Orleans region , and its most prominent . Though it was founded as early as 1903 , it traces its roots back to much older synagogues . In the mid @-@ 19th century New Orleans had a number of small Orthodox congregations of Eastern European Jews , generally " structured along nationalistic lines " . These included a synagogue of <unk> Jews ( Chevra Thilim ) , and two of Lithuanian Jews , ( one — Chevra <unk> Israel — following the non @-@ Hassidic liturgy , the other — Anshe Sfard — following the Hassidic liturgy ) . In 1857 , a congregation consisting primarily of Prussian Jews from Posen organized as Tememe Derech , " The Right Way " . As they followed the Polish rite , they were known as " The Polish Congregation " . 
 Tememe Derech built a synagogue in the 500 block of Carondelet Street in the Central City section of New Orleans in 1867 . It was the sole Orthodox congregation to construct its own building ; only a minority of New Orleans ' Jews were Orthodox , and other congregations rented space or met in members ' homes . Tememe Derech 's membership , however , never exceeded 50 , and in 1903 or 1904 the synagogue disbanded , and merged with a number of other small Orthodox congregations and a burial society to form Beth Israel . Services were initially held in rented quarters in the same 500 block of Carondelet Street . 
 In 1905 , Beth Israel purchased the home of New Orleans ' former mayor Joseph A. Shakspeare at 1610 Carondelet Street . Funds for the new acquisition came from both the Orthodox and Reform communities of New Orleans . After remodeling the building , the congregation began holding services there , in time for the 1906 High Holy Days . Membership grew quickly ; by 1910 Beth Israel was the second @-@ largest Jewish congregation in the city , with 180 member families , and by 1914 that number had grown to 250 families . By 1918 , however , membership had fallen to 175 families . That year the synagogue 's income was $ 6 @,@ 000 ( today $ 94 @,@ 000 ) . 
 Moses Hyman Goldberg was the congregation 's first rabbi , but within a year he moved to Chevra Thilim . Goldberg served as New Orleans ' mohel until his death in 1940 . 
 = = 1920s to early 2000s = = 
 Beth Israel rebuilt its synagogue at the Carondelet Street location in 1924 . The new building was designed by Emil Weil , a noted Southern architect , particularly of Jewish religious buildings . He designed other New Orleans ' synagogues , including the Touro Synagogue and the Anshe Sfard , as well as other non @-@ religious buildings throughout Louisiana . Beth Israel 's new Byzantine Revival building , with its seating capacity of 1 @,@ 200 , reflected " the growing economic and social confidence of the membership " : it had " beautiful " stained @-@ glass windows , a " magnificent " imported European chandelier , and " hand @-@ carved Stars of David in the ceiling " . The building was dedicated on September 12 , and a Boston rabbi , Henry Raphael Gold , was a guest speaker . He was so impressed that he stayed on , becoming Beth Israel 's rabbi . 
 In 1926 Beth Israel built the " Menorah Institute " Talmud Torah building on Euterpe Street , adjoining the Carondelet synagogue . The school , which served as an Orthodox alternative to the existing Communal Hebrew School , comprised a nursery school , a Hebrew school , and a Sunday school . The building also housed Beth Israel 's offices , and the " Little <unk> " ( " shul " is the Yiddish word for synagogue ) , where services were held twice a day . 
 The congregation leased land for burials in the Chevra Thilim Cemetery on Canal Street , a site that had been used by Tememe Derech as early as 1860 , and which was shared with several other congregations . In the 1930s Beth Israel purchased its own cemetery on Frenchmen Street . 
 Uri Miller joined Beth Israel as rabbi in 1935 , a post he would hold through the early 1940s . He was president of the Hebrew Theological College Alumni from 1936 to 1938 , and of its successor the Rabbinical Council of America from 1946 to 1948 . 
 During Miller 's tenure the synagogue 's neighborhood began to deteriorate . Members started moving uptown , and the congregation embarked on a search for a new location . In 1963 Beth Israel purchased a block of land at 7000 Canal Boulevard at Walker Street in the Lakeview neighborhood . It moved into its new larger building there in 1971 . 
 Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke 's successful 1989 run for a Louisiana House of Representatives seat in nearby Metairie was a cause for concern in the congregation . Then @-@ rabbi Gavriel Newman spoke out against Duke , feeling that people were being " taken in " by " the modern guise of Klan members of Duke 's ilk is the two @-@ piece suit , the blow @-@ dried hair and the sweet smile , which seem to serve them very well to hide the inherent racism and the propensity to violence . " During the campaign an anti @-@ Duke rally was planned to be held at Beth Israel by Mordechai Levy of the Jewish Defense Organization ( JDO ) . It was , however , cancelled by Beth Israel , after strong objections by members of Beth Israel and the larger Jewish community , in part because it was felt that the JDO 's actions would actually create more support for Duke , and in part because of Levy 's statements that the JDO would not rule out violence in its efforts against Duke . 
 From 1914 through World War II Beth Israel described itself the " largest Orthodox congregation in the South " , and in the 1960s it had 500 member families . By 2005 , however , that number had been reduced to fewer than 200 . Nevertheless , Beth Israel still held services twice a day , the only synagogue in New Orleans to do so . 
 = = Hurricane Katrina and aftermath = = 
 As a result of Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans , the congregation 's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water , and Beth Israel garnered national attention after attempts were made to save its Torah scrolls . Beth Israel 's rabbi , Yisroel <unk> , who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit , contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider , who had worked on <unk> search @-@ and @-@ rescue teams in Israel for five years . After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard , Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel , met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) search @-@ and @-@ rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls . The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it , where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments . 
 Despite Leider 's efforts , all seven Torah scrolls were unsalvageable , and had to be buried . They had initially been buried in her backyard by Rebecca <unk> , Beth Israel 's non @-@ Jewish secretary , who first received them after their rescue , and were subsequently re @-@ buried next to the grave of Beth Israel 's <unk> Meyer <unk> . <unk> had died just after Katrina , but could not be buried in New Orleans until months later . 
 In addition to losing all of its Torah scrolls , Beth Israel lost all its furniture , and over 3 @,@ 000 <unk> and <unk> , and almost all of its members ' homes were flooded , forcing them to move . The congregation did , however , receive assistance in replacing some of its assets ; the Orthodox Union immediately sent Beth Israel 50 <unk> <unk> , and Brith Shalom Beth Israel Congregation of Charleston , South Carolina , and Congregation Shaare Zedek Sons of Abraham of Providence , Rhode Island each donated Torahs . Hayley Fields , a 14 @-@ year @-@ old from Los Angeles , heard of Beth Israel 's difficult circumstances , and with the support of her mother , spearheaded a fund @-@ raising drive , selling 3 @,@ 500 watches . $ 18 @,@ 000 was ultimately raised to buy a Torah , which was dedicated in August , 2006 , two days before the first anniversary of the hurricane . At that ceremony the National Council of Young Israel also donated 150 new <unk> <unk> , in time for the High Holy Days . 
 In the wake of Katrina 50 families that were members of Beth Israel left New Orleans , and gave up membership in the congregation . These included Rabbi Schiff and his family . After the flood Beth Israel 's board of directors informed Schiff , who had joined they synagogue in April 2002 , that it would not be able to meet its contractual obligations and pay him past December . Schiff and his family had also lost their home and much of their possessions , and had been living in Memphis . Schiff resigned effective November 1 , 2005 , citing this loss , and the lack of a functioning Jewish Day School in the area for his children . 
 Soon after the flood , Beth Israel received an offer to temporarily use space from Congregation Gates of Prayer , a Reform synagogue in Metairie , a suburb of New Orleans . The congregation began holding weekly services and renting office space there . 
 In 2006 it was unclear if Beth Israel , which had already been in difficult financial shape , would be allowed , or have the means , to re @-@ build its synagogue . The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air @-@ conditioning system . They broke the water main , and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days , to a depth of three to four feet , before it was discovered . The property was put up for sale . 
 = = Recent events = = 
 In 2007 , the congregation began some joint programming with Anshe <unk> , New Orleans ' only other remaining Orthodox synagogue , and in the summer hired Uri Topolosky as its new rabbi . A graduate of <unk> <unk> Torah , Topolosky had previously served as the associate rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale , and had been one of 21 rabbis arrested at the United Nations during an April 2007 sit @-@ in demanding that Iran be expelled from the U.N. 
 To help attract new members , in the summer Topolosky started a recruitment campaign , placing an advertisement in the New York newspaper The Jewish Week , and re @-@ designing Beth Israel 's website . The campaign 's tagline was " If you believe in the ability to destroy , you can believe in the ability to rebuild " , a saying of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov , and by the end of October ten new members had joined . However , while all New Orleans synagogues lost membership after Katrina , as of 2007 , Beth Israel was the only New Orleans synagogue that had not re @-@ opened in its former location . 
 Beth Israel started " The <unk> Project " in 2008 , an effort to attract 10 ( see minyan ) new Orthodox families to New Orleans . The families were given " generous financial assistance " , and in return had to " commit to providing community service , from maintaining the <unk> enclosure that 's due to be completed within the month to assisting in kosher supervision at a local supermarket . " According to Topolosky , with the move of four new families to the area , New Orleans likely had proportionately the fastest growing Modern Orthodox community in the United States . In April of that year the Orthodox Union gave the congregation $ 235 @,@ 000 towards a new building . At the time , Beth Israel had 80 member families , and 80 " associate member " families ( families who belonged to other synagogues as well ) . 
 By 2009 , the congregation had decided to erect a new synagogue on land it had purchased from Gates of Prayer , part of the lot on which the Gates of Prayer synagogue stood . For the 2009 High Holy Days , Topolosky planned to launch a capital campaign to raise $ 1 million towards the construction of the building . The new building at 4004 West Esplanade Avenue was completed and occupied in August 2012 . The old building , which still stood vacant , had been purchased by a surgeon for use as medical offices . All that was saved from it and brought to the new building were a bimah ( originally from the building on Carondelet Street ) , a ner <unk> , two menorahs , a <unk> , and " a stained @-@ glass window and a wooden plaque honoring pioneer donor families from Carondelet Street " . The <unk> had previously been featured and lit at the 2010 White House Hanukkah Party . 
 Topolosky and his family left Beth Israel the following year , citing " the deteriorating Jewish educational landscape in New Orleans " . New Orleans ' only Jewish school , which had been established in 1996 , closed for a year after Hurricane Katrina , and was never able to regain its peak enrollment of over 80 students . Although by then New Orleans ' Jewish population exceeded its pre @-@ Katrina size , demographic changes negatively affected the school 's population . In 2012 the school 's board began recruiting non @-@ Jewish students , and changed the name from New Orleans Jewish Day School to Community Day School , but enrollment continued to fall to 29 students , half non @-@ Jewish , by 2013 . The same demographic changes affected Beth Israel ; its Saturday morning service only attracted around 40 worshipers , its Friday night service only 25 , and it had no daily minyan . 
 In 2013 Beth Israel hired Gabriel Greenberg to succeed Topolosky as rabbi , though he could not join the synagogue until the following year . A native of New England , he , like Topolosky , received his rabbinic ordination at <unk> <unk> Torah . As of 2016 , Greenberg was Beth Israel 's rabbi . 
 = Brunei at the 2004 Summer Olympics = 
 Brunei , as Brunei Darussalam , competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece , which took place between 13 to 29 August 2004 . The country 's participation in Athens marked its fourth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1988 Summer Olympics . 
 The Brunei delegation included only one track and field athlete , meaning Brunei , along with British Virgin Islands and Liechtenstein , sent the lowest number of athletes to the 2004 Summer Games at one . The athlete selected was Jimmy Anak Ahar , who was a middle @-@ distance runner that was selected via a wildcard as the nation had no athletes that met the " A " or " B " standards in any event . Ahar was also selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony . Ultimately , Ahar did not progress beyond the heats , meaning Brunei won no medals at this Summer Olympics . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although Brunei first participated in the Summer Olympic in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea , it was only represented by one official . It would not be until the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , United States that the country would send athletes to the Games . Since then , it has participated in four Summer Olympics between its debut and the 2004 Summer Olympics . No Brunei athlete had ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics before the 2004 Athens Games . 
 The Brunei National Olympic Committee ( NOC ) selected one athlete via a wildcard . Usually , a NOC would be able to enter up to three qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the " A " standard , or one athlete per event if they met the " B " standard . However , since Brunei had no athletes that met either standard , they were allowed to select an athlete as a wildcard . The one athlete that was selected to compete in the Athens Games was Jimmy Anak Ahar in the Men 's 1500 meters . Sending only one athlete to the Athens Games meant that the country , along with British Virgin Islands and Liechtenstein , was notable for sending the lowest number of athletes to the 2004 Summer Games . Ahar was flag bearer for the opening ceremony . Among officials , sports official Sofian Ibrahim represented the country . 
 = = Athletics = = 
 Making his Summer Olympic debut , Jimmy Anak Ahar was notable for becoming the youngest ever competitor to represent Brunei at the Olympics aged 22 . The age record stood until the 2012 Summer Olympics , when Anderson Chee Wei Lim surpassed it . Ahar qualified for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard , as his best time , three minutes , 59 @.@ 81 seconds at the 2003 Southeast Asian Games Men 's 1500 meters , was 21 @.@ 81 seconds slower than the " B " qualifying standard required . He competed on 20 August in the Men 's 1500 meters against thirteen other athletes in the third heat . He ran a time of 4 minutes , 14 @.@ 11 seconds , finishing 13th . He ranked ahead of Tanzania 's <unk> <unk> ( who did not start ) , and behind Guam 's Neil Weare ( 4 minutes , 5 @.@ 86 seconds ) , in a heat led by Great Britain 's Michael East ( 3 minutes , 37 @.@ 37 seconds ) . Overall , Ahar placed 39th out of the 41 athletes that competed , and was 32 @.@ 97 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the next round .

 = Crater Glacier = 
 The Crater Glacier ( also known as Tulutson Glacier ) is a geologically young glacier that is located on Mount St. Helens , in the U.S. state of Washington . The glacier formed after the 1980 Eruption and due to its location , the body of ice grew rapidly , unknown to the public for nearly 20 years . The glacier once contained ice caves in the smooth ice before the 2004 @-@ 2008 volcanic activity . The growth of the lava dome and volcanic eruptions from 2004 to 2008 significantly altered the appearance of the glacier . In the same time period , several agencies decided to put an official name on the glacier which , at first , was Tulutson Glacier . A later decision made Crater Glacier the official glacier name . Despite the volcanic activity , the glacier continued to advance and by mid @-@ 2008 , the glacier completely encircled the lava domes . In addition , new glaciers ( rock or ice ) have formed around Crater Glacier as well . 
 = = Description = = 
 True to its name , the glacier lies inside the north @-@ facing crater left by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and the glacier 's elevation is about 6 @,@ 794 ft ( 2 @,@ 071 m ) . A massive central lava dome emplaced from 1980 to 1987 occupies the center of the crater , and the glacier formed in the shape of a horseshoe around the dome , with two terminal moraines on the eastern and western sides . Heavy winter snowfall , repeated snow avalanches , rockfalls , and sun @-@ shading by the surrounding cliffs to the south , led to the exceptionally rapid growth of this glacier . Thus , the glacier composition is estimated to be six @-@ tenths ice and four @-@ tenths rock , with an average thickness of 328 feet ( 100 m ) and a maximum thickness of around 656 feet ( 200 m ) ; nearly as deep as Mount Rainier 's Carbon Glacier . None of the ice is older than the year 1980 , however , the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the pre – 1980 glaciers combined . The surface of the glacier looks dark and dirty in the summer due to the numerous rockfalls from the steep , unstable crater walls along with ash from eruptions , all of which help to insulate and protect the growing glacier . The 2004 @-@ 2008 volcanic activity created a series of domes that nearly split the glacier into two lobes at the south end of the crater . In spite of the four @-@ year lava dome building period , the glacier remains North America 's youngest and fastest growing glacier . With the joining of the termini on the north end of Crater Glacier in May 2008 , the body of ice completely encircles the lava domes . <unk> from the glacier gives rise to Loowit Creek . 
 Pre @-@ 2004 eruption glacier caves of Crater Glacier 
 In 2000 , glacier caves were discovered on the then @-@ smooth glacier surface . Many of these glacier caves were big enough to explore , like the glacier caves on the summit of Mount Rainier . Most of the glacier caves were located near the 1980s lava dome , where hot steam and volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice . About 7 @,@ 900 feet or 2 @.@ 4 km of underground caves and passageways in the glacier were mapped and studied . 
 Other glaciers and new rock glaciers 
 Since 2004 , new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice to Crater Glacier below . In addition , there are two rock glaciers to the north of the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier and one north of the western lobe . Two of these rock glaciers have merged with the Crater Glacier , with one on the west and one on the east . The other rock glacier on the eastern slopes of the crater wall is very close to touching the glacier . 
 = = Evolution of the Glacier = = 
 In the months after the eruption , the crater floor of St. Helens remained hot and unstable , with five minor volcanic eruptions , and lava dome construction between May and October 1980 . After the eruptions ceased in the winter of 1980 , the crater floor cooled down enough for snow and ice accumulation . Beginning with snowfall in the winter of 1980 @-@ 1981 , the glacier began to grow very rapidly in the shadow of the crater . The glacier thickened at a rate of as high as 50 ft ( 15 m ) per year and advanced northward as much as 135 ft ( 41 m ) a year . This glacier growth was discovered by scientists working in the crater about seven to nine years later . However , the existence of the glacier was not publicized until 1999 . By 2004 , Crater Glacier covered about 0 @.@ 36 square mile ( 0 @.@ 93 km2 ) , about 20 % of the glacier area in the pre @-@ 1980 glaciers , and there was a western and eastern lobe flowing around the 1980s dome . Due to the gas emissions on the crater floor , there were glacier caves ( ice caves ) in the once smooth glacial ice , and several of them had been explored by the late 1990s . 
 With the volcanic activity from 2004 to 2008 , the glacier lobes were pushed aside and <unk> by the growth of new volcanic domes . As the two streams of ice were compressed between the caldera wall and the new lava domes , the ice moved rapidly downhill , much like the squeezing of toothpaste out of a container . This resulted in a very rapid advance of the glacier termini ; first the western glacier arm merged with the rock glacier on the western crater wall and then , both arms of the Crater Glacier joined north 1980s lava dome in May 2008 , despite the volcanic activity . In addition , the volcanic activity modified the surface of the glacier and transformed it from being mostly crevasse @-@ free to being a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss @-@ crossed with crevasses and <unk> due to movement of the crater floor and lava dome growth . At the south end , the new domes almost split the Crater Glacier into two separate glaciers and melted 10 % in volume of the glacier 's ice . However , cold rock on the edge of the glacier insulated the glacier ice from the 1 @,@ 300 ° F ( 700 ° C ) lava spewing out of the lava domes , easing concerns of a catastrophic lahar caused by glacier melting . The porous nature of the crater floor also reduced the amount of meltwater flowing out of the caldera . 
 After the volcanic activity of the 2000s , the thickness of the glacier continues to increase at a slower rate of 15 ft ( 5 m ) per year and the glacier continues to advance at 3 ft ( 1 m ) per day . The latest aerial imagery taken in 2012 shows that the glacier has entered the upper reaches of the Loowit Creek canyon and the headwaters of the creek . Ice mixed with rock debris now spills into the canyon and the creek has been pushed to the east . Nearby , on the slopes of the eastern crater wall , the glacier touches one of the rock glaciers and the glacier is very close to merging with the other rock glacier . A medial moraine can be seen at the interface of the eastern and western arms of the Crater Glacier . 
 Glacier Evolution in the Caldera 
 = = Naming the glacier = = 
 Since the glacier was first observed to be forming and actively flowing in the late 1980s , most scientists working on the mountain have referred to it informally as the " crater glacier " . That name has been in wide use with the public ( at least those who were aware of the glacier 's existence ) for the two decades since the glacier formed , and has appeared in several scientific publications too . A single scientific paper , the most complete published study of the glacier to date , referred to it as the " Amphitheater glacier , " but that name has not been used otherwise . 
 Despite numerous observations and publications about the growing glacier in the late 1990s and early 2000s , no move was made to give the glacier a permanent and official name until late 2004 , after the current eruptive cycle began and the new dome began to split the glacier . At that time , a proponent from the Cowlitz tribe suggested the name " Tulutson Glacier , " from the Cowlitz language word for ice . In March 2005 , the Washington State Board on Geographic Names chose Tulutson over three other contenders ( Crater , Spirit , and <unk> ) , and so Tulutson Glacier became the de facto name . 
 However , the U.S. Board on Geographic Names had yet to make its decision , which would be official throughout the United States . The name Tulutson Glacier was submitted for consideration , along with Crater Glacier and <unk> Glacier , which would have honored the volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft , killed by a pyroclastic flow in 1991 . In June 2006 , the U.S. BGN chose Crater Glacier because of its two @-@ decade precedent of common use , despite objections from the state of Washington and the United States Forest Service which both preferred Tulutson . The scientists at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory strongly supported Crater Glacier , and also commented that Tulutson may not be an appropriate name since the volcano " lies inland in a region where the native language was not Cowlitz but Sahaptin . " 
 After the decision , some controversy erupted following an editorial in a local newspaper protesting the decision , and the state of Washington " has indicated that the name Tulutson Glacier will continue to appear on State products , although if the feature melts soon , as is anticipated , this may not be a great concern . " Despite these protests , the glacier 's official name remained Crater Glacier , though shortly after their June 2006 decision , the BGN received a follow @-@ up proposal to name the two arms of the glacier , East Crater Glacier and West Crater Glacier . This was because , at that point in time , the dome @-@ building eruptions had nearly split the glacier into an east and west arm . No further action has been taken on this matter and the merging of the ice streams north of the 1980s lava dome has rendered this move unnecessary .

 = = History = = 
 = = = Beginnings = = = 
 Auburn High School was founded as the private Auburn Academy in 1837 , less than three years after the Auburn area had been opened to settlement , funded by the sale of the lots which now make up downtown Auburn . On February 19 , 1838 , the Academy opened its first session , under the instruction of Simeon W. Yancey . A two @-@ story frame school building was constructed later that year , and in 1840 the school divided into male and female divisions as the Auburn Male and Female Academy . By 1846 , the schools were known as the Auburn High Schools , and in 1847 the male division split off the school , with the remaining female division taking the name Auburn Female Seminary . The school received a legislative charter as a Mason school in 1852 , becoming the Auburn Masonic Female College . 
 The school attracted hundreds of boarding students to Auburn in the 1840s and 1850s , offering a complete secondary education to women — including ancient and modern languages , literature , mathematics , and musical arts — at the same academic level of that given to men . By the 1850s , the school physical plant had been expanded to three buildings : a main building , a music building , and a chapel which included the largest auditorium in eastern Alabama and a fully equipped chemistry laboratory . By 1855 , the school enrolled 110 students . Faculty members included John M. Darby , a scientist who wrote his own textbooks for his students , including a Textbook of Chemistry and Botany of the Southern States , which was the earliest compilation of flora in the Southern United States , and William P. Harrison , a Methodist theologian who was eventually appointed Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives . A significant part of the curriculum included foreign languages ; courses in Greek , Latin , French , Spanish , German , and Italian were offered in 1861 . The Auburn Masonic Female College hosted speakers and debates among some of the region 's greatest luminaries , most notably an 1860 debate over secession which included William Lowndes Yancey , Alexander Stephens , Benjamin Harvey Hill , and Robert Toombs . 
 The Masons relinquished control of the school to a shared board of trustees with the East Alabama Male College in the late 1850s , and in the early 1860s , the school began admitting boys to the secondary division . When the American Civil War began in 1861 , virtually the entire male junior and senior classes of the school , as well as much of the faculty , joined Confederate States of America military units , particularly the 37th Alabama Regiment . As the " principal teacher " , W.F. Slaton , was a major in the regiment , classes in Auburn stopped for the remainder of the war . The regiment was captured at Corinth , Mississippi , and exiled to the Johnson 's Island prisoner of war camp on Lake Erie . While imprisoned there , Slaton held the school 's classes in the camp . Notably , the African American Union guards , who were prohibited by law from attending school in their native Wisconsin , were invited to join the classes , making Auburn High one of the first Southern schools to integrate , some 90 years before Brown v. Board . 
 While the school continued operation through and after the war , economic hardships in the Reconstruction era caused the school to temporarily close in the late 1860s . 
 = = = From private college to public high school = = = 
 Around 1870 , the school reopened in the building formerly occupied by the male academy , on the site of the current Auburn City Hall . The school took the name Auburn Female College , despite admitting both boys and girls . 
 Through the 1870s the town 's economic condition was poor , and the school , still run by the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , closed at least once more before reopening permanently in 1877 . In 1885 , a separate town @-@ funded public school system for Auburn was created , and the previously private Auburn Female College became the public " Auburn High School " , although tuition was still charged . While this new public funding allowed the school to remain open much longer than before — 200 days in 1886 — enrollment was significantly lower than it was prior to the Civil War , with an 1889 report listing Auburn High School as enrolling fewer than 20 students . 
 In 1892 , Auburn University ( then the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College ) decided to admit women . Since the college only admitted women with junior standing , Auburn High added three more years of classes beyond the secondary level — equivalent to freshman and sophomore college classes — for women . With this addition , the name of the school was changed to the " Auburn Female Institute " . 
 In 1899 , a two @-@ story building was built for Auburn High . In 1908 , the school dropped the post @-@ secondary program and became " Auburn High School " once more . Around 1910 , Auburn High fielded its first basketball team , and in 1911 , its first football squad . 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 In 1914 , Auburn High became the flagship high school for the county and was officially renamed Lee County High School , though " Auburn High School " remained the common name of the school . That same year , the school relocated from the 1899 building to a new structure on Opelika Road . 
 In the period between 1910 and 1920 , Auburn High changed from an academy of the classic 19th @-@ century model , focusing on the traditional Latin course , to a high school offering vocational and technical courses in addition to the academic offerings . Auburn High added vocational courses to the curriculum in 1918 , the eighth high school in the state to implement such a program . Over the next two decades , Auburn High developed its modern extracurricular face , forming band , choir , drama , and other programs , as well as diversifying occupational classes . In 1925 , Auburn High became one of the first high schools in the state to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools . A new school building was constructed in 1931 , and in 1956 , the school was officially renamed Auburn High School . 
 In 1961 , the City of Auburn again created its own school system , with Auburn High as the new district 's high school . In 1966 , the school moved to the current campus , organized as a " Freedom of Choice " school designed to promote desegregation .

 Auburn High 's costumed mascot is Samford , an anthropomorphic tiger . Samford was created in 1995 and named for three symbols of the school : Samford Avenue , which runs by the school ; Duck Samford Stadium , Auburn High 's football stadium ; and Samford Hall , the most prominent building in Auburn . Kari Pierce and Brian Puckett were the first Samford in 1995 .

 = = = = Alma Mater = = = = 
 The Auburn High School " Alma Mater " was written in 1955 by band and choral director George Corradino and members of the Auburn High School Glee Club . It replaced a previous alma mater of unknown origins . The " Alma Mater " is used at academic ceremonies and at some athletic events . A common epithet for the school used by students and alumni , " dear old Auburn High " , is taken from the last line of the song . 
 = = = = Fight songs = = = = 
 Auburn High School 's primary fight song is " Hooray for Auburn ! " . The lyrics to " Hooray for Auburn ! " come from a cheer that was commonly used in the mid @-@ 20th century . In 1961 , Auburn High School band director Tommy Goff wrote music to fit those lyrics to create the current fight song . In subsequent years , the fight song was adopted by other schools , including <unk> High School and Opelika High School . At football games , " Hooray for Auburn ! " is played after a touchdown . 
 " Glory , Glory to Ole Auburn " — often simply " Glory " — was Auburn High 's fight song before " Hooray for Auburn ! " was written in 1961 and is currently a secondary fight song of Auburn High . " Glory , Glory to Ole Auburn " has the tune of the chorus of the " Battle Hymn of the Republic " , while the lyrics are identical to those of the University of Georgia 's " Glory , Glory " but substitute the word " Auburn " for " Georgia " . At football games , " Glory , Glory to Ole Auburn " is played after a successful PAT conversion . 
 For the 1955 football season , Auburn High used the Alabama Polytechnic Institute fight song " War Eagle " . An earlier school song , " We 're Loyal to You , Auburn High " , was used from the 1920s through the 1940s . " We 're Loyal to You , Auburn High " has the melody of " Illinois Loyalty " .

 = The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson = 
 " The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson " is the first episode of The Simpsons ' ninth season . The 179th episode of the series overall , it was originally broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on September 21 , 1997 . The episode features the Simpson family traveling to Manhattan to recover the family car , which was taken by Barney Gumble and abandoned outside the World Trade Center , therefore gaining numerous parking tickets and a parking boot . 
 Writer Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham was interested in making an episode where the Simpson family travels to New York to retrieve their lost car . Executive producers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein suggested that the car be found in Austin J. Tobin Plaza at the World Trade Center , as they wanted a location that would be widely known . Great lengths were taken to make a detailed replica of the borough of Manhattan . The episode received generally positive reviews , and has since been on accolade lists of The Simpsons episodes . The " I 'm Checkin ' In " musical sequence won two awards . Because of the World Trade Center 's main role , the episode was taken off syndication in many areas following the September 11 attacks , but has come back into syndication in recent years . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At Moe 's Tavern , Moe informs Homer and his friends that one of them must be a designated driver , and Barney loses the choosing draw . After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer 's car , Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home , expecting Barney to return it the following morning . In his distressed state , Barney disappears with the car . Two months later , Barney returns to Moe 's Tavern , unable to recall where he left the car . Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government , which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza . Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience . Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees . 
 When the family arrives in Manhattan , they decide to split up . Upon arrival at his car , Homer discovers it has been issued many parking tickets and has been wheel clamped . While waiting for a parking officer to come remove the clamp , Homer drinks an excessive amount of crab juice from a food vendor and needs to urinate , but is afraid to leave his car behind . After several hours of holding it in , he finally goes to the restroom at the South Tower 's indoor observation deck , but discovers that it is out of order and must use the one at the top of the North Tower . While he is doing that , the officer arrives at the car and finding no one present , issues another ticket and leaves ; Homer 's subsequent " D 'oh ! " echoes across the city . Meanwhile , the rest of the family tours the Statue of Liberty , Little Italy , Chinatown , and the Empire State Building . Bart leaves the group to visit the offices of Mad magazine , and is in awe when he sees Alfred E. Neuman . The family attends a Broadway musical about the Betty Ford Clinic , and then take a carriage through Central Park to where they are planning to meet Homer . 
 Upon returning to the car , Homer realizes he must make it to Central Park to find his family and leave before it gets dark . Ignoring the wheel clamp , he tries to accelerate and in the process destroys the car 's fender . Homer stops by a road construction crew and steals a jackhammer so he can use it to remove the clamp . The car is free from the clamp , but further damaged as a result . Homer races to Central Park and reunites with his family . While driving back to Springfield , the family reflects on their wonderful time , while Homer 's hatred for New York remains . 
 = = Production = = 
 Writer Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , a former resident of New York , had conceived the idea of having the family travel to the city to locate their missing car and believed it to be " a classic Manhattan problem " . Bill Oakley , who had visited the World Trade Center when the construction of the towers was completed in 1973 , suggested parking the car in the plaza of the buildings . Josh Weinstein observed that , " When we realized that there was a plaza between the two towers , we knew it was a perfect spot to have Homer 's car . " 
 The animators were told to make a detailed replica of the city . David Silverman was sent to Manhattan to take hundreds of pictures of the city and areas around the World Trade Center . When he returned , Lance Wilder and his team spent time creating new scenes and backgrounds , incorporating small details such as signs and hundreds of extras that would correctly illustrate the city . Oakley and Weinstein were pleased with the final results , and both noted that the buildings , streets , and even elevator cabins were detailed closely to their real life counterparts . In the final scene , as the family is seen driving away from New York on the George Washington Bridge , the credits roll with the " camera " gradually pulling back from a view of the car , to a view of the side , and then on to a panorama view of the city ; as if the whole sequence was being shot from a helicopter . To achieve this effect , a computer model of the bridge pulling out was made and then printed out . With the print outs , photocopies were made traced onto the animation cels . The process took a long time and was expensive , as the use of computer animation was not widespread when the episode was produced . Director Jim Reardon wanted to replicate films that ended in a similar way , and commented , " I remembered that every movie located in New York would pull back if you were leaving town on a bridge . " Shortly before the episode aired , the production staff contacted Fox to make sure they would not run commercials during the credits . 
 Ken Keeler , who wrote the lyrics for the " You 're Checkin ' In " musical number , spent two hours in a room alone to write the song . Upon sharing the lyrics with the rest of the production staff , some revisions were made , although little was changed . Bill Oakley was unsatisfied with the part of the musical where the actor claims , " Hey , that 's just my Aspirin ! " , claiming that a better line could have been written . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The song used during Duffman 's first and subsequent appearances is " Oh Yeah " by Yello , popularized in the final scene of the film Ferris Bueller 's Day Off . The Original Famous Ray 's Pizza shop Homer sees is a parody of independently owned pizza stores that carry the name " Ray " in their name . The musical sequence played during the Flushing Meadows segment is a stylistic parody of the piece Flower Duet from the opera Lakmé by Leo Delibes . When the traveling bus passes by Hasidic Jews , Bart mistakes them for ZZ Top , and when Bart visits Mad magazine 's offices , he sees Alfred E. Neuman , the Spy vs. Spy characters , and cartoonist Dave Berg . The actor in the musical number " You 're Checkin ' In " was based on Robert Downey , Jr . , who was battling a cocaine addiction during the time of the episode creation , just as the character in the musical was . The sequence where Homer races alongside the carriage in Central Park was a reference to a similar scene in the film Ben @-@ Hur . The final scene when the family is crossing the George Washington Bridge uses a version of the song " Theme from New York , New York " , which continues to play throughout the credits . 
 Several cultural references are made during Homer 's flashback to his previous visit to New York City . During the entire flashback , " The Entertainer " , a piece made famous by the film The Sting , is played . Writer Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham had brought the piece to the attention of director Jim Reardon and asked him to try to fit the piece into the flashback . Maxtone @-@ Graham later commented , " It turned out that the music and the visual gags fit each other perfectly . " In the beginning of the scene , Homer passes by three pornographic film theaters , which are playing " The Godfather 's Parts , II " , " Jeremiah 's Johnson " , and " Five Sleazy Pieces " , plays on the names of The Godfather Part II , Jeremiah Johnson , and Five Easy Pieces . Woody Allen can be seen during the flashback , pouring trash out of his window onto Homer . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original broadcast , " The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson " finished 18th in ratings for the week of September 15 – 21 , 1997 , with a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 7 , equivalent to approximately 10 @.@ 5 million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , beating King of the Hill 's season two opener " How to Fire a Rifle Without Really Trying " . 
 The episode was mostly well received . The song " You 're Checkin ' In " won a 1998 Primetime Emmy Award for " Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics " , and an Annie Award for " Outstanding Music in an Animated Television Production " in the same year . In honor of The Simpsons ' 300th episode milestone in 2003 , Entertainment Weekly ranked the episode at number 13 on the list of their 25 favorite episodes , and AskMen.com ranked the episode at number seven on their top ten ; in both cases it was the second @-@ most @-@ recent installment chosen to co @-@ inhabit the lists . IGN named the episode the best of the ninth season , claiming " this is a very funny episode that started season nine off on a strong note " . Since the release of the season nine DVD box set , the episode has been highlighted by newspaper reviewers to show excellence of the season . 
 Ian Jones and Steve Williams , writers for British review website Off the Telly , claimed that the episode " ditched all pretence of a plot and went flat out for individual , unconnected sight gags and vignettes " . The two noted that it was their least favorite debut episode for a season of The Simpsons . In a separate article in Off the Telly , Jones and Williams write that the episode " ... wasn 't shown for reasons of taste and has never appeared on terrestrial television in Britain " , referring to a BBC Two schedule of the ninth season , which began October 2001 . It had actually been shown prior to the attacks on Sky One , before being made available on digital terrestrial television as well as satellite and was later shown free @-@ to @-@ air , on Channel 4 . 
 Due to the prominence of the World Trade Center in the plot , the episode was removed from syndication after the September 11 attacks . By 2006 , the episode had come back into syndication in some areas ; however , parts of the episode were often edited out . One previously such edited item is a scene of two men arguing across Tower 1 and Tower 2 , where a man from Tower 2 claims , " They stick all the jerks in Tower One " . Co @-@ executive producer Bill Oakley commented in retrospect that the line was " regrettable " . 
 = Myst Online : Uru Live = 
 Myst Online : Uru Live is an open source massively multiplayer online adventure game developed by Cyan Worlds . The game is the multiplayer component to the 2003 video game Uru : Ages Beyond Myst . Like Uru , Myst Online takes place in 2000 's New Mexico , where an ancient civilization known as the D 'ni once thrived . The D 'ni had the ability to create portals to other worlds or Ages by writing descriptive books of the Age . Players uncover clues and solve puzzles together ; plot developments were added via episodic content updates . 
 Uru 's multiplayer segment was delayed and did not ship with the single @-@ player component as planned ; in February 2004 the multiplayer was scrapped entirely . Dedicated fans kept an unsupported version of the game alive through Cyan @-@ maintained servers . Online game distributor GameTap resurrected the game as Myst Online in 2007 , but this version was canceled due to a lack of subscribers despite generally positive reviews . Cyan received the rights to Myst Online from GameTap and announced its intention to bring the game back . 
 In 2010 , Cyan Worlds released the game free of charge , under the name MO : <unk> . It is currently hosted on Cyan @-@ maintained servers . 
 In 2011 , Cyan Worlds and OpenUru.org announced the release of Myst Online 's client and 3ds Max plugin under the GNU GPL v3 license . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Myst Online 's gameplay is a massively multiplayer online game , where players interact with others to solve puzzles and advance the story . Players communicate with others using a " Ki " , an artifact which provides a special interface . Each player has their own personal Age , called Relto ; unlike in public areas , each player 's Relto is different depending on the player 's tastes . In public areas , any action a player takes is persistent and remains part of that world — kick a stone in one player 's game , for instance , and the stone will be moved when any other player enters the area . 
 Myst Online takes place in fictitious caverns below Earth 's surface . Thousands of years ago , a race known as the D 'ni practiced a craft known as The Art . By writing special books describing a location , the D 'ni created a link to that world . The D 'ni had their own number system and language distinct from the humans dwelling above them . According to the story , though the D 'ni society crumbled ( shortly after their first contact with a human who found her way down from the surface , and whose presence triggered a cultural collapse ) , archeologists much later discovered the caverns and teamed with a development studio ( Cyan Worlds ) to produce educational video games based on their findings ; thus , the story in the Myst games is canonically findings from the caverns . New content and additions to the story were revealed through " episodes " . 
 = = Development = = 
 After completing Riven — the sequel to the bestselling Myst — in 1997 , developer Rand Miller and his company , Cyan Worlds , began development of what would become Uru : Ages Beyond Myst . Initially , the game was to have been called Myst Online and have been a multiplayer @-@ only title , but game publisher Ubisoft pushed for a single @-@ player dimension . The online component , branding Uru Live , did not ship with Ages Beyond Myst ; in 2004 , Uru Live was suspended entirely . In 2006 , Cyan developed a stand @-@ in for Uru Live , called Until Uru ; this replacement was hosted by players in servers known as " shards " , and did not have content updates or official support .

 On May 9 , 2006 , Cyan Worlds and GameTap announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo that Myst Online : Uru Live would be returning in the holiday season of 2006 . The GameTap version did not require any physical purchase : all the game content was downloaded through GameTap , which was subscribed to for a monthly fee . A major reason for the resurrection of the game was the fan support . According to GameTap 's vice president of content Ricardo Sanchez , " One of the reasons [ GameTap was ] so attracted to Uru Live is that it had this persistent group that kept it alive during the dark days of it not being a product . " Closed public beta testing of Myst Online : Uru Live began in August 2006 . A period of semi @-@ open beta testing lasted from December 12 to December 18 , 2006 , with an open beta beginning on December 20 . On January 18 , 2007 , it was announced that a Macintosh port of the game was being developed by <unk> ; a beta became available soon after . This coincided with the release of the first new Age , Eder <unk> . GameTap brought Myst Online : Uru Live online in February 2007 . On May 19 , 2007 , Myst Online made the move to episodic content releases , with each episode adding new Ages , puzzles , and a plot continuation . It was also released for Mac OS X , the first GameTap game for the platform . 
 In February 2008 , GameTap announced that Myst Online was canceled . Sanchez released a statement that " The decision was a very difficult one and was made for business reasons rather than due to any issues regarding the design and vision of the amazing world that Cyan Worlds and Rand Miller have brought to us . Despite the great Myst Online experience coming to a close , Cyan is still a very valued partner of GameTap , we are on excellent terms , and we look forward to continuing our relationship in the future . " 
 Various explanations for Uru Live 's continuing troubles were given . Game designer Ernest Adams stated that " An important part of Myst 's atmosphere came from being alone in a very strange place . " Adams stated that the realities of online play distracted from the fantasy setting . When asked about the game 's commercial failure , Miller responded : 
 I 'm always going to fall back on ' we were ahead of our time , ' because it 's easy . The biggest thing we did was an all or nothing proposal from an entertainment point of view . It 's not like you can start up a new TV network and give one show a month and expect it to be successful ... We couldn 't quite pull that off with the money we had . " 
 GameTap parent Turner Broadcasting 's product development vice president Blake Lewin added that he did not believe any budget would have worked , due to the difficult content production pipeline . Lewin compared the game 's production to the television series Lost , which had difficulties producing a full season . In an article discussing the current state of the adventure game genre , IGN writers Steve Butts and Charles Onyett considered the major issues with Myst Online that while a different kind of adventure game , Myst Online was not accessible to players other than the " hardcore faithful " . The authors suggested that the franchise needed " to try something more dramatic than slapping an online architecture onto a game that already released , then periodically putting out small content updates . "

 After several months of negotiations , Cyan regained the rights to Myst Online for no charge . Miller stated that Cyan was committed to resurrecting Myst Online once again , giving fans the chance to interact with and create content . The new version of Myst Online was dubbed the " Myst Online Restoration Experiment " or MORE , and Cyan planned to reopen the game on their own servers without new content ; instead , tools would be released for fans to create new content . Cyan put forward a tentative outline , which started with Cyan running MORE servers , the restructuring of the <unk> web site , the release of MORE tools to players , and the delegation of approving fan @-@ made content given to groups known as " Guilds " . The ultimate goal was a continuation of the storyline and new content , with or without fan aid . 
 MORE was postponed after revenue to Cyan was disrupted and the company was forced to lay off all but seven employees in November 2008 . The company has since announced that Myst Online 's source code and tools would be given to the fans , making MORE an open source project . On April 6 , 2011 , Cyan Worlds released the client and the tools under the GNU GPL v3 license on the OpenUru.org website .

 On February 8 , 2010 , Cyan Worlds announced the return of Myst Online under the new title " Myst Online : <unk> Live Again " . The game is now running a live server and is being advertised as entirely free to play . Until MO : RE is released , <unk> won 't be hosting any new content . 
 Fans are , however , attempting to revitalize the community through existing means . One notable example is the inclusion of an experimental Artificial Intelligence called <unk> [ 1 ] , named after his creator 's avatar <unk> , or in @-@ game events such as heritage night [ 2 ] . Also , attempts are being made to revitalize the community through generous donations from those that wish to contribute , which are measured using Cyan 's <unk> meter .

 Myst Online was generally well received by critics . The game has average critic scores of 77 % and 83 % at aggregate sites Metacritic and Game Rankings , respectively . The Age 's varied visuals and strong aesthetic design were praised , as were the ambient sounds and music . The world that persistently changes depending on player actions was also lauded as more sophisticated than other <unk> . 
 Complaints from Uru : Ages Beyond Myst carried over to Myst Online ; for example , Robert Washburne of <unk> found that the interface was still clunky . Charles Onyett of IGN said that those who had played through the previous Uru content would not find many changes : " As a result , Myst veterans uninterested in plugging through Uru 's content again will be left with a dearth of things to actually do , shifting the onus of gameplay creation to the community . " Onyett continued that the only reason to subscribe to the game was the dedicated fan community and the potential for the game to expand . Sarah Borger of GamesRadar noted that most puzzles could be completed without the help of other players , making the game " a pretty chat room " . 
 = U.S. Route 45 in Michigan = 
 US Highway 45 ( US 45 ) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that runs from Mobile , Alabama , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan . The highway forms a part of the state trunkline highway system that is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . It enters the state from Wisconsin south of Watersmeet , ending at an intersection with Ontonagon Street in Ontonagon . In between , the roadway crosses the UP running for approximately 54 3 ⁄ 4 miles ( 88 @.@ 1 km ) through the Ottawa National Forest and parallel to the Ontonagon River . 
 The highway dates back to the 1930s in Michigan . At the time it was extended into the state , it replaced sections of M @-@ 26 and M @-@ 35 . An eight @-@ mile ( 13 km ) segment was significantly reconstructed in the late 1950s , and an alignment change in the 1970s moved the routing of US 45 near Rockland before it was reversed soon afterwards . A segment of roadway that formerly carried US 45 is the site of the Paulding Light , a local phenomenon whose origins were scientifically described in 2010 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 45 crosses from Wisconsin to Michigan near Land O ' Lakes , Wisconsin , east of the Sylvania Wilderness area of the Ottawa National Forest . The highway angles northeast from the state line before curving around to the north toward Watersmeet , where it intersects US 2 . Watersmeet is home to the northern section of the Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation . Continuing north across the Gogebic – Ontonagon county line , US 45 crosses the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones . 
 In southern Ontonagon County , the highway runs west of the Bond Falls <unk> near Paulding . North of here , the trunkline enters Bruce Crossing and intersects M @-@ 28 . After leaving town , US 45 runs northward parallel to the Middle Branch of the Ontonagon River , and the highway crosses the river near a roadside park south of Rockland . East of Rockland , US 45 meets the southern terminus of M @-@ 26 ; after the intersection , US 45 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Ontonagon River and a branch of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad ( ELS ) . 
 US 45 enters the south side of Ontonagon on Rockland Road near the Holy Family Cemetery . The roadway turns due north and crosses the ELS rail line , still running parallel to the course of the river . South of downtown , the highway crosses an intersection that serves as the joint termini of M @-@ 38 and M @-@ 64 . M @-@ 64 crosses the river from the west on a bridge built in 2006 and ends at the intersection . M @-@ 38 comes into town from the east and also ends at the same intersection . US 45 continues north on Rockland Road and turns northwest on River Street along the eastern river bank through downtown . The northern terminus of US 45 is at Ontonagon Street , about 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) from Lake Superior . 
 = = History = = 
 US 45 debuted in Michigan by 1935 on maps of the time . The highway previously terminated in Des Plaines , Illinois , until it was extended northward to Michigan . US 45 replaced M @-@ 26 between the state line north toward Rockland , as well as M @-@ 35 between Rockland and Ontonagon . The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) rebuilt an eight @-@ mile ( 13 km ) section of the highway in the Military Hills area of eastern Ontonagon County starting in 1957 . As part of the project , tons of waste copper rock were hauled into the area to provide a base for the reconstructed roadway , which was previously quite steep through the hills and muddy during rains . The project included a new bridge over the Ontonagon River that opened in late 1959 . Along with this bridge , the last eight miles ( 13 km ) of US 45 in the country were paved , connecting the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Superior with a hard @-@ surfaced road . 
 A rerouting in late 1971 moved the US 45 designation along M @-@ 26 between Rockland and Greenland . From Greenland , US 45 followed Ontonagon – Greenland Road to Ontonagon . In late 1973 , MDOT reversed the rerouting — US 45 was restored to its previous routing on Rockland Road between Rockland and Ontonagon and M @-@ 26 was re @-@ extended south from Greenland to Rockland ; M @-@ 38 was extended west along Ontonagon – Greenland Road . 
 In 2010 , students from Michigan Technological University solved the mystery of the Paulding Light , a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity . The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road , the former routing of US 45 in the Paulding area . According to area folklore , and indicated on signs in the viewing area , the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman . Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s . The students ' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US 45 in the Paulding area .

 Sweet Smell of Success is a 1957 American film noir drama film made by Hecht @-@ Hill @-@ Lancaster Productions and released by United Artists . It was directed by Alexander Mackendrick and stars Burt Lancaster , Tony Curtis , Susan Harrison and Martin Milner . The screenplay was written by Clifford Odets , Ernest Lehman and Mackendrick from the novelette by Lehman . Mary Grant designed the film 's costumes . 
 The film tells the story of powerful newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker ( portrayed by Lancaster and based on Walter Winchell ) who uses his connections to ruin his sister 's relationship with a man he deems unworthy of her . 
 Despite a poorly received preview screening , Sweet Smell of Success has greatly improved in stature over the years . It is now highly acclaimed by film critics , particularly for its cinematography and screenplay . In 1993 , the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant . " 
 Sweet Smell of Success : The Musical was created by Marvin Hamlisch , Craig <unk> and John Guare in 2002 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Manhattan press agent Sidney Falco ( Tony Curtis ) has been unable to gain mentions for his clients in J.J. Hunsecker 's ( Burt Lancaster ) influential , nationally syndicated newspaper column of late because of Falco 's failure to make good on a promise to break up the romance between Hunsecker 's younger sister Susan ( Susan Harrison ) and musician Steve Dallas ( Martin Milner ) , an up @-@ and @-@ coming jazz guitarist . 
 Falco is losing money and clients . Given one last chance by the bullying , intimidating Hunsecker , he schemes to plant a false rumor in a rival column that Dallas is a dope @-@ smoking Communist , then encourages Hunsecker to rescue Dallas 's reputation , certain that the headstrong boyfriend will reject Hunsecker 's favor and end up looking bad to Susan . 
 The plan works , in a way — Dallas can 't resist insulting Hunsecker 's methods , and , forced to choose between them , the timid Susan breaks up with Dallas in order to protect him from her brother . Hunsecker , however , is enraged by Dallas 's insults to him after a brief confrontation . He decides to ruin the boy after all ( against Falco 's advice ) and wants to have marijuana planted on the musician , then have him arrested and roughed up by corrupt police Lt. Harry Kello ( Emile Meyer ) . 
 It is such a dirty trick that even Falco wants no part of it , at least until Hunsecker promises to take a long vacation from his powerful column and turn it over to Falco in his absence . At a nightclub , Falco slips the marijuana cigarettes into a pocket of a coat belonging to Dallas , who is accosted by Kello outside the club . 
 Falco is summoned to Hunsecker 's penthouse apartment , only to find Susan there by herself and about to attempt suicide . He grabs her just as her brother walks in , but Hunsecker , encouraged by Susan 's silence , accuses Falco of trying to assault Susan and begins beating the physically weaker Falco . Falco pleads that he only came to the apartment at Hunsecker 's request , prompting Hunsecker to tell Falco that he never called him . As Susan stops Hunsecker from further harming him , Falco realizes that Susan placed the call in order to bring the men to blows . 
 In a climactic confrontation , Falco reveals to Susan that it was her brother who ordered him to destroy Dallas 's reputation and their relationship . Hunsecker makes a call to Kello to come after Falco , who tries to flee but is caught in Times Square by the brutal cop . 
 Back in the penthouse , Susan , her bags packed , acknowledges to her brother that she attempted suicide , considering death preferable to living with him . She walks out on him , saying that she will go to Dallas and tells Hunsecker that she pities rather than hates him . A mortified J.J. looks at his sister from his apartment , as she walks out into the daylight .

 = = Production = = 
 Faced with potential unemployment from the sale of Ealing Studios to the BBC in 1954 , director Alexander Mackendrick began entertaining offers from Hollywood . He rejected potential contracts from Cary Grant and David Selznick and signed with independent production company Hecht @-@ Hill @-@ Lancaster , enticed by their offer to adapt George Bernard Shaw ’ s play The Devil 's Disciple . After the project collapsed during pre @-@ production , Mackendrick asked to be released from his commitment . Harold Hecht refused and asked him to start work on another project – adapting Ernest Lehman ’ s <unk> Sweet Smell of Success into a film . 
 Lehman ’ s story had originally appeared in a 1950 issue of Cosmopolitan , renamed " Tell Me About It Tomorrow ! " because the editor of the magazine did not want the word " smell " in the publication . It was based on his own experiences working as an assistant to Irving Hoffman , a prominent New York press agent and columnist for The Hollywood Reporter . Hoffman subsequently did not speak to Lehman for a year and a half . Hoffman then wrote a column for The Hollywood Reporter speculating that Lehman would make a good screenwriter , and within a week Paramount called Lehman , inviting him to Los Angeles for talks . Lehman went on to forge a notable screenwriting career in Hollywood , writing Executive Suite , Sabrina , North by Northwest , The Sound of Music , West Side Story , The King and I , and Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production = = = 
 By the time Hecht @-@ Hill @-@ Lancaster acquired Success , Lehman was in position to not only adapt his own <unk> but also produce and direct the film . After scouting locations , Lehman was told by Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second thoughts about going with a first @-@ time director , so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick . Initially the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue @-@ heavy screenplay , so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks to make it more cinematic . As the script neared completion , Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture . James Hill took over and offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman ’ s replacement . Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets , the playwright whose reputation as a left @-@ wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee . 
 Mackendrick assumed that Odets would need only two or three weeks to polish the script , but he took four months . The director recalled , " We started shooting with no final script at all , while Clifford reconstructed the thing from stem to stern " . The plot was largely intact , but in Mackendrick 's biography he is quoted from Notes on Sweet Smell of Success : " What Clifford did , in effect , was dismantle the structure of every single sequence in order to rebuild situations and relationships that were much more complex , had much greater tension and more dramatic energy " . This process took time , and the start date for the production could not be delayed . Odets had to accompany the production to Manhattan and continued rewriting while they shot there . Returning to the city that had shunned him for going to Hollywood made Odets very neurotic and obsessed with all kinds of rituals as he worked at a furious pace , with pages often going straight from his typewriter to being shot the same day . Mackendrick said , " So we cut the script there on the floor , with the actors , just cutting down lines , making them more spare – what Clifford would have done himself , really , had there been time " . 
 Tony Curtis had to fight for the role of Sidney Falco because Universal , the studio to which he was contracted , was worried that it would ruin his career . Tired of doing pretty @-@ boy roles and wanting to prove that he could act , Curtis got his way . Orson Welles was originally considered for the role of J. J. Hunsecker . Mackendrick wanted to cast Hume Cronyn because he felt that Cronyn closely resembled Walter Winchell , the basis for the Hunsecker character in the novelette . Lehman makes the distinction in an interview that Winchell was the inspiration for the version of the character in the novelette , and that this differs from the character in the film version . United Artists wanted Burt Lancaster in the role because of his box office appeal and his successful pairing with Curtis on Trapeze . Robert Vaughn was signed to a contract with Lancaster 's film company and was to have played the Steve Dallas role but was drafted into the Army before he could begin the film . 
 Hecht @-@ Hill @-@ Lancaster allowed Mackendrick to familiarize himself with New York City before shooting the movie . In Notes on Sweet Smell of Success , Mackendrick said , " One of the characteristic aspects of New York , particularly of the area between 42nd Street and 57th Street , is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks . This was , I argued , essential to the story of characters driven by the uglier aspects of ambition and greed " . He took multiple photographs of the city from several fixed points and taped the pictures into a series of panoramas that he stuck on a wall and studied once he got back to Hollywood . 
 Cellist Fred Katz and drummer Chico Hamilton , who briefly appear in the film as themselves , wrote a score for the movie , which was ultimately rejected in favor of one by Elmer Bernstein . 
 = = = Principal photography = = = 
 Mackendrick shot the film in late 1956 , and was scared the entire time because Hecht @-@ Hill @-@ Lancaster had a reputation for firing their directors for any or even no reason at all . The filmmaker was used to extensive rehearsals before a scene was shot and often found himself shooting a script page one or two hours after Odets had written it . Lancaster ’ s presence proved to be intimidating for numerous individuals involved with the production ; at one point , Lehman had been approached to direct the film , but declined due to his fear of Lancaster . Mackendrick and composer Elmer Bernstein both found Lancaster difficult to work with , with Bernstein later recalling , “ Burt was really scary . He was a dangerous guy . He had a short fuse . ” Mackendrick decided to use Lancaster 's volatility to work for the character of JJ , asking that Lancaster wear his own <unk> glasses , which Mackendrick felt gave him the presence of " a scholarly brute . " Mackendrick smeared a thin layer of vaseline on the lenses , preventing Lancaster from focusing his eyes and giving him a perpetually blank gaze ; Mackendrick then intentionally filmed scenes with JJ from a low angle using a wide lens with overhead lighting directly above Lancaster , so that the frames cast shadows on his face . 
 Shooting on location in New York City also added to Mackendrick ’ s anxieties . Exteriors were shot in the busiest , noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers . Mackendrick remembered , " We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour , and we had high @-@ powered actors and a camera crane and police help and all the rest of it , but we didn ’ t have any script . We knew where we were going vaguely , but that ’ s all " . 
 = = Musical score and soundtrack = = 
 The film score was composed , arranged and conducted by Elmer Bernstein , but the picture also featured jazz themes performed by the Chico Hamilton Quintet , and two soundtrack albums were released on the Decca label in 1958 . Allmusic 's Blair Sanderson noted , " The soundtrack to Alexander Mackendrick 's 1957 motion picture Sweet Smell of Success combines orchestral music by the versatile Elmer Bernstein and modern jazz by the Chico Hamilton Quintet , including numbers performed in the film 's club scenes . Both provide a moody backdrop to the cynical showbiz drama and intersect at several key points through the use of a common theme , the tune ' Goodbye Baby ' . ... For his part , Bernstein employs richly dissonant big band sonorities and nocturnal urban blues in his score , and much of his music has the hard @-@ edged , gritty sound that was associated with big city life in the 1950s . Hamilton 's exploratory improvisations and Bernstein 's studio orchestrations make this a highly sophisticated film score " . In The Guardian , John L. Walters called the soundtrack " the sonic equivalent of a well @-@ mixed Manhattan : seven cool cues by drummer Chico Hamilton 's adventurous band , and 14 orchestral blasts by Elmer Bernstein " .

 A preview screening of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received , as Tony Curtis fans were expecting him to play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco . Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members " curling up , crossing their arms and legs , recoiling from the screen in disgust " . Burt Lancaster 's fans were not thrilled with their idol either , " finding the film too static and talky " . The film was a box office failure , and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill . " The night of the preview , Harold said to me , ' You know you 've wrecked our company ? We 're going to lose over a million dollars on this picture , ' " Hill recalled . However , Lancaster blamed Lehman , who remembers a confrontation they had : " Burt threatened me at a party after the preview . He said , ' You didn 't have to leave – you could have made this a much better picture . I ought to beat you up . ' I said , ' Go ahead – I could use the money . ' " 
 Sweet Smell of Success premiered in New York at Loew ’ s State in Times Square on June 27 , 1957 . Critical reaction was much more favorable . Time said that the movie was " raised to considerable dramatic heights by intense acting , taut direction ... superb camera work ... and , above all , by its whiplash dialogue " . Both it and the New York Herald included the film on their ten @-@ best lists for 1957 . The film 's reputation improved over time , with David Denby in New York magazine calling it " the most acrid , and the best " of all New York movies because it captured , " better than any film I know the atmosphere of Times Square and big @-@ city journalism " . 
 Sweet Smell of Success holds a 98 percent " fresh " rating based on 45 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes and a 100 metascore rating based on 5 reviews at Metacritic . Though Mackendrick 's direction of the actors and his staging of the scenes are at times extraordinary , in recent years critics have praised only the film 's dialogue , " courtesy of Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets , a high @-@ toned street vernacular that no real New Yorker has ever spoken but that every real New Yorker wishes he could " , A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times . Andrew Sarris in the New York Observer wrote , " the main incentive to see this movie is its witty , pungent and idiomatic dialogue , such as you never hear on the screen anymore in this age of special @-@ effects illiteracy " .

 = Berghuis v. Thompkins = 
 Berghuis v. Thompkins , 560 U.S. 370 ( 2010 ) ( docket 08 @-@ 1470 ) , is a decision by the United States Supreme Court in which the Court considered the position of a suspect who understands his or her right to remain silent under Miranda v. Arizona and is aware he or she has the right to remain silent , but does not explicitly invoke or waive the right . 
 The Court held that unless and until the suspect actually stated that he was relying on that right , his subsequent voluntary statements could be used in court and police could continue to interact with ( or question ) him . The mere act of remaining silent was , on its own , insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked his or her rights . Furthermore , a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying a waiver . 
 The Court was split 5 @-@ 4 . The dissent , authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor , argued that Miranda and other previous cases had required a claimed waiver of a constitutional right to be shown more strongly , especially in light of a lengthy interrogation with a possible " compelling influence " during which the accused had remained almost entirely silent for almost 3 hours prior to the self @-@ incriminating statement . 
 Responses from legal observers and the media were divided . Many considered Berghuis a further erosion of Miranda and were concerned it was " turning the clocks back " on safeguards developed in previous cases . At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda Others saw the ruling as a sign of strength and a signal that the Court , under its own impetus , was willing to address known issues resulting from the view of terrorism as crime . The more common view was concerned that vulnerable citizens could now be placed under pressure and , despite having an understanding of their rights , could be more easily coerced in a manner prejudicial to their interests . 
 = = Background of the case = = 
 = = = Legal background = = = 
 Under U.S. law and with rare exceptions , people ( whether criminal suspects or defendants or not ) have the right to remain silent as part of their right not to incriminate themselves under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution . Remaining silent is optional - they may speak or be silent as they wish . The Miranda warning concerns the duty of the police or other formal questioners to make sure that the suspect is aware they have that right prior to questioning , in case they want to be silent at some point or the suspect later pleads ignorance that they had the right ( and would have relied upon it had they been aware ) . Miranda v. Arizona 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966 ) and related cases contemplate that a suspect might invoke their rights ( make clear they wish to rely on them ) , waive their rights ( make clear they do not wish to rely on them ) , or do neither of these . A number of cases such as the present one , refine Miranda by addressing when and at what point a suspect , who is aware that they have the right to remain silent , is said to have begun to rely on that right , as opposed to when they were aware of the right but were not choosing to rely on it .

 Van Chester Thompkins was considered a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10 , 2000 in Southfield , Michigan . After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights , police officers interrogated him . Thompkins did not state at any time that he wanted to rely on his right to remain silent , nor that he did not want to talk to the police , nor that he wanted an attorney . The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the 3 @-@ hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case ( police described it as " nearly a monologue " ) , but near the end , detectives changed their approach and " tried a spiritual tac [ k ] " and an " appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs " . Thompkins was asked in sequence - did he believe in God , did he pray to God , and did he pray to God to forgive him for shooting the victim . He answered " yes " to each of these . Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements , claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent , that he had not waived that right , and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary . The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole . Of note , there had been significant other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction . 
 = = = State court appeal and federal court habeas corpus proceedings = = = 
 Thompkins appealed his conviction on grounds that included suppression of his admission - that he had invoked and not waived his right to remain silent - and deficient representation related to improper jury instructions , but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Thompkins ' Miranda claim . Thompkins then filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal District Court but it denied his request . However , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court 's decision , holding that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins ’ right to remain silent . 
 = = = Petition to the U.S. Supreme Court = = = 
 The state 's petition to the Supreme Court advanced a number of reasons to hold that extended silence should not be construed as an invoke , and asserted that the interview in the present case had not been coercive . 
 " Although the right of silence , in contrast to the right to counsel , can be exercised passively ( by not speaking ) , a suspect ’ s initial reticence does not inherently convey to a reasonable police officer that the suspect wishes to exercise a right to silence and terminate the interview . A suspect may want to listen to a recitation of the evidence against him or learn about the benefits of cooperation before deciding whether to exercise his rights . Or a suspect may be formulating an explanation of events that lessens his culpability , planning an alibi , or thinking through his options . Or he may be willing to talk about some topics but not others ... Simply presuming an invocation after some initial period of silence ... would override the wishes of those suspects who wanted to listen and deliberate further , rather than to end questioning ... Once a suspect has been provided with the requisite warnings and has had an opportunity to invoke his rights , the primary purposes of Miranda are fulfilled . This Court has described " a person 's right to cut off questioning " as " [ t ] he critical safeguard " provided by the Miranda warnings . " 
 " The police did not aggressively and relentlessly question respondent ... The three @-@ hour time period is similar to those the courts of appeals have found acceptable , and does not begin to approach the lengthy interrogations that this Court has disapproved . " 
 = = The Court 's decision = = 
 On June 1 , 2010 , by a vote of 5 @-@ 4 , the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit 's decision . In the Opinion of the Court , written by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy , the Court ruled that Thompkins ' silence during the interrogation did not invoke his right to remain silent and that he had waived his right to remain silent when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police . 
 ( On the other issue considered , the court ruled that prejudice due to deficient representation in respect of jury instruction was " doubtful " , but even if it had been deficient , other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction made it unlikely that a change of jury instruction would have made any difference . )

 The Court reasoned as follows on Thompkins ' various arguments : 
 There was no good reason why the standard for invoking the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel should differ . " Both protect ... against compulsory self @-@ incrimination ... by requiring an interrogation to cease when either right is invoked " . Making either of these statements would have ended the questions but the accused made neither of them . 
 The court further considered whether invocation of Miranda rights could be implied from the behavior or ambiguous words of the accused . It concluded ( in line with previous cases such as Davis v. United States ) that there was good reason why invoking these rights should require an unambiguous act of the accused , including certainty for police , prosecutors , and accused , and social benefit in law enforcement . 
 The court then considered whether the accused had taken action that waived those rights . <unk> must be a free choice with full awareness ( Moran v. <unk> ) . Miranda v. Arizona ( the Miranda ruling ) states that " [ A ] heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self @-@ incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel . " It was noted that the accused had read and expressed understanding of the rights , and had them read aloud , he had not pleaded lack of understanding , was given time , and therefore knew his rights . Specifically , having read the 5th warning ( " you have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned " ) he was aware this right was enduring and could be applied at any time in the questioning if he chose , and the police would have to honor the invocation if he did so . The court observed that " [ p ] <unk> are not required to <unk> suspects from time to time " . That a question is linked to religious beliefs does not cause the reply to be " involuntary " . The accused , understanding his rights and that they were capable of invocation at any point , had not chosen to invoke them . 
 The case of North Carolina v. Butler 441 U.S. 369 ( 1979 ) showed that a waiver of Miranda rights may be implied through " the defendant 's silence , coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver " . The court held that where a Miranda warning had been given and was understood by the accused , an accused 's uncoerced statement established an implied waiver of the right to remain silent . Thompkins answer to the police question , having understood but not chosen to invoke his rights , was sufficient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver . Further corroboration was that he had sporadically made other comments as well . 
 The court concluded that : 
 " In sum , a suspect who has received and understood the Miranda warnings , and has not invoked his Miranda rights , waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to the police . Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning . Understanding his rights in full , he waived his right to remain silent by making a voluntary statement to the police . " 
 = = = Sotomayor 's dissent = = = 
 Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion for four Justices , her first major dissenting opinion on the Court . She wrote that the case represented " a substantial retreat from the protection against compelled self @-@ incrimination that Miranda v. Arizona has long provided during custodial interrogation " , and that " [ S ] <unk> must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent — which , counterintuitively , requires them to speak . At the same time , suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so . " 
 The dissent noted that the government must satisfy the " high <unk> [ d ] of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights [ set forth in ] Johnson v. Zerbst " . It cited from Miranda that : 
 " [ A ] valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained [ ... ] the fact of lengthy interrogation ... before a statement is made is strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his rights . In these circumstances the fact that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced him to do so . It is inconsistent with any notion of a voluntary relinquishment of the privilege . " 
 and that Miranda and North Carolina v. Butler both agreed that : 
 " [ a ] court ' must presume that a defendant did not waive his right [ s ] ' ; the prosecution bears a ' heavy burden ' in attempting to demonstrate waiver ; the fact of a ' lengthy interrogation ' prior to obtaining statements is ' strong evidence ' against a finding of valid waiver ; ' mere silence ' in response to questioning is ' not enough ' ; and waiver may not be presumed ' simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained ' . " 
 The Court had previously observed that " while the privilege [ against self @-@ incrimination ] is sometimes a shelter to the guilty , [ it ] is often a protection to the innocent " and that " [ f ] or these reasons , we have observed , a criminal law system which comes to depend on the ' confession ' will , in the long run , be less reliable and more subject to abuses than a system relying on independent investigation . " 
 Although giving " sporadic " comments during the interview , no answers had been given that touched upon the case . The Court had not previously considered " whether a suspect can invoke the right to remain silent by remaining uncooperative and nearly silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes " and the dissent considered that silence throughout a lengthy interrogation " long past the point when he could be deciding whether to respond [ , ] cannot reasonably be understood other than as an invocation of the right to remain silent " . Butler also distinguished between a " sufficient course of conduct " and mere " inculpatory statements " . 
 The dissent concluded that the ruling was unnecessary in the changes it established , " flatly contradicts " Miranda and Butler , and that " [ e ] ven if Thompkins did not invoke that right , he is entitled to relief because Michigan did not satisfy its burden of establishing waiver " .

 = = = Legal views and responses = = = 
 Responses to the ruling were divided with a significant number of commentators focusing upon the erosion of Miranda , and others commenting upon the impact of the case on terrorism suspect interviews — a topic where Congress had recently attempted to legislate . 
 Cornell Law School professor Sherry F. <unk> 's discussion of the decision at <unk> was one of the former . She called the decision " an alarming break with the philosophy of Miranda v. Arizona [ that ] leaves that decision to stand as an arbitrary disclosure requirement , rather than the protection against coercive interrogation that it was originally crafted to be " . The author noted the purpose of Miranda was to address psychologically pressured interviews and that it had noted that adequate protection was essential in order " to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings " . The Miranda decision was intended to prevent coercion not merely to require a " disclosure of legal facts " . The present decision " allow [ ed ] a waiver of the right to occur after interrogation had commenced , through a response to that interrogation " . As a result , two subtly different meanings of " right to remain silent " could be construed , and a suspect who was ( in the words of Miranda v. Arizona ) " vulnerable , unassertive , and in need of protection " — precisely the kind of suspect Miranda aimed at protecting — would be left unaware : 
 " that one must utter magic words to go from possessing only one of these rights ( to remain silent while interrogation takes place ) to possessing the other right ( to avoid interrogation altogether ) . Thus , the law of Miranda sets a trap for the unwary — the very people who are feeling unable to assert themselves — to be subjected to interrogation until they are worn down and respond to questions . " 
 A joint Amicus Curiae brief on behalf of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and American Civil Liberties Union cautioned similarly : 
 " What is clear from the record is that the detectives chose not to seek an express Miranda waiver ... and importantly , the detectives made a strategic choice not to ask Thompkins whether he would be willing to waive his rights ... presumably because doing so risked invocation ... Miranda 's " waiver first " rule is the most effective way to avoid the very evil that case sought to address , namely that the highly coercive and intimidating custodial environment compels unwilling suspects to speak [ ... ] a " waiver by confession " hours later is presumed to be the product of the interrogation environment – just the sort of coerced " waiver " Miranda sought to prevent . " ( emphasis in original ) 
 Steven Shapiro , legal director of the ACLU , stated on similar lines in the Wall Street Journal online edition , that Berghuis " seriously undermines " Miranda , in which the court had " recognized that a suspect in police custody can be worn down by prolonged questioning and other interrogation tactics " . 
 UC Berkeley law professor John Yoo responded in a matching article in the same publication , that the court 's view provides interpretive guidance when a suspect says nothing for an extended period . More significantly ( he wrote ) , it symbolizes and parallels the Obama administration 's favouring of the " terrorism @-@ as @-@ crime " pre @-@ 2001 paradigm over the " terrorism @-@ as @-@ war " paradigm of the Bush era . ( See anti @-@ terrorism legislation and Bush Doctrine ) This perspective could influence terrorism cases , when the opponents were declared to be at war , since " interrogation would seek actionable intelligence to stop attacks , not confessions for use in civilian trials " . Yoo concluded that the court 's " new flexibility " would perhaps allow it to " ease the burden " on military , intelligence and police " and permit " more [ flexible responses to ] terrorism within the criminal @-@ justice paradigm , though at the expense of weakening the civil rights of all Americans " . The present ruling might clarify that Miranda was not relevant where information was not being collected for use at a trial . As such it might act in mitigation of " weak anti @-@ terrorism policies " . 
 Kent Scheidegger , legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation , stated that the court had recognized the " practical realities that the police face in dealing with suspects " and placed reasonable limits on " an artificial rule that is not really in the Constitution " . The statement concluded that " [ t ] he rule that really is in the Constitution , that no person may be compelled to be a witness against himself , is not changed by today 's decision " . 
 Emily Berman , counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law commented that " [ Berghuis ] ' potential consequences are as predictable as night following day : Police will interrogate criminal suspects who do not explicitly invoke their rights — often , those will be suspects who are unsophisticated , poorly educated or mentally ill — for hours on end . This will lead , just as inevitably , to more coerced — and therefore unreliable — confessions ... the very phenomenon that Miranda aimed to eliminate . " She noted the attorney general 's comment that Miranda warnings had not deterred terrorism suspects such as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad from talking and providing " valuable intelligence " . The positive observation was a reflection upon attempts by Congress to amend Miranda legislatively , that the decision " sends a strong signal " that " the Supreme Court is not shy about curtailing Miranda protections , even without prodding from Congress " . She concluded that " [ w ] hile it might look with hostility on congressional attempts to rein in the scope of the Miranda rule , the Supreme Court itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that Miranda affords criminal defendants . And it is willing to reach relatively far to do so . " 
 Other legal responses included Stanford University law professor Robert Weisberg , who stated that " this decision authorizes lower courts to construe ambiguous situations in favor of police and prosecutors " , and University of Michigan law professor Richard Friedman who concluded , " [ t ] his decision means that police can keep shooting questions at a suspect who refuses to talk as long as they want in hopes that the person will crack and give them some information ... It 's a little bit less restraint that the officers have to show . " 
 At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda . In The Right to Remain Silent , Charles <unk> argues that " the majority in Thompkins rejected the fundamental underpinnings of Miranda v. Arizona ’ s prophylactic rule and established a new one that fails to protect the rights of suspects . " and that " But in Thompkins , neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General were able to cite any decision in which a court found that a suspect had given an implied waiver after lengthy questioning . Thompkins persevered for almost three hours before succumbing to his interrogators . In finding a waiver on these facts , <unk> gives us an implied waiver doctrine on steroids . " 
 = = = Media response = = = 
 National and regional media outlets reported a range of views similar to the above : 
 Kansas City Star - " this is but one of a series of high court rulings in recent months that have effectively nipped away at the Miranda ruling .... Perhaps because it is occurring incrementally , few outside the legal community have taken note of the trend ... And besides , as long as the good guys win out over the bad , who cares how we get there , right ? ... We ought to care .... [ z ] <unk> for fighting crime shouldn ’ t be allowed to undercut American standards like ' innocent until proven guilty ' . " It concluded that Sotomayor - the newest justice at the court - seemed to understand that " [ g ] ood policing is based on building cases , not on coercing confessions ... What ’ s the matter with the conservatives on the court ? " 
 Bakersfield Californian - stated that " local attorneys [ are ] mixed on the decision " , citing a variety of local attorneys . These included a defense attorney as saying " [ t ] <unk> will tell whether this activist conservative @-@ majority Supreme Court is doing the right thing in moving back the clock on Miranda rights " and a district attorney as saying " Miranda had been broadened over the years far beyond what was necessary for its original goal of protecting suspects from [ coercion ] ... police culture has dramatically changed for the better in the 40 @-@ plus years since it came into being " . A second defense attorney was quoted as saying that " [ i ] t 's placing too much on a person who is already in an incredibly stressful situation . If I sit you down in a chair in a little room and shine a harsh light in your face and question you for three hours , under those conditions I could get a ham sandwich to confess . " A county public defender opined that the ruling was not unfavorable , as a clear answer would be preferable to uncertainty . Local police stated the ruling did not affect how interrogations would be conducted . 
 Philadelphia Inquirer - asked " [ s ] <unk> when do Americans have to declare their constitutional rights out loud in order to claim them ? " and that the decision had " set off ... shock waves among rights activists " . It commented that " [ t ] he fact that DNA <unk> often upend criminal confessions that turn out to have been coerced after lengthy interrogations demonstrates the risks of such police procedures . That 's a key reason Miranda rights were established in the first place " . The ruling made automatic videotaping of major @-@ crime interviews " critical " . It concluded that " [ i ] t may seem to some that the high court ruling will enable police to nab more bad guys and make the charges stick . But by setting up a ' gotcha ' set of rules about a key constitutional protection , the high court has eroded individual liberty for all Americans . " 
 A number of newspapers , including well known and national titles such as USA Today , The New York Times and The Washington Post , and titles such as Associated Press and The Washington Times , reported the facts on both sides without stating a strong editorial position in their coverage . 
 = = Subsequent ruling in Salinas v. Texas = = 
 The U.S. Constitution ’ s Fifth Amendment gives an individual suspected of crime a right not to be forced , by police or other government officials , into giving up evidence that would show he or she was guilty of a crime . Based on this constitutional prohibition against self @-@ incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials , the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his / her right to remain silent . After Berghuis , a subsequent case , Salinas v. Texas , considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers , but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request . It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest , the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his / her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment . 
 In Salinas , <unk> Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to a police station when officers asked him to accompany them to talk about the murder of two men . Salinas answered most of the officers ’ questions , but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found at the scene of the murders would match his gun . He shifted his feet , and otherwise acted nervously , but did not say anything . Later , at his trial , prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty , that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his . Salinas lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning , when an individual was not under arrest , could not be used against that person at a criminal trial . 
 The Supreme Court extended the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas , 570 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2013 ) , on June 17 , 2013 , holding that a suspect 's silence in response to a specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question . Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect 's silence could be used against him in these circumstances , Justices Alito , Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant 's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege . The other two Justices , Thomas and Scalia , concluded that the defendant 's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege , on the theory that the prosecutor 's comment at the trial — regarding the defendant 's silence in response to a question during the police interview — did not compel the defendant to give self @-@ incriminating testimony . 
 In essence the Supreme Court ruled the Fifth Amendment ’ s Self @-@ <unk> Clause does not protect a defendant ’ s refusal to answer questions asked by law enforcement before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights . In the concrete case the court issued the following holding : When petitioner had not yet been placed in custody or received Miranda warnings , and voluntarily responded to some questions by police about a murder , the prosecution ’ s use of his silence in response to another question as evidence of his guilty at trial did not violate the Fifth Amendment because petitioner failed to expressly invoke his privilege not to incriminate himself in response to the officer ’ s question . Long @-@ standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self @-@ incrimination must explicitly claim that protection . This requirement ensures that the government is put on notice when a defendant intends to claim this privilege and allows the government to either argue that the testimony is not self @-@ incriminating or offer immunity . The plurality opinion of Justices Alito , Roberts and Kennedy reiterated two exceptions to this principle : 1 ) that a criminal defendant does not need to take the stand at trial in order to explicitly claim this privilege ; and 2 ) that failure to claim this privilege must be excused when that failure was due to government coercion . The plurality opinion declined to extend these exceptions to the situation in Salinas v. Texas . Notwithstanding popular misconceptions , the Court held that the Fifth Amendment does not establish a complete right to remain silent but only guarantees that criminal defendant may not be forced to testify against himself or herself . Therefore , as long as police do not deprive defendants of the opportunity to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege , there is no Constitutional violation . The Court stated that there was no " ritualistic formula " necessary to assert the privilege against self @-@ incrimination , but that a person could not do so " by simply standing mute . " If an individual fails to invoke his right , and is later charged with a crime , the prosecution may use his silence at trial as evidence of his guilt .

 = Stephen V Báthory = 
 Stephen Báthory of <unk> ( Hungarian : Báthory István , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; Romanian : Ștefan Báthory ; 1430 – 1493 ) was a Hungarian commander , ' <unk> <unk> magister ' ( 1458 – ? ) , judge royal ( 1471 – 1493 ) and voivode of Transylvania ( 1479 – 1493 ) . He rose to power under King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and after the king 's death sided with Vladislav Jagiellon of Bohemia and later together with Pál Kinizsi defeated Prince John Corvin in the Battle of <unk> ( 1493 ) . As a result of his cruelty in Transylvania , especially against the Székelys , he was deposed by the King in 1493 and died shortly afterwards . 
 = = Family history = = 
 The Báthory family was a powerful and influential Hungarian noble family from the 14th to 17th century . The two branches of the family produced many voivodes , Transylvanian princes and a king , ( Stefan Batory of Poland ) . Báthory belonged to the powerful family of Gutkeled , of the <unk> branch . The name Báthory and the family coat @-@ of @-@ arms were granted in 1325 . 
 = = Career = = 
 In 1467 , he took part in Matthias ' bitter defeat against Moldavia at the Battle of Baia . In 1476 , Corvinus decided to support Vlad III Dracula in reclaiming his Wallachian throne from Basarab Laiotă . He therefore made Báthory supreme commander over an army of 8 @,@ 000 infantry and 13 @,@ 000 cavalry , but since Báthory was rather inexperienced in military leadership , " the actual leadership was shared by Dracula and the Serbian despot Vuk <unk> . Before this , Dracula and Báthory had waged war in Bosnia , where Báthory was sent by Corvinus to free a certain Bosnian king whose name was also Matthias . The new campaign would involve Hungarian , Moldavian , and Wallachian troops , with the assistance of a small Serbian contingent . Dracula wrote to his cousin , Prince Stephen III of Moldavia , to wait for him so that the two could merge their armies , but the merging failed due to <unk> in movement of the Hungarian troops , which resulted in Stephen 's defeat at the Battle of Valea Albă on July 26 , 1476 . On August 18 , the two armies merged and helped Stephen get rid of the Turks in Moldavia . After a consultation that took place in the city of Braşov , Dracula , Báthory , and <unk> invaded Wallachia from southern Transylvania with an army of 35 @,@ 000 , whereas Stephen would aid them by attacking eastern Wallachia with 15 @,@ 000 men . Dracula 's offensive began in early November 1476 and defeated Laiotă 's 18 @,@ 000 strong army at Rucăr , at the Wallachian @-@ Transylvanian border . Both armies lost around 10 @,@ 000 men . 
 On November 8 , Dracula captured the capital of Târgovişte where he met with Stephen . The two swore eternal allegiance to one another and when at the presence of Báthory , the two pledged as well to pursue a great crusade against the Turks . By November 11 , Báthory reported to the town officials of Sibiu that most of Wallachia was in Dracula 's hands and added that " all the boyars aside from two are with us " and " even the latter will soon join us . " On November 16 , Bucharest fell to Báthory 's army and on November 26 , Dracula was reestablished as Prince of Wallachia for his third time . After Stephen and Báthory retreated from Wallachia , Laiotă would return to Wallachia with an army to reclaim his throne . In December , <unk> and Dracula met each other in battle . Dracula possessed only a small army and was killed in battle .

 In 1479 , Báthory was made governor of Transylvania and in late August 1479 , an Ottoman expedition from Bosnia , commanded by twelve pashas , invaded Transylvania with a force of 43 @,@ 000 men . The Turks moved very quickly through the land while pillaging it , giving Báthory little time to gather his militia at Sibiu . Pál Kinizsi , the Ban of Timişoara , promised to aid Báthory . As Báthory approached Sebeş , Ali Bey , one of the Turkish pashas , had raised camp on a plain between Mureş and Sebeş , totally unaware that Kinizsi was also on his way against him . 
 On the early morning of October 13 , Báthory appeared on the " heights beyond the brook . " Ali was forced to stand ground in order to secure an eventual <unk> and evacuate his booty . " Báthory ordered his army to prepare for battle : his 3 @,@ 000 Transylvanian Saxons , supported by a second line of Transylvanian Wallachians , comprised the right flank on the Mureş River , while the Hungarians comprised the left flank — he and his heavy cavalry were placed in the middle . The Ottoman leaders were in disagreement and had their preparations for the battle delayed ; after " three hours of idle waiting , Báthory , confident that Pál Kinizsi would arrive any minute , gave the order to attack . " The Transylvanian Saxons opened the attack , but were routed ; the Transylvanian Wallachians followed their fate , with many being wounded or killed ; and later , the Hungarian line would be pressured to retreat to the centre . Báthory then charged with his heavy cavalry , but fell off his horse ; this alerted his companions who interpreted it as a bad omen and advised him to either turn back or retreat to the mountains . He ignored their advice and as head of his cavalry , charged the first Ottoman line with a great force , routing them . Ali then charged with his cavalry and a fierce battle took place that lasted for three hours . Báthory was seriously injured , as he bled from six wounds ; " his horse had been killed under him . " Surrounded by a " wall of corpses " and barely holding onto his life , he was about to lose the battle when Kinizsi 's army appeared on the hill , with drums and trumpets making their noise . Some 900 Serbs under a Demeter Jakšić assisted by " numerous courtiers of the king " , charged against the Turks . The Turks , who were taken by surprise , were slaughtered by the furious Kinizsi and after a renewed attack , he managed to save Báthory . 
 The few Turks who survived the massacre fled into the mountains , where the majority were killed by the local population . Ali , who spoke Romanian put on some peasant clothes and fled to Wallachia . Some 30 @,@ 000 Turks died in the battle , whereas Báthory lost 8 @,@ 000 Hungarians and some 2 @,@ 000 Transylvanian Saxons and Transylvanian Wallachians . The two commanders feasted together with their troops , with Kinizsi dancing with a dead Turk as his companion .

 Báthory was accused of using excessive cruelty against the Székely in Transylvania and was disposed by Vladislaus II in 1493 . He died shortly afterwards . His family would return to rule as Voivodes and then Princes of Transylvania . 
 = Tropical Storm Barbara ( 2007 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Barbara was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall during the 2007 Pacific hurricane season . The second storm of the season , Barbara developed from a small low pressure area on May 29 about 235 miles ( 380 km ) southeast of Acapulco , Mexico . The system drifted southward before turning to a steadily eastward motion , and quickly intensified into a tropical storm . Increased wind shear weakened Barbara , though it re @-@ organized to attain peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) before moving ashore just west of the border of Mexico and Guatemala . It rapidly weakened over land , and on June 2 the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on the storm . Despite expectations that the storm would attain hurricane status , Barbara moved ashore as a small , weak tropical storm . It produced locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds , and in most locations damage was minor . However , in southern Mexico , the rainfall destroyed large areas of cropland , with crop damage totaling 200 million pesos ( 2007 MXN , $ 55 million 2007 USD ) . In El Salvador , four people were killed by storm @-@ induced floods . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on May 14 , which is believed to have been the impetus to Barbara . The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day . Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence Zone , a broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27 , and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection . On May 29 , convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center , and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined . It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two @-@ E at 1800 UTC on May 29 about 115 miles ( 185 km ) southeast of Puerto Escondido , Oaxaca . Upon becoming a tropical cyclone , the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures , very light wind shear , and favorable upper @-@ level conditions . 
 In the hours after becoming a tropical cyclone , the deep convection associated with the depression decreased , though it again increased later in the day . A ragged rainband developed in the southeastern quadrant of the circulation , and based on increased Dvorak numbers and improved presentation on satellite imagery , the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Barbara on May 30 while it was located about 115 miles ( 185 km ) south of Puerto Escondido . This marked only the third time on record that two storms formed in May in the basin , after 1956 and 1984 . Initially , Barbara was forecast to intensify to attain hurricane status and reach winds of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . 
 The storm drifted southward and later eastward due to northerly flow behind a mid- to upper @-@ level trough in the Gulf of Mexico . With well @-@ defined outflow and warm sea surface temperatures , Barbara became better organized as tightly curved bands of convection developed near the center . However , by May 31 , increased wind shear and less inflow deteriorated the definition of the circulation , causing the storm to weaken . By later that day , the system contained a very small circulation within a large @-@ scale trough , and early on June 1 it was downgraded to tropical depression status . Later in the day , convective banding features re @-@ developed , and after a QuikSCAT overpass indicated a well @-@ defined circulation in the system , Barbara was again upgraded to tropical storm status . The storm reached peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and turned to the northeast as it tracked through a break in a ridge extending from the southwest Gulf of Mexico . Banding features continued to organize , and shortly before moving ashore a low @-@ level eye feature developed . At about 1300 UTC on June 2 , Barbara made landfall just west of the border between Mexico and Guatemala . The center quickly deteriorated to tropical depression status over the mountainous terrain of extreme southeastern Chiapas , and Barbara dissipated within twelve hours of moving ashore . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Early in the duration of the cyclone , the National Hurricane Center recommended for interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm . Upon regaining tropical storm status on June 1 , the governments of Guatemala and Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Sipacate , Guatemala to Barra de Tonala , Mexico . Later , as the track became more apparent , the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning , and a tropical storm watch was extended westward to Salina Cruz , Mexico . Officials in Mexico allocated emergency funds for southern regions of Chiapas and Oaxaca in preparation for a potential flooding disaster . At least 1 @,@ 400 people were evacuated in Chiapas to emergency shelters . 
 The outer rainbands of the storm first began affecting Guatemala and southeastern Mexico late on June 1 . In Mexico , the peak 24 @-@ hour rainfall total was 4 @.@ 96 inches ( 126 mm ) in <unk> , and across southeastern Mexico , the rainfall led to above normal levels in many rivers . An automatic surface station in Puerto Madero , Mexico recorded sustained winds of 36 mph ( 58 km / h ) with gusts of 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) shortly after landfall . In most locations , damage from the storm was minor , limited to downed light posts , some damaged roofs , and a brief power outage . However , winds and rains from the storm caused moderate to severe crop damage in the mountain range of southern Chiapas . About 35 sq. miles ( 90 km ² ) of banana crops were destroyed , with about 4 sq. miles ( 10 km ² ) of coffee damaged . The passage of the storm also resulted in damage to cocoa beans , mango , coconut , and other vegetables , with crop damage totaling about 200 million pesos ( 2007 MXN , $ 55 million 2007 USD ) . As a result of the crop damage , the government of Mexico provided 108 million pesos ( 2007 MXN , $ 10 million 2007 USD ) in financial aid to the affected farmers . 
 In <unk> , Guatemala near the border , winds from the storm destroyed the roofs of about a dozen palm huts , forcing over 100 residents to evacuate . The winds also downed hundreds of trees near the coastline . Heavy rainfall from the storm led to river flooding ; the island of <unk> was separated from the mainland after the bridge was washed away . Heavy rains along the periphery of the storm triggered significant flooding in El Salvador which killed at least four people .

 Portal 2 is a 2011 first @-@ person puzzle @-@ platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation . It is the sequel to Portal ( 2007 ) and was released on April 19 , 2011 , for Microsoft Windows , OS X , Linux , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve 's content delivery service Steam . Portal 2 was announced on March 5 , 2010 , following a week @-@ long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game . Before the game 's release on Steam , the company released the Potato Sack , a second multi @-@ week alternate reality game , involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early . 
 The game retains Portal 's gameplay elements , and adds new features , including tractor beams , laser redirection , bridges made of light , and paint @-@ like ' gels ' accelerating the player 's speed , allowing the player @-@ character to jump higher or place portals on any surface . These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival @-@ winning DigiPen student project Tag : The Power of Paint . In the single @-@ player campaign , the player controls protagonist Chell , awoken from suspended animation after many years , who must navigate the now @-@ dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS , a powerful supercomputer . The storyline introduces new characters , including Wheatley ( Stephen Merchant ) and Cave Johnson ( J. K. Simmons ) . Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS . Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game . Portal 2 also includes a two @-@ player cooperative mode , in which the robotic player @-@ characters Atlas and P @-@ Body ( both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker ) are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles . Valve provided post @-@ release support for the game , including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others . 
 Although some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel , Portal 2 received critical acclaim , particularly for its writing , pacing , and dark humor . The voice work of McLain , Merchant , and Simmons were also praised , as were the new gameplay elements , the challenging but surmountable learning curve , and the additional cooperative mode . Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011 , and several named it their Game of the Year . Portal 2 has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Portal 2 is a first @-@ person perspective puzzle game . The Player takes the role of Chell in the single @-@ player campaign , as one of two robots — Atlas and P @-@ Body — in the cooperative campaign , or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community @-@ developed puzzles . These four characters can explore and interact with the environment . Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury . There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface , but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately . When Chell dies in the single @-@ player game , the game restarts from a recent checkpoint ; in the cooperative game , the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle . The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory — a complicated , malleable mechanized maze . While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits , other parts occur in behind @-@ the @-@ scenes areas where the objective is less clear . 
 The initial tutorial levels guide the player through the general movement controls and illustrate how to interact with the environment . The player must solve puzzles using the ' portal gun ' or ' Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device ' , which can create two portals connecting two distant surfaces depicted as matte white , continuous , and flat . Characters can use these portals to move between rooms or to " fling " objects or themselves across a distance . Outlines of placed portals are visible through walls and other obstacles for easy location . 
 Game elements include Thermal Discouragement Beams ( lasers ) , Excursion <unk> ( tractor beams ) , and Hard Light Bridges , all of which can be transmitted through portals . Aerial Faith Plates launch the player or objects through the air and sometimes into portals . The player must disable turrets or avoid their line of sight . The Weighted Storage Cube has been redesigned , and there are new types : <unk> Cubes , which have prismatic lenses that redirect laser beams , spherical <unk> Safety Cubes , an antique version of the Weighted Storage Cube used in the underground levels , and a cube @-@ turret hybrid created by Wheatley after taking control of Aperture . The heart @-@ decorated Weighted Companion Cube reappears briefly . Early demonstrations included Pneumatic Diversity Vents , shown to transport objects and transfer suction power through portals , but these do not appear in the final game . All of these game elements open locked doors , or help or hamper the character from reaching the exit . 
 Paint @-@ like gels ( which are dispensed from pipes and can be transported through portals ) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them . Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly , blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface , and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals . Only one type of gel can be effective on a certain surface at a time only . Some surfaces , such as grilles , cannot be coated with a gel . Water can block or wash away gels , returning the surface or object to its normal state . 
 The game includes a two @-@ player cooperative mode . Two players can use the same console with a split screen , or can use a separate computer or console ; Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X , and PlayStation 3 users can play with each other regardless of platform ; a patch provided in late 2012 added split @-@ screen support for Windows and Mac OS X users under " Big Picture " mode . Both player @-@ characters are robots that control separate portal guns and can use the other character 's portals . Each player 's portals are of a different color scheme , whereof one is blue and purple and the other is orange and red . A calibration chamber separates the characters to teach the players to use the communication tools and portals . Most later chambers are less structured and require players to use both sets of portals for laser or funnel redirection , launches , and other maneuvers . The game provides voice communication between players , and online players can temporarily enter a split @-@ screen view to help coordinate actions . Players can " ping " to draw the other player 's attention to walls or objects , start countdown timers for synchronized actions , and perform joint gestures such as waving or hugging . The game tracks which chambers each player has completed and allows players to replay chambers they have completed with new partners . 
 Portal 2 's lead writer Erik Wolpaw estimates each campaign to be about six hours long . Portal 2 contains in @-@ game commentary from the game developers , writers , and artists . The commentary , accessible after completing the game once , appears on node icons scattered through the chambers . According to Valve , each of the single @-@ player and cooperative campaigns is 2 to 2 @.@ 5 times as long as the campaign in Portal , with the overall game five times as long . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Backstory = = = 
 The Portal series is linked to the Half @-@ Life series . The events in Portal take place between the first and second Half @-@ Life games ; while most of Portal 2 is set " a long time after " the events in Portal and Half @-@ Life 2 . 
 Before Portal , Aperture Science conducted experiments to determine whether human subjects could safely navigate dangerous " test chambers " , until the artificial intelligence GLaDOS , governing the laboratory , killed its employees . At the end of the first game the protagonist Chell destroys GLaDOS and momentarily escapes the facility , but is dragged back inside by an unseen figure later identified by writer Erik Wolpaw as the " Party Escort Bot " . A promotional comic shows estranged Aperture Science employee Doug <unk> , who used graffiti to guide the player in Portal , placing Chell into suspended animation to save her life , until the beginning of Portal 2 . 
 = = = Single @-@ player campaign = = = 
 Chell wakes in a stasis chamber resembling a motel room , where an artificial voice guides her through a cognitive test before she is put back to sleep . When she awakens again , the Aperture Science complex has become dilapidated and overgrown and appears on the verge of destruction . Wheatley ( Stephen Merchant ) , a personality core , helps her attempt to escape via the test chambers . In the process , they accidentally reactivate the dormant GLaDOS ( Ellen McLain ) , who separates Chell from Wheatley and rebuilds the laboratory . 
 Having done so , GLaDOS subjects Chell to new obstacle courses until Wheatley helps her escape once again . The pair sabotage the <unk> and neurotoxin @-@ manufacturing plants before confronting GLaDOS and performing a " core transfer " which replaces GLaDOS with Wheatley as the laboratory 's controlling intelligence . He is quickly corrupted by his newfound power and becomes malevolent , and when he attaches GLaDOS 's personality core to a potato battery , GLaDOS tells Chell that Wheatley was intentionally designed as an " intelligence dampening sphere " producing illogical thoughts , created to hamper her own personality . Denying this , Wheatley drops Chell and GLaDOS through an elevator shaft into the laboratories ' abandoned lowest level . Thereafter Chell ascends through the laboratories in order of construction ( the decor slowly changing from 1950s styles to one similar to that seen early in the game ) , periodically hearing audio recordings of Aperture Science 's founder , Cave Johnson ( J. K. Simmons ) , through which the player learns that Johnson became embittered and deranged as his company lost money and prestige , until his poisoning by moon dust , whereafter his assistant Caroline ( McLain ) became a test subject for a mind @-@ to @-@ computer transfer experiment , and ultimately became GLaDOS . Chell retrieves GLaDOS , and the two form a reluctant partnership to stop Wheatley before his mistakes destroy the laboratories . During their search , GLaDOS is troubled by the identification of herself as Caroline . 
 Chell and GLaDOS return to the modern chambers and face Wheatley , who is driven by GLaDOS 's software to test them against a series of traps , which Chell escapes . In their final confrontation , Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores ( Nolan North ) to Wheatley , allowing GLaDOS a second core transfer restoring her control . With the laboratories ' nuclear reactor on the brink of meltdown , the roof collapses , revealing the night sky , whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead , causing the vacuum of space to pull her and Wheatley through the other portal still inside the chamber . GLaDOS retrieves Chell , who falls unconscious , leaving Wheatley in space with a corrupt personality core orbiting him . 
 When Chell awakens , GLaDOS claims to have learned " valuable lessons " about humanity from the remnants of Caroline , then deletes Caroline 's personality files and reverts to her usual attitude , but decides that Chell is not worth the trouble of trying to kill , and releases her . Chell then traverses the building in an elevator , serenaded by the laboratories ' robotic sentinels in a song entitled " Cara Mia Addio " . On the surface , she enters a wheat field from a corrugated metal shed , with the charred and battered Weighted Companion Cube , supposedly incinerated during the events of Portal , thrown after her . 
 In a post @-@ credits scene , Wheatley floats helplessly through space with the corrupt personality core , and regrets betraying Chell . 
 = = = Cooperative campaign = = = 
 The cooperative story takes place after the single @-@ player campaign and has some ties into it , but players are not required to play them in order . Player characters Atlas and P @-@ Body are bipedal robots who navigate five sets of test chambers together , each with a fully functioning portal gun . After completing a test chamber , the robots are disassembled and reassembled at the next chamber . After completing each set of chambers , they are returned to a central hub . The puzzles in each set of chambers focus on a particular testing element or puzzle @-@ solving technique . In the first four sets , GLaDOS prepares the robots to venture outside of the test systems of Aperture Laboratories to recover data disks . She destroys them and restores their memories to new bodies — which also happens when they die in a test chamber hazard . At first , GLaDOS is excited about her non @-@ human test subjects , but later becomes dissatisfied because the two robots cannot truly die . At the end of the story , the robots gain entry to " the Vault " , where humans are stored in stasis . GLaDOS gives thanks to the robots on locating the humans , whom she sees as new test subjects , and destroys the robots . 
 = = Development = = 
 After the success of Portal , Valve decided to make Portal 2 a standalone product , partly because of pressure from other developers within Valve who wanted to work on a Portal product . Work began almost immediately after the release of Portal . Valve committed more resources to Portal 2 's development than they had for the first game ; Portal had a team of seven or eight people , but Portal 2 had a team of 30 or 40 . The initial team of four was expanded as subgroups formed to devise game mechanics and to plot the story . Participants in internal review processes were inspired by what they saw to join the project . According to Erik Wolpaw , some Portal 2 developers worked on the Left 4 Dead games to help them meet milestones , but returned to Portal 2 , " with extra people in tow . " Kim Swift , Portal 's designer , left Valve for Airtight Games halfway through Portal 2 's development . 
 Project manager Erik Johnson said Valve 's goal for Portal 2 was to find a way to " re @-@ surprise " players , which he considered a " pretty terrifying " prospect . In March 2011 , one month before the game 's release , Valve president Gabe Newell called Portal 2 " the best game we 've ever done . " After Portal 2 's release , Geoff Keighley wrote that according to Newell , " Portal 2 will probably be Valve 's last game with an isolated single @-@ player experience " . Keighley later stated that the use of the word " probably " suggests that " this could change . " Newell said that Valve is not " giving up on single @-@ player at all " , but intends to include more social features on top of the single player experience , akin to the cooperative mode in Portal 2 . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Early in its development , the development team planned to exclude portals from Portal 2 . For five months , Valve focused on a gameplay mechanic called " F @-@ Stop " , the specifics of which as of January 2013 are unknown outside of Valve , because the developers considered using it for a new game . Though the new mechanics prompted some positive feedback , every playtester expressed disappointment at the omission of portals . Following a report in Kotaku of some leaked aspects of the game 's plot then under consideration , Newell directed the team to reconsider its plans for Portal 2 , including the lack of portals . 
 Johnson stated that Valve 's aim was not to make Portal 2 more difficult than its predecessor , but instead to produce " a game where you think your way through particular parts of the level , and feel really smart when you solve it . " Portal 2 allows the player to take incremental steps to understand the game 's mechanics , an approach that led to two basic types of test chamber . The first type , which Valve calls " <unk> " , provides a relatively safe environment for player to experiment with a new gameplay concept ; the second type combines elements in new ways to force the player to think laterally , providing challenging and rewarding puzzles . Chambers were first developed through whiteboard via isometric drawings . The developers performed a sanity check on the chamber before crafting simple levels with a software tool called the Hammer level editor . Extensive playtesting ensured the solutions to each chamber were neither too obvious nor too difficult , and observed alternative solutions discovered by playtesters . Based on play @-@ testing results , the design team retained these alternative solutions or blocked them if they were considered too easy . These versions were sent back for further play @-@ testing to verify that the new elements did not prevent players from finding solutions ; further iterations between artists and playtesters occurred until such issues were resolved . Some elements from Portal were modified to suit Portal 2 ; whereas players of Portal would be familiar with the game mechanics , novice players required some training , as would players of Portal for some game elements . For example , the energy spheres used in the first game were replaced with lasers , which provided immediate feedback and reduced the in @-@ game training time . 
 The designers built several of Portal 2 's early chambers by applying decay , collapse , and overgrowth to Portal chambers to give Portal players a sense of nostalgia and a sense of time passed in the game 's world . The design team replaced low resolution textures from the first game with higher @-@ resolution , dirty textures that the new game engine could support . The middle section of the single @-@ player campaign takes place in large in @-@ game spaces in which most surfaces are unable to accept portals , which forces players to find creative ways to cross them . Much of the architecture in these sections was inspired by photographs of industrial complexes , including CERN , NASA , and the abandoned Soviet space program . According to writer Jay Pinkerton , in the game 's final section , in which Wheatley controls the Aperture facility , " the level designers just had a blast " creating deranged chambers reflecting Wheatley 's stupidity . The designers recognized that solving puzzles would mentally tire players , so they inserted occasional " experiences " to provide a respite and to advance the plot . 
 Portal 2 integrates a game mechanic from Tag Team 's Tag : The Power of Paint : paint @-@ like gels that impart special properties to surfaces or objects they coat . Impressed by Tag , Valve hired its creators to develop the mechanic further and only later decided to include it in Portal 2 . Valve 's vice @-@ president of marketing said , " the decision to combine their tech with Portal 2 came naturally " . Journalists have likened Tag to Narbacular Drop , the DigiPen student project that became Portal . The Repulsion ( jumping ) and Propulsion ( running ) gels in Portal 2 originated in Tag . Using the third Tag gel , which allows the character to walk on any coated surface regardless of gravity , gave playtesters motion sickness . It was replaced by Conversion gel , which integrates with the portal mechanic . The gels give the player more control over the environment , which increased the challenge for the puzzle designers . The gels are rendered using fluid dynamics routines specially developed at Valve by the former Tag Team . 
 Portal 2 uses advanced rendering techniques developed for Left 4 Dead 2 for rendering pools of liquid ; Portal 2 combines " flowing " surface maps to mimic the motion of water with " debris flow " maps and random noise to create realistic , real @-@ time rendering of water effects . 
 The cooperative gameplay originated from players ' requests and from anecdotes of players working together on the same computer or console to solve the game 's puzzles . Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point @-@ and @-@ click adventure games . The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve 's Left 4 Dead cooperative games , in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it . While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player , the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication , and Valve recognizes they are much more difficult than the single @-@ player puzzles . Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single @-@ player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2 , but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers . Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player . As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals , the level was sent back to the designers for further work . Except in a few cases , Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation . Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically ; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room , emphasizing that the two characters , while working together , are separate entities . The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one 's partner was a necessary element , since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple , verbal instructions . 
 Valve considered adding a competitive mode to Portal 2 . According to Wolpaw , the mode was similar to the video game Speedball ; one team would try to transport a ball from one side of the playing field to the other using portals , while the other team would attempt to stop them with their own use of portals . Matches would commence with this objective in mind , but quickly descended into chaos . Valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more and therefore they focused on the cooperative mode . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Erik Wolpaw , National Lampoon veteran Jay Pinkerton and Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek wrote the game 's script . Wolpaw and Pinkerton wrote the single @-@ player campaign story , while Faliszek wrote GLaDOS 's lines for the cooperative campaign . The game has 13 @,@ 000 lines of dialogue . The writers felt they needed to create a larger story for a stand @-@ alone title , and wanted the game to " feel relatively intimate " , and avoided adding too many new characters . They considered expanding the " sterility and dryness " of Portal and adding more comedy to the script . Wolpaw said that while some developers have been moving towards art games , no one had made a comedic video game . The game 's story development was tightly coordinated with the gameplay development and testing . 
 The developers of Portal 2 initially envisioned it as a prequel to Portal set in the 1950s , long before GLaDOS took over the Aperture Science facility , with events set in motion when Aperture CEO Cave Johnson becomes trapped within a computer . Johnson would have led an army of robots , which would battle against the player to rise to power within Aperture . In June 2008 , based on information from a casting call website and leaked script samples , Kotaku reported that Valve was seeking voice actors to play Johnson , named him as an AI and identified the game as a prequel . Valve attributed this leak to an " overeager agent " . Following negative playtester feedback about the omission of Chell and GLaDOS , Portal 2 was re @-@ conceived as a sequel . The team returned to the idea of exploring parts of the facility from Aperture 's early days , and reincorporated Johnson through a series of recordings . 
 The writers originally conceived several premature joke game endings if the player performed certain actions , but these required too much development effort for little payback and were scrapped . One of these joke endings was triggered by shooting a portal onto the moon 's surface , after which the player 's character would die from asphyxiation over a closing song , but the idea of creating a portal on the moon was incorporated into the game 's final ending . The writers planned that Chell would say a single word during the ending , but this was not considered funny enough . In an early version of the script , Chell finds a lost " tribe " of turrets looking for their leader , a huge " Animal King " turret which can be seen in in @-@ game videos of the retail product . As a reward , the Animal King would have married Chell to a turret , which would have followed Chell around the game without visible movement . The cooperative campaign was planned to feature a more detailed storyline , in which GLaDOS would send two robots to discover human artifacts , such as a comic based on a pastiche of Garfield . The writers hoped to use this idea to make the robots human @-@ like for testing purposes , but recognized that unlike the captive audience of the single @-@ player campaign , the two players in cooperative mode may simply talk over the story , and thus the story was condensed into very basic elements . 
 Wolpaw said that while many story elements of Portal are revisited in Portal 2 , he avoided some of the memes — such as the frequently repeated " the cake is a lie " . He said , " if you thought you were sick of the memes , I was sick of it way ahead of you " . Wolpaw " couldn 't resist putting in just one " cake joke . The writers did not try to predict or write new memes , and Wolpaw said , " you can 't really plan for [ dialogue to become a meme ] because if you do it probably seems weird and forced " . Portal 2 produced its own memes , including a space @-@ obsessed personality core . Valve later created a Space Core modification for the game The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim ( see below ) , and the Space Core also appeared as a laser @-@ based engraving on a panel manufactured by NASA for the International Space Station . 
 The writers saw Aperture Science itself as a character . It is depicted as a " living , breathing place " , and " a science company that 's gone mad with science . " In the Lab Rat comic , the facility is described as a " beautiful and terrible " place , " a metastasized amalgam of add @-@ ons , additions and appropriations . Building itself out of itself . " 
 Richard McCormick of PlayStation 3 Magazine identified several elements of Portal 2 's story that reference the myth of Prometheus ; McCormick wrote that GLaDOS is a personification of Prometheus , who grants knowledge to humanity — in the form of the portal gun — and is then punished by being bound to a rock , pecked at by birds , and is cast into the pits of Tartarus . McCormick also likens Wheatley to Prometheus ' foolish brother Epimetheus . Within the game , a sentry gun makes reference to the Prometheus myth , the word " Tartarus " is visible on the supporting columns in the depths of Aperture Science , and a portrait of Cave and Caroline also shows Aeschylus , the presumed author of Prometheus Bound . Journalists and players have also found connections between Portal 2 and Half @-@ Life 2 . In a crossover , in Portal 2 an experiment accidentally teleported Aperture Science 's cargo ship , the Borealis , into the position in which it is discovered at the end of Half @-@ Life 2 : Episode Two . 
 = = = Character design = = = 
 Though Portal 2 introduced some new characters , the writers wanted to maintain the one @-@ on @-@ one relationships between each character and the player @-@ character . Valve explored the possibility of introducing a new protagonist for Portal 2 . The playtesters accepted playing as a different character for the first part of the game , but they became disoriented when GLaDOS did not recognize them . The writers returned to using Chell , the protagonist of Portal . Valve artists experimented with Chell 's attire , and considered changing her ( ambiguous ) nationality . They returned to the orange " dehumanizing " jumpsuit from Portal with the top tied around Chell 's waist to enhance her freedom of movement and help her " stand out more as an individual " . PSM3 called the new look " controversially sexy " . As in the first game , Chell 's facial appearance is based on that of voice actress <unk> Glidewell . Chell continues her role as a silent observer , as the straight man in response to the insanity around her and refuses to give her antagonists any satisfaction . 
 As part of her character arc , the plot moves GLaDOS from her anger with Chell for her actions in Portal , which Wolpaw said " was going to get old pretty quick " , to an internal struggle . The reuse of McLain 's voice led to the creation of a backstory and subplot about GLaDOS 's creation . The writers panicked when they realized that their plans to have Chell and GLaDOS play off each other would only work if both players spoke . To remedy this , they created the Caroline subplot to give GLaDOS an external situation to deal with and to drive the story during the middle act of the game . 
 The writers considered introducing about six personality cores stored in portable spheres , whose main function would be story advancement . They planned cores based on Morgan Freeman 's character Red from The Shawshank Redemption and Quint from Jaws , among others . Ultimately they decided to concentrate on a single core , Wheatley , recycling two of the rejected cores in the final boss fight . Karen Prell led the animation team for Wheatley and the other personality cores . 
 Pictures of Cave Johnson , based on the face of lead animator Bill Fletcher , appear throughout Portal 2 . Though comparisons have been made between Johnson and Andrew Ryan , the wealthy industrialist who created the fictional underwater city of Rapture in BioShock , Wolpaw says the writers did not consider this character while creating Johnson . The two robotic characters provide some amusing death scenes in the cooperative mode , such as struggling while being crushed by a lowering ceiling . The artists thought the look of the robots would help tell the story , and the fact that they are holding hands emphasizes the cooperative mode . " Expressive noises " and mannerisms are used in place of distinguishable dialogue , and the robotic characters were designed as a double @-@ act , similar to Laurel and Hardy . 
 = = = Voice cast = = = 
 GLaDOS returns from Portal as a major character and the game 's antagonist , and is voiced by Ellen McLain . The writers found that they needed another character to play off Johnson , but did not want to hire another voice actor . Having already recruited McLain to play GLaDOS , they asked her to provide the voice for Caroline , Cave Johnson 's assistant . Wheatley is voiced by Stephen Merchant ; early demonstrations at trade shows used the voice of Valve animator Richard Lord . The writers wrote Wheatley 's lines with Merchant in mind , citing his unique " vocal silhouette " and his ability to ad lib in a " frantic " manner . They had assumed that Merchant would be unavailable and contacted The IT Crowd 's writer Graham Linehan to try to get Richard Ayoade , but then discovered that Merchant was interested . Merchant spent around sixteen hours recording lines and was given freedom to improvise . 
 J. K. Simmons voices Cave Johnson , Aperture Science 's founder and CEO . Simmons 's selection helped to solidify the character 's development . The robots ' voices were provided by Dee Bradley Baker , who had performed similar robotic voices for the Star Wars : The Clone Wars media . 
 In the cooperative campaign , a separate story involves two robotic characters and GLaDOS . The designers initially planned to use Chell and a new human character called " Mel " . GLaDOS ' dialogue would play off the humans ' " image issues " , and this aspect was retained after the designers switched to using robots . GLaDOS seems troubled by the robots ' cooperation , and tries to aggravate their relationship through psychological tactics , such as praising one robot over the other . Valve initially considered having GLaDOS deliver separate lines to each player , but they found this to be a significant effort for minimal benefit . The writers also tried adding lines for GLaDOS that would encourage the players to compete against each other for rewards , such as meaningless points , but playtesters did not respond well . Faliszek said that in cooperative games , it can be difficult to deliver key dialogue or in @-@ game events to players , who may not be looking in the right direction at the right time . Instead , using their experience from previous games , Faliszek and Wolpaw kept the story and key comedic lines short , and repeated them frequently . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Portal 2 contains both scored and procedurally generated music created by Valve 's composer , Mike <unk> , and two songs ; " Want You Gone " recorded by Jonathan Coulton , used on the final credits of the single @-@ player mode , and " Exile <unk> " by The National , used in the background of one of the Rat Man 's dens . The full soundtrack " Songs to Test By " , containing most of the songs in the game , was released as three free downloads between May and September 2011 , and later in October 2012 as a retail Collector 's Edition , including the soundtrack from Portal .

 In January 2008 , Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi told Eurogamer , " There 'll be more Portal , for sure " , and Portal designer Kim Swift confirmed that work on Portal 2 would begin the following month . Swift said multiplayer Portal was technically possible , but that it was " less fun than you 'd think . " 
 Portal 2 was officially announced on March 5 , 2010 , via Game Informer . Events during the preceding week foreshadowed the announcement . On March 1 , Valve released a patch for Portal that included a new achievement , " Transmission Received " , requiring the player to manipulate in @-@ game radios . This revealed new sound effects that became part of an alternate reality game ( ARG ) . The new effects included Morse code strings that suggested GLaDOS was rebooting and <unk> images from a grainy Aperture Science video . The images included hints to a BBS phone number that , when accessed , provided a large number of ASCII @-@ based images relating to Portal and segments of Aperture Science documents . Many of these ASCII pictures were later published in the Game Informer reveal of the title . New ASCII images continued to appear on the BBS after the official announcement . Background on the ARG is embedded in additional <unk> images found in a hidden room in Portal 2 . Valve 's Adam Foster came up with the idea for the ARG , tying it to the Game Informer reveal , and he provided his own home phone line to run the BBS software on , as Valve 's offices at the time were too modern to support the protocol . Foster estimates the ARG cost less than $ 100 to run . 
 A second Portal patch released on March 3 altered the game 's ending sequence to show Chell being pulled back into the Aperture facility . Gaming journalists speculated that an announcement of Portal 2 was imminent . On March 5 , Game Informer announced Portal 2 's official release on the cover of its April issue . During the following week , Gabe Newell 's speech accepting the Pioneer Award at the Game Developers Conference 2010 ended with a fake blue screen of death appearing on a screen behind him with a message purported to be from GLaDOS which hinted of further Portal 2 news at the upcoming E3 2010 . Two weeks before the E3 , game journalists received a cryptic e @-@ mail , worded as a press release from Aperture Science , hinting that the presentation on Portal 2 would be replaced with " a surprise " jointly hosted by Aperture Science and Valve . This prompted speculation that the surprise would be the announcement of Half @-@ Life 2 : Episode Three , but Valve confirmed that it would be about Portal 2 . The surprise was the announcement of Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 . 
 = = = Marketing and release = = = 
 The March 2010 announcement said that Portal 2 would be released in late 2010 . In August 2010 , Valve postponed the release to February 2011 , with a Steam release date of February 9 , to allow it to complete changes to the game 's dialogue , to fill and connect about sixty test chambers , and to finish refinements to the gel gameplay mechanic . Valve announced a further delay in November 2010 , and gave a worldwide release date through retail and online channels of April 18 , 2011 . Wolpaw stated that this eight @-@ week delay was used to expand the game 's content before reaching an internal milestone called a " content lock " , after which no further content could be added . The remaining development work involved debugging . Newell allowed the delay considering the added benefits of the new content , because he thought the company would not lose any commercial opportunities because of it . On February 18 , 2011 , Newell confirmed that Valve had completed the development work on Portal 2 and that they were " waiting for final approvals and to get the discs manufactured " . Portal 2 was the first Valve product simultaneously released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X computers through the Steam platform . Retail copies for all platforms were distributed by Electronic Arts . 
 On April 1 , 2011 , Valve released another alternate reality game called the Potato Sack . Players tried to solve the multi @-@ tiered puzzle , coordinating efforts through web sites and chat rooms . Some journalists believed the game denoted the release of Portal 2 on April 15 , 2011 , instead of the target release date of April 19 , 2011 . On April 15 , the players discovered " GLaDOS @ Home " , a distributed computing spoof that encouraged participants to play the games to unlock Portal 2 early . Once the puzzles were solved , Portal 2 was unlocked about ten hours before its planned release . 
 Valve created a series of television commercials to promote Portal 2 . Valve had worked with advertising agencies in the past , but Lombardi found the advertisements created had shown little ingenuity . Valve 's Doug Lombardi had been disappointed by " Copycat treatments . Cliché treatments . Treatments that reveal the agency wasn 't listening in the initial meeting . " Using viewer feedback , Valve tailored the ad content until they were satisfied with the results . The ads took eight weeks to complete . Valve also developed online promotional videos featuring J. K. Simmons narrating as Cave Johnson , to promote new elements of Portal 2 's gameplay . These videos were part of a larger effort described by Newell as a " documentary @-@ style investment opportunity " for Portal 2 . An earlier video released on February 14 , 2011 , promoted the cooperative aspect of Portal 2 as a <unk> 's gift and " lit up our preorders , our buzz , all the metrics that are used and collected by publishers and retailers " . Lombardi said the videos " dwarfed the demos and interviews we did " . Valve also offered Portal 2 @-@ themed merchandise , such as posters , drinking glasses , and T @-@ shirts . 
 = = = Additional and downloadable content = = = 
 Portal 2 includes bonus content , including four promotional videos , a Lab Rat comic , and an interactive trailer for the 2011 film Super 8 , constructed with the Source game engine . A feature called " Robot Enrichment " allows players to customize the cooperative campaign characters with new gestures and cosmetic items such as hats or flags . These can be earned in @-@ game , traded with other players , or bought through microtransactions at the in @-@ game store . 
 Valve planned to produce downloadable content for Portal 2 , beginning with " Peer Review " , released on October 4 , 2011 . The content , which is free regardless of platform , includes a new cooperative campaign which extends the game 's story . A week from the end of the cooperative campaign , GLaDOS prepares Atlas and P @-@ Body to deal with an intruder within Aperture Science — the bird that had previously abducted her as a potato . The content also adds a " challenge mode " similar to that in Portal — players try to complete specific chambers with the shortest time or fewest number of portals used , both which are tracked on overall and friends leaderboards . The challenge modes are available for both single @-@ player and cooperative modes . 
 According to Faliszek , user @-@ generated content for Portal 2 would be available on all platforms , but because of software dependencies , the necessary modding tools would only be available for Windows . Valve released beta versions of the modding tools on May 10 , 2011 , and supported a competition held by the community mapping website " Thinking with Portals " in May 2011 , providing prizes for the most @-@ selected maps . The " Perpetual Testing Initiative " , a free title update for the Windows and Mac versions , was released on May 8 , 2012 , and includes a new level editor and a means of obtaining and sharing user @-@ created levels through the Steam Workshop . In November 2011 , <unk> host Geoff Keighley said that Valve was developing a simplified level editing tool to allow novice editors to assemble test chambers without learning how to use the modified Valve Hammer Editor , and an in @-@ game system to distribute user @-@ created levels via the Steam Workshop . This mapping system entered beta testing in March 2012 . Within a few days of release , the Perpetual Testing Initiative add @-@ on had been used to create 35 @,@ 000 maps , with 1 @.@ 3 million downloads of these maps through Steam . Within a month , more than 150 @,@ 000 user @-@ created maps were available . The first release of the Perpetual Testing Initiative was limited to single @-@ player maps , but a patch released in August 2012 enabled users to create new levels for cooperative play . 
 As of January 2013 , Valve supports fan reuse of Portal 2 content , offering selected assets and assistance . The Windows release of Bastion includes a weapon inspired by Portal 2 's Conversion Gel and turrets ; its developer Supergiant Games received writing assistance from Eric Wolpaw and McLain voiced new lines for the turrets . An add @-@ on scenario for Hidden Path Entertainment 's tower defense game Defense Grid : The Awakening incorporates GLaDOS as an antagonist using new dialogue from McLain and assets from Portal 2 . Wolpaw and McLain also helped to create additional lines for GLaDOS for a custom single @-@ player map commissioned by Gary <unk> , which he used to propose marriage to his fiancee , Stephanie . For a patch for Bethesda 's The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim that incorporated support for Steam Workshop content , Valve developed a free add @-@ on module that introduced the Space Core as a non @-@ player character that follows the player around . Valve collaborated with Zen Studios to create a Portal 2 @-@ themed pinball table , among other Valve @-@ themed tables , for their games Pinball FX 2 and Zen Pinball . A Portal 2 @-@ themed set is available for Lego Dimensions by Warner Bros. Entertainment and Traveller 's Tales ; the game features additional stories written by Traveller 's Tales with Valve 's blessing set after the events of Portal 2 , with Ellen McLain , Stephen Merchant and J.K. Simmons reprising their respective voice roles , as well as a new GLaDOS credits song written by Jonathan Coulton and performed by McLain . 
 The Xbox 360 version was added to the backwards compatibility feature for the Xbox One in June 2016 . 
 = = Use in education = = 
 Several critics wrote that Portal 2 excels in teaching the player to solve puzzles ; in a review for the New York Times , Seth Schiesel wrote , " Somewhere out there an innovative , dynamic high school physics teacher will use Portal 2 as the linchpin of an entire series of lessons and will immediately become the most important science teacher those lucky students have ever had . " Mathematics and science teachers wrote e @-@ mails to Valve to tell them how they had included Portal in their classroom lessons as part of a project to promote the " gamification of learning " . Portal developers Joshua <unk> and <unk> Malaika led a team within Valve to explore ways of using Portal 2 for education . This led to the development of Puzzle Maker , a level editor for Portal 2 players , built from the professional tools used to develop the game . <unk> and Malaika did not want to design curricula themselves , but wanted to provide educators with tools for creating lesson plans . Hammer , the only tool freely available before the release of the built @-@ in level editor in 2012 , was difficult for educators to learn and understand . Valve gave Puzzle Maker an easy @-@ to @-@ learn interface and the ability to share puzzles and lesson plans . The tools were developed with a mathematics teacher and her students . This formed the basis of a new " Steam for Schools " initiative launched in June 2012 , under which educators could acquire Portal 2 and the Puzzle Maker software free of charge for classroom use through its " Teach with Portals " program . As of November 2012 , Valve estimates that over 2 @,@ 500 educators are using the " Teach with Portals " software within their lesson plans .

 <unk> developed a version of Portal 2 to support the Razer Hydra motion controller for PC that allows enhanced control of some game elements . Ten extra single @-@ player levels are available as downloadable content for this version .

A limited edition of the Razer Hydra comes bundled with a copy of Portal 2 for PC . 
 = = = PlayStation 3 = = = 
 The announcement that Portal 2 would be available on PlayStation 3 came as a surprise to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past , citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box . The move toward the PlayStation 3 was a result of growing frustration with Microsoft 's policies for Xbox 360 content , including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players . Newell saw Sony 's publication model as more open , allowing Steam @-@ like features to be used on the console . Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks , including automatic updates , downloadable content , and community support . The game supports cross @-@ platform play between the PlayStation 3 , Windows , and OS X versions . 
 The Steam overlay shows the player 's friends on both Steam and the PlayStation Network , with achievements rewarded for both Steam and PlayStation Network Trophies . Players can unlock the game on Steam for Windows and OS X for no additional charge . The integration of Steamworks on the PlayStation 3 allows Valve to collect data about problems that arise after shipping and push appropriate updates . Valve has stated they do not plan on integrating other PlayStation 3 features , such as 3D television or PlayStation Move support . In June 2012 , Valve announced that the PlayStation 3 version would be patched later that year to include support for the PlayStation Move motion controller , and to add the additional content that was previously provided with the Hydra , under the name Portal 2 In Motion . The patch was released in early November 2012 . A free co @-@ op add @-@ on for the Portal 2 In Motion content was added in June 2013 . Valve said that despite additional support for PlayStation 3 over Xbox 360 , the core game is the same on both platforms .

 As of February 2014 , SteamOS , Valve 's own Linux @-@ based operating system , supports Portal 2 and its predecessor , as do most modern Debian @-@ based Linux distributions on its services via the Steam client .

 Portal 2 was a strong favorite of gaming journalists during closed @-@ door previews at the E3 2010 convention . The Game Critics Awards , selected by journalists and critics , awarded Portal 2 the title of Best PC Game and Best Action / Adventure Game , and nominated the game for Best of Show and Best Console Game . IGN named Portal 2 as its Best of E3 for PC , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 systems and Best Puzzle Game , and nominated it for Best Overall Game . Gamespy named Portal 2 the Best Overall Game and Best Puzzle Game of E3 . Portal 2 won the 2010 Spike Video Game Award for " Most Anticipated Game for 2011 " .

 Portal 2 received universal acclaim from reviewers on its release , and received an average score of 95 out of 100 according to review aggregator Metacritic , and between the different platform versions was ranked as the third- to fifth @-@ highest rated game by the aggregator throughout 2011 . Several reviewers identified Portal 2 as an early contender for " Game of the Year " , while others called it one of the best games of all time . Upon release , the game was widely considered to be as good as or better than the original . Eurogamer 's Oli Welsh said that the game avoids the normal pitfalls that developers introduce in sequels , stating that " Portal is perfect . Portal 2 is not . It 's something better than that . " . Gus Mastrapa of the A.V. Club wrote that with Portal 2 , Valve had alleviated any doubts that " Portal could be expanded into a big , narrative experience with all the bells and whistles of a mainstream gaming hit " . IGN 's Charles Onyett wrote that the sequel " makes the original look like the prototype it was " by expanding the game in gameplay and story . 
 Most reviewers praised the writing and voice acting in the game . Entertainment Weekly 's Dan Stapleton of PC Gamer was able to predict many of the plot twists within Portal 2 's story but " still looked forward to witnessing exactly how the characters would react " ; he praised the development of the characters , as " their charm makes what would otherwise be an empty and lifeless world feel boisterous and alive " . The characters were well received . <unk> wrote that Merchant 's " obvious enthusiasm for the role benefits the game " and that the " consistently clever writing perfectly complements the onscreen action " . Game Informer 's Adam Biessener considered Johnson to be an even better character than GLaDOS , and praised the game 's " pitch @-@ perfect delivery " and " brilliant comedic timing " . In contrast , Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that compared to the loneliness and despair he felt while playing the first game , the characters , Wheatley and GLaDOS , lost some of this feeling and " the inane babble served only to disrupt the mood " . 
 Portal 2 's additional gameplay elements , like light bridges , lasers , and the gels , were praised as appropriate additions to the game . Reviewers were pleased with the difficulty of the puzzles throughout the game , which appeared visually complicated at first but had uncomplicated solutions . Time 's Evan Narcisse said that he feared the addition of new gameplay elements would " dilute the purity of the experience , but everything 's still executed with Valve 's high level of charm and panache . " Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph praised the manner with which these elements were introduced through a " brilliant learning curve of direction , rather than instruction " , and considered it a " design ethos that is supremely generous , but dealt with marvellous economy " . Chris Kohler of Wired wrote that the game 's puzzles " never require excessively complicated solutions " , and that much of the puzzle solving is " filled with moments that will have you slapping your forehead and thinking , ' Oh my God , I 'm such an idiot — why didn 't I see that before ? ' " . Stapleton was not as pleased with the gel additions as with the other new mechanics , calling it " difficult to control " . He felt that they have " only a couple of uses at most " . Bright felt that Portal 2 was easier than its predecessor , in part that he felt much of the game was effectively tutorials for the new gameplay additions , requiring " careful use of the tools provided " , leaving him with the impression that " the game was on rails " . 
 The cooperative puzzle solving aspect was highlighted as a valuable addition to the game . Welsh called the cooperative mode " one of the most satisfying and genuinely collaborative gaming experiences you can have with a friend " . Onyett wrote , " Valve knows how a good co @-@ operative mode requires a game design that doesn 't simply encourage but requires you to work together . In Portal 2 , communication is vital to success " . Several reviewers praised the non @-@ verbal cues that players could initiate to work with their partners . Portal 2 was praised for the amount of detail in its design , sound , and music . Nelson credited the " sheer amount of detail " put into the game 's world , and wrote , " it all feels very real and natural with brief moments where you 're simply sucked into this world " . Onyett was impressed with the amount of visual details and capabilities Valve achieved from their Source game engine and that the added details and animations of the levels " consistently serv [ ed ] not only to entertain the eye but to expand our understanding of the game 's characters " . Hoggins wrote that the game 's world reacted to the player @-@ character Chell 's presence " in a startlingly organic way " , and praised Valve 's design as " an achievement of world @-@ building that compares favourably with BioShock 's underwater city of Rapture " . 
 Some reviewers said that the second act of the game , taking place in the less @-@ structured portion of the old Aperture facilities , may be confusing to some players . Young wrote that in the second act , the game " cranks up the difficulty level at a speed that may dishearten casual gamers " , and said that particularly when traveling between chambers , he had " absolutely no idea where I was supposed to head next " . Kohler wrote that while the player can explore the abandoned areas of Aperture , " none of it ever does anything — it 's just a lot of sterile , duplicated , non @-@ interactive environments " . Watters wrote that the loading time between the game 's levels , in contrast to earlier Valve games , are " long enough to make you take notice and wish they were shorter " . Watters also said that it was unfortunate that the game lacks " stand @-@ alone test chambers and leaderboards ... but even so , Portal 2 is not light on content " without these . Welsh said that the attempt to recapture the spirit of the song " Still Alive " at the end credits of Portal 2 " was a mistake " . Video game critic Ben " Yahtzee " Croshaw named it the best game of 2011 in his review show Zero Punctuation . However he wrote in his Extra Punctuation column that , while Portal 2 was a " very good game " , it unnecessarily retconned portions of the origin game 's story , and did not really further the game 's concept . However , this criticism was directed solely at the campaign , and he stated that he found the game 's co @-@ op to be " much more appealing and much more within the spirit of the original " . 
 On April 20 , 2011 , it was reported that customers had launched a protest against perceived shortcomings of Portal 2 . Users complained that the game was too short — some saying that it is only four hours long , about the existence of paid , downloadable content for some versions at launch , and that the Windows and OS X versions were ports of the console version . Other journalists countered that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port . Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote that the game lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add @-@ ons . Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the early release of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores .

 Based on sales data from Amazon.com , Portal 2 was the best @-@ selling game in the United States in the first week of its release , but was overtaken by Mortal Kombat in its second week . According to NPD Group , Portal 2 was the second @-@ best selling game in the U.S. in April 2011 , at 637 @,@ 000 copies , and the fourth @-@ best selling in May . However , NPD does not include sales on Valve 's Steam platform . Portal 2 was the best selling game in the U.K. in the first week of its release , the first number @-@ one for a Valve game . It retained the top spot during its second week . 
 Portal 2 was released a few days before the PlayStation Network outage . Gamasutra analyst Matt Matthews said that , based on NPD Group data , the outage " did not seriously affect retail sales of software " , but some developers did report drops in sales . <unk> analyst Joe Anderson expected that the effect of the outage on UK sales of Portal 2 would be mild . On June 22 , Newell announced that Portal 2 had sold 3 million copies . As of July 2011 , Electronic Arts stated that more than 2 million copies of Portal 2 have been sold by retailers worldwide . In an August 2011 interview , Newell stated that " Portal 2 did better on the PC than it did on the consoles " . Upon release of the Perpetual Testing Initiative in May 2012 , Newell stated that Portal 2 had shipped more than 4 million units , with the personal computer versions outselling the console versions . Overall , Portal and Portal 2 had together shipped more than 8 million units .

 Route 19 is a state highway in Passaic County , New Jersey , United States . Also referred to as the Paterson Peripheral , it runs 3 @.@ 04 mi ( 4 @.@ 89 km ) from an intersection with County Route 509 ( Broad Street ) and County Route 609 ( Colfax Avenue ) in Clifton north to another intersection with County Route 509 ( Main Street ) in downtown Paterson . Between U.S. Route 46 in Clifton and Interstate 80 in Paterson , Route 19 is a freeway . The main purpose of the route is to connect the Garden State Parkway to I @-@ 80 and downtown Paterson . The road was originally proposed as the Paterson spur of the Garden State Parkway that was to run north to Wayne . In 1959 , it was planned to become part of the Paterson Peripheral , an extension of Route 20 from downtown Paterson . By 1971 , the road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and I @-@ 80 , at which time it received the Route 20 designation ; the rest was cancelled in 1978 due to feared community disruption . In 1988 , this portion of Route 20 became Route 19 as it did not connect with the other segment of the route . In the 1990s , Route 19 was extended to Main Street in downtown Paterson as part of a project that also completed the interchange with I @-@ 80 .

From this intersection , it heads north <unk> with County Route 509 as a four @-@ lane divided highway with a 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) speed limit , soon interchanging with U.S. Route 46 . Past US 46 , the road crosses a brook and County Route 509 ( Broad Street ) splits off , with Route 19 interchanging with the Garden State Parkway . Route 19 continues past the Garden State Parkway as a six @-@ lane 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) freeway surrounded by trees , coming to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with County Route 509 . 
 Past this interchange , the speed limit increases to 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) and the road heads into Paterson . Here , the route has a southbound exit and northbound entrance with County Route 621 ( Valley Road ) before becoming an eight @-@ lane road and interchanging with Interstate 80 , where the speed limit drops to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Past I @-@ 80 , the speed limit lowers to 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) and Route 19 continues north as a five @-@ lane road , with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes , to an interchange with County Route 638 ( Grand Street ) . From here , the route becomes a four @-@ lane divided surface road and heads into urbanized areas of downtown Paterson .

 = = History = = 
 What is now Route 19 was once planned as the Paterson spur of the Garden State Parkway , which was to run through Paterson and <unk> to County Route 504 in Wayne . The planned Paterson spur would become an extension of Route 20 in 1959 . This road , which was to be a six @-@ lane , $ 58 million freeway called the Paterson Peripheral , was to run from Clifton north to the existing Route 20 in downtown Paterson . This road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and Valley Road by 1969 and north to Interstate 80 in 1975 . Upon completion , this road received the Route 20 designation . The extension to Route 20 through Paterson was stopped in 1971 because of the designation of the Great Falls Historic District , a historical district recognizing Paterson ’ s heritage as an industrial center . By the 1990s , this portion of Route 20 was redesignated Route 19 as it did not connect with the mainline of the route . In 1992 , a project to complete the interchange with I @-@ 80 and extend the route to Main Street in downtown Paterson to ease congestion was finished . This interchange received the Prize Bridge Award in the category of Grade Separation from Modern Steel Construction magazine in 1996 .
