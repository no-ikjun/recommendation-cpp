 Michigan teams have spent a total of 22 weeks ranked number 1 with the last time occurring in 2013 . Entering the 2013 – 14 season this ranked 13th and third in the Big Ten behind Indiana ( 54 ) and Ohio State ( 37 ) . Two Michigan teams ( Dec. 14 , 1964 87 – 85 over Wichita State at Detroit and Dec. 13 , 1997 81 – 73 over Duke at home ) have defeated the number one ranked team . 
 The following table summarizes Michigan history in the AP Poll : 
 = Sully Historic Site = 
 Sully Historic Site , more commonly known as Sully Plantation , is listed in the National Register of Historic Places , and is a Virginia landmark in Chantilly , Virginia . Possessed by the Lee family of Virginia from 1725 to 1839 , Richard Bland Lee built the main house in 1794 . 
 Following the purchase by William Swartwort in 1838 , Sully was used as a home , a working farm , or both by a series of private owners . Then in 1958 , Sully was acquired by the federal government as a part of the area to be used for the construction of Dulles Airport . One year later , Sully became a national historic site . Today the Fairfax County Park Authority operates the site with a specific focus on the Lee family .

 = = = Pre @-@ Lee period = = = 
 The land that would become part of Sully was likely controlled by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area . English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg tribe in modern @-@ day Northern Virginia . The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July of 1675 that became a part of Bacon 's Rebellion . English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664 . When diplomatic attempts failed , the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June of 1666 . The specifics of that military action are unclear , but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed , suggesting the English gained control of the area . The English presumptively took control after a violent conflict with the Doeg in 1666 . Little is recorded about the disposition of this land from the time when the English gained control of it until the land is patented by the Lee family of Virginia . 
 = = = Lee period = = = 
 Originally acquired in 1725 by Richard Bland Lee 's grandfather , Henry Lee I , Sully was inherited by Richard 's father Henry Lee II of " <unk> " . At his death in 1787 , the land was divided between Richard and his younger brother Theodorick Lee . Being the older of the two , Richard was given the more alluvial northern half , having resided there as manager of the property since approximately 1781 . During this period the predominant crop grown was tobacco . 
 = = = = Richard Bland Lee = = = = 
 Richard severely curtailed tobacco production in favor of more sustainable crops , including wheat , corn , rye , and barley . This reduced the soil depletion inherent to tobacco production , and allowed for the practice of crop rotation . He also planted fruit orchards , including peach and apple trees , which he used to produce spirits . In 1801 Richard constructed a dairy , which ran primarily under the supervision of his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee . 
 After his election to the United States Congress in 1789 , and for most of the next five years , Richard turned day @-@ to @-@ day management of his estate over to his brother Theodorick , who supervised spring planting and fall harvest . Theodorick also managed the collection of rent from tenant farmers and the construction of the large house Richard had planned for the estate , on which construction had begun in 1794 . Before he left for Congress in 1789 , Richard had chosen the name " Sully " for his estate . 
 By 1811 , having been drawn into heavy debt trying to aid his brothers , Henry Lee III and Charles Lee , extricate themselves from severe financial difficulties , Richard Bland Lee decided he could no longer sustain ownership of Sully . Accordingly , he decided to sell the plantation to raise cash to pay some of the debt . He sold Sully for $ 18 @,@ 000 to his second cousin , Francis Lightfoot Lee II , son of Richard Henry Lee . 
 = = = = Francis Lightfoot Lee II = = = = 
 For several years after his purchase of Sully , Francis Lightfoot Lee II ( called F. L. by his family ) was able to realize an annual profit of $ 1 @,@ 500 to $ 2 @,@ 500 . At least part of that success was due to the " judicious system of husbandry " employed by F. L. ' s wife Jane Fitzgerald Lee . Then in 1816 , due to complications during the delivery of their fifth child Frances Ann Lee , Jane Fitzgerald Lee died . Four years later in 1820 , F. L. had either a nervous breakdown or stroke . Unable to care for himself , he was committed to the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia in 1825 . 
 Following the breakdown , Sully was placed under the administrative care of F. L. ' s nephew Richard Henry Lee II . Richard Henry Lee II 's management was marked by negligence and apparent apathy towards the dishonesty of managers who were embezzling money from the estate : 
 " … mismanagement , having allowed an estate clear of debt , well stocked , well arranged under a good system as it had been for years ' according to ' the universal belief and opinion of all friends , connections and neighbors ' to be ' wasted and the debts lost . ' ... Colonel <unk> Butler replaced Richard Henry Lee as the ' Committee ' for the Estate on January 1 , 1827 , but Butler also proved unsatisfactory . On June 23 , 1830 the county court ordered his removal and , ' for the safekeeping and good management ' of the estate ... " 
 Control of Sully was next placed in the hands of Colonel George Washington Hunter in 1830 . Gamble claims , " in no hands ... would Sully fare as well as when it had been assiduously maintained by a single , devoted , industrious proprietor . " 
 After their father 's move to the Pennsylvania Hospital during the summer of 1825 , F. L. ' s children ( with the exception of Samuel Philips Lee who had entered the Navy ) , were under the care of William Brent , Jr. and Winifred Brent . The <unk> were relatives who had moved to Sully to care for the Lee children and to start at Sully , a " select seminary " for boys and girls . 
 During subsequent years , as the Lee children grew older they began to leave Sully . Samuel <unk> Lee had entered the Navy , and John Lee went to West Point . Arthur Lee moved west to the Ohio country , while his oldest daughter Jane Elizabeth Lee married Henry Tazewell Harrison in a sunrise ceremony at Sully on February 6 , 1834 . With his brothers @-@ in @-@ law absent from the estate , Harrison took over representing their interests with the appointed administrator , Colonel Hunter , whom he replaced on July 18 , 1836 . Finally , in 1838 , after a bizarre period , in which the estate had ostensibly been sold to a buyer who was arrested in England prior to completing the purchase , Sully was sold to merchant William Swartwort . 
 = = = Post @-@ Lee period = = = 
 Following the purchase by William Swartwort in 1838 , Sully was used as a home , a working farm , or both by a series of private owners . Then in 1958 , the land including the main house was acquired by the Federal Government to make way for construction of Dulles Airport . A campaign to save the site began almost immediately afterwards . Those involved included previous owners of the property , Lee descendants , and a neighbor , Eddie Wagstaff , who later endowed the Sully Foundation that still provides support for the site . This campaign ended in 1959 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation making Sully a national historic site . 
 The Fairfax County Park Authority agreed to operate the site as a county historical park , and has since acquired an additional 60 acres ( 240 @,@ 000 m2 ; 2 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 sq ft ; 24 ha ) to bring the total size of Sully Historic Site to approximately 120 acres ( 490 @,@ 000 m2 ; 5 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 sq ft ; 49 ha ) . The site 's historic period of significance encompasses the ownership of Richard Bland Lee and Francis <unk> Lee ( 1787 – 1838 ) . Interpretation at the site reflects the ownership of its founder Richard Bland Lee , which explains the park authority decision to have Sully " completely furnished with antiquities from the Federal period . "

 = Endometrial cancer = 
 Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium ( the lining of the uterus or womb ) . It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body . The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period . Other symptoms include pain with urination or sexual intercourse , or pelvic pain . Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause . 
 Approximately 40 % of cases are related to obesity . Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive estrogen exposure , high blood pressure and diabetes . Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer , taking both estrogen and progesterone in combination , as in most birth control pills , decreases the risk . Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents . Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as " uterine cancer " , although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as cervical cancer , uterine sarcoma , and <unk> disease . The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma , which accounts for more than 80 % of cases . Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by endometrial biopsy or by taking samples during a procedure known as dilation and curettage . A pap smear is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer . Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for . 
 The leading treatment option for endometrial cancer is abdominal hysterectomy ( the total removal by surgery of the uterus ) , together with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries on both sides , called a bilateral salpingo @-@ oophorectomy . In more advanced cases , radiation therapy , chemotherapy or hormone therapy may also be recommended . If the disease is diagnosed at an early stage , the outcome is favorable , and the overall five @-@ year survival rate in the United States is greater than 80 % . 
 In 2012 , endometrial cancers occurred in 320 @,@ 000 women and caused 76 @,@ 000 deaths . This makes it the third most common cause of death in cancers which only affect women , behind ovarian and cervical cancer . It is more common in the developed world and is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract in developed countries . Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010 . This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity . 
 = = Classification = = 
 There are several types of endometrial cancer , including the most common endometrial carcinomas , which are divided into Type I and Type II subtypes . There are also rarer types including uterine papillary serous carcinoma , adenosquamous carcinoma , <unk> and uterine clear @-@ cell carcinoma . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Vaginal bleeding or spotting in women after menopause occurs in 90 % of endometrial cancer . Bleeding is especially common with adenocarcinoma , occurring in two @-@ thirds of all cases . Abnormal menstrual cycles or extremely long , heavy , or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before menopause may also be a sign of endometrial cancer . 
 Symptoms other than bleeding are not common . Other symptoms include thin white or clear vaginal discharge in postmenopausal women . More advanced disease shows more obvious symptoms or signs that can be detected on a physical examination . The uterus may become enlarged or the cancer may spread , causing lower abdominal pain or pelvic cramping . Painful sexual intercourse or painful or difficult urination are less common signs of endometrial cancer . The uterus may also fill with pus ( <unk> ) . Of women with these less common symptoms ( vaginal discharge , pelvic pain , and pus ) , 10 – 15 % have cancer . 
 = = Risk factors = = 
 Risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity , diabetes mellitus , breast cancer , use of tamoxifen , never having had a child , late menopause , high levels of estrogen , and increasing age . Immigration studies ( migration studies ) , which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer , show that there is some environmental component to endometrial cancer . These environmental risk factors are not well characterized . 
 = = = Hormones = = = 
 Most of the risk factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens . An estimated 40 % of cases are thought to be related to obesity . In obesity , the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into <unk> , an estrogen . Higher levels of <unk> in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens . Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood . Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , which also causes irregular or no ovulation , is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity . Specifically , obesity , type II diabetes , and insulin resistance are risk factors for Type I endometrial cancer . Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300 – 400 % . 
 Estrogen replacement therapy during menopause when not balanced ( or " opposed " ) with progestin is another risk factor . Higher doses or longer periods of estrogen therapy have higher risks of endometrial cancer . Women of lower weight are at greater risk from unopposed estrogen . A longer period of fertility — either from an early first menstrual period or late menopause — is also a risk factor . Unopposed estrogen raises an individual 's risk of endometrial cancer by 2 – 10 fold , depending on weight and length of therapy . In trans men who take testosterone and have not had a hysterectomy , the conversion of testosterone into estrogen via androstenedione may lead to a higher risk of endometrial cancer . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Genetic disorders can also cause endometrial cancer . Overall , genetic causes contribute to 2 – 10 % of endometrial cancer cases . Lynch syndrome , an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer , also causes endometrial cancer , especially before menopause . Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40 – 60 % risk of developing endometrial cancer , higher than their risk of developing colorectal ( bowel ) or ovarian cancer . Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20 % of people . Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer , on average , 11 years before . <unk> in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and / or <unk> : genes that participate in the process of mismatch repair , which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA . Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2 , <unk> , and PMS2 , which are also mismatch repair genes . Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2 – 3 % of endometrial cancer cases ; some sources place this as high as 5 % . Depending on the gene mutation , women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer . With MLH1 mutations , the risk is 54 % ; with MSH2 , 21 % ; and with <unk> , 16 % . 
 Women with a family history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk . Two genes most commonly associated with some other women 's cancers , BRCA1 and BRCA2 , do not cause endometrial cancer . There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen , a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer , in breast and ovarian cancers . The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer . Women with this disorder have a 5 – 10 % lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer , compared to the 2 – 3 % risk for unaffected women . 
 = = = Other health problems = = = 
 Some therapies for other forms of cancer increase the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer , which is a baseline 2 – 3 % . <unk> , a drug used to treat estrogen @-@ positive breast cancers , has been associated with endometrial cancer in approximately 0 @.@ 1 % of users , particularly older women , but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer . A one to two @-@ year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer , and a five @-@ year course of therapy <unk> that risk . <unk> , a similar drug , did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer . Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for endometrial cancer , as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis . Specifically , ovarian granulosa cell tumors and <unk> are tumors associated with endometrial cancer . 
 Low immune function has also been implicated in endometrial cancer . High blood pressure is also a risk factor , but this may be because of its association with obesity . Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer . The risk is not negated by regular exercise , though it is lowered . 
 = = = Protective factors = = = 
 Smoking and the use of progestin are both protective against endometrial cancer . Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause . This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped . Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device ( IUD ) . Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken : by 56 % after four years , 67 % after eight years , and 72 % after twelve years . This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped . Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected . Having had more than five infants ( grand <unk> ) is also a protective factor , and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35 % . Breastfeeding for more than 18 months reduces risk by 23 % . Increased physical activity reduces an individual 's risk by 38 – 46 % . There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Endometrial cancer forms when there are errors in normal endometrial cell growth . Usually , when cells grow old or get damaged , they die , and new cells take their place . Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded , and old or damaged cells do not die as they should . The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor . These abnormal cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively . 
 In 10 – 20 % of endometrial cancers , mostly Grade 3 ( the highest histologic grade ) , mutations are found in a tumor suppressor gene , commonly p53 or PTEN . In 20 % of endometrial hyperplasias and 50 % of endometrioid cancers , PTEN suffers a loss @-@ of @-@ function mutation or a null mutation , making it less effective or completely ineffective . Loss of PTEN function leads to up @-@ regulation of the <unk> / Akt / mTOR pathway , which causes cell growth . The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer . When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed , the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive . <unk> mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas , which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas . Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma . 
 PTEN and p27 loss of function mutations are associated with a good prognosis , particularly in obese women . The Her2 / neu oncogene , which indicates a poor prognosis , is expressed in 20 % of endometrioid and serous carcinomas . CTNNB1 ( beta @-@ catenin ; a transcription gene ) mutations are found in 14 – 44 % of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis , but the data is unclear . Beta @-@ catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with squamous cells . <unk> mutations are found in approximately 10 % of endometrial cancers , and their prognostic significance is unclear . <unk> is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer : 9 % of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8 % of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene . 
 Type I and Type II cancers ( explained below ) tend to have different mutations involved . <unk> , which often carries a point mutation in Type I endometrial cancer , is also mutated in 26 % of clear cell carcinomas of the endometrium , and 18 % of serous carcinomas . Epigenetic silencing and point mutations of several genes are commonly found in Type I endometrial cancer . Mutations in tumor suppressor genes are common in Type II endometrial cancer . PIK3CA is commonly mutated in both Type I and Type II cancers . In women with Lynch syndrome @-@ associated endometrial cancer , microsatellite instability is common . 
 Development of an endometrial hyperplasia ( overgrowth of endometrial cells ) is a significant risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma , though cancer can develop without the presence of a hyperplasia . Within ten years , 8 – 30 % of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer , whereas 1 – 3 % of non @-@ atypical hyperplasias do so . An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei . Pre @-@ cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia . Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer . Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40 . Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53 , and develops into a serous carcinoma . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Diagnosis of endometrial cancer is made first by a physical examination and dilation and curettage ( removal of endometrial tissue ; D & C ) . This tissue is then examined histologically for characteristics of cancer . If cancer is found , medical imaging may be done to see whether the cancer has spread or invaded tissue . 
 = = = Examination = = = 
 Routine screening of asymptomatic people is not indicated , since the disease is highly curable in its early , symptomatic stages . Instead , women , particularly menopausal women , should be aware of the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer . A cervical screening test , such as a Pap smear , is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50 % of the time . A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix . Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal , especially in the early stages of disease . Changes in the size , shape or consistency of the uterus and / or its surrounding , supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced . Cervical stenosis , the narrowing of the cervical opening , is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus ( <unk> or <unk> ) . 
 Women with Lynch syndrome should begin to have annual biopsy screening at the age of 35 . Some women with Lynch syndrome elect to have a prophylactic hysterectomy and salpingo @-@ oophorectomy to greatly reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer . 
 <unk> ultrasound to examine the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used to aid in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States . In the United Kingdom , both an endometrial biopsy and a <unk> ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer . The homogeneity of the tissue visible on <unk> ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous . Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer , so another screening method ( for example endometrial biopsy ) must be used in conjunction . Other imaging studies are of limited use . CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high @-@ risk subtype ( at high risk of metastasis ) . They can also be used to investigate <unk> disease . An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma . MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes . 
 Dilation and curettage or an endometrial biopsy are used to obtain a tissue sample for histological examination . Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option , but it may not give conclusive results every time . <unk> only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium , which is often not indicative of cancer , and is therefore not used , unless in conjunction with a biopsy . <unk> can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer . New evidence shows that D & C has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy . 
 Before treatment is begun , several other investigations are recommended . These include a chest x @-@ ray , liver function tests , kidney function tests , and a test for levels of CA @-@ 125 , a tumor marker that can be elevated in endometrial cancer . 
 = = = Types = = = 
 Endometrial cancer includes carcinomas , which are divided into Type I and Type II cancers and includes endometrioid adenocarcinoma , uterine papillary serous carcinoma , uterine clear @-@ cell carcinoma , and several other very rare forms . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 The vast majority of endometrial cancers are carcinomas ( usually adenocarcinomas ) , meaning that they originate from the single layer of epithelial cells that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands . There are many microscopic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma , but they are broadly organized into two categories , Type I and Type II , based on clinical features and pathogenesis . The two subtypes are genetically distinct . 
 Type I endometrial carcinomas occur most commonly before and around the time of menopause . In the United States they are more common in whites , particularly those with a history of endometrial hyperplasia . Type I endometrial cancers are often low @-@ grade , minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall ( myometrium ) , estrogen @-@ dependent , and have a good outcome with treatment . Type I carcinomas represent 75 – 90 % of endometrial cancer . 
 Type II endometrial carcinomas usually occur in older , post @-@ menopausal people , in the United States are more common in black women , and are not associated with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia . Type II endometrial cancers are often high @-@ grade , with deep invasion into the underlying uterine wall ( myometrium ) , are of the serous or clear cell type , and carry a poorer prognosis . They can appear to be epithelial ovarian cancer on evaluation of symptoms . They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive , with a greater risk of relapse and / or metastasis . 
 = = = = = <unk> adenocarcinoma = = = = = 
 In endometrioid adenocarcinoma , the cancer cells grow in patterns reminiscent of normal endometrium , with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei . Low @-@ grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells , have not invaded the myometrium , and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia . The tumor 's glands form very close together , without the stromal tissue that normally separates them . Higher @-@ grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well @-@ differentiated cells , have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands , and are associated with an atrophied endometrium . There are several subtypes of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar prognoses , including <unk> , secretory , and ciliated cell variants . There is also a subtype characterized by squamous differentiation . Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma . 
 The genetic mutations most commonly associated with endometrioid adenocarcinoma are in the genes PTEN , a tumor suppressor ; PIK3CA , a kinase ; KRAS , a GTPase that functions in signal transduction ; and CTNNB1 , involved in adhesion and cell signaling . The CTNNB1 ( beta @-@ catenin ) gene is most commonly mutated in the squamous subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma . 
 = = = = = Serous carcinoma = = = = = 
 Serous carcinoma is a Type II endometrial tumor that makes up 5 – 10 % of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women . Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum ( seen as <unk> caking ) or the lymphatic system . Histologically , it appears with many atypical nuclei , papillary structures , and , in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas , rounded cells instead of columnar cells . Roughly 30 % of endometrial serous carcinomas also have <unk> bodies . Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers ; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium . 
 The genetic mutations seen in serous carcinoma are chromosomal instability and mutations in TP53 , an important tumor suppressor gene . 
 = = = = = Clear cell carcinoma = = = = = 
 Clear cell carcinoma is a Type II endometrial tumor that makes up less than 5 % of diagnosed endometrial cancer . Like serous cell carcinoma , it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis . Histologically , it is characterized by the features common to all clear cells : the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H & E stained and visible , distinct cell membranes . The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma . This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women . 
 = = = = = Mucinous carcinoma = = = = = 
 Mucinous carcinomas are a rare form of endometrial cancer , making up less than 1 – 2 % of all diagnosed endometrial cancer . Mucinous endometrial carcinomas are most often stage I and grade I , giving them a good prognosis . They typically have well @-@ differentiated columnar cells organized into glands with the characteristic mucin in the cytoplasm . Mucinous carcinomas must be differentiated from cervical adenocarcinoma . 
 = = = = = Mixed or undifferentiated carcinoma = = = = = 
 Mixed carcinomas are those that have both Type I and Type II cells , with one making up at least 10 % of the tumor . These include the malignant mixed Müllerian tumor , which derives from endometrial epithelium and has a poor prognosis . 
 <unk> endometrial carcinomas make up less than 1 – 2 % of diagnosed endometrial cancers . They have a worse prognosis than grade III tumors . Histologically , these tumors show sheets of identical epithelial cells with no identifiable pattern . 
 = = = = = Other carcinomas = = = = = 
 Non @-@ metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma are very rare in the endometrium . <unk> cell carcinoma of the endometrium has a poor prognosis . It has been reported fewer than 100 times in the medical literature since its characterization in 1892 . For primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium ( <unk> ) to be diagnosed , there must be no other primary cancer in the endometrium or cervix and it must not be connected to the cervical epithelium . Because of the rarity of this cancer , there are no guidelines for how it should be treated , nor any typical treatment . The common genetic causes remain uncharacterized . Primary transitional cell carcinomas of the endometrium are even more rare ; 16 cases had been reported as of 2008 . Its pathophysiology and treatments have not been characterized . Histologically , <unk> resembles endometrioid carcinoma and is distinct from other transitional cell carcinomas . 
 = = = = Sarcoma = = = = 
 In contrast to endometrial carcinomas , the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that originate in the non @-@ glandular connective tissue of the endometrium . They are generally non @-@ aggressive and , if they recur , can take decades . <unk> to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent . They typically have estrogen and / or progesterone receptors . The prognosis for low @-@ grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good , with 60 – 90 % five @-@ year survival . High @-@ grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma ( <unk> ) has a worse prognosis , with high rates of recurrence and 25 % five @-@ year survival . <unk> prognosis is dictated by whether or not the cancer has invaded the arteries and veins . Without vascular invasion , the five @-@ year survival is 83 % ; it drops to 17 % when vascular invasion is observed . Stage I ESS has the best prognosis , with five @-@ year survival of 98 % and ten @-@ year survival of 89 % . ESS makes up 0 @.@ 2 % of uterine cancers . 
 = = = Metastasis = = = 
 Endometrial cancer frequently metastasizes to the ovaries and Fallopian tubes when the cancer is located in the upper part of the uterus , and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus . The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa , then into other reproductive and pelvic structures . When the lymphatic system is involved , the pelvic and para @-@ aortic nodes are usually first to become involved , but in no specific pattern , unlike cervical cancer . More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs , as well as the liver , brain , and bone . Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20 – 25 % of the time , more than any other gynecologic cancer . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 There is a three @-@ tiered system for histologically classifying endometrial cancers , ranging from cancers with well @-@ differentiated cells ( grade I ) , to very poorly @-@ differentiated cells ( grade III ) . Grade I cancers are the least aggressive and have the best prognosis , while grade III tumors are the most aggressive and likely to recur . Grade II cancers are intermediate between grades I and III in terms of cell differentiation and aggressiveness of disease . 
 The histopathology of endometrial cancers is highly diverse . The most common finding is a well @-@ differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma , which is composed of numerous , small , crowded glands with varying degrees of nuclear <unk> , mitotic activity , and stratification . This often appears on a background of endometrial hyperplasia . Frank adenocarcinoma may be distinguished from atypical hyperplasia by the finding of clear stromal invasion , or " back @-@ to @-@ back " glands which represent nondestructive replacement of the endometrial stroma by the cancer . With progression of the disease , the myometrium is infiltrated . 
 = = = Staging = = = 
 Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged using the FIGO cancer staging system . The 2009 FIGO staging system is as follows : 
 <unk> invasion and involvement of the pelvic and para @-@ aortic lymph nodes are the most commonly seen patterns of spread . A Stage 0 is sometimes included , in this case it is referred to as " carcinoma in situ " . In 26 % of presumably early @-@ stage cancers , <unk> staging revealed pelvic and distant metastases , making comprehensive surgical staging necessary . 
 = = Management = = 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 The primary treatment for endometrial cancer is surgery ; 90 % of women with endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery . Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo @-@ oophorectomy , which is the removal of the uterus , and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes . <unk> , or removal of pelvic and para @-@ aortic lymph nodes , is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above . <unk> is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States , but in the United Kingdom , the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater . The topic of <unk> and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated . In stage III and IV cancers , <unk> surgery is the norm , and a biopsy of the <unk> may also be included . In stage IV disease , where there are distant metastases , surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy . <unk> , an open @-@ abdomen procedure , is the traditional surgical procedure ; however , laparoscopy ( keyhole surgery ) is associated with lower operative morbidity . The two procedures have no difference in overall survival . Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer . Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery . 
 The few contraindications to surgery include inoperable tumor , massive obesity , a particularly high @-@ risk operation , or a desire to preserve fertility . These contraindications happen in about 5 – 10 % of cases . Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low @-@ grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins , with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy . This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done . Uterine perforation may occur during a D & C or an endometrial biopsy . Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction , temporary incontinence , and lymphedema , along with more common side effects of any surgery , including constipation . 
 = = = Add @-@ on therapy = = = 
 There are a number of possible additional therapies . Surgery can be followed by radiation therapy and / or chemotherapy in cases of high @-@ risk or high @-@ grade cancers . This is called adjuvant therapy . 
 = = = = Chemotherapy = = = = 
 Adjuvant chemotherapy is a recent innovation , consisting of some combination of paclitaxel ( or other <unk> like docetaxel ) , doxorubicin ( and other anthracyclines ) , and platins ( particularly cisplatin and carboplatin ) . Adjuvant chemotherapy has been found to increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy . Mutations in mismatch repair genes , like those found in Lynch syndrome , can lead to resistance against platins , meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations . Side effects of chemotherapy are common . These include hair loss , low neutrophil levels in the blood , and gastrointestinal problems . 
 In cases where surgery is not indicated , palliative chemotherapy is an option ; higher @-@ dose chemotherapy is associated with longer survival . Palliative chemotherapy , particularly using <unk> and gemcitabine , is also often used to treat recurrent endometrial cancer . 
 = = = = Radiotherapy = = = = 
 Adjuvant radiotherapy is commonly used in early @-@ stage ( stage I or II ) endometrial cancer . It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy ( VBT ) , which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity , or external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) . Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected ; in the case of endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina . External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body . VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina , whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery . However , the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial . Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis , overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved . VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT . 
 Radiotherapy can also be used before surgery in certain cases . When pre @-@ operative imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix , radiation can be given before a total hysterectomy is performed . Brachytherapy and EBRT can also be used , singly or in combination , when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy . Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects , particularly in the gastrointestinal tract . 
 = = = = Hormonal therapy = = = = 
 Hormonal therapy is only beneficial in certain types of endometrial cancer . It was once thought to be beneficial in most cases . If a tumor is well @-@ differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors , progestins may be used in treatment . About 25 % of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins . Also , endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents , including tamoxifen , 17 @-@ hydroxyprogesterone <unk> , <unk> , <unk> acetate , and <unk> . This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and / or progestin receptors . Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells . Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease . 
 = = = Monitoring = = = 
 The tumor marker CA @-@ 125 is frequently elevated in endometrial cancer and can be used to monitor response to treatment , particularly in serous cell cancer or advanced disease . Periodic MRIs or CT scans may be recommended in advanced disease and women with a history of endometrial cancer should receive more frequent pelvic examinations for the five years following treatment . Examinations conducted every three to four months are recommended for the first two years following treatment , and every six months for the next three years . 
 Women with endometrial cancer should not have routine surveillance imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising . Imaging without these indications is discouraged because it is unlikely to detect a recurrence or improve survival , and because it has its own costs and side effects . If a recurrence is suspected , PET / CT scanning is recommended . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 = = = Survival rates = = = 
 The five @-@ year survival rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80 % . Most women , over 70 % , have FIGO stage I cancer , which has the best prognosis . Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis , but these are relatively rare , occurring in only 13 % of cases . The median survival time for stage III @-@ IV endometrial cancer is nine to ten months . Older age indicates a worse prognosis . In the United States , white women have a higher survival rate than black women , who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease by the time of their diagnosis . Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression ; 93 % of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to three years , compared with 36 % of women with low progesterone receptor disease . Heart disease is the most common cause of death among those who survive endometrial cancer , with other obesity @-@ related health problems also being common . 
 = = = Recurrence rates = = = 
 Recurrence of early stage endometrial cancer ranges from 3 to 17 % , depending on primary and adjuvant treatment . Most recurrences ( 75 – 80 % ) occur outside of the pelvis , and most occur two to three years after treatment , 64 % after two years and 87 % after three years . 
 Higher @-@ staged cancers are more likely to recur , as are those that have invaded the myometrium or cervix , or that have metastasized into the lymphatic system . <unk> serous carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma , and endometrioid carcinoma are the subtypes at the highest risk of recurrence . High @-@ grade histological subtypes are also at elevated risk for recurrence . 
 The most common site of recurrence is in the vagina ; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis . If relapse occurs from a cancer that has not been treated with radiation , EBRT is the first @-@ line treatment and is often successful . If a cancer treated with radiation recurs , pelvic <unk> is the only option for curative treatment . Palliative chemotherapy , <unk> surgery , and radiation are also performed . Radiation therapy ( VBT and EBRT ) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50 % five @-@ year survival rate . Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation , and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and , if possible , chemotherapy . Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes , para @-@ aortic lymph nodes , peritoneum ( 28 % of recurrences ) , and lungs , though recurrences can also occur in the brain ( < 1 % ) , liver ( 7 % ) , adrenal glands ( 1 % ) , bones ( 4 – 7 % ; typically the axial skeleton ) , lymph nodes outside the abdomen ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 % ) , spleen , and muscle / soft tissue ( 2 – 6 % ) . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 As of 2014 , approximately 320 @,@ 000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer worldwide each year and 76 @,@ 000 die , making it the sixth most common cancer in women . It is more common in developed countries , where the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer in people born with uteri is 1 @.@ 6 % , compared to 0 @.@ 6 % in developing countries . It occurs in 12 @.@ 9 out of 100 @,@ 000 women annually in developed countries . 
 In the United States , endometrial cancer is the most frequently diagnosed gynecologic cancer and , in women , the fourth most common cancer overall , representing 6 % of all cancer cases in women . In that country , as of 2014 it was estimated that 52 @,@ 630 women were diagnosed yearly and 8 @,@ 590 would die from the disease . Northern Europe , Eastern Europe , and North America have the highest rates of endometrial cancer , whereas Africa and West Asia have the lowest rates . Asia saw 41 % of the world 's endometrial cancer diagnoses in 2012 , whereas Northern Europe , Eastern Europe , and North America together comprised 48 % of diagnoses . Unlike most cancers , the number of new cases has risen in recent years , including an increase of over 40 % in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2013 . Some of this rise may be due to the increase in obesity rates in developed countries , increasing life expectancies , and lower birth rates . The average lifetime risk for endometrial cancer is approximately 2 – 3 % in people with uteruses . In the UK , approximately 7 @,@ 400 cases are diagnosed annually , and in the EU , approximately 88 @,@ 000 . 
 Endometrial cancer appears most frequently during perimenopause ( the period just before , just after , and during menopause ) , between the ages of 50 and 65 ; overall , 75 % of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause . Women younger than 40 make up 5 % of endometrial cancer cases and 10 – 15 % of cases occur in women under 50 years of age . This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time . The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63 years of age ; in the United States , the average age of diagnosis is 60 years of age . White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women , with a 2 @.@ 88 % and 1 @.@ 69 % lifetime risk respectively . Japanese @-@ American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates . 
 = = Research = = 
 There are several experimental therapies for endometrial cancer under research , including immunologic , hormonal , and chemotherapeutic treatments . <unk> ( Herceptin ) , an antibody against the Her2 protein , has been used in cancers known to be positive for the Her2 / neu oncogene , but research is still underway . <unk> therapies are also under investigation , particularly in uterine papillary serous carcinoma . 
 Cancers can be analyzed using genetic techniques ( including DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry ) to determine if certain therapies specific to mutated genes can be used to treat it . PARP inhibitors are used to treat endometrial cancer with PTEN mutations , specifically , mutations that lower the expression of PTEN . The PARP inhibitor shown to be active against endometrial cancer is <unk> . Research is ongoing in this area as of the 2010s . 
 Research is ongoing on the use of metformin , a diabetes medication , in obese women with endometrial cancer before surgery . Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation . Preliminary research has shown that preoperative metformin administration can reduce expression of tumor markers . Long @-@ term use of metformin has not been shown to have a preventative effect against developing cancer , but may improve overall survival . 
 <unk> , an mTOR inhibitor , is under investigation as a potential treatment . Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN . <unk> ( <unk> ) is also being researched as a treatment for people who have previously had chemotherapy . Preliminary research has been promising , and a stage II trial for <unk> was completed by 2013 . There has also been research on combined <unk> / progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer . <unk> and tyrosine kinase inhibitors , which inhibit angiogenesis , are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor . <unk> is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer . Treatments for rare high @-@ grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched , as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease . <unk> being researched include doxorubicin and <unk> . 
 There is also research in progress on more genes and biomarkers that may be linked to endometrial cancer . The protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and the IUD is being investigated . Preliminary research has shown that the levonorgestrel IUD placed for a year , combined with 6 monthly injections of gonadotropin @-@ releasing hormone , can stop or reverse the progress of endometrial cancer in young women . An experimental drug that combines a hormone with doxorubicin is also under investigation for greater efficacy in cancers with hormone receptors . Hormone therapy that is effective in treating breast cancer , including use of <unk> inhibitors , is also being investigated for use in endometrial cancer . One such drug is anastrozole , which is currently being researched in hormone @-@ positive recurrences after chemotherapy . Research into hormonal treatments for endometrial stromal sarcomas is ongoing as well . It includes trials of drugs like mifepristone , a progestin antagonist , and <unk> and <unk> , two <unk> inhibitors . 
 Research continues into the best imaging method for detecting and staging endometrial cancer . In surgery , research has shown that complete pelvic <unk> along with hysterectomy in stage 1 endometrial cancer does not improve survival and increases the risk of negative side effects , including lymphedema . Other research is exploring the potential of identifying the sentinel lymph nodes for biopsy by injecting the tumor with dye that shines under infrared light . Intensity modulated radiation therapy is currently under investigation , and already used in some centers , for application in endometrial cancer , to reduce side effects from traditional radiotherapy . Its risk of recurrence has not yet been quantified . Research on hyperbaric oxygen therapy to reduce side effects is also ongoing . The results of the <unk> 3 trial assessing combining adjuvant radiotherapy with chemotherapy were awaited in late 2014 .

 Endometrial cancer is not widely known by the general populace , despite its frequency . There is low awareness of the symptoms , which can lead to later diagnosis and worse survival . 
 = Crazy Taxi ( series ) = 
 Crazy Taxi is a series of score attack racing video games that was developed by Hitmaker and published by Sega . The first game appeared in arcades in 1999 and was very successful , prompting Sega to port the arcade version to their Dreamcast console in 2000 . It is the third best @-@ selling Dreamcast game in the United States , selling over a million copies . The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2 , Nintendo GameCube , and PC with sequels also appearing on the Xbox , Game Boy Advance , and PlayStation Portable systems . 
 Each game has the player assume the role of a taxi driver who must accumulate money by delivering passengers to their destinations in the fastest time possible , earning tips by performing " crazy stunts " before the time runs out . The franchise has been recognized for its innovative gameplay design which is easy to learn but difficult to master , its use of in @-@ game advertising , and its soundtrack music provided by the bands The Offspring and Bad Religion . The core gameplay mechanic has been patented by Sega , leading to at least one lawsuit over similar gameplay in The Simpsons : Road Rage , which has since been settled out of court . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack games that all employ the same fundamental rules and mechanics . The player controls one of several taxi drivers in a fictional city , looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible . The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock . Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination . The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips , to yellow for intermediate distances , and to green indicating long ones . When a passenger is picked up , the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time . Furthermore , a second countdown timer is started , representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination . While a passenger is in the taxi , a large green arrow is shown on the player 's HUD that points in the general direction of the passenger 's destination to help guide the player through the map . 
 The player can use special " crazy stunt " moves such as drifts , jumps , and near @-@ misses , and consecutive combos of these , to earn extra money from the passenger during the trip . If the destination is reached in time , the player is paid based on distance driven with a possible time bonus based on how quickly the destination was reached . If the passenger 's countdown drops to zero , they will exit the taxi and the player will be required to look for another fare . The game continues in this mode as long as time remains on the clock . Once the clock reaches zero , the game is over , and the player is ranked and rated based on the total earned . 
 Unlike other arcade games , the player cannot continue from where the previous game ended . The game cannot be played indefinitely ; while there are hundreds of potential passengers to pick up and deliver , there are only a limited number of fares in the game . The various passengers scattered throughout the city will randomly appear and disappear throughout the game , but once one is picked up that passenger is unavailable for the rest of that game . The core gameplay in the series has been praised as being " deceptively complex " ; as stated by the IGN staff for their review of the Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi : 
 As you progress through the game 's ratings scale by picking up and delivering passengers as quickly as possible , you will slowly but surely realize that there is much more to the game than getting from point a to b . 
 Starting with Crazy Taxi 2 , the gameplay included the ability to pick up a party of passengers , each having a different destination . The number of passengers in the car multiplies the tip bonuses earned from stunt driving , while the total fare can only be earned once the last passenger is dropped off in time . Additionally , Crazy Taxi 2 introduced a new stunt move called the " Crazy Hop " that allowed the player to make the taxi jump to clear some obstacles or reach higher drivable surfaces . 
 The console games have also featured a set of mini @-@ games that require the player to meet a certain objective using one or more of the various " crazy stunts " within the game . Some of these test the player 's handling of a taxi , while others are more exaggerated , such as taxi bowling or pool . Some mini @-@ games require the completion of others before they can be accessed . 
 Prior to each game session , the player can pick one of several drivers and their associated cars ; each car / driver has slightly different performance relating to factors such as speed and turning , that impact the game . 
 = = Development = = 
 The original arcade game was developed by Hitmaker as a variation from then @-@ current arcade titles . Crazy Taxi producer Kenji Kanno noted that the time extension on gameplay was a breakaway of the current " 100 yen for 3 minutes " that persisted at the time for arcade games , and rewarded players with longer playing times by performing well in the game . In addition to providing a game that could be played in short sessions , Kanno wanted a game to explore the " daily life and routine " of a taxi driver . In the development of the Dreamcast version of the original arcade game , the developers included a larger map in addition to the arcade one , as to create a feeling of " being lost " and allowing home console players to have fun " learning the town " . Mini @-@ games were developed for this version as to " let the player play longer if he improve [ d ] skill " by offering challenges that were both fun and educational . Over one hundred different ideas for mini @-@ games were developed by the team but then pared down for the Crazy Box mini @-@ game challenges for the game . The addition of the Crazy Hop in Crazy Taxi 2 came about because the development team noted that " ... in New York – where the basic landscape is quite flat – we had to create 3D space by letting the player drive on the buildings " and " We added the Crazy Hop to let the player hop around the roofs of buildings to make short cuts " . 
 Hitmaker had tried to develop an on @-@ line version of Crazy Taxi , to be called Crazy Taxi Next exclusively for the Xbox , which , besides multiplayer game modes , would have included night and day cycles , each with a different set of passengers and destinations , while reusing and graphically updating the maps from Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2 . Ultimately , both multiplayer and day / night cycles were dropped and work on Crazy Taxi Next was transferred to Crazy Taxi 3 : High Roller , which included some of the nighttime driving concepts suggested by Next . 
 Kenji Kanno has noted that the gameplay in the Crazy Taxi series has otherwise not " evolved " with each new game " because basically the whole point of the game is to have a lot of fun in a short period of time , and it 's a very concentrated game . So instead of trying to evolve the series necessarily , it 's more like taking that concept and putting it in different places – seeing how it works . " Kanno is considering bringing the title to newer consoles , but would want to be able to include multiplayer features and having a time cycle within the game that would affect passengers ' attitudes and the environment of the game . 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Through the series , the cities used within the Crazy Taxi games have been influenced by real @-@ world cities , including San Francisco , Los Angeles , New York City , and Las Vegas . Certain versions of the Crazy Taxi game include in @-@ game counterparts of real @-@ world businesses , including Pizza Hut , Kentucky Fried Chicken , FILA , and Tower Records ; these were often destination targets for the passengers . Although this is one of the most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history , it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers , perhaps because it gives a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game . These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties . 
 = = = Soundtrack = = = 
 The soundtrack of the Crazy Taxi series has typically been licensed hard rock and punk rock music . The arcade and initial home console versions include selections from punk rock bands The Offspring and Bad Religion , though these have been removed in both the Game Boy Advance and the PlayStation Portable remakes because of licensing issues . In the case of the Game Boy Advance Catch a Ride , the game uses instrumental music instead of recorded songs .

 Sega applied for and was awarded U.S. Patent 6 @,@ 200 @,@ 138 – " Game display method , moving direction indicating method , game apparatus and drive simulating apparatus " – in 2001 . The mechanics in the " 138 patent " describe an arcade cabinet similar to Sega 's previous arcade game Harley @-@ Davidson & L.A. Riders ( 1997 ) , but also describe the arrow navigation system and pedestrian avoidance aspects that were used in Crazy Taxi . 
 In 2001 , Electronic Arts and Fox Entertainment released The Simpsons : Road Rage , which has been labelled a rip @-@ off of the Crazy Taxi formula by game reviewers . In this game , the player controlled one of The Simpsons characters as they drive about Springfield , taking passengers to their destinations in the same manner as Crazy Taxi . Sega sued Fox Entertainment , Electronic Arts , and developer Radical Games Ltd. over infringement of the 138 patent . The case , Sega of America , Inc. v. Fox Interactive , et al . , was settled in private for an unknown amount . The 138 patent itself remains valid , and is considered to be one of the most important patents in video game development today .

 The arcade version of Crazy Taxi was released in 1999 , and featured only the San Francisco @-@ inspired map ( known as " Arcade " in the first console game , and later as " West Coast " in sequels ) . The " Standard Version " arcade cabinet included a cockpit seat , steering wheel , a gear shift lever ( for forward and reverse gear ) and a brake and acceleration pedal ; a more compact " Naomi Cabinet Version " also existed without the cockpit seat . The arcade game was one of the first to use the Sega NAOMI hardware processor , which is based on the Sega Dreamcast and was unveiled as part of Sega 's exhibition at the 1999 Amusement Operators Union exposition in Japan . 
 = = = Crazy Taxi ( console ) = = = 
 The console / home version of Crazy Taxi was released for the Dreamcast on January 24 , 2000 . The Dreamcast and the cabinet arcade version share nearly identical processing hardware , and porting the game to the home console was only made difficult due to the limited internal memory size on the Dreamcast . Sega used Crazy Taxi to show the power of the Dreamcast 's graphical processor , capable of maintaining 60 frame / s throughout play . In addition to the arcade map , this version included the San Francisco @-@ themed city ( entitled " Original " ) , as well as additional mini @-@ games ( " Crazy Box " ) that can be used to hone the player 's taxi handling skills . The new map , much larger than the arcade version , was designed to let the player experience the feeling of " being lost " and allow for exploration , something that could not be done on the arcade version , as well letting " the player enjoy all 3 dimensions . " 
 Once Sega left the hardware market , other companies began to take up some of the franchises , including Crazy Taxi . Acclaim brought the game to the PlayStation on May 21 , 2001 and GameCube on November 18 , 2001 , while Activision and <unk> ported the game to the PC in 2002 ; only the PlayStation 2 port was more successful than the Dreamcast version , and the rest didn 't do as well . Currently , the Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi can be played through emulation via <unk> on PC systems . 
 = = = Crazy Taxi 2 = = = 
 Crazy Taxi 2 was released for the Dreamcast on May 28 , 2001 . The game introduced four cab drivers as well as two new maps inspired based on New York City ( " Around Apple " and " Small Apple " ) , and added two gameplay features : the mechanics of collecting multiple passengers from a single spot , and the " Crazy Hop " , allowing the taxi to clear traffic and certain obstacles with short jumps . Additionally , the " Crazy Box " mode in the first game was expanded into a " Crazy Pyramid " mode . 
 = = = Crazy Taxi 3 : High Roller = = = 
 Crazy Taxi 3 : High Roller was released for the Xbox on July 23 , 2002 , and later released as a PC title in 2004 . The game reuses the original arcade map modified to allow the use of the " Crazy Hop " introduced in Crazy Taxi 2 , one of the maps from Crazy Taxi 2 , and a new map based on Las Vegas ( " Glitter Oasis " ) . The game adds an additional four characters to select from . The game allows the player to unlock other modes of transport besides the taxi , including a stroller , a pedal bike and a carriage . The mini @-@ games in Crazy Taxi 3 are featured in a " Crazy X " arrangement . An arcade version , entitled Crazy Taxi : High Roller was created in 2003 using the same three maps as the home console version . 
 = = = Crazy Taxi : Catch a Ride = = = 
 Crazy Taxi : Catch a Ride was ported to the Game Boy Advance by Graphics State and distributed by THQ , and released on April 8 , 2003 . This version is fundamentally the same as the Crazy Taxi console versions , featuring the San Francisco and Los Angeles @-@ themed maps but with a smaller selection of mini @-@ games , adapted to play on the portable device using the Graphics State " Rush " engine . Specifically , while the city and streets are rendered using 3D graphics , the taxi , passengers , and other traffic are represented by sprites in order to work on the limited GBA hardware . Richard Whittall , creative director for Graphics State , noted that Catch A Ride was " about the most technically challenging game you could do on a handheld machine " at the time of its release . 
 = = = Crazy Taxi : Fare Wars = = = 
 Crazy Taxi : Fare Wars was developed by Sniper Studios with support from members of the original Hitmaker Crazy Taxi design team in Japan and released for the PlayStation Portable on August 7 , 2007 . The game effectively is a port of both Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2 to this system without any changes to the gameplay , but lacking the in @-@ game advertising and the original soundtracks . While the game includes its own soundtrack , the player can use their own music stored on the PSP ; as noted by Jeff Hasson of Sniper Studios , " for those hard core fans that must have The Offspring playing , they have that option with the Custom Music Player . " The player can also record up to a minute of gameplay footage that can then be shared with friends . The game includes a multiplayer feature over the PSP 's ad @-@ hoc wireless system , allowing players to vie for fares within the same map , including the ability to steal passengers from another player . Multiplayer games such as time trials or " C @-@ R @-@ A @-@ Z @-@ Y " runs ( a variation of the game " Horse " ) can also be played sharing a common PSP , with each player taking turns within the game . 
 = = = Crazy Taxi City Rush = = = 
 Crazy Taxi City Rush was announced by Sega in March 2014 as a free @-@ to @-@ play mobile title for iOS and Android systems . City Rush is a game similar in concept to Temple Run , where the player does not have direct control of the speed of the taxi but can use touch motions to swerve in traffic and make turns . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The original Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi was one of the best @-@ selling games for the console . The game was the second largest selling Dreamcast game in the United States in 2000 , selling nearly 750 @,@ 000 units , and is the third best @-@ selling Dreamcast game in the United States with over a million units sold . The game was praised for capturing the arcade flavor , and possibly exceeding it by making the controls and execution of the crazy stunts easier to perform . The game did suffer from " pop @-@ up " due to limited draw distances , and loss of frame rate when a large number of cars were on the screen . Critics noted the lack of depth given that it was a port of an arcade game , some difficulties with the destination arrow , and the poor " Wolfman Jack " impersonation of the in @-@ game announcer . 
 Crazy Taxi 2 was well received by reviewers with the new features helping to expand play from the original game , though some thought that more drastic changes could have been made in the sequel . Despite the addition of new maps , the lack of new gameplay elements caused Crazy Taxi 3 to be panned by reviewers . IGN noted in its review for Crazy Taxi 3 that " It 's clear that the creative vibrancy that first imagined the Taxi series has waned considerably . " 
 The ports of the original game to the PS2 and GameCube platforms are not considered as strong as the Dreamcast game . Both were noted to suffer from more " pop @-@ up " than the Dreamcast version , as well as poorer controls , despite having the same gameplay features . Graphic problems plagued the Crazy Taxi : Catch a Ride port to the Game Boy Advance ; as IGN stated , " it 's painfully obvious that the hardware just was never meant to push so much . " Both PC ports for Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 3 also suffered from graphics problems . 
 The PSP ports of Crazy Taxi : Fare Wars have had a somewhat better reception than other ports . Reviews have complimented the game on the multiplayer additions and the ability to add a custom soundtrack – which led IGN to comment that " Including this should be a no @-@ brainer , but many PSP titles don 't " – but have noted some graphical glitches , the long loading times , and the lack of the original soundtracks for the games . The reviews of the controls of the game have mixed , with some praising the scheme on the PSP , while others have stated that the controls feel stiff and inconsistent . GameSpot 's review noted that the gameplay in Crazy Taxi does not hold up well compared to more recent racing games across various platforms . 
 A Crazy Taxi segment is featured in the " Sega Carnival " track in Sonic Riders , including a hidden shortcut allowing racers to receive a ride from taxi driver Axel ; a Crazy Taxi extreme gear can be unlocked as well . There is also a minigame based on Crazy Taxi in the EyeToy game , Sega Superstars , in which players move around and shout to call one of the taxi drivers . B.D. Joe , who has appeared in most games in the series , appears as a playable character in the cross @-@ series racing game , Sonic & Sega All @-@ Stars Racing . Sumo Digital 's Steve " <unk> " Lycett had to get approval from SEGA <unk> in order to use B.D. Joe in the game . He also appeared in the sequel , Sonic & All @-@ Stars Racing Transformed . 
 = = Beyond video games = = 
 Sega has attempted to branch the Crazy Taxi franchise beyond the realm of video games , with varied results . 
 In addition to the video arcade games , Sega Enterprises , Inc . ( USA ) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003 . The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model in the center of the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets ( representing passengers ) at the far end . Passengers were worth different points , from which the operator would then set the amount of tickets to be won . The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games . 
 There have been two attempts to create a movie based on the Crazy Taxi franchise . In 2001 , Goodman @-@ Rosen Productions acquired the rights for the movie , with Richard Donner lined up to direct the film . Donner had stated " I loved playing ' Crazy Taxi , ' and I realized immediately that it had the potential to be a big summer event movie . " The movie would have been tied with other merchandise items such as T @-@ shirts and toys , according to Jane Thompson , director of licensing for Sega of America . However , this initial attempt stalled due to an " absence of plot elements " according to Movie Insider . After this option expired , <unk> Entertainment acquired the rights to a Crazy Taxi movie based on the game franchise in 2002 , with an expected release date in mid @-@ 2003 . However , since then , no further news on the film has been forthcoming . 
 In 2003 , Sega entered a contract with DSI Toys to produce a remote controlled car in their " <unk> " line based on the Crazy Taxi franchise , but DSI filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy later that year . Sega has formed the production company Stories International and teaming up with Evan <unk> for film and TV projects based on theirs games with Crazy Taxi as an animated project . 
 = Niger women 's national football team = 
 The Niger women 's national football team is a FIFA @-@ recognised team representing Niger in international association football matches . The team has played in two FIFA recognised matches , both of which were losses to Burkina Faso women 's national football team in 2007 . There is an under @-@ 20 women 's national team who were supposed to participate in the 2002 African Women U @-@ 19 Championship but withdrew before playing a game . There are problems that impact the development of the women 's game in Africa that effect Niger . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Early development of the women 's game at the time colonial powers brought football to the continent was limited as colonial powers in the region tended to take male concepts of patriarchy and women 's participation in sport with them to local cultures that had similar concepts already embedded in them . The lack of later development of the national team on a wider international level symptomatic of all African teams is a result of several factors , including limited access to education , poverty amongst women in the wider society , and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses . When quality female football players are developed , they tend to leave for greater opportunities abroad . Continent wide , funding is also an issue , with most development money coming from FIFA , not the national football association . Future , success for women 's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities . Attempting to commercialise the game and make it commercially viable is not the solution , as demonstrated by the current existence of many youth and women 's football camps held throughout the continent . 
 Niger Football Federation was founded in 1967 and became a FIFA affiliate that same year . The FIFA <unk> is <unk> . The national association does not have a full @-@ time staffer dedicated to women , and there are no organisational or constitutional provisions specifically pertaining to the women 's game . 
 No organised women 's football programme existed in the country despite football being one of the most popular sports in the country by 2009 . For women though , basketball is the most popular participation sport . In 2006 , there were zero registered female players and zero registered football clubs for women only . Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women 's World Cup in the country were bought by the African Union of Broadcasting and Supersport International . 
 = = Team = = 
 In 1985 , almost no country in the world had a women 's national football team including Niger who officially had no women 's national senior A team before 2006 and only had their first FIFA recognised international in 2007 when they competed at the Tournoi de Cinq Nations held in Ouagadougou . On 2 September , they lost to Burkina Faso 0 @-@ 10 . On 6 September , they lost to Burkina Faso 0 @-@ 5 . The country did not have a team competing in the 2010 African Women 's Championships during the preliminary rounds or the 2011 All Africa Games . In June 2012 , the team was not ranked in the world by FIFA . The country has never been ranked by FIFA . 
 The country has had a Niger women 's national under @-@ 19 team who have competed in the 2002 African Women U @-@ 19 Championship , the first edition of the competition to be held . They had a bye in the first round . In the quarterfinals , they were supposed to play Morocco but Niger withdrew from the competition . 
 = IB Diploma Programme = 
 The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme ( IBDP ) is a two @-@ year educational programme primarily aimed at students aged 16 – 19 . The program provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognised by many universities worldwide . It was developed in the early to mid @-@ 1960s in Geneva , Switzerland , by a group of international educators . After a six @-@ year pilot programme ended in 1975 , a bilingual diploma was established . 
 Administered by the International Baccalaureate ( IB ) , the IBDP is taught in schools in over 140 countries , in one of three languages : English , French , or Spanish . In order to participate , students must attend an IB school . IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects , one from each subject group , and three core requirements . Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments , and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations , usually consisting of two or three timed written tests . Internal assessment varies by subject : there may be oral presentations , practical work , or written work . In most cases , these are initially graded by the classroom teacher , whose grades are then verified or modified , as necessary , by an appointed external moderator . 
 Generally , the IBDP has been well received . It has been commended for introducing interdisciplinary thinking to students . In the United Kingdom , The Guardian newspaper claims that the IBDP is " more academically challenging and broader than three or four A @-@ levels " . However , a pledge to allow children in all areas to participate in the programme was shelved amid concerns that a " two @-@ tier " education system was emerging , because the growth in IB was driven by private schools and sixth form colleges . British students who take the IB with its six subjects , Extended Essay ( EE ) , Theory of Knowledge ( TOK ) , and Creativity , Action and Service ( CAS ) receive differently structured university offers to those who sit three A @-@ levels , with universities working carefully to construct appropriate equivalent offer conditions . 
 = = History and background = = 
 In 1948 the " Conference of Internationally @-@ minded Schools " asked the International School of Geneva ( Ecolint ) to create an international schools program . When he became director of Ecolint 's English division , Desmond Cole @-@ Baker began to develop the idea , and in 1962 , his colleague Robert Leach organised a conference in Geneva , at which the term " International Baccalaureate " was first mentioned . An American social studies teacher , Leach organized the conference — with a $ 2500 grant from UNESCO — which was attended by observers from European schools and UNESCO . Writing about the genesis of the International Baccalaureate in Schools Across Frontiers , Alec Peterson credits Leach as " the original promoter of the International Baccalaureate . " At the end of the conference , Unesco funded the International School Association with an additional $ 10 @,@ 000 , which was inadequate to do more than produce a few papers , or bring teachers together for meetings . 
 By 1964 , international educators such as Alec Peterson ( director of the Department of Education at Oxford University ) , Harlan Hanson ( director of the College Board Advanced Placement Program ) , Desmond Cole ( director of United Nations International School in New York ) and Desmond Cole @-@ Baker ( head of the International School of Geneva ) founded the International Schools Examination Syndicate ( ISES ) . Cole and Hanson brought experience with college entrance examinations in the United States , and Hanson , in particular , brought his experience from a long relationship with the College Board . According to Peterson , " the breakthrough in the history of the IB " came in 1965 with a grant from the Twentieth Century Fund , which commissioned Martin Mayer , author of The Schools , to produce a report on the feasibility of establishing a common curriculum and examination for international schools that would be acceptable for entry to universities worldwide . This led to conferences involving Ecolint , the United World College of the Atlantic ( Atlantic College ) , and others in the spring and fall of 1965 , at which details about the curriculum for the Diploma Programme were discussed and agreed upon . 
 The Ford Foundation grant , secured in 1966 , funded Peterson 's study at Oxford University , which focused on three issues : a comparative analysis of " secondary educational programmes in European countries ... in cooperation with the Council of Europe " ; university expectations for secondary students intending to enter university ; and a " statistical comparison of IB pilot examination results with ... national school leaving examinations such as British A Levels and US College Board ( AP ) Tests " . As a result of the study and the curriculum model developed at Atlantic College , Peterson initiated the pattern of combining " general education with specialization " , which melded with the curricula of the United States and Canada , and became the " curriculum framework " proposed at the UNESCO conference in Geneva in 1967 . Late in 1967 , ISES was restructured and renamed the IB Council of Foundation , and John <unk> became the first president in January 1968 . In 1967 , the group , which by then also included Ralph Tyler , identified eight schools to be used for the experimentation of the curriculum . 
 In 1968 , the IB headquarters were officially established in Geneva for the development and maintenance of the IBDP . Alec Peterson became IBO 's first director general , and in 1968 , twelve schools in twelve countries participated in the IBDP , including Atlantic College and UNIS of New York . The aim was to " provide an internationally acceptable university admissions qualification suitable for the growing mobile population of young people whose parents were part of the world of diplomacy , international and multi @-@ national organizations . " 
 The first six years of the IB Diploma Programme , with a limited number of students , are referred to as the " experimental period " . Each school was to be inspected by ISES or IBO and had to be approved by their government . The experimental period ended in 1975 , and in that year , the International Baccalaureate North America ( <unk> ) was established as a separate entity , allowing the funding for implementation of the IBDP to remain in the country rather than being sent to Geneva . The first official guide to the programme containing its syllabus and official assessment information was published in 1970 and included the theory of knowledge course . The extended essay was introduced in 1978 , but creativity , action , service ( CAS ) , although mentioned in guides beforehand , was not specifically identified in the guide until 1989 . 
 In 1980 , responding to criticism that the " internationalism " was Eurocentric , the IB hosted a seminar in Singapore with the goal of incorporating Asian culture and education into the IB curriculum . In 1982 , the Standing Conference of Heads of IB Schools took steps to modify the Eurocentrism in the curriculum . The same year , the Japanese government hosted a science conference for IBO " as a token of Japanese interest in the various dimensions of the IB " . 
 From the start , all subjects of the IB Diploma Programme were available in English and French , and it was mandatory for all students to study both a first and a second language . In 1974 , bilingual diplomas were introduced that allowed students to take one or more of their humanities or science subjects in a language other than their first . The IB Diploma Programme subjects became available in Spanish in 1983 . 
 = = Core requirements and subject groups = = 
 To be awarded an IB diploma , a candidate must fulfill three core requirements , in addition to passing his or her subject examinations : 
 Extended essay ( EE ) . Candidates must write an independent research essay of up to 4 @,@ 000 words in a subject from the list of approved EE subjects . The candidate may choose to investigate a topic within a subject they are currently studying , although this is not required . The EE may not be written on an interdisciplinary topic . 
 Theory of knowledge ( TOK ) . This course introduces students to theories about the nature and limitations of knowledge ( basic epistemology ) and provides practice in determining the meaning and validity of knowledge ( critical thinking ) . It is claimed to be a " flagship element " of the Diploma Programme , and is the one course that all diploma candidates are required to take . TOK requires 100 hours of instruction , the completion of an externally assessed essay of 1600 words ( from a choice of six titles prescribed by the IB worth 67 % ) , and an internally assessed presentation ( worth 33 % ) on the candidate 's chosen topic . 
 Creativity , activity , service ( CAS ) . CAS aims to provide students with opportunities for personal growth , self @-@ reflection , intellectual , physical and creative challenges , and awareness of themselves as responsible members of their communities through participation in social or community work ( service ) , athletics or other physical activities ( activity ) , and creative activities ( creativity ) . The guideline for the minimum amount of CAS activity over the two @-@ year programme is approximately 3 – 4 hours per week , though " hour counting ” is not encouraged . Previously , there was a requirement that 150 CAS hours be completed , but this was abolished in 2010 . However , some schools still require these hours . 
 Subject groups 
 Students who pursue the IB diploma must take six subjects : one each from Groups 1 – 5 , and either one from Group 6 or a permitted substitute from one of the other groups , as described below . Three or four subjects must be taken at Higher level ( HL ) and the rest at Standard level ( SL ) . The IB recommends a minimum of 240 hours of instructional time for HL courses and 150 hours for SL courses . 
 While the IB encourages students to pursue the full IB diploma , the " substantial workload require a great deal of commitment , organization , and initiative " . Students may instead choose to register for one or more individual IB subjects , without the core requirements . Such students will not receive the full diploma . 
 The six IBDP subject groups and course offerings are summarised below . More information about the subject groups and individual courses can be found at the respective subject group articles : 
 Group 1 : Studies in language and literature . Taken at either SL or HL , this is generally the student 's native language , with over 80 languages available . As of courses starting in summer 2011 , there are two options for Language A ( previously A1 ) : Literature , which is very similar to the old course , and Language and Literature , a slightly more challenging adaptation of the former Group 2 Language A2 subjects , which have been withdrawn . The interdisciplinary subject Literature and Performance can also be taken at SL . 
 Group 2 : Language acquisition . An additional language , taken at the following levels : Language B ( SL or HL ) , or Language ab initio ( SL only ) . Latin and Classical Greek are also offered and may be taken at SL or HL . Following the replacement of the Language A2 option with the Group 1 Language and Literature offering for courses starting in summer 2011 , the Language B syllabus was changed : the coursework is now more rigorous , and at HL , there is the compulsory study of two works of literature ( although this is for comprehension rather than analysis and is only assessed through coursework ) . In addition , B SL students can study one of the texts as a replacement for the optional topics . 
 Group 3 : Individuals and societies . Humanities and social sciences courses offered at both SL and HL : Business and Management , Economics , Geography , History , Information Technology in a Global Society ( <unk> ) , Philosophy , Psychology , and Social and Cultural Anthropology . The course World Religions , the interdisciplinary course Environmental Systems and Societies , and the pilot course Global Politics are also offered at SL only . 
 Group 4 : Experimental sciences . Five courses are offered at both SL and HL : Chemistry , Biology , Physics , Design Technology and Computer Science . The course Sport , Exercise and Health Science and the interdisciplinary course Environmental Systems and Societies are offered at SL only . 
 Group 5 : Mathematics . In order of increasing difficulty , the courses offered are Mathematical Studies SL , Mathematics SL and HL , and Further Mathematics SL and HL . The computer science elective courses were moved to Group 4 as a full course from first examinations in 2014 . 
 Group 6 : The arts . Courses offered at both SL and HL : Dance , foreign languages , Music , Theatre , Visual Arts , and Film . In lieu of taking a Group 6 course , students may choose to take an additional course from Groups 1 – 4 or either Further Mathematics HL ( if already studying Mathematics HL ) a Computer science course from Group 4 , or a school @-@ based syllabus course approved by IB . The interdisciplinary subject Literature and Performance is also offered , although currently only at SL . 
 Environmental systems and societies SL is an interdisciplinary course designed to meet the diploma requirements for groups 3 and 4 , while Literature and Performance SL meets the requirements of Groups 1 and 6 . 
 Online Diploma Programme and pilot courses 
 The IB is developing a pilot online version of the IBDP and currently offers several online courses to IBDP students . Eventually , it expects to offer online courses to any student who wishes to register . Additionally , the IB has developed pilot courses that include World Religions ; Sports , Exercise and Health Sciences , Dance , and a transdisciplinary pilot course , Literature and Performance . These pilot courses have now become part of the mainstream courses . Currently , Global Politics is a pilot course that is intended to become mainstream in September 2015 . 
 = = Assessment and awards = = 
 All subjects ( with the exception of CAS ) are evaluated using both internal and external assessors . The externally assessed examinations are given worldwide in May ( usually for Northern Hemisphere schools ) and in November ( usually for Southern Hemisphere schools ) . Each exam usually consists of two or three papers , generally written on the same or successive weekdays . The different papers may have different forms of questions , or they may focus on different areas of the subject syllabus . For example , in Chemistry SL , paper 1 has multiple choice questions , paper 2 has extended response questions and data analysis , and paper 3 focuses on the " Option ( s ) " selected by the teacher . The grading of all external assessments is done by independent examiners appointed by the IB . 
 The nature of the internal assessment ( IA ) varies by subject . There may be oral presentations ( used in languages ) , practical work ( in experimental sciences and performing arts ) , or written work . Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and is marked by a teacher in the school . A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB , in a process called external moderation of internal assessment . Based on this moderation , the grades of the whole subject from that school will change . 
 Points are awarded from 1 to 7 , with 7 being equal to A * , 6 equal to A , and so on . Up to three additional points are awarded depending on the grades achieved in the extended essay and theory of knowledge , so the maximum possible point total in the IBDP is 45 . The global pass rate for the IB diploma is approximately 80 % . In order to receive an IB diploma , candidates must receive a minimum of 24 points or an average of four ( or C ) out of a possible seven points for six subjects . Candidates must also receive a minimum of 12 points from their Higher Level subjects and a minimum of 9 points from their Standard Level subjects . Additionally , candidates must complete all of the requirements for the EE , CAS and TOK . Failing conditions that will prevent a student from being awarded a diploma , regardless of points received , are non @-@ completion of CAS , more than three scores of 3 or below , not meeting the specific points required for Higher Level or Standard Level subjects , or plagiarism . 
 Candidates who successfully complete all the requirements of the IB Diploma Programme and one or more of the following combinations are eligible to receive a bilingual diploma : two Group 1 subjects ( of different languages ) , a Group 3 or 4 subject taken in a language other than the candidate 's Group 1 language , or an Extended Essay in a Group 3 or Group 4 subject written in a language other than the candidate 's Group 1 language . IB certificates are issued to indicate completion of diploma courses and exams for non @-@ diploma candidate students . 
 Special circumstances 
 Where standard assessment conditions could put a student with special educational needs at a disadvantage , special arrangements may be allowed . The Candidates with Special Assessment Needs publication contains information regarding procedures and arrangements for students with special needs . 
 = = Application and authorization = = 
 To offer the IB Diploma Programme , an institution must go through an application process , and during that period the teachers are trained in the IB . At the end of the application process , IB conducts an authorisation visit . Once a school is authorised to offer the programme , an annual fee ensures ongoing support from the IB , legal authorisation to display the IB logo , and access to the Online Curriculum Centre ( OCC ) and the IB Information System ( <unk> ) . The OCC provides information , resources , and support for IB teachers and coordinators . <unk> is a database employed by IB coordinators . Other IB fees also include student registration and individual diploma subject examination fees . 
 = = University recognition = = 
 The IB diploma is accepted in 75 countries at over 2 @,@ 000 universities , and the IB has a search directory on its website , although it advises students to check recognition policies directly with each university . The IB also maintains a list of universities offering scholarships to IBDP graduates under conditions specified by each institution , including 58 colleges and universities in the United States . The following is an overview of university recognition policies in various countries . 
 For the purposes of university admissions in Austria , the IB diploma is considered a foreign secondary school leaving certificate , even if the school issuing the diploma is in the country . Admission decisions are at the discretion of higher education institutions . 
 In Finland , the IB diploma gives the same qualification for matriculation as the national matriculation examination . The core requirements differ very little , although the Finnish degree has more electives and languages are a larger part of the final grading . 
 In France , the IBDP is one of the foreign diplomas that allow students access into French universities . 
 Germany sets certain conditions for the IB diploma to be accepted ( a foreign language at minimum A2 Standard Level ; mathematics Standard Level minimum ; economics , geography , or history as the Group 3 subject ; and at least one science or mathematics course at Higher Level ) . German International Baccalaureate students in some schools are able to earn a " bilingual diploma " that gains them access to German universities ; half of the classes in this programme are held in German . 
 The Italian Ministry of Education recognises the IB diploma as academically equivalent to the national diploma , provided the curriculum includes the Italian language and the particular IB programme is accepted for <unk> matriculation in Italy . 
 Spain considers the IB diploma academically equivalent to the " Título de <unk> español " . As of 1 June 2008 , IB diploma holders no longer need to pass the University Entrance Examination to be admitted to Spanish universities . 
 Turkish universities accept the IB diploma , but all applicants are required by law to take the university entrance examinations . 
 According to the IB , there are two universities in Russia that officially recognise the IB diploma subject to certain guidelines . The Russian Ministry of Education considers the IB diploma issued by state @-@ accredited IB schools in Russia equivalent to the certificate of secondary ( complete ) general education ( <unk> ) . 
 In the United Kingdom , UCAS publishes a university entrance tariff table that converts IB and other qualifications into standardised " tariff points " , but these are not binding , so institutions are free to set minimum entry requirements for IB candidates that are not the same as those for A level candidates . Most universities in the UK require IB students to take more courses than A @-@ level students — requiring , for instance , four As and two Bs from an IB student , whereas an A @-@ level student will only need an ABB — because each subject taken as a part of the IB gives a less broad coverage of a similar subject taken at A @-@ level . 
 Although every university in Australia accepts the IB diploma , entry criteria differ from university to university . Some universities accept students on their IB point count , whereas others require the points to be converted . In most states , this is based on the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank ( <unk> ) . In Queensland , IBDP scores are converted to a <unk> scale to determine selection rank . 
 In the United States , institutions of higher education set their own admission and credit policies for IB diploma recognition . Colorado and Texas have legislation requiring universities to adopt and implement policy which awards college credit to students who have successfully completed the IBDP . 
 In Canada , IB North America publishes a IB Recognition Policy Summary for Canadian Universities . Peruvian universities do not officially accept the IB diploma . However , the Ministry of Education may grant partial equivalence to national diploma for students who have satisfactorily completed the fourth year of high school in the country . 
 In Hong Kong , IB diploma students may apply to universities as non @-@ <unk> ( Joint University Programmes Admissions System ) . 
 The People 's Republic of China does not formally accept the IB diploma for university qualification . 
 In the 2008 – 2009 prospectus in Singapore , the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) accepts the IBDP as a high school qualification for Singapore universities . University requirements are as follows : three HL subjects with scores of 5 or better , two SL subjects with scores of 4 or better , and a grade of 4 or better in English A , Standard Level . 
 In India , the Association of Indian Universities recognises the IBDP as an entry qualification to all universities , provided that the applicants include a document from the IB detailing percentage equivalency and that specific course requirements for admission to medical and engineering programs are satisfied .

 The IBDP was described as " a rigorous , off @-@ the @-@ shelf curriculum recognized by universities around the world ” in the December 10 , 2006 , edition of Time magazine , in an article titled " How to bring our schools out of the 20th century " . It was also featured in the summer 2002 edition of American Educator , where Robert Rothman described it as " a good example of an effective , <unk> sound , exam @-@ based system " . Howard Gardner , a professor of educational psychology at Harvard University , said that the IBDP curriculum is " less parochial than most American efforts " and helps students " think critically , synthesize knowledge , reflect on their own thought processes and get their feet wet in interdisciplinary thinking " . An admissions officer at Brown University claims the IBDP garners widespread respect . 
 In the United Kingdom , the IBDP is " regarded as more academically challenging but broader than three or four A @-@ levels " , according to an article in the Guardian . In 2006 , government ministers provided funding so that " every local authority in England could have at least one centre offering sixth @-@ formers the chance to do the IB " . In 2008 , Children 's Secretary Ed Balls abandoned a " flagship Tony Blair pledge to allow children in all areas to study IB " . Fears of a " two @-@ tier " education system further dividing education between the rich and the poor emerged as the growth in IB is driven by private schools and sixth @-@ form colleges . 
 In the United States , criticism of the IBDP has centered on the claim that it is anti @-@ American , according to The New York Times . Early funding from UNESCO , and the organization 's ties to the United Nations are cited as objectionable . The cost of the program is also considered to be too high . In 2012 , the school board in Coeur d 'Alene , Idaho , voted to eliminate all IB programmes in the district because of low participation and high costs . 
 = Andrew III of Hungary = 
 Andrew III the Venetian ( Hungarian : III . <unk> András , Croatian : Andrija III . <unk> , Slovak : Ondrej III . ; c . 1265 – 14 January 1301 ) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1290 and 1301 . His father , Stephen the Posthumous , was the posthumous son of Andrew II of Hungary although Stephen 's brothers considered him a bastard . Andrew grew up in Venice , and first arrived in Hungary upon the invitation of a rebellious baron , Ivan Kőszegi , in 1278 . Kőszegi tried to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary , but the conspiracy collapsed and Andrew returned to Venice . 
 Being the last male member of the House of Árpád , Andrew was elected king after the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290 . He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a coronation diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy . At least three pretenders — Albert of Austria , Mary of Hungary , and an adventurer — challenged his claim to the throne . Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year , but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim . The Hungarian bishops and Andrew 's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters , but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule . 
 Hungary was in a state of constant anarchy during Andrew 's reign . The Kőszegis , the <unk> , and other powerful families autonomously governed their domains , rising up nearly every year in open rebellion against Andrew . With Andrew 's death , the House of Árpád became extinct . A civil war ensued which lasted for more than two decades and ended with the victory of Mary of Hungary 's grandson , Charles Robert .

 Andrew was the son of Stephen the Posthumous , the self @-@ styled Duke of Slavonia , and his second wife , Tomasina Morosini . Andrew 's father was born to Beatrice D 'Este , the third wife of Andrew II of Hungary , after the king 's death . However , Andrew II 's two elder sons , Béla IV of Hungary and Coloman of Halych , accused Beatrice D 'Este of adultery and refused to acknowledge Stephen the Posthumous as their legitimate brother . Andrew 's mother , Tomasina Morosini , was the daughter of wealthy Venetian patrician Michele Morosini . 
 The exact date of Andrew 's birth is unknown . According to historians Tibor <unk> , Gyula Kristó , and Attila Zsoldos , he was born in about 1265 . Stephen the Posthumous nominated his wife 's two kinsmen , including her brother Alberto Morosini , as Andrew 's guardians before his death in 1272 .

 Andrew came to Hungary for the first time in 1278 at the invitation of a powerful lord , Ivan Kőszegi . Kőszegi wanted to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary . Andrew , who was the only male member of the royal family besides the king , adopted the title of " Duke of Slavonia , Dalmatia and Croatia " and marched as far as Lake Balaton . Andrew achieved nothing , however , and went back to Venice in autumn . 
 Andrew returned to Hungary at the beginning of 1290 . On this occasion , Lodomer , Archbishop of Esztergom , also urged him to come , since the archbishop wanted to dethrone the excommunicated Ladislaus IV with the assistance of Ivan Kőszegi . Before Andrew was successful , Arnold <unk> , an enemy of the Kőszegis , invited him to the fort of <unk> and captured him . <unk> sent Andrew to Vienna , where Albert I , Duke of Austria , held him in captivity . 
 Three Cuman assassins murdered Ladislaus IV on 10 July 1290 , and Archbishop Lodomer subsequently dispatched two monks to Vienna to inform Andrew of the king 's death . With the monks ' assistance , Andrew left his prison in disguise and hastened to Hungary .

 Upon Andrew 's arrival , his opponents tried to bribe Theodor , Prior of the Székesfehérvár Chapter , not to hand over the Holy Crown of Hungary to the soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ king , but the prior refused them . Archbishop Lodomer crowned Andrew king in Székesfehérvár on 23 July . The lords and prelates swore loyalty to Andrew only after he issued a charter promising the restoration of internal peace and respect for the privileges of the nobility and the clergymen . He then appointed the most powerful noblemen , who had for years administered their domains independently of the monarch , to the highest offices . Amadeus Aba , who dominated the northeastern parts of the kingdom , was made palatine , Ivan Kőszegi , the lord of the western parts of Transdanubia , became master of the treasury , and Roland Borsa remained the voivode of Transylvania . Andrew held a diet before 1 September . To put an end to anarchy , the " prelates , barons and noblemen " ordered the destruction of castles which had been erected without royal permission and the restoration of estates that had been unlawfully seized to their rightful owners . Andrew promised that he would hold a diet each year during his reign . 
 There were several other challengers to Andrew 's claim to the throne . Rudolf I of Germany claimed that Hungary escheated to him after Ladislaus IV 's childless death , because Ladislaus IV 's grandfather , Béla IV of Hungary , had sworn fidelity to Frederick II , Holy Roman Emperor during the Mongol invasion of Hungary . Although Pope Innocent IV had years before freed Béla IV of his oath , Rudolf I of Germany attempted to bestow Hungary on his own son , Albert of Austria , on 31 August . The self @-@ declared " Andrew , Duke of Slavonia " — an adventurer who claimed to be identical to Ladislaus IV 's dead younger brother — also challenged King Andrew 's right to the crown and stormed into Hungary from Poland . He was shortly thereafter forced to return to Poland , where he was murdered . 
 Andrew married <unk> , the daughter of <unk> of Kuyavia , before the end of 1290 . Andrew then held a general assembly for the barons and the noblemen of five counties to the east of the river Tisza — Bihar , <unk> , Szabolcs , Szatmár , and Szolnok — at Nagyvárad ( now Oradea in Romania ) in early 1291 . The assembly outlawed Stephen <unk> , a staunch supporter of the late Ladislaus IV , for major trespass . From the assembly , Andrew went to Gyulafehérvár ( now Alba Iulia in Romania ) . Here he issued the decrees of his 1290 diet at the assembly of the local noblemen , Saxons , Székelys and Romanians , in February or March . Around the same time , Andrew dismissed Amadeus Aba and made Iván Kőszegi palatine . 
 Ladislaus IV 's sister Mary , wife of Charles II of Naples , announced her claim to the throne in April 1291 . The Babonići , Frankopans , Šubići , and other leading Croatian and Slavonian noble families accepted her as the lawful monarch . Andrew 's main concern , however , was Albert of Austria 's claim . He invaded Austria , forcing Albert to withdraw his garrisons from the towns and fortresses — including Pressburg ( now Bratislava in Slovakia ) and Sopron — that he had captured years before , many of which were held by the Kőszegis before their conquest . The Peace of Hainburg , which concluded the war , was signed on 26 August , and three days later Andrew and Albert of Austria confirmed it at their meeting in <unk> ( now <unk> in Slovakia ) . The peace treaty prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert of Austria had seized from the Kőszegis . The Kőszegis rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292 , acknowledging Mary 's son , Charles Martel , as King of Hungary . The royal troops subdued the rebellion by July , but the Kőszegis captured and imprisoned Andrew during his journey to Slavonia in August . Andrew was liberated within four months , after his supporters sent their relatives as hostages to the Kőszegis . 
 = = = Rebellions and attempts to consolidate ( 1293 – 1298 ) = = = 
 Upon Andrew 's request , his mother , Tomasina , moved to Hungary in 1293 . Andrew appointed her to administer Croatia , Dalmatia , and Slavonia . Due to her activities , the Babonići , Šubići , and the Dalmatian towns , acknowledged Andrew 's rule . Andrew visited the northern parts of Hungary and ordered the revision of former land grants in February . After his return to Buda , he again made Amadeus Aba palatine . In August , Andrew arranged a marriage between his niece , Constance Morosini , and Vladislav , son of Stefan Dragutin of Serbia , who had earlier acknowledged Charles Martel 's claim to Hungary . 
 Roland Borsa besieged and captured Benedict , Bishop of Várad 's fortress at <unk> ( now <unk> in Romania ) on 23 May 1294 . Andrew held a general assembly and outlawed Borsa . According to historian Attila Zsoldos , he made Nicholas Kőszegi palatine on this occasion . Andrew laid siege to Borsa 's fort at Adorján ( now Adrian in Romania ) . The siege lasted three months before the fort fell to Andrew in October . Andrew replaced Roland Borsa with Ladislaus III Kán as voivode of Transylvania , but the former preserved all his domains in the lands east of the Tisza . 
 The Croatian lord Paul Šubić again turned against Andrew and joined the camp of Charles Martel in early 1295 , but Charles died in August . Within two months , the Babonići also rebelled against Andrew . Early the next year , the recently widowed King Andrew visited Vienna and arranged a marriage with Duke Albert 's daughter Agnes . The Kőszegis soon rose up in open rebellion . Andrew declared war on the rebels , and Archbishop Lodomer excommunicated them . Andrew and Albert jointly seized the Kőszegis ' main fort at Kőszeg in October , but could not subdue them . Andrew 's mother seems to have died at the end of the year because references to her activities disappear from the contemporaneous documents . 
 Matthew III Csák , whom Andrew had made palatine in 1296 , turned against Andrew at the end of 1297 . Andrew 's staunch supporter , Archbishop Lodomer , died around the same time . In early February of 1298 , Andrew visited Albert of Austria in Vienna and promised to support him against Adolf of Nassau , King of Germany . Andrew sent an auxiliary troop , and Albert of Austria routed King Adolf in the Battle of <unk> on 2 July . 
 = = = Last years ( 1298 – 1301 ) = = = 
 Andrew held an assembly of the prelates , noblemen , Saxons , Székelys , and Cumans in Pest in the summer of 1298 . The preamble to the decrees that were passed at the diet mentioned " the laxity of the lord king " . The decrees authorized Andrew to destroy forts built without permission and ordered the punishment of those who had seized landed property with force , but also threatened Andrew with excommunication if he did not apply the decrees . At the gathering , he appointed his uncle , <unk> Morosini , Duke of Slavonia . After the close of the diet , Andrew entered into a formal alliance with five influential noblemen , including Amadeus Aba , who stated that they were willing to support him against the Pope and the bishops . Gregory <unk> , the Archbishop @-@ elect and Apostolic Administrator of Esztergom , forbade the prelates to participate at a new diet which was held in 1299 . The prelates ignored the archbishop 's order and Andrew deprived him of Esztergom County . 
 A group of powerful lords — including the Šubići , Kőszegis and <unk> — urged Charles <unk> of Naples to send his grandson , the 12 @-@ year @-@ old Charles Robert , to Hungary in order to become king . The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300 . Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb . The Kőszegis and Matthew Csák , however , were shortly reconciled with Andrew , preventing Charles ' success . Andrew 's envoy to the Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert 's adventure , either . Andrew , who had been in poor health for a while , was planning to capture his opponent , but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301 . According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Kristó , the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved . 
 Andrew was buried in the Franciscan church in Buda . Years later , Palatine Stephen Ákos referred to Andrew as the " last golden branch " of the tree of King Saint Stephen 's family , because with Andrew 's death the House of Árpád , the first royal dynasty of Hungary , ended . A civil war between various claimants to the throne — Charles Robert , Wenceslaus of Bohemia , and Otto of Bavaria — followed Andrew 's death and lasted for seven years . The civil war ended with Charles Robert 's victory , but he was forced to continue fighting against the Kőszegis , the Abas , Matthew Csák , and other powerful lords up to the early 1320s .

 White Zombie went into development in early 1932 . The Halperins leased office space from Universal Studios to get their film ( then titled Zombie ) underway . The film 's zombie theme was inspired by the Broadway play by Kenneth Webb titled Zombie . The screenplay for White Zombie was written by Garnett Weston . Weston 's screenplay focuses more on action than dialog . To aid the Halperins , producer Phil Goldstone helped secure funds for White Zombie as he had for other independent films at the time . 
 White Zombie was filmed in eleven days in March 1932 and was shot at the Universal Studios lot and Bronson Canyon on such a small budget that it had to film at night . Other than Béla Lugosi and Joseph Cawthorn , the majority of the cast in White Zombie were actors whose fame had diminished since the silent film era . By the time Lugosi appeared in White Zombie , he was already popular with contemporary audiences after his starring role in the hit 1931 film , Dracula . Sources vary about Lugosi 's salary for White Zombie . Claims range between US $ 500 to $ 900 . Richard Sheffield , who was his close friend in the 1950s , reported a payment of $ 5 @,@ 000 for White Zombie on Lugosi 's tax returns . The cast and crew 's reaction to Lugosi on the set was mixed . Madge Bellamy recalled her collaboration with Lugosi positively , stating that he was very pleasant and that he used to kiss her hand in the morning when they would come on to the set . In contrast , assistant cameraman Enzo Martinelli remarked that " Lugosi wasn 't really a friendly type " on set . 
 Phil Goldstone had previously worked with Bellamy and offered her the role of Madeleine Short for a salary of $ 5 @,@ 000 . For the role of Dr. Bruner , the Halperins looked for an actor with name value and decided to cast Joseph Cawthorn , who was then known to audiences only as comic relief in stage and film roles . Set designer Ralph Berger utilized the rented sets of previous Universal Studios films . These sets included the great halls from Dracula , pillars and a hanging balcony from The Hunchback of Notre Dame ( 1923 ) , the dark corridors from Frankenstein ( 1931 ) and chairs from The Cat and the Canary ( 1927 ) . In addition to Berger , assistant director William Cody and sound director <unk> " Pete " Clark earned their first film credit by working on White Zombie . Jack Pierce , Lugosi 's make @-@ up artist on White Zombie , had been responsible for the make @-@ up of several other famous horror films of the era including Frankenstein , The Wolf Man , and The Mummy ( 1932 ) . 
 The music of White Zombie was supervised by Abe Meyer . Instead of using pre @-@ recorded music , Meyer had orchestras record new versions of compositions for each specific film he was involved in . The music in White Zombie draws from works including Mussorgsky 's " Pictures at an Exhibition " , Gaston Borch 's " Incidental Symphonies " , and Hugo Riesenfeld 's " Death of the Great Chief " . Other pieces on the White Zombie soundtrack include music written by Richard Wagner , H. Maurice Jacquet , Leo <unk> , and Franz Liszt . The film begins with " Chant " , a composition of wordless vocals and drumming , created by Universal Studios employee Guy Bevier Williams , a specialist in ethnic music .

 White Zombie experienced distribution problems from the beginning , and went through several film studios including Columbia Studios and Educational Pictures before its initial release . United Artists had been distributing several independent and foreign films that year and bought the rights to release White Zombie . A preview of White Zombie 's first cut was shown on June 16 , 1932 , in New York City . This print of White Zombie had a running time of 74 minutes , whereas the regular distribution prints ran for only 69 minutes .

Harrison 's Reports wrote , " [ The film ] is certainly not up to the standards of Dracula or Frankenstein , but the types of audience that go for horror pictures will enjoy it " . 
 National media outlet reviewers were generally negative . Frederic Smith of Commonweal opined , " [ The film is ] interesting only in measure of its complete failure " . Liberty wrote , " If you do not get a shock out of this thriller , you will get one out of the acting " . In Vanity Fair 's " Worst Movie of 1932 " article , Pare Lorentz wrote about a " Terrific deadlock with Blonde Venus holding a slight lead over White Zombie , Bring ' Em Back Alive , and Murders in the Rue Morgue " . In the United Kingdom , press was mixed . The Kinematograph Weekly thought the film was " quite well acted , and has good atmosphere " but thought , too , it was " not for the squeamish or the highly intelligent " . The Cinema News and Property Gazette thought the film was for the " less sophisticated " and that the " exaggerated treatment of the subject achieves reverse effect to thrill or conviction " . Years after the film 's release , Victor Halperin expressed a distaste for his horror films : " I don 't believe in fear , violence , and horror , so why traffic in them ? " 
 Modern critical reception has been mixed , with critics praising the film 's atmosphere while deprecating the acting . Time Out London wrote , " Halperin shoots this poetic melodrama as trance ... The unique result constitutes a virtual bridge between classic Universal horror and the later Val Lewton productions . " TV Guide gave the film three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four , comparing the film 's atmosphere to Carl Dreyer 's film Vampyr .

 White Zombie is considered to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies . Not many early horror films followed White Zombie 's Haitian origins style . Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from White Zombie , such as people returning from the dead and other elements of zombie mythology . These films include : The Ghost Breakers ( 1940 ) , King of the Zombies ( 1941 ) , I Walked with a Zombie ( 1943 ) , and The Plague of the Zombies ( 1966 ) . These films all contain elements from White Zombie including the blank @-@ eyed stares , the voodoo drums , and zombies performing manual labor . 
 Victor Halperin directed a White Zombie sequel , Revolt of the Zombies , which was released in 1936 . Béla Lugosi was considered for the role of villain Armand <unk> , but the part went to Dean Jagger . Cinematographer Arthur Martinelli and producer Edward Halperin returned for the sequel . Modern critical response to Revolt of the Zombies is generally unfavorable . In a review from Zombie Movies : The Ultimate Guide , the review declares that " [ T ] here 's no experimentation here , only dull composition shots and flatly lit shots of <unk> characters in a by @-@ the @-@ numbers plot . " Allmovie rated White Zombie three stars out of five , while it gave Revolt of the Zombies only one star and deemed it far inferior to the original . 
 Scenes from White Zombie have appeared in other films including Curtis Hanson 's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle , Michael Almereyda 's Nadja , and Tim Burton 's Ed Wood . The heavy metal band White Zombie appropriated their name from the film . The group 's vocalist Rob Zombie said of the film , " [ It 's ] a great film that not a lot of people know about ... It amazes me that a film that is so readily available can be so lost . " In 1997 , the Janus company released a model kit based on the Murder Legendre character . 
 In 2009 , it was announced that Tobe Hooper would direct a remake of White Zombie . Screenwriter Jared Rivet worked on a script in 2007 with Hooper . The project was halted due to rights issues . Rivet explained that White Zombie " is clearly public domain , but there were question marks about uncredited source material . " 
 In 2013 , Walkabout Publishing released Stephen D. Sullivan 's adaptation of White Zombie . No stranger to adaptations , Sullivan told Monster Kid Radio , " <unk> , there are movies in the public that I can do an adaptation of , the same way I did Iron Man ... and White Zombie was right at the top of the list of public domain films that I thought would be a good adaptation .

After serving in World War I , Johnson purchased and edited the Elizabethtown Mirror newspaper . He revived the struggling paper , sold it to a competitor and used the profits to obtain his journalism degree from the University of Kentucky in 1922 . After graduation , he became editor of The Anderson News , and in 1925 , he accepted an offer to co @-@ publish and edit the Richmond Daily Register . 
 In 1935 , Johnson was chosen as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor . He was elected and served under Governor A. B. " Happy " Chandler from 1935 to 1939 . He had already secured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1939 when Chandler resigned and elevated Johnson to governor so that Johnson could appoint Chandler to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the death of M. M. Logan . He went on to win a full gubernatorial term in the general election , defeating Republican King Swope . Johnson 's desire to expand the state 's social services was hampered by the financial strain imposed on the state by the outbreak of World War II . Nevertheless , he ran a fiscally conservative administration and took the state from being $ 7 million in debt to having a surplus of $ 10 million by the end of his term . 
 Following his term as governor , Johnson joined Reynolds Metals as a special assistant to the president . He continued his employment with Reynolds until 1961 . He took a year @-@ long leave of absence in 1946 to accept President Harry S. Truman 's appointment as the first U.S. Undersecretary of Labor , serving under Lewis B. Schwellenbach . He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1960 , losing to incumbent Republican John Sherman Cooper . He died February 7 , 1970 , and was buried in Richmond Cemetery in Richmond , Kentucky . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Keen Johnson was born in a two @-@ room cabin at Brandon 's Chapel in Lyon County , Kentucky , on January 12 , 1896 . He was the only son of Reverend Robert and Mattie ( Holloway ) Johnson . His parents named him in honor of John S. Keen , a family friend from Adair County . The Johnsons also had two daughters — Catherine ( Keturah ) and Christine . Robert Johnson was a Methodist minister , and the family moved often as a result of his occupation . 
 After completing his elementary education in the public schools , Johnson attended Vanderbilt Preparatory School for Boys , a Methodist institution in Elkton , Kentucky . He finished his preparatory coursework in 1914 and matriculated to Central Methodist College in Fayette , Missouri . He had intended to continue his studies at the University of Missouri School of Journalism , but he interrupted his studies to enlist in the U.S. Army for service in World War I. 
 After basic training , Johnson entered officer training at Fort Riley on May 15 , 1917 . In August 1917 , he was appointed second lieutenant and assigned to the 354th Infantry , 89th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces at Camp Funston . He was promoted to first lieutenant on March 29 , 1918 , and on June 4 , 1918 , he was deployed to France , where he studied logistical communications at the Army School of the Line and Staff College . He remained in Europe with the American Expeditionary Force until April 1919 and was honorably discharged from the Army on October 31 , 1919 . 
 On June 23 , 1917 , while still completing his military training , Johnson married Eunice Nichols . Their only child , a daughter named Judith , was born May 19 , 1927 . Upon his return from military service , Johnson purchased the Elizabethtown Mirror with financial assistance from his father . He built the struggling paper almost from the ground up , and a competitor soon bought him out for a profit . Johnson used the profit from the sale of the Mirror to continue his education at the University of Kentucky . While a student , he worked as a reporter for the Lexington Herald . He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1922 . The university awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1940 . 
 After graduation , Johnson purchased half @-@ ownership of The Anderson News and served as the paper 's editor and publisher . In 1925 , Shelton M. <unk> asked Johnson to enter into a joint venture to purchase the Richmond Daily Register . Lured by the idea of publishing a daily paper , Johnson accepted . As a result of one of his editorials , Johnson was named executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee in 1932 . He continued to hold this position and publish the Register through 1939 . 
 = = Political career = = 
 In 1935 , Johnson was one of three contenders for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor . In the primary , he received more votes than his opponents , J. E. Wise and B. F. Wright , but a newly enacted election law required a runoff if no candidate received a majority . On September 7 , Johnson defeated Wise in the runoff . 
 In the gubernatorial primary , A. B. " Happy " Chandler defeated Tom Rhea , the candidate favored by sitting governor Ruby Laffoon . Johnson had also favored Rhea , and had backed Robert T. Crowe over J. C. W. Beckham , Chandler 's choice in the 1927 Democratic primary . Nevertheless , the two put aside their differences and won the general election . Chandler defeated Republican King Swope by over 95 @,@ 000 votes , and Johnson defeated J. J. Kavanaugh by over 100 @,@ 000 votes . 
 = = = Governor of Kentucky = = = 
 The division between Chandler and Laffoon led to factionalism within the state Democratic Party . When no strong gubernatorial candidate emerged from the Chandler faction in 1939 , Chandler threw his support behind Johnson . John Y. Brown , Sr. announced he would challenge Johnson in the primary . This solidified the Chandler faction 's support , as Brown was an outspoken critic of the Chandler administration . Brown gained the support of Chandler critics , notably former governor Ruby Laffoon , Tom Rhea , Earle C. Clements , and Alben Barkley . He further garnered the support of the United Mine Workers and labor boss John L. Lewis . It was to no avail , as Johnson defeated Brown in the primary by over 33 @,@ 000 votes to secure the Democratic gubernatorial nomination . 
 The Republicans chose King Swope , the loser in the 1935 gubernatorial election , to oppose Johnson . In the middle of the campaign , however , Johnson was elevated to governor . United States Senator M. M. Logan died in October 1939 , and Governor Chandler resigned so that Johnson — thus elevated to governor — could appoint him to the vacant seat . In the general election on November 17 , Johnson defeated Swope 460 @,@ 834 to 354 @,@ 704 , securing a full term as governor . 
 In his inaugural address , Johnson promised to be " a saving , thrifty , frugal governor " . His policies helped him eliminate the state 's debt of $ 7 million and left the treasury with a surplus of $ 10 million by the end of his term . It was the first time the state had had a surplus since the administration of J. C. W. Beckham in 1903 . Johnson achieved the surplus without enacting any tax increases . Not all in Johnson 's party were happy with his approach to governing ; one critic noted , " Old Keen frugaled here and frugaled there till he damn near frugaled us to death . " 
 Louisville Courier @-@ Journal reporter Howard Henderson wrote several stories exposing corruption in Johnson 's administration , including a significant one dealing with laundry contracts . Hubert Meredith , Johnson 's politically ambitious attorney general , freely aired his concerns about the administration , gaining recognition for himself from the publicity generated . Historian James C. Klotter opined " It is doubtful whether Johnson 's administration had any more political scandal than others , but the publicity made it seem that way . " 
 In the 1940 legislative session , Johnson successfully lobbied the General Assembly to allocate money to a teacher retirement system that had previously been authorized but left unfunded . Despite his fiscally conservative nature , he increased funds to programs to assist the elderly by $ 1 million per year . Other accomplishments of the session included the provision of pensions for justices on the Kentucky Court of Appeals , creation of soil conservation districts in the state , and banning the sale of marijuana . 
 Johnson 's primary interest lay in improving the state 's mental and penal institutions . These improvements began under Governor Chandler , and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were in their best condition in forty years by the end of his term , he was disappointed that he was not able to do more . In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II , he had to curb state construction . 
 In the 1941 legislative session , Johnson vetoed a measure allowing the sale of alcoholic beverages to surrounding states , even those with laws forbidding alcohol sales . The bill was very popular , and was supported by many of the state 's powerful special interests . It had passed the Kentucky House of Representatives by a vote of 84 – 0 and the Kentucky Senate by a vote of 31 – 3 . After Johnson 's veto , the House reversed itself , voting 86 – 3 to sustain the veto . 
 In the 1942 legislative session , Johnson stressed the importance of allowing Kentucky cities to purchase and distribute power from the Tennessee Valley Authority . In an address to the Assembly , Johnson declared , " I have never had a stronger conviction on a question of public policy ... The principle involved is as correct as the Ten Commandments . " The Assembly passed the necessary legislation as Johnson requested . 
 A major accomplishment of the Johnson administration was the passage of a legislative redistricting bill . Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census , Kentucky 's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941 . He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session for the sole purpose of considering a redistricting bill . The legislators obliged , and passed a bill by the end of the special session . 
 Johnson took an active part in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1943 . Among the candidates were Ben Kilgore , Rodes K. Myers , and J. Lyter Donaldson . Myers was Johnson 's lieutenant governor , but he had turned on the administration . Johnson called him a carpetbagger from North Carolina , " a political adventurer " , and " a phony farmer " . He also ridiculed Kilgore , who had strong support from the Louisville Courier @-@ Journal , the Rural Electric Association , and the Farm Bureau , by calling him a " Casanova " . Donaldson , Johnson 's former campaign manager , secured his support and the Democratic nomination . He was defeated in the general election by Republican Simeon Willis . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Beginning in 1940 , Johnson was a member of the State Democratic National Committee , serving until 1948 . On June 6 , 1942 , he was named to the board of regents of Eastern State College ( now Eastern Kentucky University or EKU ) , a position he held for eight years . EKU 's Keen Johnson Building , a 1939 Works Progress Administration project , was named in honor of him . The building and its clock tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks on the university 's campus . 
 On January 1 , 1944 , he was named a special assistant to the president of Reynolds Metals , advising him on postwar unemployment problems . He became vice @-@ president of public relations for the company in 1945 . 
 Johnson developed a strong rapport with union leaders and in 1946 , President Harry S. Truman and Kentucky Senator Alben Barkley asked him to accept an appointment to the newly created post of Undersecretary of Labor . In August 1946 , Johnson took a leave of absence from Reynolds and accepted the appointment . He frequently attended President Truman 's cabinet meetings due to the illness of Secretary Lewis B. Schwellenbach . 
 In mid @-@ 1947 , Johnson returned to Reynolds . In 1950 , he became a member of the company 's board of directors . In this capacity , he organized meetings of sales executives and traveled extensively to promote the company 's aluminum products . He retired from Reynolds in January 1961 . 
 In 1960 , Johnson sought a seat in the U.S. Senate . He defeated John Y. Brown , Sr. in the Democratic primary , but was unable to unseat Republican incumbent John Sherman Cooper in the general election . In 1961 and 1964 , he was appointed to the state board of education . He served as a delegate to an assembly to revise the state constitution in 1964 . In 1965 , the University of Kentucky honored him with a Centennial Award and inducted him into its Hall of Distinguished Alumni . He died February 7 , 1970 in Richmond , Kentucky , and is buried in Richmond Cemetery . 
 = Susanna Clarke = 
 Susanna Mary Clarke ( born 1 November 1959 ) is an English author best known for her debut novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell ( 2004 ) , a Hugo Award @-@ winning alternative history . Clarke began Jonathan Strange in 1993 and worked on it during her spare time . For the next decade , she published short stories from the Strange universe , but it was not until 2003 that Bloomsbury bought her manuscript and began work on its publication . The novel became a best @-@ seller . 
 Two years later , she published a collection of her short stories , The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories ( 2006 ) . Both Clarke 's novel and her short stories are set in a magical England and written in a pastiche of the styles of 19th @-@ century writers such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens . While Strange focuses on the relationship of two men , Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell , the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Clarke was born on 1 November 1959 in Nottingham , England , the eldest daughter of a Methodist minister and his wife . Due to her father 's posts , she spent her childhood in various towns across Northern England and Scotland , and enjoyed reading the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , Charles Dickens , and Jane Austen . She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy , politics , and economics from St Hilda 's College , Oxford in 1981 . 
 For eight years , she worked in publishing at Quarto and Gordon Fraser . She spent two years teaching English as a foreign language in Turin , Italy and Bilbao , Spain . She returned to England in 1992 and spent the rest of that year in County Durham , in a house that looked out over the North Sea . There she began working on her first novel , Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell . In 1993 , she was hired by Simon & Schuster in Cambridge to edit cookbooks , a job she kept for the next ten years . 
 = = = Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell = = = 
 Clarke first developed the idea for Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell while she was teaching in Bilbao : " I had a kind of waking dream ... about a man in 18th @-@ century clothes in a place rather like Venice , talking to some English tourists . And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background – he 'd been dabbling in magic , and something had gone badly wrong . " She had also recently reread J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings and afterward was inspired to " [ try ] writing a novel of magic and fantasy " . 
 After she returned from Spain in 1993 , Clarke began to think seriously about writing her novel . She signed up for a five @-@ day fantasy and science @-@ fiction writing workshop , co @-@ taught by science fiction and fantasy writers Colin Greenland and Geoff Ryman . The students were expected to prepare a short story before attending , but Clarke only had " bundles " of material for her novel . From this she extracted " The Ladies of Grace Adieu " , a fairy tale about three women secretly practising magic who are discovered by the famous Jonathan Strange . Greenland was so impressed with the story that , without Clarke 's knowledge , he sent an excerpt to his friend , the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman . Gaiman later said , " It was terrifying from my point of view to read this first short story that had so much assurance ... It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata . " Gaiman showed the story to his friend , science @-@ fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden . Clarke learned of these events when Nielsen Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology Starlight 1 ( 1996 ) , which featured pieces by well @-@ regarded science @-@ fiction and fantasy writers . She accepted , and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997 . 
 Clarke spent the next ten years working on the novel in her spare time . She also published stories in Starlight 2 ( 1998 ) and Starlight 3 ( 2001 ) ; according to the New York Times Magazine , her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet . Overall , she published seven short stories in anthologies . " Mr Simonelli , or The Fairy Widower " was shortlisted for a World Fantasy Award in 2001 . 
 Clarke was never sure if she would finish her novel or if it would be published . Clarke tried to write for three hours each day , beginning at 5 : 30 am , but struggled to keep this schedule . Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end , she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together . Clarke , admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader , " clung to this method " " because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning , [ the novel ] would lack depth , and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do . But if I had known it was going to take me ten years , I would never have begun . I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year , or the year after next . " Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together . 
 Around 2001 , Clarke " had begun to despair " , and started looking for someone to help her finish and sell the book . Giles Gordon became her first literary agent and sold the unfinished manuscript to Bloomsbury in early 2003 , after two publishers rejected it as unmarketable . Bloomsbury were so sure the novel would be a success that they offered Clarke a £ 1 million advance . They printed 250 @,@ 000 hardcover copies simultaneously in the United States , Britain , and Germany . Seventeen translations were begun before the first English publication was released on 8 September 2004 in the United States and on 30 September in the United Kingdom . 
 Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is an alternative history set in 19th @-@ century England during the Napoleonic Wars . It is based on the premise that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men : Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange . Centring on the relationship between these two men , the novel investigates the nature of " Englishness " and the boundary between reason and madness . It has been described as a fantasy novel , an alternative history , and an historical novel and draws on various Romantic literary traditions , such as the comedy of manners , the Gothic tale , and the Byronic hero . Clarke 's style has frequently been described as a pastiche , particularly of 19th @-@ century British writers such as Charles Dickens , Jane Austen , and George Meredith . The supernatural is contrasted with and highlighted by mundane details and Clarke 's tone combines arch wit with antiquarian quaintness . The text is supplemented with almost 200 footnotes , outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship . The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the New York Times best @-@ seller list , remaining on the list for eleven weeks . 
 = = = The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories = = = 
 In 2006 , Clarke published a collection of eight fairy tales presented as the work of several different writers , seven of which had been previously anthologised . The volume 's focus on " female mastery of the dark arts " is reflected in the ladies of Grace Adieu 's magical abilities and the prominent role needlework plays in saving the Duke of Wellington and Mary , Queen of Scots . The collection is a " sly , frequently comical , feminist revision " of Jonathan Strange . In tone , the stories are similar to the novel — " nearly every one of them is told in a lucid , frequently deadpan , bedtime @-@ story voice strikingly similar to the voice that narrates the novel . " 
 The title story , " The Ladies of Grace Adieu " , is set in early 19th century Gloucestershire and concerns the friendship of three young women , Cassandra <unk> , Miss Tobias , and Mrs. Fields . Though the events of the story do not actually appear in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell , they are referenced in a footnote in Chapter 43 . Clarke has said , " For a long time it was my hope that these three ladies should eventually find a place in ... the novel ... I decided there was no place for them ... I deliberately kept women to the domestic sphere in the interests of authenticity ... it was important that real and alternate history appeared to have converged . This meant that I needed to write the women and the servants , as far as possible , as they would have been written in a 19th @-@ century novel . " Reviewers highlighted this tale , one calling it " the most striking story " of the collection and " a staunchly feminist take on power relations " . In her review of the volume in Strange Horizons , Victoria Hoyle writes that " there is something incredibly precise , clean , and cold about Clarke 's portrayal of ' women 's magic ' in this story ( and throughout the collection ) — it is urgent and desperate , but it is also natural and in the course of things . " 
 The collection received many positive reviews , though some critics compared the short stories unfavourably with the highly acclaimed and more substantial Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell . Hoyle wrote in her review that " the stories ... are consistently subtle and enchanting , and as charismatic as any reader could wish , but , while the collection has the panache of the novel , it lacks its glorious self @-@ possession . "

 Clarke currently resides in Cambridge with her partner , the science fiction novelist and reviewer Colin Greenland . She was , in 2004 , working on a book that begins a few years after Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell ends and which will centre around characters who , as Clarke says , are " a bit lower down the social scale " . She commented in 2005 that progress on the book had been slowed by her ill health .

 = Honky Tonk Heroes = 
 Honky Tonk Heroes is a country music album by Waylon Jennings , released in 1973 on RCA Victor . With the exception of " We Had It All " , all of the songs on the album were written or co @-@ written by Billy Joe Shaver . The album is considered an important piece in the development of the outlaw subgenre in country music as it helped revive the honky tonk music of Nashville by injecting a rock and roll attitude . 
 = = Background = = 
 Jennings and manager Neil Reshen had renegotiated the singer 's contract with RCA Records in 1972 , which gave him creative control over his work . By 1973 , Atlantic Records was attempting to sign Jennings who , with fellow country singer Willie Nelson , had become dissatisfied with RCA because of the company 's conservative influence upon their music . Nelson , who had signed with Atlantic , was becoming more popular , and this persuaded RCA to renegotiate with Jennings before it lost another potential success . Jennings ' music had already evolved from his early recordings with the label , especially on his previous three LPs Good Hearted Woman ( 1972 ) , Ladies Love Outlaws ( 1972 ) , and especially Lonesome , On 'ry and Mean ( 1973 ) . This evolution was spurred by the singer trying to capture the dynamics of his live sound on record ( often by using his backing band the Waylors rather than studio musicians ) and his choice of material , which often included songs composed by writers outside the Nashville mainstream . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 Jennings had invited the then unknown Billy Joe Shaver to Nashville to write the songs for his next album after hearing him sing " Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me " just before the 1972 Dripping Springs Reunion . When Shaver got to Nashville he spent six months unsuccessfully trying to speak with Jennings , who had apparently forgotten the invite ; eventually , with the help of local D.J. Roger " Captain Midnight " Schutt , Shaver turned up at a RCA recording session Jennings was doing with producer Chet Atkins , and tried to confront the singer , who merely offered Shaver $ 100 . Shaver refused the money and told Jennings that he was willing to fight him if he would not listen to his songs . In the 2003 documentary Beyond Nashville , Shaver recalls : 
 " Finally I caught him in Studio A of RCA . He came out of the control booth and he had a couple of bikers - bikers hung around with him a lot , some pretty tough looking customers - and I 'd had enough . I just said , ' Hey Waylon ! ' And he turned . I said , ' I got these songs that you claimed you was gonna listen to , and if you don 't listen to ' em I 'm gonna whip your ass right here in front of everybody . ' And boy , <unk> . Man ! Everything got quiet and them old boys started <unk> ' and Waylon stopped ' em . He said , ' Hoss , you don 't know how close you come to gettin ' killed . ' I said , ' Well , I 've had enough . You done told me you was gonna do this . Now I 'm full of songs and I want you to listen to ' em . " 
 Jennings offered to record " Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me " and told Shaver to sing another song – if Jennings liked it he would record it and Shaver could sing another ; but if he did not like it , Shaver would have to leave . Shaver sang " Ain 't No God in Mexico " , followed by " Honky Tonk Heroes " and " Old Five and <unk> and Me " . Jennings was so taken with Shaver 's tunes that he decided he would record an album consisting solely of Texan 's songs . RCA producer Chet Atkins was reluctant to record the material of an unknown writer , but since he had creative control , Jennings decided to record the album anyway , although the executives of RCA Records delayed its release . Jennings was also spending more of his time at Tompall Glaser 's " Hillbilly Central " studio at 916 Nineteenth Avenue South in Nashville , attracted by the laid back , communal atmosphere that was the antitheses of the traditional setup that Jennings had endured at RCA since 1966 . Jennings brought Glaser back with him to RCA Victor Studios to co @-@ produce Honky Tonk Heroes . " Tompall and I were best friends , " Jennings reminisced in the audio version of his autobiography Waylon . " We met at about the time he broke up with his brothers , and I kind of took their place in his life . " Jennings and Shaver worked on the songs for several weeks , with Shaver believing that Jennings was not closely following the phrasing of the tunes , and in some cases he played the songs repeatedly so that Jennings would understand them . The title cut was especially problematic , with Jennings and Shaver - both temperamental personalities - clashing over the arrangement . In Michael <unk> 's book Outlaw : Waylon , Willie , Kris , and the Renegades of Nashville , Jennings drummer Richie Albright recalls : 
 " We were doing the album and Billy Joe was around , and we began ' Honky Tonk Heroes , ' so we cut the first part of the song and we stopped , and Waylon said , ' This is the way we 're going to do it . ' And Billy Joe had been sitting in the back and he come walking up , saying , ' What are you doing ? You 're fucking up my song . That ain 't the way it goes . ' Pretty soon Waylon and Billy Joe are just <unk> at one another . Billy Joe didn 't understand the way we were putting it together ... then we put it together and he said , ' Yeah . That 's good . That 's the way it goes . ' " 
 The album that resulted is what many call the outlaw movement 's first true record and Jennings ' artistic zenith . Almost all of the songs on Honky Tonk Heroes contain a defiant , restless longing for and celebration of the road ( " Moving is the closest thing to being free ... " ) and a rock and roll swagger that was entirely new in Nashville circles . Although concept albums were not new in country music , with stars like Johnny Cash , Marty Robbins , and Porter Wagoner all having recorded LPs with unifying themes , Honky Tonk Heroes offered a more progressive take on the enterprise , resembling the albums Mickey Newbury had recently recorded and the blockbuster Red Headed Stranger album that Willie Nelson would release two years later . In addition to Shaver 's brooding compositions , Jennings rounded out the collection with the tender ballad " We Had It All , " written by Kris Kristofferson keyboardist " Funky " Donnie Fritts . According to Michael <unk> 's book Outlaw , RCA had asked Waylon to tack on one more song to augment the Shaver songs , in hopes of landing a hit single , and after considering Steve Young 's " Seven Bridges Road , " Jimmie Rodgers ' " T for Texas , " and Shel Silverstein 's " The Leaving Coming On , " Jennings opted for the Fritts tune , which would go on to be recorded and performed by Rod Stewart , Ray Charles , Bob Dylan , the Rolling Stones . Released as a single , " We Had it All " , peaked at number 28 in Billboard 's Country Singles . Jennings and Shaver also collaborated on the hit single " You Asked Me To , " which spent fifteen weeks on the Billboard country singles charts , reaching a peak of number eight . In the liner notes to The Essential Waylon Jennings , Wade Jessen quotes the singer : " We wrote this one night in the dark over at Bobby Bare 's office across the street from a Burger Boy where we 'd been playing pinball . Shaver said , ' I 've got it started . Let 's finish it . ' We wrote it pretty well in the dark . " Shaver recorded his own version in 1977 for the album Gypsy Boy , with special guest Willie Nelson on guitar and vocals . " You Asked Me To " also appeared as the closing song on Elvis Presley 's 1975 album Promised Land . 
 Two songs , " Low Down Freedom " and " Black Rose , " were produced by Ronny Light . " We Had It All " was produced by Jennings and Ken Mansfield . Like the music within , the album cover was also at odds with the elaborate , often overwrought cover designs from Music Row , featuring an unpretentious shot of a smiling Jennings and his unkempt friends sat around a studio laughing and drinking . In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh , Shaver said of the LP , " Oh , it was great , because the songs were bigger than me . And I couldn 't possibly sing as good as Waylon . And at the time , Waylon was just great , so great , and I knew something was gonna happen good for him , and sure enough it helped me and it helped him , too , and that 's a pretty good trade . " 
 = = Release and critical reception = = 
 Initially , the executives of RCA Records , and Chet Atkins , tried to avoid releasing the album , which finally came out in May 1973 . It got a mixed reception from critics , although it is now regarded as one of the most important albums in the history of country music and is listed in Robert Dimery 's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die . It reached # 14 in Billboard 's Top Country Albums and # 185 in the Billboard 200 @.@ while " You Ask Me To " peaked at number 8 . It received praise from magazines that did not often cover country music , like counterculture bible Rolling Stone , which raved , " After many years of overproduction on record , Waylon Jennings ' new album offers an opportunity to hear the crisp , robust no @-@ nonsense sound which has been his trademark since his early days with Buddy Holly 's Crickets . " The Music Journal described the album as " certainly brash , lively and down @-@ to @-@ earth . Thoroughly infectious too . " Regarding the composition of the songs , Stereo Review wrote : " Billy Joe Shaver songs have [ Jennings ] in a corral if not in a box ... This is like picking Kris Kristofferson up by the literary ankles , shaking him vigorously , and using every damn nugget that tumbles out . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Honky Tonk Heroes helped add to the outlaw image of Jennings , and the album is considered an important piece in the development of the outlaw subgenre in country music . Shaver , who is regarded as helping push forward outlaw country , feels that the album was " the touchstone of the Outlaw movement " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine in a retrospective review in Allmusic felt that Jennings had been looking for a musical approach which had roots in country and rock , and Shaver 's songs – " sketching an outlaw stance with near defiance and borrowing rock attitude to create the hardest country tunes imaginable " – provided that common ground . Erlewine believed that the album arrived at the right moment to revive the honky tonk music of Nashville by injecting a rock and roll attitude that would produce outlaw country . Kenneth Burns , in Robert Dimery 's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die , says that Honky Tonk Heroes is " one of country music 's landmark albums " , and points out Jennings ' rock and roll roots as bass player for Buddy Holly . In 2013 author Michael <unk> wrote , " The album christened country music 's outlaw era ... and bathed in risk , having gambled on the work of an untested songwriter . "

 = Alex + Ada = 
 Alex + Ada is an American comic book series created by Jonathan Luna and Sarah Vaughn . The duo began work on the series in January 2013 , before publishing 15 issues through Image Comics between November 2013 and June 2015 . The series has since been collected into three trade paperbacks . 
 Alex + Ada centers upon the relationship between a lonely man and an intelligent android . The series received positive reviews from critics who compared it to other popular science fiction stories , although Luna 's artwork was sometimes criticized for being simplistic .

 = = = Development = = = 
 Jonathan Luna had previously created comics with his brother Joshua , but was exhausted after six straight years of work . Inspired by a TED Talk , he decided to take a break from working . During his two years away from comics , he painted Star Bright and the Looking Glass , a fairy tale picture book that was proofread by his friend Sarah Vaughn and published in 2012 . 
 While working on the picture book , Luna realized he missed telling a story panel by panel and decided to return to comics . He and his brother had decided to work on separate projects , so Luna pitched the idea of a young man who falls in love with a female android to Vaughn over dinner . Vaughn , who began writing and drawing romance comics in her youth , jumped at the opportunity . 
 After initializing the concept in January 2013 , the two discussed the project for three or four months before creating an outline for the whole story . The original outline was for 12 issues , but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed . They looked at past and present rights movements for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights . Luna wrote the first draft of issue one , then the two worked together to rewrite it . 
 Luna began drawing around April . Alex + Ada is the first comic Luna drew completely digitally . Because Luna needed to focus on art , Vaughn wrote the first draft of the remaining issues . She and Luna would discuss the draft , then she would rewrite it . 
 = = = Publication = = = 
 The first issue of Alex + Ada was released November 6 , 2013 , and was Vaughn 's first published comic work . It was the 141st best selling issue of the month with estimated sales around 15 @,@ 000 , which was more than any book Luna had done previously . During the course of publication , the series length was increased from 12 issues to 15 issues . Each issue was released approximately six weeks apart , with the final issue available June 18 , 2015 . Issue 15 was the 206th best selling issue of the month with estimated orders around 8 @,@ 250 . The series has been collected into three trade paperbacks , each containing five issues .

 Alex is a young man who is depressed after his fiancée breaks up with him . Tired of seeing him unhappy , Alex 's grandmother sends him Ada , a Tanaka X @-@ 5 android which is capable of intelligent human interaction . The robot is initially incapable of self @-@ awareness , as each android has a program that blocks any potential free thought or consciousness . 
 Alex decides to remove this program and grant Ada her own mental freedom , as he is uninterested in a partner who cannot truly interact with him . Because removing the program is illegal and carries harsh consequences for both Ada and Alex , they have to pretend Ada is not self @-@ aware . When a jealous love @-@ interest of Alex reports Ada as sentient to the FBI , Alex and Ada attempt to flee the country . When they are intercepted by the FBI , Ada gets shot by the police and Alex is arrested . He is convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison , but Ada is not found to be sentient . 
 During his time in prison , rights are granted to sentient robots . On Alex 's release , Ada is returned to him . She appears to be non @-@ sentient , but Alex discovers she locked her consciousness to protect him . He restores her freedom and is re @-@ united with her . 
 = = Reception = = 
 According to review aggregator Comic Book Round Up , critics gave the first issue an average 8 @.@ 0 / 10 and the series as a whole 8 @.@ 5 / 10 . During its publication , Alex + Ada appeared on many " best of " lists created by comic news websites . 
 Reviewing for Bleeding Cool , Zac Thompson and David Dissanayake made favorable comparisons to the 1982 film Blade Runner and the 2013 film Her . Dissanayake also noted the entertaining realism , as it " feels like our world , full of technologies that ... will [ exist ] very soon . " Comic Book Resources ' Sonia Harris also praised the series for its realism , writing the " metaphor of artificially intelligent beings living out their secret lives , unsafe and insecure , yet potentially stronger and smarter than humans is potent . " Dean Stell , a reviewer for Weekly Comic Book Review , said Luna and Vaughn created " a wonderful and classically @-@ themed science @-@ fiction story . " Writing for Bloody Disgusting , Lonnie Nadler said Luna 's work on facial expressions was the " major highlight " of his illustrations . 
 Luna 's simplistic artwork is a frequent point of criticism among reviewers , although some call it appropriate for the setting . In addition to Luna 's " painfully plain " illustrations , Newsarama 's David <unk> also criticized the story 's pace . 
 = Malcolm Mercer = 
 Major @-@ General Malcolm Smith Mercer , CB ( 17 September 1859 – 3 June 1916 ) was a Canadian general , barrister and art patron who practiced law in Toronto and led the 3rd Canadian Division during the first two years of the First World War before he was killed in action at Mount Sorrel in Belgium . Mercer was an experienced militia commander and had demonstrated a great flair with training and organising the raw Canadian recruits during the opening months of the war . He also demonstrated courage under fire , visiting the front lines on numerous occasions at the height of battle and personally directing his forces in the face of poison gas attacks and heavy shellfire . 
 Mercer remains the most senior Canadian officer ever to die in combat and was unfortunate to be killed at the opening engagement of the largest battle of his career , when he was trapped by shellfire during a front line reconnaissance and overrun during the subsequent German attack . The division Mercer created and trained remained one of the best units of the Canadian army under his successor Louis Lipsett and Mercer was remembered by the men under his command , many of whom attended his funeral in the aftermath of the Battle of Mount Sorrel . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Mercer was born in September 1859 in Etobicoke , a small town to the west of Toronto in Ontario , Canada . He was the third of nine children to Thomas and Mary Mercer and was raised in Delmer and St Catharines . During his childhood he was educated at local schools and worked on the family farm before enrolling at the University of Toronto in 1881 to study philosophy . He graduated in 1885 and turned his attention to law , being called to the bar three years later . He established a practice in Toronto and had several partners , forming a highly successful but discreet firm which he managed until 1914 . Mercer never married or had children and reportedly he was " quiet and unobtrusive . He avoided publicity , moved little in society and in his legal practice preferred to keep his clients out of court , if he could . " 
 During his years in the law , Mercer used his substantial income to support the arts and amassed a large art collection including many pieces by Carl Ahrens , of whom Mercer was a close friend and admirer . This art collection was auctioned off in 1925 and was found to contain a selection of art , porcelain , sculpture and antique furniture from around the globe . Mercer was also a keen amateur painter himself and was also an excellent sportsman who represented Canada and the Canadian Army in shooting contests both at home and in Britain . 
 = = Military service = = 
 Mercer 's greatest passion however was reserved for the Canadian militia , which he joined as a student in 1881 . Posted to The Queen 's Own Rifles of Canada as a private soldier , Mercer devoted much time and energy to the unit and became an excellent soldier and first @-@ rate shot . Mercer rose steadily through the ranks of the militia , being made an officer in 1885 and a captain in 1891 . In 1903 as a brevet major , Mercer led a company to Sault Ste . Marie to calm a riot by striking dock workers , his only deployment before 1914 . In 1911 , Mercer was promoted to Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Commandant of the regiment and in 1913 , Mercer was aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Defence Minister Sam Hughes during a military tour of Europe , during which he inspected the German army first @-@ hand and became convinced that war was imminent . 
 = = = Outbreak of World War = = = 
 At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 , Mercer was amongst those immediately called upon by Hughes to establish and build a Canadian Expeditionary Force . Ordered to take his regiment to Camp Valcartier near Quebec City at 12 @.@ 30 on the 4 August , Mercer worked in his law office until 12 @.@ 00 before arriving on time at the barracks in uniform . Within days he had been promoted to Temporary Brigadier @-@ General in command of the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade which consisted of the first four battalions of the Expeditionary Force recruited in Ontario . Amongst these men his militiamen were dispersed , intended to spread experience and morale amongst the raw recruits . At the end of September , after just under two months training , the brigade departed on the 20 @-@ day sea voyage to Britain as the first installment of the Canadian Expeditionary Force . 
 On arrival at Plymouth a British officer took overall command of the " Canadian Contingent " as the Expeditionary Force was then known and Mercer was despatched to Camp Bustard on Salisbury Plain , where he oversaw the training and organising of the Canadian Force to ready it for fighting in Belgium and Northern France . Mercer performed well at this task and an inspection of his camp on the 4 November by King George V , Queen Mary , Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener drew the compliment " No finer physique in the British Army . A fine brigade . Splendid . " Mercer 's fellow brigadiers in the Expeditionary force , Richard Turner , VC and Arthur Currie commanded similar training camps and together the officers prepared their men for departure to France on 9 February 1915 . 
 = = = Second battle of Ypres = = = 
 Dispatched for the Western Front , the Canadian Contingent was initially deployed near the Belgian town of Ypres where on the 22 April Mercer 's men became embroiled in the Second Battle of Ypres . A German attack on French lines had caused massive casualties through the use of poison gas and Mercer 's brigade was fed piecemeal into the battle as reinforcements by poorly coordinated staff officers . In a confused and bloody encounter the untested Canadian forces held back the Germans despite being forced to wrap urine @-@ soaked cloths around their faces to counteract the chlorine gas . The next day , Mercer 's men were directed to attack an escarpment named Mauser Ridge , an operation which failed because French troops ordered to support the Canadian line did not arrive . Mercer himself travelled to the front line to witness the battle and came under fire for the first time before retiring in order to remonstrate with the French officers intended to support him . The Canadian Contingent took very heavy casualties in the battle and subsequently all three Canadian brigadiers were made Companions of the Order of the Bath for their courage and generalship in the action . 
 During the year the Canadian Contingent was involved in further fighting , assaulting German lines in the unsuccessful battles of Festubert and Givenchy . In the aftermath of these engagements , the Canadian Contingent was reorganised into the Canadian Corps , consisting of two divisions led by Turner and Currie who were under the overall command of British Lieutenant @-@ General Edwin Alderson . Mercer was detached from his Brigade and placed in charge of coordinating the mass of small and independent Canadian units which were steadily arriving from Canada . During the autumn of 1915 Mercer was able to shape this force ( which included dismounted cavalry regiments and British Indian artillery ) into an effective infantry unit and in January 1916 he was confirmed as Major @-@ General in command of the 3rd Canadian Division , as this disparate force became . 
 = = = Death at Mount Sorrel = = = 
 In early June 1916 , the Canadian Corps was again posted to trenches around the Belgian town of Ypres . The new commander of the Canadian Corps , Julian Byng , was inspecting the Corps positions in front of a German @-@ held rise named Mount Sorrel and noted that the Canadian troops were overlooked by German positions and under constant danger of enemy fire . The Germans also seemed to be digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended . Byng ordered Mercer to make a reconnaissance of the front line and draw up a plan to overrun the more dangerous German positions in a local attack . Mercer complied on the 2 June , conducting a standard inspection of front line Canadian trenches at 08 : 30 . 
 Shortly after Mercer had arrived in the trenches , a massive German artillery bombardment began , heavy calibre shells destroying trenches and caving in dugouts , killing many Canadian soldiers . Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned by a huge shell burst which wounded most of his staff and the officers of the battalion he was inspecting . The more badly wounded among the officers were transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham , and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large @-@ scale German attack . In the confused situation , Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire , where Mercer 's leg was broken by a bullet . 
 Mercer and Gooderham sheltered from the continued artillery bombardment in a battered trench , both suffering from the effects of their wounds , until 01 : 00 on the 3 June . By this stage of the battle an artillery duel had begun between the armies who were still mixed together , Mercer and Gooderham trapped in between . At approximately 02 : 00 a shrapnel shell exploded in the trench in which they were hiding , further wounding Gooderham and killing Mercer instantly with shrapnel wounds to the heart . Gooderham stayed with his commanding officer 's body until captured by advancing German troops who buried the general 's corpse in a shallow grave at Gooderham 's request . The buried field hospital was also captured by the advancing Germans and as a result nobody who knew of the general 's whereabouts on the day returned to Allied lines . A staff officer later claimed that the shell which killed Mercer was British in origin , although it is unclear how this conclusion was reached . 
 Believing Mercer to have been captured , General Currie assumed command of the battle and with the use of saturation bombardment was able to retake the lost trenches and drive the Germans back to Mount Sorrel despite heavy casualties . On the 21 June a Canadian burial party found 30 bodies in a sector of trench , amongst them General Mercer 's remains , only recognisable by his uniform decoration . Mercer was buried in a military grave at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery , later surmounted with a Commonwealth War Grave headstone . Mercer 's funeral was attended by many men of his Division and from his old regiments as well as numerous Canadian and British officers who had worked alongside him . Mercer was posthumously mentioned in dispatches for his courage under fire , the third time he had been so mentioned , and his division was taken over by Major @-@ General Louis Lipsett who was himself killed in action two years later . Mercer is remembered as an efficient and capable organiser who never got the opportunity to demonstrate the tactical nous he had shown in training and exercises . He also remains the highest ranking Canadian officer to ever be killed in combat . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 General Mercer Public School in Toronto , originally built in 1923 , was named after Mercer . 
 Malcolm Mercer was also an active Freemason . Following the Armistice with Germany in 1918 steps were taken to create new Masonic Lodges in Toronto to accommodate returning soldiers looking to join Freemasonry , including a new Lodge in the West Toronto Junction neighbourhood of Toronto , which was instituted in 1919 and named The General Mercer Lodge in honour of Malcolm Mercer . The General Mercer Lodge remains active to this day , meeting at the same Masonic Temple in West Toronto where Mercer attended Lodge prior to the war . 
 = Mount Cayley volcanic field = 
 The Mount Cayley volcanic field is a remote volcanic zone on the South Coast of British Columbia , Canada , stretching 31 km ( 19 mi ) from the Pemberton Icefield to the Squamish River . It forms a segment of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt , the Canadian portion of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , which extends from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia . Most of the Cayley volcanoes were formed during periods of volcanism under sheets of glacial ice throughout the last glacial period . These subglacial eruptions formed steep , flat @-@ topped volcanoes and subglacial lava domes , most of which have been entirely exposed by deglaciation . However , at least two volcanoes predate the last glacial period and both are highly eroded . The field gets its name from Mount Cayley , the largest and most persistent volcano , located at the southern end of the Powder Mountain Icefield . This icefield covers much of the central portion of the volcanic field and is one of the several glacial fields in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains . 
 Eruptions along the length of the field began between 1 @.@ 6 and 5 @.@ 3 million years ago . At least 23 eruptions have occurred throughout its eruptive history . This volcanic activity ranged from effusive to explosive , with magma compositions ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic . Because the Mount Cayley volcanic field has a high elevation and consists of a cluster of mostly high altitude , non @-@ overlapping volcanoes , subglacial activity is likely to have occurred under less than 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) of glacial ice . The style of this glaciation promoted meltwater escape during eruptions . The steep profile of the volcanic field and its subglacial landforms support this hypothesis . As a result , volcanic features in the field that interacted with glacial ice lack rocks that display evidence of abundant water during eruption , such as hyaloclastite and pillow lava . 
 Of the entire volcanic field , the southern portion has the most known volcanoes . Here , at least 11 of them are situated on top of a long narrow mountain ridge and in adjacent river valleys . The central portion contains at least five volcanoes situated at the Powder Mountain Icefield . To the north , two volcanoes form a sparse area of volcanism . Many of these volcanoes were formed between 0 @.@ 01 and 1 @.@ 6 million years ago , some of which show evidence of volcanic activity in the past 10 @,@ 000 years . 
 = = Geology = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 The Mount Cayley volcanic field formed as a result of the ongoing subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone along the British Columbia Coast . This is a 1 @,@ 094 km ( 680 mi ) long fault zone running 80 km ( 50 mi ) off the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia . The plates move at a relative rate of over 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) per year at an oblique angle to the subduction zone . Because of the very large fault area , the Cascadia subduction zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7 @.@ 0 or greater . The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500 years . During these periods , stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin . When the plate finally slips , the 500 years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake . 
 Unlike most subduction zones worldwide , there is no deep oceanic trench present along the continental margin in Cascadia . The reason is that the mouth of the Columbia River empties directly into the subduction zone and deposits silt at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean , burying this large depression . Massive floods from prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula during the Late Pleistocene also deposited large amounts of sediment into the trench . However , in common with other subduction zones , the outer margin is slowly being compressed , similar to a giant spring . When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals , the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes , such as the magnitude 9 @.@ 0 Cascadia earthquake on January 26 , 1700 . However , earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone are less common than expected and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years . The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates . These two tectonic plates currently converge 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) to 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) per year . This is only about half the rate of convergence from seven million years ago . 
 Scientists have estimated that there have been at least 13 significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the past 6 @,@ 000 years . The most recent , the 1700 Cascadia earthquake , was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island . It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean . The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides . Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand , and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened . The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at <unk> Bay , killing all the people that lived there . The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near @-@ shore subsidence , submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris . 
 = = = Subglacial volcanoes = = = 
 Lying in the middle of the Mount Cayley volcanic field is a subglacial volcano named Slag Hill . At least two geological units compose the edifice . Slag Hill proper consists of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic rock . Lying on the western portion of Slag Hill is a lava flow that likely erupted less than 10 @,@ 000 years ago due to the lack of features indicating volcano @-@ ice interactions . The Slag Hill flow @-@ dominated tuya 900 m ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) northeast of Slag Hill proper consists of a flat @-@ topped , steep @-@ sided pile of andesite . It protrudes through remnants of volcanic material erupted from Slag Hill proper , but it represents a separate volcanic vent due to its geographical appearance . This small subglacial volcano possibly formed between 25 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago throughout the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation . 
 Cauldron Dome , a subglacial volcano north of Mount Cayley , lies west of the Powder Mountain Icefield . Like Slag Hill , it is composed of two geological units . Upper Cauldron Dome is a flat @-@ topped , oval @-@ shaped pile of at least five andesite lava flows that resembles a tuya . The five andesite flows are columnar jointed and were likely extruded through glacial ice . The latest volcanic activity might have occurred between 10 @,@ 000 and 25 @,@ 000 years ago when this area was still influenced by glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation . Lower Cauldron Dome , the youngest unit comprising the entire Cauldron Dome subglacial volcano , consists of a flat @-@ topped , steep @-@ sided pile of andesite lava flows 1 @,@ 800 m ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) long and a maximum thickness of 220 m ( 720 ft ) . These volcanics were extruded about 10 @,@ 000 years ago during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation from a vent adjacent to upper Cauldron Dome that is currently buried under glacial ice . 
 Ring Mountain , a flow @-@ dominated tuya lying at the northern portion of the Mount Cayley volcanic field , consists of a pile of at least five andesite lava flows lying on a mountain ridge . Its steep @-@ sided flanks reach heights of 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) and are composed of volcanic rubble . This makes it impossible to measure its exact base elevation or how many lava flows constitute the edifice . With a summit elevation of 2 @,@ 192 m ( 7 @,@ 192 ft ) , Ring Mountain had its last volcanic activity between 25 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago when the Fraser Glaciation was close to its maximum . Northwest of Ring Mountain lies a minor andesite lava flow . Its chemistry is somewhat unlike other andesite flows comprising Ring Mountain , but it probably erupted from a volcanic vent adjacent to or at Ring Mountain . The part of it that lies higher in elevation contains some features that indicate lava @-@ ice interactions , while the lower @-@ elevation portion of it does not . Therefore , this minor lava flow was likely extruded after Ring Mountain formed but when glacial ice covered a broader area than it does to this day , and that the lava flowed beyond the region in which glacial ice existed at that time . 
 To the north lies Little Ring Mountain , another flow @-@ dominated tuya lying at the northern portion of the Mount Cayley volcanic field . It consists of a pile of at least three andesite lava flows lying on a mountain ridge . Its steep @-@ sided flanks reach heights of 240 m ( 790 ft ) and are composed of volcanic rubble . This makes it impossible to measure its exact base elevation or how many lava flows comprise the edifice . With a summit elevation of 2 @,@ 147 m ( 7 @,@ 044 ft ) , Little Ring Mountain had its last volcanic activity between 25 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago when the Fraser Glaciation was close to its maximum . 
 Ember Ridge , a mountain ridge between Tricouni Peak and Mount Fee , consists of at least eight lava domes composed of andesite . They were likely formed between 25 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago when lava erupted beneath glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation . Their current structures are comparable to their original forms due to the minimal degree of erosion . As a result , the domes display the shapes and columnar joints typical of subglacial volcanoes . The random shapes of the Ember Ridge domes are the result of erupted lava taking advantage of former ice pockets , eruptions taking place on uneven surfaces , subsidence of the domes during volcanic activity to create rubble and separation of older columnar units during more recent eruptions . The northern dome , known as Ember Ridge North , covers the summit and eastern flank of the mountain ridge . It comprises at least one lava flow that reaches a thickness of 100 m ( 330 ft ) , as well as the thinnest columnar units in the Mount Cayley volcanic field . The small size of the columnar joints indicates that the erupted lava was cooled immediately and are mainly located on the dome 's summit . Ember Ridge Northeast , the smallest subglacial dome of Ember Ridge , comprises one lava flow that has a thickness no more than 40 m ( 130 ft ) . Ember Ridge Northwest , the most roughly circular subglacial dome , comprises at least one lava flow . Ember Ridge Southeast is the most complex of the Ember Ridge domes , consisting of a series of lava flows with a thickness of 60 m ( 200 ft ) . It is also the only Ember Ridge dome that contains large amounts of rubble . Ember Ridge Southwest comprises at least one lava flow that reaches a thickness of 80 m ( 260 ft ) . It is the only subglacial dome of Ember Ridge that contains hyaloclastite . Ember Ridge West comprises only one lava flow that reaches a thickness of 60 m ( 200 ft ) . 
 Mount Brew , 18 km ( 11 mi ) southwest of the resort town of Whistler , is a 1 @,@ 757 m ( 5 @,@ 764 ft ) high lava dome composed of andesite or dacite that probably formed <unk> between 25 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago . It contains two masses of rock that might resemble ice @-@ marginal lava flows . These edifices have not been studied in detail but they could have formed during the same period as the Ember Ridge subglacial domes due to their structures , columnar joints and compositions . 
 = = = Eroded edifices = = = 
 The Mount Cayley massif , 2 @,@ 385 m ( 7 @,@ 825 ft ) in elevation , is the largest and most persistent volcano in the Mount Cayley volcanic field . It is a highly eroded stratovolcano composed of dacite and rhyodacite lava that was deposited during three phases of volcanic activity . The first eruptive phase started about four million years ago with the eruption of dacite lava flows and pyroclastic rock . This resulted in the creation of the Mount Cayley proper . Subsequent volcanism during this volcanic phase constructed a significant lava dome . This acts like a volcanic plug and composes the lava spines that currently form pinnacles on Cayley 's rugged summit . After the Mount Cayley proper was constructed , lava flows , tephra and welded dacite rubble was erupted . This second phase of activity 2 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 7 million years ago resulted in the creation of the Vulcan 's Thumb , a craggy volcanic ridge on the southern flank of the Mount Cayley proper . Lengthy dissection from an extended period of erosion demolished much of the original stratovolcano . Volcanic activity after this prolonged period of erosion produced thick dacite lava flows from parasitic vents 300 @,@ 000 years ago that extended into the <unk> and <unk> Creek valleys near the Squamish River . This subsequently created two minor parasitic lava domes 200 @,@ 000 years ago . These three volcanic events in contrast to several others around Cayley in that they do not show signs of interaction with glacial ice . 
 Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee , an extensively eroded volcano containing a north @-@ south trending ridge . It has an elevation of 2 @,@ 162 m ( 7 @,@ 093 ft ) and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field . Its volcanics are undated , but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75 @,@ 000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation . Therefore , volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice . The remaining products from Fee 's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock . This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee 's eruptive history , as well as its first volcanic event . The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge . These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano . Following extensive dissection , renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow , flat @-@ topped , steep @-@ sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge . The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee 's earlier volcanic events . This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion , and likely one or more glacial periods . Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north @-@ south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark . 
 Pali Dome , located north and northeast of Mount Cayley , is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field . Like Cauldron Dome , it consists of two geological units . Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material . It lies on the eastern portion of the Powder Mountain Icefield . Much of the lava flows form gentle topography at high elevations but terminate in finely jointed vertical cliffs at low elevations . The first volcanic activity likely occurred about 25 @,@ 000 years ago , but it could also be significantly older . The most recent volcanic activity produced a series of lava flows that were erupted when the vent area was not covered by glacial ice . However , the flows show evidence of interaction with glacial ice in their lower units . This indicates that the lavas were erupted about 10 @,@ 000 years ago during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation . The ice @-@ marginal lava flows reach thicknesses of up to 100 m ( 330 ft ) . Pali Dome West consists of at least three andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material ; its vent is presently buried under glacial ice . At least three eruptions have occurred at Pali Dome East . The age of the first volcanic eruption is unknown , but it could have occurred in the past 10 @,@ 000 years . The second eruption produced a lava flow that was erupted when the vent area was not buried under glacial ice . However , the flow does show evidence of interaction with glacial ice at its lower unit . This indicates that the lavas were erupted during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation . The third and most recent eruption produced another lava flow that was largely erupted above glacial ice , but was probably constrained on its northern margin by a small glacier . Unlike the lava flow that was erupted during the second eruption , this lava flow was not impounded by glacial ice at its lower unit . This suggests that it erupted less than 10 @,@ 000 years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation retreated .

 At least two sequences of basaltic andesite lava flows are deposited south of Tricouni Peak . One of these sequences , known as Tricouni Southwest , creates a cliff on the eastern side of a north @-@ south trending channel with a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) adjacent to the High Falls Creek mouth . The eastern flank of the lava flow , outside the High Falls Creek channel , has a more constant structure . Several fine @-@ scale columnar joints and the overall structure of the lava flow suggest that its western portion , along the length of the channel , ponded against glacial ice . Near its southern unit , lava oozed into cracks in the glacial ice . This has been identified by the existence of spire @-@ like cooling formations , although many of these edifices have been destroyed by erosional processes . Other features that indicate the lava ponded against glacial ice include its unusually thick structure and its steep cliffs . Therefore , the Tricouni Southwest lava flow was erupted about 10 @,@ 000 years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation was retreating . The explanation for the western portion displaying ice @-@ contact features while the eastern portion does not is likely because its western flank lies in a north @-@ south trending channel , which would have been able to maintain smaller amounts of solar heat than its unsheltered eastern flank . As a result , the western portion of the lava flow records glaciation during a period when the eastern slopes were free from glacial ice . 
 Tricouni Southeast , another volcanic sequence south of Tricouni Peak , consists of at least four andesite or dacite lava flows that outcrop as several small cliffs and bluffs on extensively vegetated flanks . They reach thicknesses of 100 m ( 330 ft ) and contain small amounts of hyaloclastite . The feeder of their origins has not been discovered but is likely located at the summit of the mound . These lavas form ice @-@ marginal <unk> , suggesting that every lava flow was erupted about 10 @,@ 000 years ago when the vast Cordilleran Ice Sheet was retreating and remains of glacial ice was sparse . 
 Exposed along the Cheakamus River and its tributaries are the Cheakamus Valley basalts . Although not necessarily mapped as part of the Cayley field , this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field . At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0 @.@ 01 and 1 @.@ 6 million years ago . Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows , some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia . In 1958 , Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation . Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till , the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas , indicating subaqueous volcanism , the columnar jointing at the edges of the lavas , indicating rapid cooling , and the absence of apparent <unk> .

 The andesite lava of Ember Ridge comprises 55 % brownish @-@ green volcanic glass with a trachytic matrix of plagioclase . About 35 % of Ember Ridge andesite contains phenocrysts of hornblende , augite , plagioclase and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots . A feature south of Ember Ridge , unofficially known as Betty 's Bump , comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase , augite and olivine . Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty 's Bump andesite as much as 20 % . The relationship of Betty 's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation . 
 Little Ring Mountain at the northern end of the field contains at least 70 % brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase . <unk> textures are up to 5 % , suggesting that the lava erupted <unk> . Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano . At least one <unk> fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and polycrystalline quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic plagioclase . 
 The dacite volcanics composing Mount Fee contain brown volcanic glass as much as 70 % and vesicular textures as much as 15 % . About 25 % of the volcanics contain crystal content , including plagioclase , hornblende , orthopyroxene , orthoclase and sporadic quartz . The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas . A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass , but rather composed of an abnormal <unk> matrix . This indicates that it might have developed as part of a subvolcanic intrusion . 
 At Ring Mountain , andesite comprises 70 % brown volcanic glass and vesicular textures as much as 15 % . The <unk> matrix is trachytic . <unk> , biotite , plagioclase and hornblende occur as <unk> and comprise 1 % to 7 % of the andesite . Small qualities of quartz are common and occur as <unk> . <unk> of orthoclase likely exist in andesite at Ring Mountain . 
 Andesite at Slag Hill consists of 70 % dark brown volcanic glass with varied degrees of trachytic texture in the <unk> matrix and less than 5 % of the andesite comprises vesicular textures . <unk> , hornblende and augite are mostly in form as phenocrysts and comprise 1 % to 10 % of the andesite . <unk> crystals are found occasionally and they likely represent xenocrysts . 
 = = = Geothermal and seismic activity = = = 
 At least four seismic events have occurred at Mount Cayley since 1985 and is the only volcano that has recorded seismic activity in the field . This suggests that the volcano still contains an active magma system , indicating the possibility of future eruptive activity . Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion , this observation indicates that some volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field may be active , with significant potential hazards . This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada 's most youthful volcanoes and with long @-@ lived volcanoes with a history of significant explosive activity , such as Mount Cayley . Recent seismic imaging from Natural Resources Canada employees supported <unk> studies in the region of Mount Cayley that created a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) below the surface . It is estimated to be 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) long and 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) wide with a thickness of less than 1 @.@ 6 km ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) . The reflector is understood to be a sill complex associated with the formation of Mount Cayley . However , the available data does not rule out the probability of it being a body of molten rock created by dehydrating of the subducted Juan de Fuca Plate . It is located just beneath the weak lithosphere like those found under subduction zone volcanoes in Japan . 
 At least five hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley , providing more evidence for magmatic activity . This includes springs found at <unk> Creek and <unk> Creek on the southern flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field . They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young . As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field , it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir . Here , the water is heated , becomes less dense and rises back to the surface along fissures or cracks . These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens .

 Several volcanic features in the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980 , including Mount Cayley , Cauldron Dome , Slag Hill , Mount Fee , Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain , which was titled Crucible Dome at the time . This resulted in the creation of a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes . The most detailed study of Mount Cayley took place during this period . Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther 's 1980 map . Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes . The sixth lava dome , Ember Ridge Northeast , was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001 . 
 The hot springs adjacent to Mount Cayley have made the volcanic field a target for geothermal exploration . At least 16 geothermal sites have been identified in British Columbia , Mount Cayley being one of the six areas most capable for commercial development . Others include Meager Creek and Pebble Creek near Pemberton , <unk> Hot Springs near Terrace , Mount Edziza on the Tahltan Highland and the Lillooet Fault Zone between Harrison Lake and the community of Lillooet . Temperatures of 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) to more than 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) have been measured in shallow boreholes on the southwestern flank of Mount Cayley . However , its severe terrain makes it challenging to develop a proposed 100 megawatt power station in the area .

 The line of volcanoes has been the subject of myths and legends by First Nations . To the Squamish Nation , Mount Cayley is called tak <unk> <unk> tl 'a <unk> <unk> . In their language it means " Landing Place of the Thunderbird " . The Thunderbird is a legendary creature in North American indigenous peoples ' history and culture . When the bird flaps its wings , thunder is created , and lightning originates from its eyes . The rocks that make up Mount Cayley were said to have been burnt black by the Thunderbird 's lightning . This mountain , like others in the area , is considered sacred because it plays an important part of their history . The Black Tusk , a pinnacle of black volcanic rock on the north shore of Garibaldi Lake to the southeast , sustains the same name . Cultural ceremonial use , hunting , trapping and plant gathering occur around the Mount Garibaldi area , but the most important resources was a lithic material called obsidian . Obsidian is a black volcanic glass used to make knives , chisels , adzes and other sharp tools in pre @-@ contact times . <unk> rhyodacite was also collected from a number of minor outcrops on the flanks of Mount Fee , Mount Callaghan and Mount Cayley . This material appears in goat hunting sites and at the <unk> rockshelter , collectively dated from about 8 @,@ 000 to 100 years old . 
 A number of volcanic peaks in the Mount Cayley field were named by mountaineers that explored the area in the early 20th century . Mount Fee was named in September 1928 by British mountaineer Tom Fyles after Charles Fee ( 1865 – 1927 ) , who was a member of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club in Vancouver at the time . To the northwest , Mount Cayley was named in September 1928 by Tom Fyles after Beverley Cochrane Cayley during a climbing expedition with the Alpine Club of Canada . Cayley was a friend of those in the climbing expedition and had died in Vancouver on June 8 , 1928 at the age of 29 . Photographs of Mount Cayley were taken by Fyles during the 1928 expedition and were published in the 1931 Canadian Alpine Journal Vol XX . 
 = = = Protection and monitoring = = = 
 At least one feature in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is protected as a provincial park . Brandywine Falls Provincial Park at the southeastern end of the field was established to protect Brandywine Falls , a 70 m ( 230 ft ) high waterfall on Brandywine Creek . It is composed of at least four lava flows of the Cheakamus Valley basalts . They are exposed in cliffs compassing the falls with a narrow sequence of gravel lying above the oldest lava unit . These lava flows are interpreted to have been exposed by erosion during a period of catastrophic flooding and the valley these lavas are located in is significantly larger than the river within it . The massive flooding that shaped the valley has been a subject of geological studies by Catherine Hickson and Andree <unk> @-@ Stevens . It has been proposed that there could have been significant floods during the waning stages of the last glacial period as drainage in a valley further north was blocked with remnants of glacial ice . Another possible explanation is subglacial eruptions created large amounts of glacial meltwater that scoured the surface of the exposed lava flows . 
 Like other volcanic zones in the Garibaldi Belt , volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are . This is partly because the field is located in a remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the past few hundred years . As a result , volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes , including tsunamis , earthquakes and landslides . However , with the existence of earthquakes , further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects , particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area . Because of these concerns , significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge on the state of the Garibaldi volcanoes . This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism . 
 = = Volcanic hazards = = 
 The Mount Cayley field is one of the largest volcanic zones in the Garibaldi Belt . Smaller zones include the Garibaldi Lake volcanic field surrounding Garibaldi Lake and the Bridge River Cones on the northern flank of the upper Bridge River . These areas are adjacent to Canada 's populated southwest corner where the population of British Columbia is the greatest . 
 A large volcanic eruption from any volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field would have major effects on the Sea @-@ to @-@ Sky Highway and municipalities such as Squamish , Whistler , Pemberton and probably Vancouver . Because of these concerns , the Geological Survey of Canada is planning to create hazard maps and emergency plans for Mount Cayley , as well as Mount Meager north of the volcanic field , which experienced a major volcanic eruption 2 @,@ 350 years ago similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . 
 = = = Landslides = = = 
 Like many other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt , Mount Cayley has been the source for several large landslides . To date , most geological studies of the Mount Cayley field have focused on landslide hazards along with geothermal potential . A major debris avalanche about 4 @,@ 800 years ago dumped 8 km2 ( 3 @.@ 1 sq mi ) of volcanic material into the adjacent Squamish valley . This blocked the Squamish River for a long period of time . Evans ( 1990 ) has indicated that a number of landslides and debris flows at Mount Cayley in the past 10 @,@ 000 years might have been caused by volcanic activity . Since the large debris avalanche 4 @,@ 800 years ago , a number of more minor landslides have occurred at it , including one 1 @,@ 100 years ago and another event 500 years ago . Both landslides ultimately blocked the Squamish River and created lakes upstream that lasted for a limited amount of time . In 1968 and 1983 , a series of landslides took place that caused considerable damage to logging roads and forest stands , but did not result in any casualties . Future landslides from Mount Cayley and potential damming of the Squamish River are significant geological hazards to the general public , as well as to the economic development in the Squamish valley . 
 = = = Eruptions = = = 
 Eruptive activity in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt . Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth 's rocky lithosphere . The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring . While molten rock breaks through the crust , the size of the volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture , creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles . Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time , such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity . At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars . At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone . 
 While molten rock comes closer to the surface it would most likely cause more fragmentation , triggering an explosive eruption that could produce an eruption column with an elevation of 20 km ( 12 mi ) and may be sustained for 12 hours . A well @-@ documented explosive eruption in the Garibaldi Belt with such force is the eruption of Mount Meager 2 @,@ 350 years ago , which deposed ash as far east as Alberta . This would endanger air traffic and would have to take another route away from the eruptive zone . Every airport buried under pyroclastic fall would be out of service , including those in Vancouver , Victoria , Kamloops , Prince George and Seattle . The tephra would destroy power transmission lines , satellite dishes , computers and other equipment that operates on electricity . Therefore , telephones , radios and cell phones would be disconnected . Structures not built for holding heavy material would likely demolish under the weight of the tephra . Ash from the eruption plume would subside above the vent area to create pyroclastic flows and would travel east and west down the nearby Cheakamus and Squamish river valleys . These would likely have significant impacts on salmon in the associated rivers and would cause considerable melting of glacial ice to produce debris flows that may extend into Daisy Lake and Squamish to cause significant damage . The eruption column would then travel eastward and extract air travel throughout Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador . 
 Explosive eruptions may decrease and be followed by the eruption of viscous lava to form a lava dome in the newly formed crater . Precipitation would frequently trigger lahars and these would continuously create problems in the Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys . If the lava dome continues to grow , it would eventually rise above the crater rim . The lava would be cooling and expanding then may produce landslides to create a massive zone of blocky talus in the Squamish river valley . While the dome of lava grows , it would frequently subside to create large pyroclastic flows that would again travel down the adjacent Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys . Tephra swept away from the pyroclastic flows would create ash columns with elevations of at least 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) , repeatedly depositing tephra on the communities of Whistler and Pemberton and again disrupting regional air traffic . Lava of the unstable dome may occasionally create minor pyroclastic flows , explosions and eruption columns . The community of Squamish would be abandoned , Highway 99 would be out of service and destroyed , and traffic adjacent to Vancouver , Pemberton and Whistler would remain forced to travel along a route to the east that is more lengthy than Highway 99 . 
 Eruptions would likely continue for a period of time , followed by years of decreasing secondary activity . The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows . Rubble on the flanks of the volcano and in valleys would occasionally be released to form debris flows . Major construction would be needed to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99 .

 Luminous Studio ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a multi @-@ platform game engine developed and used internally by Square Enix . The engine was developed for and targeted at eighth @-@ generation hardware and DirectX 11 @-@ compatible platforms , such as Xbox One , the PlayStation 4 , and versions of Microsoft Windows . It was conceived during the development of Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 to be compatible with next generation consoles that their existing platform , Crystal Tools , could not handle . 
 The engine powered the Agni 's Philosophy and Witch Chapter 0 tech demos and now centers on Final Fantasy XV , a title in the Final Fantasy series for eighth @-@ generation consoles . Critics praised the engine 's two tech demos , citing their graphics and real time rendering and declaring the engine as representative of the future of gaming .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 According to Julien Merceron , the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in the early 2010 's , the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 while he was in the final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 . This was a difficult period for Square Enix : the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting technical barriers as it transitioned to open world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle , and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems . Faced with these issues , Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines for their products , including Luminous Studio . Talking about sharing the engine , Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game : this resulted in Luminous Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development , while other major next @-@ generation titles would use other outsourced engines . 
 The construction of Luminous was similar in concept to Epic Games ' Unreal Engine or the Unity engine from Unity Technologies in that it incorporated all the development tools needed from asset editing onward , as well as being " high quality , easy to use , flexible , high speed , compact , and supporting both manual and automatic [ game development methods ] . " The development team drew inspiration for this concept and approach from Unreal Engine and <unk> 's CryEngine . The name " Luminous " was chosen to reflect the crystal theme of the Final Fantasy series . There were many major factors that the team considered while building the engine , as they wanted to insure the highest possible quality for high @-@ end games . Some of the environmental factors included lighting , shading and modeling . A core feature of the gameplay was the artificial intelligence ( AI ) , which had previous been liable to become unstable or poor under certain conditions or with poor programming due to the large amount of individual codes needed . For Luminous , the team created a single unifying flexible framework to control the scale of the AI while also making it intuitive . It was intended to be used in @-@ house rather than licensed out to other developers , but that western subsidiaries of the company would have access to it . In addition , they also built in the ability to blend graphical assets designed for CG scenery with highly advanced real @-@ time animation , making the two graphically similar . Luminous Studio was publicly revealed in 2011 . 
 The head of the project was Yoshihisa Hashimoto , Square Enix 's Chief Technology Officer , who had moved over to the company from Sonic Team in 2009 and became involved with development in 2011 . Other key Square Enix staff members working on Luminous Studio include Takeshi Nozue , Akira Iwata and Hiroshi Iwasaki . While ground work was being laid for Luminous , members of the team traveled to look at engine technology being developed by IO Interactive , Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal , western video game developers who became subsidiaries after the company bought out Eidos Interactive . Square Enix 's western subsidiaries shared information about game engine development from their experience developing the CDC and Glacier 2 game engines and shared their source code with the Luminous Studio team . During 2012 , one third of the final development team was from western subsidiaries of the company . Luminous was developed based on high @-@ end DirectX 11 technology . While designed for eighth @-@ generation video games , it was said to also be compatible with any console and hardware that could handle shaders , such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . Its compatibility with Nintendo 's seventh @-@ gen hardware such as the Wii and Nintendo 3DS was doubted , as those consoles did not support shaders . During this early stage , they were looking into the possibility of adjusting the engine for use on Wii U. The company were hoping to promote Luminous as a kind of brand , showing off the logo and tech demo when they were ready . 
 = = = Agni 's Philosophy = = = 
 Agni 's Philosophy is a tech demo created by Square Enix to show off the capacities of Luminous Studio . The demo was a collaboration between the cinematic Visual Works division -- a section of the company generally associated with CGI movie production for the company 's video games -- and Square Enix 's R & D department , Advanced Technology Division , with a goal to create a real @-@ time graphics tech demo that has a quality coming as close as possible to pre @-@ rendered CGI . Development of the demo took approximately half a year . Unlike previous technology demos created by the company , which were based on pre @-@ existing games , Square Enix decided to create something completely original . The demo was themed around the Final Fantasy series : during discussions , the team asked the question " What is Final Fantasy ? " , broke down its basic components and used them , along with added unusual elements , in the demo . A focus during the demo 's development was the creation of Agni , the central character . For the demo , as it was a work @-@ in @-@ progress , they optimized it for graphical performance . While the story and themes were created by the Japanese staff , many of the character designs were done by staff from their western subsidiaries . The technology to create the demo was all sourced from then @-@ existing high @-@ end PCs . An initial mock up of Agni 's hair was created using a mannequin and wig styled by a professional make @-@ up artist . Each character 's face was constructed around mo @-@ capped footage of live actors , then tweaked and expanded in post @-@ production . The entire development process , from conception through development , took approximately a year . Agni 's Philosophy was first shown at E3 2012 as part of a special presentation by Square Enix . As part of the presentation , guest speakers paused the demo and adjusted elements of the characters on the fly to show off the engine 's customization features . It was also shown at SIGGRAPH 2012 . 
 The Agni 's Philosophy tech demo was running at 60 frames per second , used 1 @.@ 8 GB of texture data per frame , and pushed ten million polygons per frame , with approximately 300 @,@ 000 to 400 @,@ 000 polygons for each character model . The entire city in the demo was tessellated . There is a scene where 100 @,@ 000 illuminated firefly @-@ like insects appear on screen , each one a full polygon mesh model with body and wings , which proceed to merge to generate a summoned monster . Production for the demo began in June 2011 , and was initially produced as pre @-@ rendered CGI animation by Visual Works before Square Enix attempted to reproduce it entirely in real @-@ time with the Luminous Studio engine , using the same assets as the CGI version . 
 = = = Final Fantasy XV = = = 
 Prior to its rebranding and full move onto eight @-@ generation consoles , Final Fantasy XV ( then called Final Fantasy Versus XIII ) , used lighting technology from Luminous along with a purpose @-@ built proprietary gameplay engine . For its E3 2013 re @-@ reveal under its new title , the company used a specially @-@ created engine environment named Ebony . In July 2014 , Hashimoto left the company , citing personal reasons . While still working as an advisor for Luminous Studio , his position as project leader was filled by Remi <unk> , a senior engineer who had worked with games featuring Luminous technology . The version of XV shown off at Tokyo Game Show and Jump Festa that year ran on Luminous 1 @.@ 4 , which combined Luminous with components created for Ebony . The Episode <unk> game demo is planned to run on 1 @.@ 5 . The developers are planning for the final game to run on version 2 @.@ 0 . 
 With Luminous Studio , real @-@ time scenes in XV have five million polygons per frame , with character models made up of about 100 @,@ 000 polygons each . Character models for XV were constructed with 600 bones , estimated as roughly 10 @-@ 12 times more than seventh generation hardware . About 150 bones are used for the face , 300 for the hair and clothes , and 150 for the body . For the characters ' hair , the team used the same technique as with the characters in Agni 's Philosophy . The inner hair for each character uses about 20 @,@ 000 polygons , five times more than seventh generation hardware . The data capacity for textures is also much greater than before . Each character uses 30 MB of texture data , and ten levels of detail . While seventh @-@ generation games used 50 to 100 MB of texture data for a scene , Final Fantasy XV can use about sixteen times this amount on the PlayStation 4 console . 2048 × 2048 and 4096 × 4096 <unk> are used for the HD textures .

 In April 2015 , Square Enix announced that the engine will support DirectX 12 , and Nvidia revealed a new real @-@ time tech demo developed by Square Enix for the engine , called Witch Chapter 0 [ cry ] , featuring the character Agni from the earlier Agni 's Philosophy demo . The demo renders over 63 million polygons per frame , uses " 8K by 8K " resolution textures , and her hair is rendered with over 50 shaders , with each strand of hair rendered as a polygon . It also portrays human crying with a high level of detail , and the quality of the real @-@ time graphics have been compared to pre @-@ rendered CGI animation . The tech demo took a year to produce , and was running on a PC with four GeForce GTX Titan X graphics cards .

 The Stavne – Leangen Line ( Norwegian : Stavne – <unk> ) is a 5 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometer ( 3 @.@ 6 mi ) railway line between Stavne and Leangen in Trondheim , Norway . The line provides an alternative connection between the Dovre Line and Nordland Line , allowing trains to bypass Trondheim Central Station . The line includes the Stavne Bridge over the river of Nidelva , Lerkendal Station and the 2 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometer ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) long Tyholt Tunnel . Construction of the line started during the Second World War by the Wehrmacht , the German military occupying Norway , in an attempt to make the railway in Trondheim resistant to sabotage . Because of the long construction time of the tunnel , tracks were laid in the city streets , but neither route was completed before the end of the war . Construction was placed on hold and the Stavne – Leangen Line did not open until 2 June 1957 . At first it was primarily used by freight trains , but since 1988 , passenger services have been provided . 
 = = Route = = 
 The Stavne – Leangen Line is 5 @.@ 8 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 6 mi ) and acts as a connection between the Dovre Line and the Nordland Line ( formerly the Meråker Line ) in Trondheim . It is single track and standard gauge , is not electrified and has no passing loops . It is equipped with centralized traffic control ( CTC ) , has eight bridges , two tunnels and no level crossings . The line is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . 
 To the southwest , the line connects to the Dovre Line at Stavne . There are two forks , laid triangularly , one each from the north and south . On the Dovre Line 's side of the triangle is the closed Stavne Station . The track from the north branches off just after passing Marienborg Station . The station is built in such a way that trains on the Dovre Line use the one track and trains on the Stavne – Leangen Line use the other track . The Stavne – Leangen Line 's northern switch is located 547 @.@ 82 kilometers ( 340 @.@ 40 mi ) from Oslo Central Station , and 2 @.@ 82 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 75 mi ) from Trondheim Central Station . The southern fork merges with the northern fork 1 @.@ 79 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 11 mi ) after the northern fork branches from the mainline . 
 At 80 meters ( 260 ft ) after the merger , the line crosses Nidelva on the 186 @-@ meter ( 610 ft ) long Stavne Bridge before crossing European Road E6 on a 25 @.@ 3 @-@ meter ( 83 ft ) long concrete bridge . The line then reaches Lerkendal Station , which is located 2 @.@ 55 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 58 mi ) from Marienborg . It serves the <unk> campus of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology , and Lerkendal Stadion , the home ground of Rosenborg BK . The line continues through the 2 @,@ 785 @-@ meter ( 9 @,@ 137 ft ) long Tyholt Tunnel , which starts 270 meters ( 890 ft ) after Lerkendal Station .

 During the German occupation of Norway as part of the Second World War , the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage . They decided that the best way to do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt . However , construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected , so instead <unk> started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim . They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and then follow <unk> and Olav <unk> gate , cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up <unk> before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station . However , by German capitulation on 8 May 1945 , construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate . 
 The Norwegian State Railways regained interest in the line during the 1950s and resumed construction . The line was officially opened on 1 June 1957 and revenue traffic started the following day . The line was originally only used for freight trains , although it was occasionally used by passenger trains , especially when there was maintenance work on bridges . The line received CTC on 11 January 1976 . Lerkendal Station was opened on 1 December 1988 , and with the establishment of the Trøndelag Commuter Rail in 1993 , the station started being used for scheduled commuter rail services . Ownership of the line passed to the Norwegian National Rail Administration from 1 December 1996 . Marienborg Station opened in 1999 , and from 2001 , all commuter trains operating to and from Steinkjer had Lerkendal Station as their southern terminus . 
 In 2002 , NSB launched a now abandoned proposal to establish an urban train service in Trondheim . According to the proposal , trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a loop back to the central station . The services was proposed to be operated as part of the commuter rail system . It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone , including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line , and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel . In a 2005 report , SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced , it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus . The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3 @.@ 6 @-@ percent gradient , which would be too steep for mainline trains . 
 = Nikola Žigić = 
 Nikola Žigić ( Serbian Cyrillic : Никола <unk> , IPA : [ <unk> <unk> ͡ ɕ ] ; born 25 September 1980 ) is a Serbian international footballer who played as a centre forward . 
 Žigić was born in Bačka Topola , in what was then SFR Yugoslavia . He began playing football as a youngster with AIK Bačka Topola , and scored 68 goals from 76 first @-@ team matches over a three @-@ year period in the third tier of Yugoslav football . Military service took him to Bar in 2001 , where he was able to continue his goalscoring career with the local second @-@ level club <unk> . A brief spell back in the third tier with Kolubara preceded his turning professional with First League side Red Star Belgrade in 2002 . He spent time on loan at third @-@ tier Spartak Subotica before making his Red Star debut in 2003 . Despite suggestions that his height , of 2 @.@ 02 m ( 6 ft 7 1 ⁄ 2 in ) , made him better suited to sports other than football , Žigić ended the season as First League top scorer , domestic player of the year , league champion and scorer of the winning goal in the cup final . He won a second league – cup double in 2005 – 06 , a second player of the year award , and finished his three @-@ year Red Star career with 70 goals from 109 appearances in all competitions . 
 In August 2006 , Žigić signed for Spanish club Racing Santander ; his goals and his partnership with Pedro Munitis helped them achieve a mid @-@ table finish in La Liga . He then moved to Valencia , but was unable to establish himself as a regular in the starting eleven . He spent the second half of the 2008 – 09 La Liga season back with Racing on loan , for whom he scored 13 goals in just 19 matches . Žigić joined Birmingham City of the Premier League in 2010 , and in his first season , he scored in their League Cup win . Even after relegation to the Championship , and despite increasing efforts to remove his large salary from the financially struggling club 's wage bill , he remained with Birmingham for the full four years of his contract . Having been without a club for a few months , he rejoined Birmingham for the second half of the 2014 – 15 season . 
 Žigić made his senior international debut for Serbia and Montenegro in March 2004 , and following the breakup of Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 , he played internationally for Serbia until 2011 . He won 57 caps for his country and scored 20 goals . He was a member of the 2006 and 2010 World Cup squads , and briefly captained his country in 2011 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Žigić was born in Bačka Topola , in what was then SFR Yugoslavia , the son of Jovan , a former footballer , and his wife Milica , who had been a basketball player . He completed his secondary education at the mechanical engineering school in Bačka Topola . His brother Branko , 15 months his junior , also became a footballer , as a central defender with clubs including Cement <unk> and Serbian First League club Proleter Novi Sad . During the Yugoslav Wars in 1999 , Žigić 's hometown was beneath the flight @-@ path of NATO bombers heading for Belgrade ; for much of that part of the conflict , the family home was without electricity or running water . 
 Žigić is married to Sanja ; the couple have two daughters . 
 = = Club career = = 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 He joined his hometown football club , AIK Bačka Topola , as a youngster , and graduated to the senior side in 1998 – 99 . He began as a centre back , but soon realised he preferred scoring goals to defending . Žigić 's parents did not want him to take football seriously until he completed his education , and he remained with AIK Bačka Topola until 2001 , scoring 68 goals in 76 matches in the Serbian League Vojvodina , the third level of Yugoslav football . When military service took him to Bar , he was able to play for the local club , <unk> , for whom he scored 15 goals from 23 appearances in the 2001 – 02 Second League of FR Yugoslavia . After trials in France with Saint @-@ Étienne and Créteil came to nothing , Žigić returned home where he played 8 matches for third @-@ tier club Kolubara , scoring 3 goals . 
 Žigić then signed his first professional contract , with Red Star Belgrade , one of the biggest clubs in the country . Because he was not considered ready for first @-@ team football at that level , he spent the latter part of the 2002 – 03 season on loan at Spartak Subotica , another third @-@ tier side , for whom his goalscoring rate was even higher : 14 goals from just 11 league games . 
 = = = Red Star = = = 
 Returning head coach <unk> Muslin brought Žigić into Red Star 's senior squad for the 2003 – 04 First League season , and gave him his debut in the starting eleven on the opening day . That first game ended in defeat , and Žigić 's physical appearance – a growth spurt from the age of 16 had brought his height to 2 @.@ 02 m ( 6 ft 7 1 ⁄ 2 in ) – provoked suggestions that he might be better suited to basketball . He scored the second goal as they beat Hajduk Kula 2 – 0 in the next league match . In between , he produced a hat @-@ trick against <unk> in the 2003 – 04 UEFA Cup qualifying round , and went on to contribute a further three goals as Red Star beat Odense 6 – 5 on aggregate in the first round . He scored twice in the 3 – 0 win in the Eternal Derby against Partizan , and celebrated by miming a basketball shot . By the mid @-@ season break , he had 12 league goals as well as the 6 in the UEFA Cup , and was named Player of the Year for 2003 , both by the captains of the First League teams voting via the Večernje novosti newspaper and by the Football Association . He finished the season as the league 's top scorer , with 18 , as Red Star won their 23rd title , and scored the winning goal in the cup final . 
 Resuming the partnership with Marko Pantelić begun in the second half of 2003 – 04 , Žigić continued to score freely in the new season . With Red Star two goals and a man down in the first leg of the Champions League qualifier against Young Boys , he netted twice in the last 12 minutes to give his team an away draw . Domestically , Pantelić top @-@ scored with 21 league goals and Žigić contributed 15 as Red Star finished in second place , behind Partizan . Žigić scored against Partizan to help Red Star reach the cup final , but was one of five regular starters unavailable for that match through injury or suspension , and his team lost to a last @-@ minute goal to ten @-@ man <unk> . 
 In September 2005 , Žigić signed a one @-@ year extension to his contract , which had been due to expire at the end of the season . He helped his team progress through the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Cup , and <unk> to Reuters ' correspondent , " capped a brilliant individual performance with two goals " as well as providing the cross for Milan Purović as Red Star beat Roma 3 – 1 in the third match of the group stage . His first goal , a header , appeared to have been scored from an offside position , but for the second , in the 86th minute , he dispossessed Philippe <unk> , evaded two more opponents , and bent the ball into the top corner from 25 m ( 27 yd ) with his weaker left foot . He said afterwards , " I 've never scored a goal like that in my entire career . I was going to pass the ball but there was no one ahead of me so I just decided to go for it and see what happens " . The win left Red Star needing to win their last group match to stand a chance of qualifying for the knockout rounds , but they failed to do so . 
 For the second time in three years , Žigić was chosen as domestic player of the year in the captains ' poll , and was also honoured by the Red Star Sport Association as best male athlete of 2005 , an award open to athletes representing the club in any sport , not just in football . After Pantelić 's departure for Hertha BSC , Red Star 's goals were spread more evenly among the remaining forward players . In the league , Žigić and Boško Janković were joint @-@ top scorers with 12 , and Purović contributed one fewer , as the club won their 24th title . They completed the double with a defeat of city rivals OFK in the cup final , coming back from 2 – 0 down via Žigić 's 67th @-@ minute free kick under the defensive wall and Purović 's equaliser to take the match into extra time , during which Žigić gave Red Star the lead with a header and Dušan Basta made the final score 4 – 2 . After the match , Žigić refused to answer questions about his Red Star future . 
 = = = Racing Santander = = = 
 Žigić began the season with Red Star , but on 29 August 2006 , he signed a four @-@ year contract with La Liga club Racing Santander . The fee , officially undisclosed , was variously reported at anything from € <unk> to € 7M . Although better offers had been rejected , those offers had arrived at the wrong time : the pressure on Red Star to win the domestic title meant they were unlikely to dispose of a major player in mid @-@ season . The player felt he was more likely to start matches with a club at Racing 's level . Partnering the diminutive Pedro Munitis , he contributed 11 goals – including a hat @-@ trick in a 5 – 4 win over Athletic Bilbao – four assists and five penalties won in league competition over the season as Racing finished tenth . The efficacy of the pair earned them the nickname of Dúo <unk> ( the Two Point @-@ getters ) ; ahead of the coming season , new coach Marcelino García Toral recalled how " we all know how many points Racing picked up when Žigić and Munitis weren 't there . Without them , Racing didn 't add points " . His performances earned him the captains ' vote as best player based abroad for 2006 , and contributed to his 2007 Football Association of Serbia Golden Ball award . 
 = = = Valencia = = = 
 Žigić signed for Valencia in August 2007 . The fee was unconfirmed , but suggestions appeared in the media of € 15M , € 18M , and around € 20M , a figure possibly including the player 's wages over the five years of his contract . He had been linked with numerous other moves , and Fenerbahçe made an offer that was better financially for both Racing and the player , but Žigić preferred to stay in " the best league in Europe " in a country where he was accustomed to the language and culture . He was suffering from an ankle injury when he arrived – which delayed his integration into the first @-@ team group and , according to Mundo Deportivo , undermined the coaching staff 's confidence in him – then aggravated the injury by playing in a Euro 2008 qualifier in September , and did not appear for Valencia until October . 
 He made his debut as a second @-@ half substitute in Valencia 's Champions League group @-@ stage defeat at home to Chelsea , and started the next league match , another home defeat against Espanyol , but was selected only infrequently either by Quique Flores , who had signed him , or by successor Ronald Koeman . With the transfer window approaching , Koeman had given Žigić two weeks to convince him he was worth keeping . Prior to the Copa del Rey on 19 December , Valencia had not scored for six matches , and they were soon 1 – 0 down to third @-@ tier opponents Real Union . Žigić came on and scored twice to turn the match around , and followed up with another goal three days later as Valencia came from behind to secure a 2 – 2 draw at Real Zaragoza . A mooted loan to English club Portsmouth fell through when Koeman changed his mind about the player leaving , but he made only nine league appearances ( two starts ) in what remained of the season , and was sent off in the first of those . 
 Speculation regarding moves to the Premier League came to nothing . By October , Žigić had appeared just once for Valencia , in the UEFA Cup , and an opportunity arose to join his former club , Racing Santander , on an emergency loan . This depended on the league allowing Racing to release Luis Fernández on medical grounds , because of a degenerative condition of his knee , thus freeing up a space in the first @-@ team squad . The LFP 's medical committee decided that the condition was not yet clearly career @-@ ending , so any agreement with Žigić had to be held over until the January 2009 transfer window . In the meantime , he played in four more cup matches for Valencia , two domestic and two UEFA , and scored in three of them , but took no part in the league campaign . 
 The loan agreement was duly revived , and Žigić returned to the club and the city that " feel like home " . Racing were to pay his wages and write off the debt outstanding from the sale of Mario <unk> , and there was no option to purchase . Resuming his partnership with Munitis in the first game of his second spell , Žigić scored the only goal of the visit to Real Valladolid , repeated the feat at Getafe two weeks later , and scored again in the next match , a 2 – 0 win away at Sevilla . He finished the season as Racing 's top scorer , with 13 goals from only 19 games . 
 In the 2009 close season , there were rumours linking Žigić with moves to clubs including Sunderland , Monaco , and Bordeaux , but the player insisted his intention was and always had been to be successful with Valencia . He made 26 appearances for the club in 2009 – 10 in all competitions , more than in the previous two seasons combined , but only 5 were league starts . Within four minutes of replacing the injured David Villa in the league match against Racing in October , he took advantage of a defensive error to score the only goal of the game ; out of respect for his former club , he did not celebrate . On 2 January 2010 , his 93rd @-@ minute header against Espanyol took Valencia third in the table , and his double against Deportivo La Coruña in the 2009 – 10 Copa del Rey put Valencia 2 – 0 up at half @-@ time ; the game finished 2 – 2 and Valencia lost 4 – 3 on aggregate . With four minutes left of the Europa League quarter @-@ final second leg , Valencia were denied a penalty when an Atlético Madrid defender pulled Žigić to the ground so forcefully that a large hole was torn in the front of his shirt , apparently unnoticed by referee or goalline official ; the tie ended goalless , so Atlético progressed on away goals from the first leg and went on to win the competition . Away to Espanyol on 1 May , again as a substitute for Villa , he scored both goals in a 2 – 0 win that secured Valencia a place in the next season 's Champions League . 
 = = = Birmingham City = = = 
 On 25 May 2010 , Žigić signed a four @-@ year contract with Premier League club Birmingham City for an undisclosed fee , which media speculation suggested to be in the region of £ 6 million . He made his debut on the opening day of the season away at Sunderland : replacing Garry O 'Connor in the 58th minute , he came close to scoring from outside the penalty area and " injected a note of panic hitherto undetected " in the home team 's defence as Birmingham came back from 2 – 0 down to secure a draw . Žigić 's first goal for the club came as Birmingham beat Milton Keynes Dons 3 – 1 in the League Cup on 21 September . He scored his first Premier League goal on 16 October , opening the scoring at Arsenal with a header from Keith Fahey 's cross , but Birmingham lost the game 2 – 1 . 
 In a hostile League Cup quarter @-@ final against local rivals Aston Villa , Žigić had an apparently valid goal disallowed for offside against another player , and with the scores level after 86 minutes , was about to be substituted when he produced a " mis @-@ hit , deflected , scruffy late goal " that secured the win . He opened the scoring against favourites Arsenal in the final with a short @-@ range header , and with one minute of normal time remaining , he flicked on a long clearance , Arsenal 's goalkeeper and central defender got in each other 's way , and the ball fell to Obafemi Martins to tap in the winning goal . Football manager turned commentator David Pleat wrote that " Birmingham earned their victory through terrific teamwork and astute deployment of Žigić 's strengths . " Because of " niggling " hip and groin injuries , he made only two more substitute appearances . His absence deprived the team of what the Birmingham Mail 's reporter called their " most effective style : getting the ball forward early , pressing up the pitch and playing off him " , as they were relegated to the Championship . 
 Despite his agent Milan <unk> 's insistence that his client would not be playing in the lower divisions , Žigić underwent groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September . He told the Mail that he would be happy to stay and that any move would depend on the club , which was in increasing financial difficulty , wanting to sell . His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1 – 0 win against Leeds United . Early in the Europa League group match at Braga , Birmingham were awarded a penalty . In the absence of regular penalty @-@ taker Marlon King , Žigić took on the responsibility . His attempt was saved , Braga won the match 1 – 0 , and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds . Away to Leeds , Žigić scored all four in a 4 – 1 win , and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool . 
 Ahead of the 2012 – 13 season , Žigić was close to a return to Spain with Real Mallorca . Birmingham were prepared to give him a free transfer to reduce the wage bill by his reported £ 50 @,@ 000 a week , but the deal fell through when board and agent could not agree a payoff for the player , who earlier in the summer had expressed his intention to see out the two years left on his contract . He began the playing season on the bench , coming off it after 85 minutes to produce a 94th @-@ minute equaliser at home to Charlton Athletic on the opening day , and was used more as substitute than starter by new manager Lee Clark , who preferred Peter Løvenkrands or Leroy Lita . On the eve of the January transfer window , chief executive Peter Pannu confirmed that player sales were necessary to stave off the risk of administration . Even if the club could raise as much as £ 6M from the sale of England goalkeeper Jack Butland , Žigić 's wages were more than the club could afford , and the player needed " to go out and showcase himself . " The club had failed to include a clause in his contract to reduce his wages in the event of relegation , and it emerged later that they had agreed to substantial annual increments . 
 He did not leave , and in February , Clark publicly criticised him for producing " possibly the worst training session in terms of a professional footballer I have ever come across " , despite knowing he was due to start the upcoming game against Watford . Up until this incident , he had scored six league goals at a rate of one every 165 minutes , and been sent off twice . Clark said that Žigić would not be involved against Watford , but that it was " in his hands " as to whether he would prepare properly for the Sheffield Wednesday fixture three days later . His response must have been acceptable , because he played the whole of the goalless draw against Wednesday , started all the remaining matches – the longest run of starts of his Birmingham career – and ended the season with nine league goals , second only to King . 
 Žigić missed the first few weeks of the 2013 – 14 season with a back problem , and once fit , played regularly throughout the season , as one of a small number of senior players in an inexperienced and youthful team with numerous short @-@ term loanees . The team struggled , and reached the last day of the season needing at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One . Two goals down with 12 minutes left , Žigić scored , and three minutes into stoppage time , his close @-@ range header was cleared off the line to Paul <unk> , who headed home to preserve Birmingham 's second @-@ tier status . Birmingham were reported to be " quietly confident " of retaining his services for another season , at a much reduced salary , especially as he was believed to be keen on applying for British citizenship , which required five years ' residence , but he left at the end of his contract . He was the last remaining member of the League Cup @-@ winning team . 
 Having been without a club since his departure , Žigić began training with Birmingham again in November 2014 . After a successful appeal to be granted a work permit , for which he did not qualify automatically , he signed a contract on 4 December to expire at the end of the season . He made his second debut as a late substitute in the Championship match at home to Reading on 13 December , with Birmingham already 6 – 1 ahead . He played only infrequently – nine substitute appearances in the league and two FA Cup matches – and the club confirmed he would be released when his contract expired . 
 = = International career = = 
 Coach Ilija Petković gave Žigić his international debut for Serbia and Montenegro on 31 March 2004 , as an 84th @-@ minute substitute in a 1 – 0 friendly defeat against Norway in Belgrade . His next appearance and first start came some 14 months later ; in a friendly against Italy in Canada , he ran onto a through ball and went round the goalkeeper to open the scoring and also hit the post in a 1 – 1 draw . 
 He also scored in his next match , against Poland in another friendly , and established himself as a regular selection , but it was his substitute appearance in a crucial World Cup qualifier against Spain in Madrid in September 2005 that brought him wider international recognition . After a poor first @-@ half – Petković said they " were lucky to be only a goal down at half @-@ time " – Žigić was introduced , and the tactic of " putting him in the centre of the opposition defence and playing long high balls to him ... was remarkably successful " . He pressured the goalkeeper into missing a cross which dropped for Dejan Stanković to set up Mateja Kežman 's equaliser , and 12 minutes later , his pass left Kežman clear on goal but he mis @-@ hit what might have been a winning shot . The result left Serbia @-@ Montenegro top of the group , and they confirmed their qualification at home to Bosnia and Herzegovina when Žigić 's assist gave Kežman a tap @-@ in for the only goal of the game . 
 Žigić 's only start at the 2006 World Cup came in the last fixture , when his team had already been eliminated after losing the first two group matches . He scored early in the first half off a long ball from Stanković against Côte d 'Ivoire – the goal was Serbia @-@ Montenegro 's first of the tournament – but the match ended in a 3 – 2 defeat . 
 Still an automatic choice under new national manager Javier Clemente , Žigić scored the only goal in Serbia 's first competitive match as a separate country , a Euro 2008 qualifier at home to Azerbaijan in September 2006 . He scored once , missed two more good chances and was then sent off for elbowing an opponent in stoppage time of the March 2007 qualifying defeat in Kazakhstan , so missed the next , a home draw with Portugal , and also missed the Finland fixture in June after surgery on a facial injury . He still scored seven goals as Serbia failed to qualify . 
 Žigić played regularly through the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign under the management of Radomir Antić , contributing three goals and partnering former Red Star teammate Marko Pantelić as Serbia qualified for a major tournament for the first time as an independent nation . Ahead of the tournament proper , he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006 : " I went to Germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of . Tactically , I have learned a lot and I 'm in much better condition , both physically and psychologically . This is my World Cup , I think I can play a lead role and I want to show I 'm a player that can do it in big games . " After losing to Ghana in the opening group match , Serbia went on to face Germany . Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose 's first @-@ half dismissal , Žigić headed a cross down to Milan Jovanović who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game ; Lukas Podolski 's second @-@ half penalty was saved , and Antić dedicated the victory to the Serbian people . In a game of missed chances against Australia , Serbia lost 2 – 1 and finished bottom of the group . 
 Goals in four of Serbia 's five internationals in the latter part of 2010 brought his total to 20 . He was not selected to start the other match , a Euro 2012 qualifier in Italy that was abandoned after six minutes because of crowd trouble ; UEFA awarded the match to the hosts as a 3 – 0 win . After Serbia failed to qualify for the tournament , both Stanković and Nemanja Vidić retired from international football , and Žigić was appointed captain of the national team . He captained the team in friendly defeats to Mexico and Honduras in 2011 , his 56th and 57th appearances for his country , which proved to be his last . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Žigić 's extreme height predisposes him to an aerial game . He is dangerous from set pieces , scoring many headed goals and knocking the ball down for others : when he joined Red Star , the coach set out the team in a 4 – 3 – 3 formation , with Žigić at centre @-@ forward and two wingers to feed those strengths . He tried to use his physical presence to disrupt opposing defences , both for his own benefit and to draw their attentions away from others . Pep Guardiola said in 2009 that Žigić was not easy to defend against , " almost unstoppable " in the air , but the best way would be to keep him as far as possible away from the penalty area . Speaking in 2010 , Radovan <unk> , then assistant manager of the Serbia national team , described him as " the king of air play , he is the finest there is in Europe . He possesses the sense of space and movement without the ball and can assist his teammates with headers and set up goal @-@ scoring opportunities . " 
 As exemplified on his debut for Racing , a performance in which he demonstrated his aerial power , he is capable of playing with his back to goal , and his height was not incompatible with agility . He prefers to play not as a lone striker but in partnership with a shorter , speedier , teammate . Racing 's fitness coach , Javier <unk> , was surprised that Žigić was " well coordinated , to the extent that he doesn 't seem so tall when I see him in training . " 
 He prefers to receive the ball in the air , because he can always beat smaller players in the air but they can take advantage of better acceleration and quicker reactions on the ground . According to David Pleat , a major factor in Birmingham 's 2011 League Cup win was " telling him to do what he does best and flick the ball on with his head from direct diagonal balls played from both wings " . Nevertheless , he is technically competent , scoring goals with his feet and providing assists for others . A 2009 feature in Mundo Deportivo assessed Žigić as one of those few tall players with a good touch on the ball , and in 2010 , German international defender Per Mertesacker described him as " technically a good player and very smart tactically " .
