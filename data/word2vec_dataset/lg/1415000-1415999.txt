 = Migration of the Serbs = 
 <unk> Srba ( English : Migration of the Serbs ) is the name given to four similar oil paintings by the artist Paja Jovanović which depict Serbs , led by Archbishop Arsenije III , fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690 – 91 . The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije I , the Patriarch of Karlovci , to be displayed at the following year 's Budapest Millennium Exhibition . In the view of the Serbian clergy , it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self @-@ administration in Austria @-@ Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy 's borders . 
 Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres ( 150 by 230 in ) , the first painting was completed in 1896 , and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year . Dissatisfied , the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church 's view of the migration . Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly , he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest , and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop 's palace in Sremski Karlovci . Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting , three of which survive . The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade , the second at the Pančevo Museum , and the fourth at Princess Ljubica 's Residence , in Belgrade . Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture , and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović 's finest achievements .

 In 1689 , Arsenije III , the Archbishop of Peć , incited Serbs in Kosovo , Macedonia and the Sandžak to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and support a Habsburg incursion into the Balkans . On 2 January 1690 , the Habsburgs and Serbs were defeated in battle at the Kačanik Gorge . The Habsburgs began to retreat , prompting thousands of Serb villagers to leave their homes and flee north fearing Ottoman reprisals . In Serbian historiography , this event came to be known as the Great Serb Migration . Between 30 @,@ 000 and 40 @,@ 000 Serb refugees streamed into Habsburg @-@ held Vojvodina , north of the Danube River , and settled there . The migrants would come to call the regions they had formerly inhabited Old Serbia , and dubbed their adopted homeland " new Serbia " . Tim Judah , a journalist specializing in the Balkans , describes the exodus as one of the most traumatic events in Serbian history . 
 In 1691 , Arsenije struck a deal with the Holy Roman Emperor , Leopold I , whereby the Habsburgs granted the Serbs ecclesiastic autonomy and some degree of self @-@ administration , much to the displeasure of the Catholic Church and Hungarian authorities . Leopold recognized Arsenije as the leader of Habsburg Serbs in both religious and secular affairs , and indicated that this power would be held by all future Archbishops . In 1712 , Sremski Karlovci became the Patriarchate for Serbs living in the Habsburg Empire .

 In the early 1890s , Hungarian officials announced plans for a Budapest Millennium Exhibition to be held in 1896 ; it was intended to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin , reaffirm Hungary 's " national and territorial legitimacy " and the Hungarian people 's " natural and historical right in the areas they inhabited . " The Exhibition was to be held at Budapest 's City Park . Exhibits were to be divided into twelve distinct areas , one of which was visual art . The showpiece of the art exhibit was to be a painting by Hungary 's foremost history painter , Mihály Munkácsy , titled The Founding of the Hungarian State . Several pavilions displaying the cultural and industrial achievements of non @-@ Hungarians living in the Hungarian @-@ administered territories of Austria @-@ Hungary were also built , including one for the Serbs . 
 In 1895 , on the orders of the Patriarch of Karlovci , Georgije I , the Congress Board of Sremski Karlovci commissioned the young realist Paja Jovanović to compose Migration of the Serbs , intending for it to be displayed as part of the Serb pavilion . The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint for the Exhibition , the other being the Vršac triptych , which was commissioned by the Vršac city council . In the eyes of the clergy , Migration of the Serbs would help legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self @-@ administration in Austria @-@ Hungary . The official Church narrative held that Leopold had requested that the Serbs of Kosovo , Macedonia and the Sandžak settle the Ottoman – Habsburg frontier to create a buffer against further Ottoman encroachment , and Church officials intended for Jovanović 's painting to reflect this view . Hence , the painting had significant political implications . Habsburg Serbs asserted that the agreement between Arsenije and Leopold legitimized their claim to the lands they inhabited , while Croatian nationalists decried the Serbs as " uninvited guests " who only acquired Leopold 's pledge of autonomy after they had migrated to the Habsburg lands . Migration of the Serbs was thus intended to challenge the historical and political narratives being forwarded by the Croatian and Hungarian painters whose works were also going to be displayed . 
 = = = Preparation = = = 
 The commission offered Jovanović the opportunity to make a name for himself as a serious history painter , given that the subject of the work was an event of international significance and the painting was to be displayed in a foreign capital . To ensure Migration of the Serbs was historically accurate , Jovanović studied authentic medieval weapons , costumes and other objects , later incorporating them into the composition . He also studied medieval histories , collected ethnographical evidence and consulted historians . Notably , the Church asked the historian and Orthodox priest Ilarion Ruvarac to consult Jovanović on the historical details of the migration and accompany him on a visit to the monasteries of Fruška Gora , where the young artist examined a number of contemporary sources and objects from the time . 
 The art historian Lilien Filipovitch @-@ Robinson notes that Jovanović incorporated modern techniques into the work and emulated the naturalistic approach of contemporary landscape painters , showing he was " at ease with the art of the past and that of his own time " . The composition marked a significant departure for Jovanović , who up until that point had painted mostly Orientalist pieces as opposed to ones that depicted specific moments from Serbian history .

 The original oil painting measures 380 by 580 centimetres ( 150 by 230 in ) . It depicts Arsenije leading tens of thousands of Serbs into exile , riding a horse and flanked by a Serb flag . In direct reference to The Bible , the image is reminiscent to that of Moses leading the chosen people out of Egypt . The irony , Judah notes , is that the Patriarch is leading his people away from their promised land . The Patriarch and four other figures dominate the composition , staggering unevenly across the canvas as opposed to moving in a straight line . " They punctuate the foreground , " Filipovitch @-@ Robinson writes , " directing the eye through the diagonals and curves of their bodies and gesture to the next line of figures behind them . Each subsequent line leads to the next . " All age groups are represented in the painting , and Jovanović pays special attention to their facial details . Thousands of figures on horseback and on foot appear in the background before eventually receding into the horizon . The left background shows Serbian warriors pointing their lances at the sky while the right background shows lumber wagons carrying families into exile . At the right foreground , an old man herds his sheep . To the right of the Patriarch , a mother and her infant son sit atop a horse carrying their belongings . The woman is the young wife of militia leader Jovan Monasterlija and the child his son . A mustachioed warrior walks before them with swords fastened to his belt and a rifle resting against his shoulder , " striding purposefully into the future " . The warrior 's right arm is smeared with blood and bound by a white sling . 
 Upon first seeing it , Georgije was displeased by Jovanović 's depiction of the exodus , particularly the sight of sheep and wagons carrying women and children , saying it made the migrants look like " rabble on the run " . The source of the Patriarch 's displeasure lay in differing interpretations of what had originally caused the migration to take place ; the Church maintained that Arsenije was simply heeding the call of the Holy Roman Emperor to head north . Having studied Ruvarac 's work , Jovanović came to hold the view that fear of Ottoman persecution , rather than the desire to protect the Habsburg frontier , had prompted the migrants to leave their homes . Jovanović duly took the painting back to his studio and altered it to the Patriarch 's liking , removing the sheep , lumber wagons , and the woman and her infant son , putting stylized warriors in their place . He also placed the letter Leopold had supposedly sent the Serbs inviting them to settle Vojvodina in the hand of <unk> Đaković , a priest riding beside Arsenije . Although these changes were made relatively quickly , Jovanović could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest . Hence , only the Vršac triptych was displayed at the Millennium Exhibition . 
 Migration of the Serbs was unveiled at the Archbishop 's palace in Sremski Karlovci in 1896 . It was kept there until 1941 , when Ustaše fascists looted the palace and stole it , cut it out of its frame and took it to Zagreb , where it remained until the end of the war . After the war , the painting was returned to Serbia , briefly put on display at Belgrade 's National Museum , and then given back to the Serbian Orthodox Church . It was ultimately put on display at the patriarchate building in Belgrade , where it remains . It began undergoing restoration in 2004 . 
 = = = Other versions = = = 
 While working on the copy that the Patriarch had commissioned , Jovanović began a second version of the painting , one that retained the woman and her child , the herd of sheep and the wagons carrying refugees . This , Filipovitch @-@ Robinson asserts , is indicative of " Jovanović 's firmness of conviction and artistic integrity . " The second version was smaller than the first , measuring 126 by 190 centimetres ( 50 by 75 in ) . Like the first , it was completed in 1896 , and came to be called the " Pančevo version " as it was acquired by the Pančevo Museum in the 1970s . Shortly after its completion , the rights to the Pančevo version were purchased by Zagreb art collector Petar Nikolić , who secured the right to publish lithographic reproductions of the paining for the next fifty years . Such prints became quite popular , and could be found in Serb homes up to the end of the 20th century . As the Pančevo version was the first to be lithographically reproduced , it became the best known rendition . It was displayed at the 1900 Exposition Universelle ( world 's fair ) in Paris . 
 At the height of World War II , Jovanović created a third version on behalf of a Belgrade physician named <unk> <unk> , who requested that the figure of Monasterlija 's wife bear her likeness . This version measured 65 @.@ 2 by 96 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 25 @.@ 7 by 38 @.@ 0 in ) . Its current whereabouts are unknown , and it is presumed lost . In 1945 , as the war neared its end , a wealthy Serbian merchant named Milenko Čavić commissioned a fourth and final version , incorrectly assuming that the others had been destroyed in the fighting . Čavić gifted the painting to the <unk> family at the war 's end . They emigrated to the United States following the communist takeover of Yugoslavia in 1945 , and took it with them to New York . This version was returned to Belgrade in 2009 , and is currently on display at Princess Ljubica 's Residence . It measures 100 by 150 centimetres ( 39 by 59 in ) .

 The painting was well received in Serbia and abroad ; it has since attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture . An allusion to it is made in Emir Kusturica 's Underground , where war refugees are depicted marching towards Belgrade in similar fashion , following the German bombing of the city in April 1941 . Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović 's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history . Historian Katarina <unk> observes that there are striking similarities between the painting and photographs of the Royal Serbian Army 's retreat to the Adriatic coast during World War I. Judah remarks that the composition resembles images of the exodus of Krajina Serbs following Croatia 's Operation Storm in August 1995 . 
 The journalist John Kifner describes Migration of the Serbs as a " Balkan equivalent to Washington Crosses the Delaware ... an instantly recognizable [ icon ] of the 500 @-@ year struggle against the Ottoman Turks . " Professor David A. Norris , a historian specializing in Serbian culture , calls Jovanović 's approach " highly effective " , and writes how the stoic attitude of the priests , warriors and peasants reminds the viewer of the historical significance of the migration . He asserts that Migration of the Serbs and similar paintings stimulated a " revived collective memory " among the new Serbian middle class , " transforming ... folk memory into a more modern vehicle for the invention of a new national ideology based on the Serbian struggle for freedom from foreign domination . " Art historian Michele <unk> describes the painting as a celebration of the Serbs ' " valiant effort to defend Christian Europe against ... the Ottoman Turks . " The historian Noel Malcolm doubts the historical veracity of depictions of Arsenije leading vast columns of refugees , saying there is no concrete evidence to confirm or deny that the number of migrants exceeded 40 @,@ 000 , as Church leaders claimed . 
 Filipovitch @-@ Robinson ranks the painting among Jovanović 's three best works , alongside The Takovo Uprising ( 1888 ) and The Proclamation of Dušan 's Law Codex ( 1900 ) . This view is shared by the art historian Jelena Milojković @-@ Djurić , as well as Judah . Filipovitch @-@ Robinson praises Jovanović 's " uncompromising realism " and commends his portrayal of the migrants . She writes that the Pančevo version " validates Jovanović as an insightful commentator on ... Balkan history " , and is indicative of " the methodology and technical skill which had already brought him international acclaim . " Jovanović " persuades the viewer of the believability and authenticity of the event , " she writes . " He captures the determination , strength , and dignity of a people . [ ... ] Regardless of the reasons for this migration , they move forward in unison to meet the hard challenges of an unknown land . "

 The episode received moderately positive reviews from critics . Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode an 8 @.@ 0 out of 10 , signifying a " great " episode . Fickett wrote that " Hot Girl " helped to establish what type of character Michael would eventually become in the subsequent seasons , noting the character 's " deep and desperate loneliness " which would eventually become a main conceit in the series . He concluded that the episode ended with a " classic Office moment " — Michael realizing that Jim will be giving Katy a ride home — that " captures the desperation and loneliness of [ Pam , Jim , and Michael ] – and does a great job of setting the stage for the show 's terrific second season . " Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B but described it as " the weakest of the first season . " Alli noted that the episode was largely the " play on the same joke , " featuring Michael and Dwight " making idiots of themselves over Katy . " However , she did positively compare the American version of the show to the British version , stating , " All things considered , I think the first season is very underrated owing to unnecessary comparisons to the British version , " but concluded that the episode was " its weak moment . " 
 Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " . Adams largely praised Fischer 's performance , noting that she " helped build her character ’ s arc every step of the way " in the series , and that several of her moments in " Hot Girl " helped to emphasize this point . Furthermore , he complimented the appearance of Katy , noting that it she both causes a rift between Pam and Jim , but due to " the confidence of Adams ’ performance and some hidden compartments in Kaling ’ s script " , she also has " legitimate agency " .

 = Theatre Royal , Bath = 
 The Theatre Royal in Bath , England , was built in 1805 . A Grade II * listed building , it has been described by the Theatres Trust as " One of the most important surviving examples of Georgian theatre architecture " . It has a capacity for an audience of around 900 . 
 The Theatre Royal was built to replace the Old Orchard Street Theatre , funded by a Tontine and elaborately decorated . The architect was George Dance the Younger , with John Palmer carrying out much of the work . It opened with a performance of Shakespeare 's Richard III and hosted performances by many leading actors of the time including Dorothea Jordan , William Macready and Edmund Kean . A major fire in 1862 destroyed the interior of the building and was quickly followed by a rebuilding programme by Charles J. Phipps , which included the construction of the current entrance . Further redecoration was undertaken in 1892 ; more extensive building work , including a new staircase and the installation of electric lighting , followed in 1902 . Despite performances by casts including Sarah Bernhardt , the ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell , the theatre was rarely very profitable . During World War II Donald Wolfit , Irene Vanbrugh , John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike appeared , with shows including Noël Coward 's Private Lives and Blyth Spirit , a performance by Ballet Rambert and light entertainment such as Charley 's Aunt , but audiences declined . 
 In 1979 the theatre was bought by a trust and , following public donations , it underwent refurbishment , with the rebuilding of the stage and the installation of a new taller fly tower for scenery and lighting . In 1997 a new 150 seat theatre , known as the Ustinov Studio , was opened . Further restoration work to the main auditorium was needed in 2010 . In 2005 a children 's theatre known as The Egg was opened . The complex also includes bars and restaurants . The Theatre Royal is host to several annual events , including the Family Theatre Festival and the Shakespeare Unplugged Festival .

 = = = Construction = = = 
 The theatre was erected in 1805 , replacing the Old Orchard Street Theatre which had obtained a royal patent in 1768 enabling the use of the title ' Theatre Royal ' , the first to achieve this outside London . The Orchard Street site became a church and is now a Freemason 's Hall . The new theatre was first proposed in 1802 at several sites in Bath until the current site was chosen in 1804 ; funding was raised by the use of a Tontine , an investment plan named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti , who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653 . It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery . Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund , and thereafter receives an annuity . As members die , their shares devolve to the other participants , and so the value of each annuity increases . On the death of the last member , the scheme is wound up . Shares which cost £ 200 were rapidly purchased with the prince regent who later became George IV and his bother Prince Frederick among the subscribers . A similar scheme had previously been used for the construction of the Bath Assembly Rooms . 
 The exterior of the building , with arches , pilasters , garlands and ornaments , which is visible from <unk> Square , was designed by George Dance the Younger who also designed the decorative sections of the interior . The main fabric of the building was by John Palmer , who supervised the construction . The ceiling was decorated with panels from Fonthill <unk> , a mile from Fonthill Abbey , which were painted by Andrea <unk> and donated to the theatre by Paul Cobb Methuen . Because of the potential damage from the gas lights , which were installed in 1827 , the paintings were moved by William Blathwayt to Dyrham Park . 
 The opening night was on 12 October 1805 was a production of Richard III , with an unknown actor in the lead . Though not a success , the theatre soon established a good reputation and thrived under the management of William Wyatt Dimond . Early performances included appearances by the child actors Master Betty and Clara Fisher , with adult leads from prominent actors on the London stage including Dorothea Jordan , William Macready and Edmund Kean . In addition to Shakespeare and other serious drama , the productions included opera and comedy with Joseph Grimaldi playing the clown in a pantomime of Mother Goose in November 1815 . 
 Between the 1810s and 1850s there were a series of changes in ownership and management . These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath 's popularity ; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London . As a result , the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline . Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute , who was the manager of the Bath Assembly Rooms and the son @-@ in @-@ law of the owner Mrs Macready , took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise . 
 = = = Fire and rebuilding = = = 
 On 18 April 1862 a major fire destroyed the interior of the building including the stage , scenery , wardrobe and library , leaving just the exterior walls still standing . A new company was formed to rebuild the theatre and a competition held for designs . The winner was C.J. Phipps and rebuilding , which included the new entrance on Sawclose , quickly followed . The present main entrance to the Theatre Royal , in Sawclose , was built in 1720 by Thomas Greenway , and was previously at Beau Nash 's house . Pevsner criticizes the mouldings of window @-@ frames , frieze and volutes of the door @-@ hood brackets as " characteristically overdone " , and mentions Wood citing its " profuse ornament " which was typical of a mason rather than an architect . Chute remained as manager and employed Charles Kean and Ellen Terry to play in A Midsummer Night 's Dream on the opening night , 3 March 1863 . 
 Initially the reopened theatre struggled to become profitable despite appearances by Henry Irving among others . In 1885 William Lewis took over as the lessee and was followed , in 1892 , by his son Egbert Lewis . They redecorated the theatre in 1892 and attracted larger regular audiences to performances of melodrama and comedy while starting to put on Gilbert and Sullivan operas and other attractions . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 In 1902 the theatre closed for nine months to enable extensive building work to be carried out in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter . This involved a new staircase , the installation of electric lighting , a new fire curtain and hot water radiators throughout the auditorium . In 1905 , on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal , numerous William Shakespeare 's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson . 
 In 1914 the theatre impresario Arthur Carlton , from Worcester , took over the lease . As he was responsible for 14 theatres around the country at the time , he appointed Mrs D. <unk> Munro as the local manager . Performances were maintained during World War I , and in 1916 Sarah Bernhardt portrayed a wounded male French soldier in Du Théâtre au Champ d 'Honneur . In the 1920s there were appearances by the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell . During the Great Depression of the 1930s the theatre was not profitable and closed completely for six months . In 1938 the lease was taken over by Reg Maddox , whose family were involved with the theatre for the next 40 years . During World War II the theatre fared better , with appearances by prominent actors including Donald Wolfit , Irene Vanbrugh , John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike . In the Post @-@ War years , receipts suffered as audiences dwindled in the face of competition from cinema and television . Unsuccessful proposals were made for a trust to run the theatre in 1968 , and in the 1970s , shares in the owning company were bought by the property developer Charles Ware , who sold to Charles Clarke , a solicitor from Bristol . Clarke was responsible for a redecoration of the building , but as profits were still small , in 1976 he sold it to Louis I. Michaels , who ran the Haymarket Theatre in London . 
 In March 1979 , the dilapidated theatre was purchased by a trust headed by Jeremy Fry for £ 155 @,@ 000 . The following year , an appeal was launched to raise money for renovations , including the complete rebuilding of the stage , installation of a steel grid to hold stage lighting and scenery and a higher fly system , to allow major touring companies , including the Royal National Theatre under Peter Hall , to be booked to perform . The total projected cost was £ 3 @.@ 5 million , of which £ 1 @.@ 8 million was seen as being essential to reopening the theatre . Money and donations in kind were received from the city council , Arts Council England , Bath Preservation Trust , Leche Trust , Historic buildings council , Manifold Trust , South @-@ West <unk> and Restoration Company and many individuals . Work on the building started to designs by <unk> and Hurst . However , as insufficient funds had been raised by 1982 to complete the work , loans were negotiated with the Bristol & West and Lombard North Central with guarantees from local councils . The theatre reopened on 30 November 1982 with a performance of A Midsummer Night 's Dream , featuring a cast from the National Theatre lead by Paul Scofield . The event was attended by Princess Margaret , Countess of Snowdon . 
 = = = 2010 refurbishment = = = 
 In October 2009 , the ' 2010 Refurbishment Appeal ' was launched by Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall , Royal Patron of the Theatre Royal Bath , to raise money for a programme of work to preserve the 200 @-@ year @-@ old building , while ensuring that it remained suitable for 21st @-@ century audiences . The £ <unk> refurbishment by Fry , the most extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before , included an expanded foyer , improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels , complete refurbishment of the bars and the creation of The Jeremy Fry Bar , in the former cellars of The Garrick 's Head pub , and redecoration of the auditorium . Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage , and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building , with new fire alarm systems , air @-@ conditioning and lighting , all designed to improve the building 's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30 % . The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios , and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work . 
 A successful campaign , led by writer and novelist Bel Mooney , who had been instrumental in previous fund @-@ raising campaigns for the Theatre Royal Bath , saw almost a third of the money raised through donations and sponsorship , enabling work to begin away from public areas in March 2010 . The theatre 's Main House was closed in July 2010 , to allow the work on the foyer , bars and auditorium to be completed . 
 The official re @-@ opening took place on Wednesday , 8 September 2010 , just ten and a half months after the original campaign was launched , with the building work being completed on schedule . The ceremonial re @-@ opening was performed on @-@ stage by actors Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles , who were starring in the Theatre Royal 's own production of The Rivals , Richard Brinsley Sheridan 's classic Restoration comedy , set in and around 18th @-@ century Bath . In 2011 , the theatre won a British Construction Industry Award Conservation Award . 
 The theatre itself is said to be haunted by several ghosts including the Grey Lady , who was an actress centuries ago . She has been seen watching productions in the Grey Lady Box , and she leaves the distinctive scent of jasmine . She has purportedly been seen and scented in recent years . 
 = = Architecture and features = = 
 The theatre , along with the neighbouring Garrick 's Head public house , is a Grade II * listed building and is considered a prime example of Georgian architecture . The oldest part of the building is the former Garrick 's Head on St John 's Close . The three storey five bay building , with a basement , has a hipped roof with a part @-@ balustraded parapet . Above the door is a bust of David Garrick , which was made in 1831 by Lucius Gahagan . The <unk> Square side of the building , originally designed by George Dance the Younger , is of five bays with pilasters carrying a frieze of comic and tragic muses . The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries . The east front , now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose , was altered from a plain six @-@ bay entrance by the addition of the round @-@ arched foyer hiding four of the original bays . The 900 seat auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork , with red and gilt decoration , and a trompe @-@ l 'œil ceiling and glittering chandelier . It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan , supported by cast iron pillars . 
 In 2017 the Sawclose area between the current Theatre Royal main entrance and the former Bluecoat School is to be made into a pedestrian @-@ friendly shared space area for pedestrians , cyclists and cars . 
 = = = Ustinov Studio = = = 
 In 1997 , a studio theatre was built at the rear of the building on Monmouth Street , called the Ustinov Studio , named after the actor Peter Ustinov . The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son , Igor Ustinov , entitled Hopefully . The 150 @-@ seat auditorium was originally a space for the youth theatre and small @-@ scale touring productions , but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts , stand @-@ up comedy ( including high @-@ profile acts such as Bill Bailey , Stewart Lee and Lucy Porter ) and in @-@ house productions . To accommodate the technical needs of these productions , a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007 , improving the backstage & technical facilities , the foyer , bar and auditorium . The Ustinov Studio re @-@ opened in February 2008 , with their own production of Breakfast With Mugabe , starring Joseph Marcell , Miles Anderson and Nicholas Bailey . 
 As of 2015 , the studio is led by the Artistic Director Laurence Boswell . In the 2012 American Season at the Ustinov Studio , Sarah Ruhl 's In the Next Room ( or The Vibrator Play ) was the winner of the Best New Play — Theatre Awards UK 2012 and nominated for three Tony Awards . The Ustinov Studio was also nominated for the prestigious Empty Space ... Peter Brook Award 2012 . The Daily Telegraph 's Dominic Cavendish praised the venue as a " constantly bubbling fount of marvels " at the awards ceremony . The Ustinov also received a second consecutive nomination for the 2013 awards . 
 In Autumn 2013 , the Ustinov presented The Spanish Golden Age Season , three new translations of rarely seen plays . These included the tragedy Punishment without Revenge , and the romantic comedies Don Gil of the Green Breeches and A Lady of Little Sense , which ran in repertory with a cast of ten actors in all three plays between September and December 2013 . It was later transferred to the <unk> Theatre . 
 In Summer 2014 , the Ustinov Studio presented a new comedy , ' Bad Jews ' , and in November of the same year , a black comedy by Florian Zeller , ' The Father ' starring Kenneth Cranham . Both of these plays have gone on to huge national and international success in following two years , running almost continuously on several tours and West End transfers , culminating in Kenneth Cranham winning the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Play at the 2016 Awards Ceremony .

 = Desert Inn = 
 The Desert Inn , also known as the D.I. , was a casino hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise , Nevada , which operated from April 24 , 1950 , to August 28 , 2000 . Designed by architect Hugh Taylor and interior design by Jac <unk> , it was the fifth resort to open on the Strip . It was situated between Desert Inn Road and Sands Avenue . 
 The Desert Inn opened with 300 rooms and the Sky Room restaurant , headed by a chef formerly of the Ritz Paris , which once had the highest vantage point on the Las Vegas Strip . The casino , at 2 @,@ 400 square feet ( 220 m2 ) , was one of the largest in Nevada at the time . The 9 @-@ storey St. Andrews Tower was completed during the first renovation in 1963 , and the 14 @-@ storey Augusta Tower became the Desert Inn 's main tower when it was completed in 1978 along with the seven @-@ story Wimbledon Tower . The Palms Tower was completed in 1997 with the second and final renovation . The Desert Inn was the first hotel in Las Vegas to feature a fountain at the entrance . In 1997 , the Desert Inn underwent a $ 200 million renovation and expansion , but after it was purchased for $ 270 million by Steve Wynn in 2000 , he decided to demolish it and build a new hotel and resort . The remaining towers of the Desert Inn were imploded in 2004 . Today , the Wynn and Encore stands where the hotel once stood . 
 The original performance venue at the Desert Inn was the Painted Desert Room , later the Crystal Room , which opened in 1950 with 450 seats . Frank Sinatra made his Las Vegas debut there on September 13 , 1951 and became a regular performer . The property included an 18 @-@ hole golf course which hosted the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions from 1953 to 1966 . The golf course is now a part of the Wynn resort . 
 = = History = = 
 The hotel was situated at <unk> Las Vegas Boulevard South , between Desert Inn Road and Sands Avenue . The original name for many years was Wilbur Clark 's Desert Inn . Wilbur Clark , described by Frank Sinatra biographer James Kaplan as a " onetime San Diego bellhop and Reno craps dealer " , originally began building the resort with his brother in 1947 with $ 250 @,@ 000 , but he ran out of money . Author Hal Rothman notes that " for nearly two years the framed structure sat in the hot desert sun , looking more like an ancient relic than a nascent casino " . Clark approached the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for investment , but they were struggling financially . In 1949 , he met with Moe Dalitz , the head of the notorious Cleveland gang , the Mayfield Road Mob , and Dalitz agreed to fund 75 % of the project with $ 1 @.@ 3 million , and construction resumed . Much of the financing came from the American National Insurance Company ( ANICO ) , though Clark became the public frontman of the resort while Dalitz remained quietly in the background as the principal owner . The resort would eventually be renamed Desert Inn , and was affectionately called the " D.I. " by Las Vegas locals and regular guests . 
 The Desert Inn opened formally on April 24 , 1950 , at a two @-@ day gala which was heavily publicized nationally . Journalists from all of the major newspapers and magazines were invited , and the hotel paid $ 5 @,@ 700 to cover air tickets . 150 invitations were sent out by Clark to VIPs with a credit limit of $ 10 @,@ 000 . About half the attendees at the opening were from California and Nevada . At the opening show in the Painted Desert Room were performers such as Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy , Vivian Blaine , Pat Patrick , The Donn Arden Dancers , Van Heflin , Abbott and Costello and the Desert Inn Orchestra , led by Ray Noble . In attendance were a number of mafiosi , including Black Bill Tocco , Joe <unk> , Sam Maceo , Peter Licavoli and Frank Malone in a gala which Barbara Greenspun believed marked the beginning of heavy involvement of the mafia in the development of Las Vegas . Sidney <unk> was one of its early investors . 
 The Desert Inn became known for its " opulence " and top @-@ notch service . The first manager of the Desert Inn had previously worked as the manager at the Clift Hotel in San Francisco . Lew and Edie Wasserman were frequent guests of the hotel . During the 1950s , the hotel often hosted the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , Winston Churchill , Adlai Stevenson , Senator John F. Kennedy , and former President Harry S. Truman . 
 In 1959 , Lawrence Wien , owner of New York City 's Plaza Hotel purchased the hotel , but signed a management deal for Clark to remain as manager . In the early 1960s , the mafia @-@ financed casino hotels of the Las Vegas Strip and Nevada came under close scrutiny by the FBI , and they placed increased pressure on the Nevada Gaming Control Board to force the mobsters out of Las Vegas . After Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises of Frank Sinatra 's Cal Neva Lodge & Casino at Lake Tahoe , his gambling license was removed by the Board and he was forced to sell up and forfeit his share in the Sands Hotel and Casino . The Desert Inn faced similar scrutiny by the FBI , attracting controversy at the same time for the involvement of Dalitz and his mobster associates , but simultaneously called for the prosecution of the FBI for illegal wiretapping . In 1964 , Clark sold his remaining share in the hotel to Dalitz and business associates Morris Kleinman , Thomas McGinty and Sam Tucker . He died of a heart attack the following year . The bell captain of the Desert Inn , Jack Butler , remembered Clark : " Wilbur was the greatest guy . Without him this town never would 've got off the ground . Everyone came into the club just to see him and he was all over the postcards . He was the only boss who would agree to have his picture taken " . 
 The Desert Inn 's most famous guest , businessman Howard Hughes , arrived on Thanksgiving Day 1966 , renting the hotel 's entire top two floors . After staying past his initial ten @-@ day reservation , he was asked to leave in December so that the resort could accommodate the high rollers who were expected for New Year 's Eve . Instead of leaving , Hughes started negotiations to buy the Desert Inn . On March 27 , 1967 , Hughes purchased the resort from Dalitz for $ 6 @.@ 2 million in cash and $ 7 million in loans . This was the first of many Las Vegas resort purchases by Hughes , including the Sands Hotel and Casino ( $ 14 @.@ 6 million ) and the Frontier Hotel and Casino ( $ 23 million ) . However , Hughes refused to include the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions in the deal , so Dalitz moved the tournament to his Stardust Resort and Casino in 1967 and 1968 . 
 The reclusive Hughes continued to live in his penthouse suite at the Desert Inn for four years , never leaving his 250 square feet ( 23 m2 ) bedroom . Usually unclothed , he spent his time " negotiating purchases and business deals with the curtains drawn and windows and doors sealed shut with tape " , and did not allow anyone from the hotel staff to come in and clean his room . On the eve of Thanksgiving 1970 , he was removed from his room on a stretcher and flown to the Bahamas . After Hughes 's death in 1976 , the hotel remained under the Summa Corporation , who completed the extensive renovation that he had ordered . Summa sold the hotel to Kirk Kerkorian and the <unk> Corporation in 1986 , and it became known as the MGM Desert Inn . Kerkorian sold it to ITT @-@ Sheraton in 1993 for $ 160 million .

 In 1992 , Frank Sinatra celebrated his 77th birthday at the hotel in an event which generated much media attention . Dick Taylor , the CEO of public relations firm Rogers & Cowan recalled : " We had the stars assemble in the casino 's presidential suite and then took them in <unk> to the entrance of the hotel , where the press and hundreds of fans were gathered , like a Hollywood movie premiere . The stars were interviewed on the red carpet and in they went to the famed Crystal Room . It was a very big deal . " 
 In 1997 , the Desert Inn underwent a $ 200 million renovation of the Augusta Tower and St. Andrews Tower and expansion , with the building and completion of the Palms Tower and it was sold the following year to Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide . Due to losing money , Starwood immediately put the hotel back up for sale , and sold it to Sun International Hotels Ltd. on May 19 , 1999 for $ 275 million . That year , Sinatra 's and the Rat Pack 's estate managers , Sheffield Enterprises Inc . , sued the Desert Inn , claiming an infringement of rights in their use of Sinatra 's name and persona in its advertising and sales , including the words " Frank " , " Ol ' Blue Eyes , " " the chairman of the Board " and " The Rat Pack " . Sinatra 's estate specifically objected to their use in " billboard advertising , marquees , alcoholic beverages and wine menus , and on the front and back of tee @-@ shirts and caps at its gift shop " and alleged photographs of Sinatra and his signature on the walls behind the bar near the entrance to the Starlight Lounge of the Desert Inn . 
 The Desert Inn celebrated its 50th anniversary on April 24 , 2000 . Celebrations were held for a week and a celebrity golf tournament was held with the likes of Robert Loggia , Chris O 'Donnell , Robert Urich , Susan Anton , Vincent Van Patten and Tony Curtis . As part of the festivities , a time capsule was buried in a granite burial chamber on April 25 , to be reopened on April 25 , 2050 . Three days later , on April 27 , the resort was purchased for $ 270 million by Steve Wynn . Wynn closed the Desert Inn at 2 : 00 a.m. on August 28 , 2000 . 
 On October 23 , 2001 , the Augusta Tower , the Desert Inn 's southernmost building , was imploded to make room for a mega resort that Wynn planned to build . Coming a month after the September 11 attacks , the implosion was marked with less fanfare than previous Las Vegas demolition spectacles due to its similarity to the implosion of the Twin Towers . Originally intended to be named Le Rêve , the new project opened as Wynn Las Vegas . The remaining two towers , the St. Andrews Tower and Palms Tower were both temporarily used as the Wynn Gallery , spanning 1 @,@ 316 square feet ( 122 @.@ 3 m2 ) to display some of Wynn 's art collection . The St. Andrews Tower and Palms Tower were finally imploded on November 16 , 2004 .

 The initial hotel , a $ 6 @.@ 5 million property set in 200 acres , was designed by Hugh Taylor who was hired after Wilbur Clark and Wayne McAllister could not agree on the design . Interiors were by noted New York architect Jac <unk> . The property conveyed the image of a " southwestern spa " that was " half ranch house , half nightclub " . It was built of " cinder blocks but trimmed with sandstone and finished throughout the inside with redwood " . The logo of the hotel was a Joshua tree cactus . The driveway into the hotel passed under an " old @-@ fashioned ranch sign " bearing the name Wilbur Clark 's Desert Inn in scripted letters . The Desert Inn was the first hotel in Las Vegas to feature a fountain at the entrance . A " Dancing Waters " show involved the fountain jets choreographed to music . 
 The interior of the hotel was finished in redwood with flagstone flooring . The public space included a registration area , a casino , two bars , a coffee shop , a restaurant , various commercial shops and services , and a broadcasting station for K @-@ RAM radio . Guest rooms were located in wings situated behind the main building , surrounding the figure @-@ eight swimming pool . The hotel originally had 300 rooms , each outfitted with air conditioning with individual thermostats . 
 The lounge was located in a three @-@ story , glass @-@ sided tower at the front of the hotel known as the Sky Room , which was the largest structure on the Strip at the time of its construction and commanded views of the mountains and desert all around , as well as overlooked the " Dancing Waters " feature . The Sky Room restaurant was headed by a chef formerly of the Ritz Paris . 
 The original performance venue at the Desert Inn was the 450 seat Painted Desert Room , later the Crystal Room , which opened in 1950 with 450 seats . Charles <unk> created the handpainted murals , and a " band car " was used to move the orchestra within the showroom . Next door was a restaurant , the Cactus Room . The Kachina Doll Ranch was a supervised play area for guests ' children . The hotel had a ladies salon and health club from the outset . Another performance venue at the hotel was the Lady Luck Lounge . 
 The hotel first underwent renovation in the early 1960s , during which the St. Andrews Tower was built in 1963 . In the 1970s , the hotel underwent a $ 54 @-@ million renovation under Howard Hughes , which resumed under the responsibility of the Summa Corporation after his death in 1976 . The 14 @-@ story Augusta Tower became the Desert Inn 's main tower when it was completed in 1978 . The seven @-@ story Wimbledon Tower contained duplex suites , and resembled a modern version of a Mayan pyramid . It overlooked the golf course and was built at the same time , bringing the total room count to 825 . By 1978 , most of the 1950s structures on the property had been replaced with modern buildings and the property was renamed the Desert Inn and Country Club . It featured full country club amenities open to guests of the hotel , including a club house , driving range , pro shop , restaurant and lounge at the golf club ; 10 tournament @-@ class outdoor tennis courts ; and a 18 @,@ 000 feet ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) spa . Three restaurants were added : the " small , intimate " Monte Carlo Room , the " gourmet " Portofino Room , and the Ho Wan Chinese restaurant . At the time of its sale to ITT @-@ Sheraton in 1993 , the Desert Inn had the largest frontage of any casino hotel on the Las Vegas Strip , measuring 1 @,@ 700 feet ( 520 m ) feet . 
 In 1997 , the Desert Inn underwent a $ 200 million renovation and expansion by Steelman Partners , giving it a new Mediterranean @-@ looking exterior with white stucco and red clay tile roofs . The room count was reduced to 715 to provide more luxurious accommodations . The nine @-@ story Palm Tower was completed , the lagoon @-@ style pool was added , and notable changes were made to the Grand Lobby Atrium , Starlight Lounge , Villas Del Lago , and new golf shop and country club . The seven @-@ story lobby , fully built in marble , was also a major part of the renovation .

Hundreds of coin @-@ operated gambling machines – including slot machines , video poker , 21 , and keno – were installed during the 1978 renovation . The casino acquired a reputation for attracting the high rollers . On January 27 , 2000 , the <unk> jackpot record for Las Vegas was broken when $ 34 @,@ 955 @,@ 489 was won by an anonymous gambler at the Desert Inn , playing a bank of six <unk> machines near the hotel 's coffee shop . 
 = = = Golf course and country club = = = 
 The 18 @-@ hole , par @-@ 72 Desert Inn Golf Club opened in 1952 . Initially , Dalitz had pushed the idea of opening a golf course next to the hotel with an entrance off the Strip , which would be accessible to other hotels and boost the city 's profile as a resort destination . When other hotel owners rejected this idea , Dalitz built the course on the hotel premises . He also opened an outdoor dining area , to accommodate golfers and swimmers who might prefer a more informal atmosphere . The course hosted the PGA Tour Tournament of Champions from 1953 to 1966 , attracting professional golfers such as Sam Snead , Arnold Palmer , and Jack Nicklaus . Allard Roen was director of the tournament for many years , and was instrumental in breaking down the racial barrier on the Strip . He broke the all @-@ white club convention by permitting Sammy Davis , Jr. to play on the course . From 1958 it hosted the Golf Cup Golf Tournament , the largest tournament in the world for amateur golfers . 
 According to the Las Vegas Sun , the course " held the distinction of being the only golf course in the United States to have annually hosted three championship tour events – the PGA Tour 's Las Vegas Invitational , the Las Vegas Senior Classic and the LPGA Las Vegas International " . The Panasonic Las Vegas Invitational , now the Las Vegas Invitational , returned to the Desert Inn in 1983 , and became known as the wealthiest PGA event in the world . It has since been won by the likes of Fuzzy Zoeller , Curtis Strange , Greg Norman , and Paul <unk> . The Las Vegas Senior Classic event at the Desert Inn was added to the Senior PGA Tour in 1986 , and has since been won by Bruce Crampton ( 1986 ) , Al <unk> , who equaled the course record at the time of 62 ( 1987 ) , Larry Mowry ( 1988 ) and Lee Trevino ( 1992 ) . 
 Wilbur Clark was the first to build a home on the golf course in the 1950s . Additional homes were added to the Desert Inn Country Club Estates from the 1960s on . During his ownership of the hotel , Howard Hughes built 100 residential units on the property . After Steve Wynn purchased the resort in 2000 and announced that the real estate was too valuable to leave as a golf course , homeowners were forced to sell their properties to Wynn and his property developer Irwin <unk> . <unk> bought homes closest to the golf course for $ 2 million each , and homes on the perimeter of the resort for $ 900 @,@ 000 to $ 1 @.@ 2 million each . The Junior League of Las Vegas convinced Wynn to save one house from demolition and moved it to a lot in downtown Las Vegas to serve as its headquarters . This was the Morelli House , designed by architect Hugh Taylor for Antonio Morelli , a " rare example of modernist architecture in Las Vegas " . The house was subsequently listed on the City and State historic registers .

 Almost every major star of the latter half of the 20th century played at the Desert Inn . Frank Sinatra made his Las Vegas debut at the Desert Inn on September 13 , 1951 . He later said of it : " Wilbur Clark gave me my first job in Las Vegas . That was in 1951 . For six bucks you got a filet mignon dinner and me " . Noël Coward performed at the Inn on one occasion for an entire month . In 1954 , after a performance at the Desert Inn , Betty Hutton announced one of her several retirements . Eddie Fisher was heckled by a disguised Elizabeth Taylor during a 1961 performance , in a year which saw Dinah Shore booked for her fourth performance and debut Vegas performances at the Desert Inn by both Benny Goodman and Rosemary Clooney . In 1979 , Jet magazine noted that Wayne Newton was " enthroned " at the Desert inn as king of entertainment idols " , earning $ 10 million a year , which made him the highest @-@ paid nightclub performer of all time . Other performers in its famous " crystal showroom " over the years included Patti Page , Ted Lewis , Joe E.

Orson Welles ' film F for Fake covers , among other topics , the scandal of a fake biography of Howard Hughes , and the billionaire 's Desert Inn residence is illustrated by Welles . In the 1985 film Lost in America , Julie Hagerty 's character Linda Howard loses the couple 's " nest egg " at the Desert Inn , leading to a memorable scene in which Albert Brooks ' character David Howard tries to convince the Casino manager ( Garry Marshall ) to give them their money back . David , an ad man , proposes a campaign centered around the generosity of the casino in his case , replete with a jingle : " The Desert Inn has heart ... The Desert Inn has heart . " The opening scene to the 1993 film Sister Act 2 : Back in the Habit took place in the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel . The Desert Inn saw its last commercial use in the 2001 film Rush Hour 2 , shortly before it was imploded . It was converted into the " Red Dragon " , an Asian @-@ themed casino set . 
 The hotel served as the primary backdrop for the TV show Vega $ which aired on ABC from 1978 to 1981 . The 1980s Aaron Spelling soap opera Dynasty included footage of the hotel , and use of the Presidential Suite . The hit 1980s NBC TV series , Remington Steele , filmed their 60th Las Vegas @-@ set episode at the inn , where both the exterior and interior are shown regularly throughout the episode .

 The closure of the Desert Inn in 2000 and subsequent demolition was unpopular with many as it seemed to mark the end of old Las Vegas . Historian Michael Green stated : " To a lot of people outside of Las Vegas , these two places ( the Desert Inn and the Sands ) really meant Las Vegas . These were the places that represent the images of Las Vegas , in a far greater way than the Dunes , the Aladdin , the Hacienda and the Landmark " . Robert <unk> , Howard Hughes 's publicist for many years , remarked that the " Desert Inn was the gem of Las Vegas " . The hotel remained popular with locals until the end , as the heavily tourism @-@ driven modern Las Vegas emerged in the 1990s . 
 Desert Inn Road , an east @-@ west Las Vegas Valley roadway , still exists . It is the only major east @-@ west surface street on the Strip that does not connect to Las Vegas Boulevard .

 Reptile is a video game character from the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise . Created for Midway Games by John Tobias and Ed Boon , Reptile debuted in Mortal Kombat as a hidden boss and appeared in subsequent titles as a playable character , also appearing in the merchandise and other media related to the series . 
 Reptile is a Raptor , a nearly @-@ extinct bipedal humanoid race of reptilian creatures and loyally serves the series ' recurring villain Shao Kahn in hope that his race will be revived . Reptile has been featured in almost every title in the series under the same pretenses , and until the 2011 reboot , he had yet to be rewarded for his efforts . Critical reception to the character has been positive , with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character . 
 = = Conception and history = = 
 Included in the first game late in the development process , Reptile 's character concept was conceived while Boon was driving back to work from lunch . Noting the success of utilizing a palette swap method for Scorpion and Sub @-@ Zero 's character sprites , he and Tobias decided to include a " super secret hidden feature " in Mortal Kombat , choosing Reptile 's green color as a contrast to Scorpion 's original yellow and Sub @-@ Zero 's blue colors . Developed with the premise of being " a cooler version of Scorpion " , the character 's concept was completed in a single evening . Reptile 's inclusion was intended as a marketing tool for the arcade game : as extreme conditions must be met to encounter Reptile , the designers hoped to rely on word of mouth to spread rumors of the character 's existence . However , the character was not included in the title until version 3 @.@ 0 of the game . 
 Reptile 's appearance caused fans to speculate that he could be unlocked and used as a controllable character . Boon noted in a later interview that due to the popularity of the rumors surrounding the character , they decided to include Reptile in subsequent installments of the series as a playable fighter . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Reptile was originally depicted as a tall , muscular , light @-@ skinned humanoid . Due to his origin as a palette swap of Scorpion and Sub @-@ Zero , his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green . His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his lower body , along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood . Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs , while an open V @-@ shaped green vest protected his torso , extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth . He wears a green facial mask as part of his ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature , however he does remove the mask in @-@ game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality . Reptile stands 6 feet ( 183 cm ) tall , and speaks in a hissing tone . 
 In Mortal Kombat 4 , Reptile 's appearance became more reptilian , with his head completely uncovered . His hands became clawed , while his feet were now three @-@ toed talons . By Deadly Alliance , Reptile had developed a full reptilian head and tail , with gold and black armor to cover his legs , elbows , shoulders , and belt . Bone spurs extended from the base of his skull down his spine , ending at the tip of his tail , while a similar spur extended from his heel on each foot . Ed Boon described the changes to Reptile 's design over the course of the two games as hinting at him " evolving into a bigger character " , and foreshadowing Onaga controlling his body in Deception . 
 Reptile 's appearance in Shaolin Monks used an amalgam of his three previous designs , intended by character designer Mark Lappin to portray a classic yet fresh feel for the character . The design incorporated the appearance of his body from Mortal Kombat 4 , his clothing from the original Mortal Kombat , and the look of his feet , hands , and armor from Deadly Alliance . In addition , black strips of cloth wrapped around his forearms , hands , and head , leaving his eyes and mouth exposed . The design was later reused as his primary outfit in Armageddon , with his appearance from Deadly Alliance serving as his secondary outfit .

 In the original Mortal Kombat , Reptile is a mysterious hidden enemy character , unplayable and with no biography . Hints regarding the conditions of how to unlock the fight against him are conveyed by Reptile randomly appearing prior to other matches . Some of these hints include " Look to La Luna , " " Perfection is the key , " and " Alone is how to find me . " To fight Reptile , the player must get a Double Flawless victory in single player mode on the Pit stage and finish the match off with a fatality . There must also be a silhouette flying past the moon , which will occur every sixth game . 
 In Mortal Kombat II , Reptile returns as a playable character and a member of a reptilian race called Raptors , who were pulled into Outworld and enslaved by Shao Kahn . Promised the revival of his people in turn for his loyalty , Reptile serves Kahn as Shang Tsung 's bodyguard . He was chosen to assist Jade in order to kill Kitana during the events of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 , he is defeated and exiled , but reappears in Mortal Kombat 4 as Shinnok 's minion . By Deadly Alliance , Reptile returns to Kahn 's service . He overhears Shang Tsung plotting to kill Kahn , but en route to warn his master , he meets a female vampire who offers knowledge of his race . Reptile pledges his loyalties to her , though eventually realizes she is merely using him and sets out to kill her . Instead of the vampire he finds Onaga 's dragon egg instead , which transforms Reptile into Onaga 's avatar , leading to the events of Deception and ending with his defeat at the game 's conclusion . Separated from Onaga as a result , Reptile returns in Mortal Kombat : Armageddon . In Konquest mode in Armageddon , he appears in the Red Dragon lair commanding <unk> 's dragon Caro to close the portal but refused . Taven battles Reptile in combat and emerges victorious . 
 Reptile also appears in Mortal Kombat : Shaolin Monks , appearing in the game 's opening sequence and later as a boss . During development , producer Shaun Himmerick noted that Reptile was included in the game because the character was one of Himmerick 's favorite in the series . Originally included in NBA Jam Tournament Edition alongside other Mortal Kombat characters as an unlockable player , he was eventually removed from later versions of the game at the request of the NBA . 
 Reptile reappears in the 2011 Mortal Kombat video game , retelling his role from the first tournaments . Not only as a playable character , but also includes a recreation of the original hidden battle at the bottom of the pit , in his original green ninja alternate outfit . In addition to this , he is seen in cyborg version during a match in the new " Challenge Tower " , as he puts on the cyborg costume of a " Unit 5 " . 
 In Mortal Kombat X ( 2015 ) , Reptile follows Kotal Kahn and helps bring about Mileena 's removal from the throne .

 As a secret character in the first Mortal Kombat , Reptile features a hybrid of Sub @-@ Zero 's and Scorpion 's attacks , such as the former 's freezing projectile and the latter 's harpoon . When made a playable character for later installments , his moves were changed completely . His " <unk> " attack creates an energy ball from his hands , while his " Acid Spit " attack produces a higher , faster projectile . Reptile can slide towards the opponent , or turn invisible for a brief period of time or until hit . Later titles in the series modify these moves , such as splitting the <unk> attack into slow and fast variants , or remove moves in favor of different attacks , only to return them in the next installment . 
 Reptile 's Fatalities in Mortal Kombat II consist of revealing his reptilian face in order to devour the opponent 's head , or turning invisible and severing the opponent 's torso . Later finishing moves expand upon the concept , ranging from regurgitating acid upon the opponent to leaping upon their body and gnawing the flesh from their skulls . In a series retrospective , the Mortal Kombat development team named Reptile 's finishers as some of their favorites from the series .

 Reptile appears as a minor character in several of Malibu Comics ' Mortal Kombat comic book series released in 1995 , debuting in the Goro : Prince of Pain miniseries as a member of a team led by Kitana to find the missing Goro , later appearing in the Battlewave miniseries hypnotizing Sonya Blade into wanting to marry Shao Kahn , and in several one @-@ shots , such as Kitana and Mileena . He also appears in comics published by Midway for Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 4 , based on his role in each title . In the comics , Reptile speaks in the same hissing tone as he does in the games . A paperback novel written by C. Dean Anderson entitled Mortal Kombat : Reptile 's World was released in 1996 . Written for junior readers , the book described the past of Reptile 's fictional race through the eyes of other series characters . 
 Reptile later appears in the 1995 film Mortal Kombat as a bipedal lizard , camouflaging himself until found by Liu Kang . After being thrown into a statue , Reptile transforms into a human @-@ looking ninja and battles Liu Kang , but is defeated and then crushed after reverting to his original form . Reptile 's lizard form was rendered with the use of computer @-@ generated imagery , while the character 's human form is portrayed by Keith Cooke , clothed similar to Scorpion and Sub @-@ Zero in the film , but green and with a fanged open mouth imprinted on his face mask . Originally not included in the movie , Reptile was added in response to focus groups being unimpressed with the original fights in the film . Actor Robin Shou ( Liu Kang ) and director Paul Anderson noted that neither knew what Reptile 's lizard form would look like until after filming , making the pre @-@ fight sequence difficult to shoot . 
 The 1998 television series Mortal Kombat : Konquest features Reptile in his human form , portrayed by Jon Valera . Commander of Shao Kahn 's Raptors , he betrays Kahn and forms an alliance with <unk> to share dominion over Kahn 's domain and serve as one of her mates , only to be killed later during an ambush by Shao Kahn 's priests . A similar character named <unk> appears in the animated Mortal Kombat series ' third episode , leading an attack with other Raptors . Voiced by Josh Blyden , he is defeated and sent back to Outworld . 
 Reptile featured in director Kevin Tancharoen 's 2010 short film Mortal Kombat : Rebirth , a grittier , more realistic take on the MK canon . He was played by Richard Dorton and depicted therein as a cannibalistic criminal who eats his victims ' heads after killing them . While not an inhuman ninja , the character suffers from a real @-@ life disease known as Harlequin @-@ type <unk> , giving him patchy scale @-@ like skin and eyes that are grown inward . Reptile was the only character from the film who did not carry over into Tancharoen 's Mortal Kombat : Legacy web series . 
 Skrillex released the single Reptile 's Theme , referring to the Mortal Kombat character and sampling from the game , in a compilation album titled Mortal Kombat : Songs Inspired by the Warriors .

 The character has been well received by critics . GameSpot said that Reptile gives the series " an air of mystery " due to the circumstances behind his first appearance , while CraveOnline listed the battle against him in Mortal Kombat as the fourth greatest event in video gaming . UGO.com ranked him eleventh in their list of top Mortal Kombat characters , stating that his exclusivity as a hidden character in the original game made him an " arcade legend " and set the tone for secrets in future titles in the series , and adding , " future games would feature even more hidden enemies and complicated ways of accessing them , but the first was still the best . " He was also fifth in Game Revolution 's list of top " old school " Mortal Kombat characters " , praised for his introduction in Mortal Kombat and his changes in the sequel . IGN listed him as a character they would like to see as downloadable content for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe , noting " It 's just not ( a Mortal Kombat ) game without a bevy of palette @-@ swapped ninjas ... and our vote goes to Reptile , " adding that while the character would be a " pain in the ass to fight sometimes " , his inclusion would be " a blessing to have on your side . " He was also featured in the 2008 MSN article about the ten greatest Easter eggs in gaming . In 2010 UGO , included him on the list of the 25 coolest hidden characters in video gaming . ScrewAttack placed Reptile at ninth place on their list of top Mortal Kombat characters , commenting that anyone who got to fight him in the original Mortal Kombat became a local legend and getting to play as him and turn invisible in Mortal Kombat II was " icing on the cake " . In UGO Networks ' 2012 list of the top Mortal Kombat characters , Reptile placed as sixth , stating that he is the best hidden character in the series .

 = Harry Lee ( cricketer ) = 
 Henry William " Harry " Lee ( 26 October 1890 – 21 April 1981 ) was a professional English cricketer who played first @-@ class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) and Middlesex County Cricket Club between 1911 and 1934 . He made one Test appearance for England , in 1931 . An all @-@ rounder , Lee was a right @-@ handed batsman and bowled both off break and slow @-@ medium pace bowling with his right arm . He scored 1 @,@ 000 runs in a season on thirteen occasions . Part of the County Championship winning sides in 1920 and 1921 , Lee aggregated 20 @,@ 158 runs and took 401 wickets in first @-@ class cricket . 
 The son of a greengrocer , Lee worked hard to earn himself a place in the Middlesex side in the years before the First World War , eventually getting his chance in 1914 when other players had joined the early war effort . Lee enlisted in the army in September 1914 and served until December 1915 ; although shot in the leg , declared dead and taken prisoner of war , he survived and returned to play for Middlesex in 1919 . He secured his place in the team with three strong all @-@ round seasons , and was twice part of a top four when each batsman scored a century in the same innings — he shares this achievement with Jack Hearne . Less prolific through the mid @-@ 1920s , he scored runs heavily once again towards the end of the decade . He made his only Test appearance in 1931 , drafted into the England team after injuries and illness depleted the squad . He continued playing county cricket until 1934 , when he was released by Middlesex aged 44 , to allow the county to develop younger players . He umpired first @-@ class cricket from his retirement until the Second World War , standing in 153 matches . 
 Lee 's career was overshadowed by more attractive , faster @-@ scoring batsmen in the team , such as Hearne and Patsy Hendren . His two younger brothers also played first @-@ class cricket ; both Jack and Frank moved to Somerset after failing to break into the Middlesex team . All three brothers scored centuries during the 1931 season , the first instance of three professional brothers doing so in first @-@ class cricket . Two years later , all three were involved in a single dismissal : Harry was caught by Frank off the bowling of Jack in a county match . At the time of his death in 1981 , Lee was the second @-@ oldest living Test cricketer . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Lee was born in Marylebone , London on 26 October 1890 , the eldest of three boys , all of whom progressed to play first @-@ class cricket . His father was a greengrocer and a coal merchant who followed cricket closely in the London evening papers . During Lee 's youth , he developed his cricket by playing against lamp @-@ posts , and reflected in his autobiography that : " If a bowler can clean bowl a man nine times out of ten against a lamp @-@ post , he will not miss a full @-@ sized wicket when he gets the chance . " His cricketing talent was encouraged at school ; he first attended Barrett Street School and then St. Thomas 's School in Portman Square . Both schools had headmasters who were sports enthusiasts , and at St. Thomas 's the headmaster , Mr. <unk> , offered a penny to any schoolboy who could bowl him out , a feat Lee achieved regularly . Mr. <unk> also taught Lee to concentrate on bowling a good length , and Lee played primarily as a bowler during his school years . During his final year at St. Thomas 's , the school reached the final of the local Church School 's League Shield , and Lee earned victory for his school with six wickets . When Lee left school , he worked with his father as a greengrocer , a job he liked , but not enough to stop him writing a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club , asking for a job on the ground staff at Lord 's Cricket Ground . 
 Along with approximately 25 other boys , Lee was invited for a trial at Lord 's early in 1906 , and bowled under the observation of Alfred <unk> and the head groundsman , Tom Hearne . Lee described his first over as " six of the worst balls that anyone can ever have pitched " , but as his nerves calmed , he improved , and was eventually selected as one of the five ground staff boys by Hearne . As a ground boy , Lee had numerous tasks ; sweeping , dusting and cleaning the seats , preparing nets , marking the pitch , weeding and similar . On a match day , jobs included selling scorecards , operating the score @-@ board or fielding in the practice nets . All of this left little time for the boys to practise their own game . No formal coaching was in place , but Lee was guided by a few different players ; England internationals Teddy Wynyard and Albert Trott among them . In the 1909 and 1910 seasons , Lee started to gain some attention from Middlesex County Cricket Club : he scored 39 runs in a match for the Middlesex Colts in 1909 , and 60 runs against Reading Cricket Club in 1910 . He was making more appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , collecting runs and wickets regularly , but not prolifically . In 1911 , when a number of the Middlesex side were missing due to trial matches for England selection , Lee was invited to join the team for two County Championship matches in the south @-@ west , against Somerset and Gloucestershire . Placed at number eleven in Middlesex 's batting order , Lee batted once in a rain @-@ affected match against Somerset , remaining four not out , and was not required to bowl . Lee did bowl against Gloucestershire , but remained wicketless from nine overs in the match . 
 Lee was given greater opportunities in 1912 , appearing seven times for Middlesex in the Championship . The first of these appearances , against Warwickshire at Edgbaston , brought Lee his first wicket in first @-@ class cricket when he caught Charles Baker off his own bowling . He claimed five wickets in the match , and another three against Nottinghamshire a month later , to total eight wickets for the season at 9 @.@ 50 runs apiece and finish technically at the top of the county 's bowling averages for the season , . Lee joined the MCC bowling staff in 1913 at the invitation of A. J. Webbe , but he was used sparingly in first @-@ class cricket that season , playing just three times , all for Middlesex . In the first of these matches , Lee scored 35 not out at the end of Middlesex 's innings , helping his side to avoid the follow @-@ on . His " plucky knock " was praised by captain Pelham Warner , who promoted him to bat at number five in the fourth innings , by which stage the game was heading for a draw . During 1913 , although certainly not a regular in the Middlesex team , Lee asked his captain for his county cap , a request which Warner responded to with surprise that he had not already received it , and promptly asked for one to be sent down . 
 In the 1914 season , Lee almost doubled his total of first @-@ class appearances . Two early season appearances against Oxford and Cambridge universities brought a few runs , and a match for the MCC against Hampshire saw Lee bat at number six in both innings . He played just twice in the County Championship prior to August , both times against Warwickshire . The start of the First World War in early August initially resulted in the cancellation of Middlesex 's tour of the northern counties , Yorkshire and Lancashire , but this decision was later reversed , and Middlesex took a heavily weakened side on the tour . Due to regular opening batsman William Robertson being unavailable , Lee was promoted to open the batting alongside Frank Tarrant . He scored 30 and 16 against Yorkshire , followed by 1 and 44 not out against Lancashire . Lee and Tarrant continued to open for Middlesex for the remainder of the season , and against Nottinghamshire , Lee scored his first century in first @-@ class cricket . Having been dismissed for 17 in the first innings , Lee scored 139 runs in the second , and shared a partnership of 183 runs with Patsy Hendren , who also reached his century .

 Initially , even after the declaration of war , Lee did not feel that there would be any impact on his life , and was looking forward to playing cricket in the 1915 season . After learning that the MCC and Middlesex County Cricket Club were keen to support the war effort , and encountering members of the Territorial Force marching through London , Lee changed his mind and enlisted into 13th ( County of London ) Battalion ( part of the all @-@ Territorial Force London Regiment ) in Kensington ( the battalion was usually known as " The <unk> " as it recruited largely from that area of London ) on 1 September 1914 . At this time the pre @-@ war battalion had been split into two , with the " first line " , 1 / 13th Battalion , of men who had volunteered for overseas service then being based in Abbots Langley , Hertfordshire , this unit would be sent to France in November 1914 . The " second line " , 2 / 13th Battalion , of men who had not volunteered for overseas service and new recruits was initially at White City , London prior to moving to Maidstone , Kent in January 1915 . In December 1914 a " third line " battalion , 3 / 13th Battalion , was formed as an additional training unit . This was based at Richmond Park . The surviving portions of Lee 's service record are unclear as to which of these units he spent time with during his training . 
 He was posted to 1 / 13th ( County of London ) Battalion on 25 February 1915 , and joined them in France just over a week later . Lee participated in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in mid @-@ March , an Allied offensive to regain the French village of Neuve @-@ Chapelle . The village was retaken from the Germans , but the plan to press on and also capture Aubers was abandoned . Following this attack , the Germans heavily refortified the area and were expecting further attacks . The battle , part of a larger offensive known as the Battle of Aubers Ridge , commenced on 9 May . The Kensingtons formed part of 25th Brigade , and were one of the lead infantry units in the northern pincer of the attack , targeting Fromelles . Lee was part of D Company , which along with C Company led the Kensingtons during the assault . During the attack , the initial objectives were achieved , but at heavy cost . However , the attacking forces soon ran out of ammunition and retreated the following morning . Of the 550 men that the Kensingtons had engaged , there were 499 casualties , including 13 officers ; in total the British casualties numbered over 11 @,@ 000 men . 
 During the attack Lee was shot in the leg ; a bullet hit his left thigh and fractured his femur . He lay for three days between the lines having been given up for dead . A memorial service was held after the announcement of his death . After three days , Lee was found by the Germans and transported to hospital in Valenciennes . The ten @-@ hour journey was initially made in the passenger compartment of a train , with sacks of straw , before he transferred to a Red Cross train at Lille . For the first week he was looked after by the French Red Cross , before the Germans took over . He remained in Valenciennes for six weeks , and remained bedridden for the duration of his stay . After this time , he was transferred to a second hospital in Hannover . For the first half of the two @-@ day journey , Lee had to lie on a wooden seat with a blanket under him and his leg in an iron case , which hurt his back significantly , and was provided with no food . The second half of the journey was completed on a Red Cross train . During his stay in Hannover , Lee began to heal quickly , but after receiving advice from a fellow prisoner , he greatly exaggerated the injury , and was selected to be returned to England . He began the journey on 1 October 1915 , and boarded the boat for England five days later . Although Lee had amplified the severity of his injury , in England he discovered that one of his legs would be permanently shorter than the other , and he had suffered significant muscle death . He was told that he would neither be able to fight nor play cricket again . He was discharged from the army on 4 December 1915 , and was eligible for the Silver War Badge to show that he had served honourably . He later also received the 1914 @-@ 15 Star , British War Medal and Victory Medal . After leaving the army , Middlesex paid for Lee to be treated by a specialist , and he was able to play a match for the Army Service Corps against Lancing College in early 1916 , in which he scored a century . 
 = = = Coaching in India = = = 
 Having been invalided out of the Army , Lee worked as a filing clerk in the War Office , a position which allowed him plenty of time to play cricket with the MCC and in other wartime matches . Towards the end of the summer in 1916 , he met Frank Tarrant 's wife , who suggested that Lee should accompany her husband to work in India . He readily accepted , but before he was able to leave , his mother died and Lee felt that he should remain at home to look after his two young brothers . A year later , with the household settled , Lee took Tarrant up on the offer . He was originally booked on the Nyanza , which was sailing to Bombay , but was transferred to the Nagoya at the last minute , which sailed directly to Lee 's final destination of Calcutta . The Nyanza was torpedoed 20 miles ( 32 km ) out of Plymouth , and though it returned to port , 49 lives were lost . During the Nagoya 's journey , the convoy of which it was part was attacked passing through the Mediterranean Sea by the German U @-@ boat UB @-@ 50 . One of the ships , the City of Lucknow , an 8 @,@ 000 ton cargo steamer in the convoy , was sunk . The rest of the journey was completed without incident , despite a rumour that the Emden , a German light cruiser , lay in wait for the convoy . 
 In India , Lee worked as a football and cricket coach for the Maharaja of Cooch Behar , but was treated more like a guest than a paid retainer . He played a few first @-@ class matches during his time in India , and in his first match in the country , for the Maharaja 's XI against Lord Willingdon 's XI , Lee claimed his maiden five @-@ wicket haul , taking five wickets and conceding eleven runs . He added another three wickets in the second innings to record the best bowling analysis of the match . In November 1918 , Lee played for England against India . The Indian team did not have Test status , which was not attained until 1932 , but they had a strong team , and dominated the match against an England side which was far from representative . Lee claimed four wickets in the match for the concession of 177 runs , and made scores of eight and nine with the bat . Lee 's highest score , and only century in first @-@ class cricket in India was made in a match he was playing against the Maharaja of Cooch Behar 's team . Appearing instead for MC Bird 's XI , Lee opened the batting and scored 104 runs . He also claimed seven wickets in the match , which his side won by an innings . 
 = = Return to county cricket = = 
 Despite the injury he sustained during the war , when county cricket resumed in 1919 , Lee took his leave of the Maharaja and returned to England to resume his career with Middlesex . County Championship matches were played over two days , an experiment which was unpopular with Lee , who described it as a " nightmare season " . Even with these shorter matches , Lee passed 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs in a season for the first time in his career , and won himself a regular place in the Middlesex side . He scored four centuries during the season , including one in each innings of a charity match played against Surrey at The Oval . During the first innings , he reached 163 , sharing a second wicket partnership of 226 with Jack Hearne , and in the second he scored 126 . His batting average for the season was 40 @.@ 76 ; the first of only three times that it would exceed 40 during his career . The championship reverted to three @-@ day matches for 1920 , and Lee enjoyed his greatest successes as a batsman during the season . He scored centuries in successive matches in mid @-@ May , reaching 102 against Warwickshire at Lord 's , and then 119 against Sussex at the same venue . Against Sussex , each of Middlesex 's top four batsmen scored centuries ; in addition to Lee 's 119 runs , Pelham Warner scored 139 , Nigel Haig 131 , and Hearne remained 116 not out when the side declared . This was the first time the feat had been achieved in first @-@ class cricket . Lee also took eleven wickets in the match , taking five in the first innings and six in the second to complete his maiden ten @-@ wicket haul . In doing so , he became one of only eight Middlesex cricketers to have taken ten wickets in the same match as scoring a century . Playing against Hampshire at Southampton the following month , Lee scored his first double century , being 221 not out when Middlesex declared . He was also not out in the second innings , meaning that he was on the pitch for the full duration of the match . In total , Lee scored 1 @,@ 518 runs at an average of 43 @.@ 37 in first @-@ class matches in 1920 . He ranked third amongst Middlesex batsmen — by both runs scored and batting average — in the County Championship , which the county won narrowly , completing victory in the final session of their final match . In A History of Cricket , H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton praise Lee 's " all @-@ round excellence " during the season : in addition to his runs , he claimed 40 wickets in the Championship at an average of 22 @.@ 40 . 
 Lee 's performances put him in contention for a place on the English touring party to travel to Australia that winter , but he eventually missed out on selection . Instead , he travelled to South Africa for the first of many winters playing and coaching in the country , accepting an invitation from the Wanderers Club in Johannesburg . For the second consecutive season , Lee scored in excess of 1 @,@ 500 runs in all first @-@ class matches in 1921 , aided by his highest career score ; 243 not out against Nottinghamshire . Lee batted for over six hours to reach the score in a match which Middlesex won by an innings . He only scored one other century during the season , 121 runs against Sussex , but passed 50 on nine occasions . However , he enjoyed his best season as a bowler , claiming 72 first @-@ class wickets at an average of 19 @.@ 66 , the best of his career . Middlesex won the County Championship once more , and Lee finished third in both the batting and bowling tables , behind Hearne and Hendren amongst the batsmen , and Jack Durston and Haig , the bowlers . After the season , he travelled once more to South Africa , this time to coach at both St. Andrew 's School and Grey College in Bloemfontein . His obituary in the Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack states that by the end of 1921 his best years were over . 
 Lee was certainly less prolific over the following few years : he averaged under 25 with the bat in each of the years from 1923 to 1925 , and only passed 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs in the first of the three . For the second time in his career , Lee was part of a batting line @-@ up in which each of the top four batsmen scored a century : against Hampshire in Southampton , Lee scored 107 , fellow opener Hugh Dales got 103 , Hearne reached 232 and Hendren remained 177 not out as Middlesex declared with 642 runs . In 1923 , he recorded his best bowling performance , taking eight wickets for the concession of 39 runs in the first innings against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham . He took a further four wickets in the second innings to help Middlesex to an eight wicket victory . He claimed 50 wickets for the third and final time that season , in which he was utilised heavily , being Middlesex 's third most used bowler . He did not travel to South Africa in either of 1923 – 24 or 1924 – 25 , a fact which he describes as the " cause and effect " of his poor form in 1924 and 1925 . He travelled to South Africa again in 1926 , spending the first of three successive winters in Cape Town , coaching at South African College Schools . This coincided with a revival in his county cricket batting form ; in 1926 he passed 1 @,@ 000 runs after missing out on the total for two years . 
 Heading toward the twilight of his career , Lee enjoyed a batting renaissance in 1928 and 1929 . He averaged over 35 in each season , and scored runs heavily , reaching 1 @,@ 715 runs in the first year and 1 @,@ 995 in the second , the most in any season of his career . For the only time in his career , Lee was selected in 1928 to play for the professional " Players " team in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture . Appearing in the contest at The Oval in early June , he opened the batting and scored 56 runs . The match finished as a draw with the final day lost to rain . In 1929 , he scored a century in each innings of a match for the second time , making 124 and 105 not out against a strong Lancashire bowling attack . Later that season , he scored his third and final double century , scoring 225 runs against Surrey at The Oval , during which he shared a second wicket partnership of 319 with Gubby Allen . Lee 's 1 @,@ 617 runs for Middlesex in the County Championship in 1929 made him their leading run @-@ scorer , although both Hearne and Hendren topped 1 @,@ 000 runs with superior averages . The following season saw Lee accumulate 1 @,@ 485 first @-@ class runs at an average of 26 @.@ 05 , in the season which saw him play more matches than in any other : 34 in total . He reached a century only once , scoring 150 runs against Somerset at Taunton .

 For the English winter of 1930 – 31 , Lee took on positions at both St. Andrew 's College and Rhodes University , both in Grahamstown in South Africa . The MCC were touring that winter , and suffered heavily with injuries and illness . No fewer than seven players were missing at various stages , and the England captain , Percy Chapman , requested that Lee be excused from his coaching duties to join up with the touring party . Having believed he had secured this permission , he made his first appearance against Natal , scoring 14 runs in his only innings . He played in three further tour matches , twice making scores in the forties , but not reaching a half @-@ century during the tour . His only Test appearance came in the fourth Test between England and South Africa . Lee opened the innings alongside Bob Wyatt and scored 18 and 1 in his two innings of the match , which finished a draw . During the match , the MCC were contacted by one of the schools he had been coaching at , which claimed that Lee had broken his contract by leaving without permission . Lee argued vehemently against these claims , citing the fact that the sportsmaster at the school had told Jack White that he had permission to leave , but the MCC were unmoved , and refused to issue Lee his England cap and blazer until he had apologised . Lee felt he had no need to apologise , and never received either cap or blazer , though small compensation came in the form of an England touring tie , which Jack Hobbs gave to him . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Though now into his forties , Lee remained a regular in the Middlesex side in the early 1930s , and in 1931 he scored 1 @,@ 291 runs at an average of 30 @.@ 02 , including two centuries . Both of his brothers , Jack and Frank , also scored a first @-@ class century during the season , Jack scored 113 for Somerset against Northamptonshire , and Frank carried his bat to remain 134 not out for Somerset against Sussex . The feat was the first instance of three professional brothers all scoring first @-@ class centuries in the same season . Two years later , all three brother were involved in a dismissal : Harry Lee was caught for 82 runs by Frank from the bowling of Jack . Though Lee passed 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs in each of 1932 and 1933 , he did so with averages under 25 , and in 1934 he was dropped from the Middlesex side in order to encourage some younger players to break into the team . He continued to appear for the MCC during the season , and scored a century against Cambridge University in early July . He was briefly recalled to the Middlesex team in August , and recorded a final century , reaching 119 against Warwickshire . Although he was successful in the subsequent match against Surrey , making scores of 65 and 38 not out , Middlesex terminated his contract at the end of the season , much to his disappointment . In 437 first @-@ class appearances , Lee scored a total of 20 @,@ 158 runs at an average of 29 @.@ 95 . He scored 38 centuries and passed 1 @,@ 000 runs in a season on 13 occasions . 
 Upon the completion of his playing career , Lee began umpiring almost straight away , standing in non @-@ first @-@ class MCC matches . He petitioned Middlesex to be put forward for first @-@ class duties for the following season , which they duly did . He was approved by the county captains , and umpired first @-@ class cricket from 1935 until 1946 . He then returned to coaching , taking on a position at Downside School in Somerset from 1949 until 1953 . He was a regular attendee at Lord 's throughout the remainder of his life , and by the time of his death in 1981 , he was England 's second oldest Test cricketer . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 In his own words , Lee was not a " brilliant youngster like Jack Hearne or Denis Compton , but an ordinary , average county cricketer " . Despite this assertion , Lee 's 18 @,@ 594 first @-@ class runs for Middlesex rank him eleventh in their all @-@ time list , and he is one of only seventeen cricketers to have scored over 5 @,@ 000 runs and taken over 300 wickets for the county . H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton suggested that figures alone do show his true worth , as at the time the Lord 's pitch did not favour batsmen , and had he played his career on " some other ground where the pitch was a batsman 's paradise , his figures would have borne a truer relation to his value . " Lee batted with a noticeable crouch , and scored predominantly on the leg side . His style was unattractive to watch , but effective , and although Hearne and Hendren drew most of the plaudits for their more colourful methods , Lee received praise for his toughness and courage .

 Super Mario Bros. 3 ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Sūpā Mario Burazāzu Surī ) is a 1988 platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) video game console . It is the third official overall installment in the Super Mario Bros. series . It was first released in Japan on October 23 , 1988 ( a few weeks after the release of the North American version of Super Mario Bros. 2 ) and later in North America on February 9 , 1990 . The game was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development , led by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka . Enhanced remakes were later released on the Super NES in 1993 and the Game Boy Advance in 2003 . The game has been re @-@ released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii , Nintendo 3DS , and Wii U consoles . 
 Super Mario Bros. 3 centers on plumbers Mario and Luigi who embark on a quest to save Princess Toadstool and the rulers of seven different kingdoms from the antagonist Bowser and his children , the Koopalings . The player , as Mario or Luigi , is able to defeat enemies by stomping them or using items that bestow magical powers . Mario and Luigi are given a wider range of abilities than in previous Super Mario games , including flying or sliding down slopes . In addition , Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces numerous elements , such as new enemy characters and the use of a world map to transition between levels , that have reappeared in or have influenced subsequent Mario games . 
 Super Mario Bros. 3 is acclaimed by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time . It was a commercial success upon release , which was partly influenced by its promotion in the 1989 film The Wizard . Super Mario Bros. 3 is the third @-@ best selling NES game , having sold over 17 million copies worldwide . The popularity of the game also inspired a short @-@ lived animated television series . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Super Mario Bros. 3 is a two @-@ dimensional , side @-@ scrolling platform game in which the player controls the on @-@ screen protagonist : either Mario or Luigi . The game shares similar gameplay mechanics with previous titles in the series — Super Mario Bros. , Super Mario Bros. : The Lost Levels , and Super Mario Bros. 2 — but introduces several new elements . In addition to the running and jumping moves found in past games , the player can slide down slopes , pick up and throw special blocks , and freely climb up and down vines . In addition , with power @-@ ups , Mario can fly and float . The game world consists of eight " kingdoms " that are each subdivided into multiple levels . The eight worlds feature distinct visual themes ; for example , the second world , " Desert Land " , contains sand @-@ covered levels with pyramids , while the levels in the fourth world , " Giant Land " , are populated with obstacles and enemies twice as tall and twice as wide as those in the other worlds . 
 The player navigates through the game via two game screens : an overworld map and a level play @-@ field . The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current kingdom and has several paths leading from the world 's entrance to a castle . Paths connect to action panels , fortresses and other map icons , and allow players to take different routes to reach the kingdom 's goal . Moving the on @-@ screen character to an action panel or fortress will allow access to that level 's playfield , a linear stage populated with obstacles and enemies . The majority of the game takes place in these levels , with the player traversing the stage by running , jumping , flying , swimming , and dodging or defeating enemies . 
 Completing stages allows the player to progress through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds . Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat ; the first seven worlds feature an airship controlled by one of the Koopalings , while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world . Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths , and mini @-@ games and bonus screens that provide the player a chance to obtain special power @-@ ups and additional lives . Power @-@ ups obtained in these mini @-@ games are stored in a reserve until activated by the player from the map screen . 
 In addition to special items from previous games like the " Super Mushroom " and the " Fire Flower " , new power @-@ ups are introduced that provide the player with new options . The " Super Leaf " and " Tanooki Suit " give Mario raccoon and tanuki appearances respectively and allow him to fly ; the " Tanooki Suit " also enables him to turn into stone to avoid enemies for a short period of time . Changing into a Tanooki statue while jumping results in Mario pounding the ground and killing whatever enemies are directly under him ; this marks the first appearance of the " ground pound " move in a Mario game , a move that was later given to Yoshi in Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island and that later became part of Mario 's standard move set in Super Mario 64 and subsequent games . Other suits include the " Frog Suit " , which increases the character 's underwater speed and agility and improves jumping height on land , and the " Hammer Suit " , which gives Mario the appearance of the Hammer <unk> enemy and allows him to throw hammers at enemies and resist fire attacks ( when crouching ) . 
 Super Mario Bros. 3 includes a multiplayer option which allows two players to cooperatively play the game by taking turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels ; the first player controls Mario , while the other controls Luigi ( a palette swap of Mario ) . Through this mode , players can also access several mini @-@ games , including a remake of the original Mario Bros. arcade game , in which one player has the opportunity to steal the cards of another but may lose their turn if they lose the mini @-@ game . 
 = = Plot and characters = = 
 The plot of Super Mario Bros. 3 is described in the instruction booklet . The Mushroom World , the setting of the game , is invaded by the Koopalings , Bowser 's seven children . The Koopalings conquer each of the seven kingdoms by stealing its king 's magical wand and using it to transform him into an animal . Princess Toadstool sends Mario and Luigi to travel to each kingdom , retrieve the stolen wand , and restore its king to normal . 
 During the course of the game , the Princess sends notes and special items to Mario and Luigi , as they restore the kings of each kingdom . When the brothers rescue the seventh king , the letter they receive reveals that Bowser has kidnapped Toadstool and is holding her captive in the castle of his own kingdom , Dark Land . The brothers travel through Dark Land , enter his castle , and defeat Bowser in a battle . The game ends with Toadstool being freed from the castle . 
 On September 10 , 2015 , Miyamoto confirmed a fan theory stating that the entirety of Super Mario Bros. 3 takes place as a stage play . The game opens with curtains being pulled , featuring obstacles hanging from the catwalk , objects bolted to the background , and shadows on the skyline . When Mario finishes a level , he walks off the stage . 
 = = Development = = 
 Super Mario Bros. 3 was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development , a team that consisted of over ten people , and took more than two years to complete . Developer Shigeru Miyamoto served as director . He worked closely with the designers and programmers during the conceptual and final stages , encouraging a free interchange of ideas . Miyamoto considered intriguing and original ideas to be key to creating a successful game . 
 The game was designed to appeal to players of varying skill levels . To assist less skilled players , bonus coins and 1 @-@ ups are more abundant in earlier worlds , while later worlds present more complex challenges for more experienced players . In the two @-@ player mode , the players alternate turns to balance play time . The development team introduced new power @-@ ups and concepts that would give Mario the appearance of different creatures as a means of providing him with new abilities . An early idea changed Mario into a centaur , but was dropped in favor of a raccoon tail that allows limited flying ability . Other costumes with different abilities were added to his repertoire , and levels were designed to take advantage of these abilities . New enemies were included to add diversity to the game , along with variants of previous enemies , such as Goombas , Hammer Bros. , and Koopa <unk> . 
 Some of the enemies designed for Super Mario Bros. 3 were inspired by the team 's personal experiences . For example , Miyamoto stated that the Chain Chomp enemy , a tethered ball and chain creature that lunges at the player when in close proximity , was based on a " bad [ childhood ] experience " he had with a dog . Bowser 's children , the Koopalings , were designed to be unique in appearance and personality ; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work and efforts . Nintendo of America named the Koopalings after well @-@ known musicians ; for example the characters " Ludwig von Koopa " and " Roy Koopa " are named after Ludwig van Beethoven and Roy Orbison respectively . 
 The character graphics were created with a special graphics machine ( " Character Generator Computer Aided Design " ) that generated a collection of all the graphical shapes used in the game . Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game 's code uses to access , and are combined to form complete images on the screen in real time . The Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge uses Nintendo 's custom <unk> ( memory management controller ) ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities . The <unk> chip allows for animated tiles , extra RAM for diagonal scrolling , and a <unk> timer to split the screen . The game uses these functions to split the game screen into two portions , a playfield on the top and a status bar on the bottom , allowing the top portion to scroll as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to display text and other information . 
 During 1988 , a shortage of ROM chips , along with Nintendo of America 's preparation of a version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for Western gamers , prevented Nintendo from performing various North American game releases according to their original schedules . The delayed products included Super Mario Bros. 3 and , according to Nintendo Power , Zelda II : The Adventure of Link . The delay , however , presented Nintendo with an opportunity to promote the game in a feature film . In 1989 , Tom Pollack of Universal Studios approached Nintendo of America 's marketing department about a video game movie ; inspired by Nintendo video game competitions , Pollack envisioned a video game version of Tommy for younger audiences . Nintendo licensed its products for inclusion in what would become the film The Wizard . During the movie 's production , the filmmakers requested and were granted approval from Nintendo regarding the script and portrayal of the company 's games . Super Mario Bros. 3 was one of the products shown in the film , and was used in a final scene involving a video game competition . The film was released in December 1989 , between the Japanese and English versions of the game .

 Upon release , the game was lauded by the video game press . It was widely considered to be one of the best games released for the NES , and even of all time . Computer and Video Games editors Paul Rand , Tim Boone and Frank O 'Connor awarded the game a 98 / 100 , praising it for its gameplay , replayability , sound and graphics . Boone commented that the game is nearly flawless in its utterly " stupendous <unk> and absolutely impossible to put down for anything less than a fire alarm - and even then you find yourself weighting down the odds . " Rand called Super Mario Bros. 3 the best video game ever , labeling it " the Mona Lisa of gaming " and stating that it is " astoundingly brilliant in every way , shape and form . " O 'Connor stated that the game " makes Sonic the Hedgehog look like a wet Sunday morning and even gives the [ Super ] Famicom 's Mario 4 a run for its money . " 
 Julian Rignall of Mean Machines referred to Super Mario Bros. 3 as the " finest video game " he had ever played , citing its addictiveness , depth , and challenge . A second Mean Machines reviewer , Matt Regan , anticipated the game would be a top @-@ selling title in the United Kingdom , and echoed Rignall 's praise , calling it a " truly brilliant game " . Regan further stated that the game offered elements which tested the player 's " brains and reflexes " , and that though the graphics were simple , they were " incredibly varied " . In a preview of the game , Nintendo Power gave it high marks in graphics , audio , challenge , gameplay , and enjoyability . 
 Super Mario Bros. 3 has received universal acclaim from modern critics who also considered the title to be one of the best games of all time . Edge magazine considered Super Mario Bros. 3 Nintendo 's standout title of 1989 , and commented that its success outshone the first Super Mario Bros. ' s sales milestone ; the first title sold 40 million copies , but was bundled with the NES . They lauded the overworld map as an elegant alternative to a menu to select levels . Allgame 's Skyler Miller praised the game 's level design , graphics , music , and nonlinearity . Dengeki referred to the game as a popular title and expressed excitement over its rerelease on the Game Boy Advance system . The items hidden in the game 's levels , such as the warp whistles , were well @-@ received : Rignall regarded them as part of the game 's addictiveness ; and Sheff stated that finding them provided a sense of satisfaction . Both Screw Attack and GamesRadar ranked it the best NES game ever made . GamesRadar claimed that while Super Mario Bros. defined its genre , Super Mario Bros. 3 perfected it . 
 Criticism focused on particular aspects of the game . Miller considered the inability to save progress a drawback , since gamers will have to play the entire game in one sitting if they wish to complete it . Rignall described the audio and visuals as being outdated in comparison to games on the Mega Drive and Super NES ( the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in Europe ) . The game 's difficulty was also criticized by some critics .

By 1993 , the game had sold 4 and 7 million unbundled units in Japan and the United States respectively . In the United States alone , the game generated over US $ 500 million in revenue for Nintendo . Author David Sheff commented that , in music industry terms , the game went platinum 11 times . Including bundled units , the NES version of the game sold over 17 million copies . Game Informer reported in their October 2009 issue that the Virtual Console version had sold one million copies .

 Super Mario Bros. 3 introduced several elements which were carried over to subsequent Mario titles . A similar overworld map is used in Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. , and Mario 's ability to fly has been a feature in games such as Super Mario World , Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy . The game 's ' Super Leaf ' item has returned in more recent Mario titles for the Nintendo 3DS , like Super Mario 3D Land , Mario Kart 7 and New Super Mario Bros. 2 . Bowser 's red hair was first popularized in the game , and has since become a part of his standard appearance . 
 Through a collaboration between NBC and Nintendo of America , an animated television series titled The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 was created in 1990 by DIC Entertainment . The show aired weekly and featured numerous characters , enemies , and settings from the video game ; the original seven Koopalings are given different names based on their given personalities and are also given a new age order . Other Nintendo products have included various elements from the game as well . Music from Super Mario Bros. 3 appears as a track on Nintendo Sound Selection Koopa , a collection of songs from Nintendo games . The game 's stages and graphics comprise a background theme in the 2006 Nintendo DS game Tetris DS . The Koopalings are also world bosses in Super Mario World , Mario is Missing ! , Yoshi 's Safari , Hotel Mario and all New Super Mario Bros. games except New Super Mario Bros. Boom Boom , another boss from this game , additionally reappears in Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World , alongside a boomerang @-@ wielding female counterpart named Pom Pom . Super Mario Bros. 3 is one of the four games represented in Super Mario Maker . 
 Super Mario Bros. 3 has appeared on numerous top video game lists . The game debuted on Nintendo Power 's Top 30 best games ever list at number 20 in September 1989 . It entered the list 's top 10 a few months later and reached number one in May 1990 . Super Mario Bros. 3 remained within the top 20 for more than five years . More than a decade later , the magazine ranked the game number six on their list of 200 Greatest Nintendo Games . In August 2008 , Nintendo Power listed Super Mario Bros. 3 as the second best Nintendo Entertainment System video game , praising it for making the series more complex and introducing new abilities that have since become signature abilities in the series . The game placed 11th , behind Super Mario Bros. , in Official Nintendo Magazine 's " 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time " . In 2007 , ScrewAttack called Super Mario Bros. 3 the best Mario game in the series as well as the best game on the NES , citing the graphics , power @-@ ups , secrets , and popularity , summing it up as " just incredible " and stating , " If you haven 't experienced this greatness , we pity you " . In a poll conducted by Dengeki , the game tied with Super Mario World as the number three video game their readers first played . 
 The game has been ranked on several of IGN 's lists of " top games " . In 2005 , they rated it 23rd among their Top 100 Games , and praised the precise and intuitive controls . IGN editors from the United States , United Kingdom , and Australia ranked Super Mario Bros. 3 number 39 in their 2007 Top 100 Games , citing Miyamoto 's " ingenious " designs . They further commented that the game improved on the " already @-@ brilliant concepts " of the previous titles with new power @-@ ups and enemies . Users and readers of the website placed the game high on similar lists : 32nd in 2005 and 21st in 2006 . In 2007 , the game was included in the " game canon " , a list of the ten most important video games selected for preservation by the Library of Congress . In 2009 , Game Informer put Super Mario Bros. 3 9th on their list of " The Top 200 Games of All Time " , saying that it is " a game with incredible lasting power that we won 't soon forget " . This is down one place from Game Informer 's previous ranking in 2001 . Edge ranked the game # 20 on its list of " The 100 Best Games To Play Today " , calling it " the one 8 @-@ bit game that still shines today , no caveats required .

 Super Mario Bros. 3 is well known for spawning the Commander Keen series of side @-@ scrolling platform games , which launched Id Software . During their period of employment at Softdisk in the early 1990s , video game developers John Carmack and Tom Hall secretly developed the adaptive tile refresh technology that would perform smooth , side @-@ scrolling graphics on EGA cards for IBM clone personal computers . They used their spare time late at night to develop a clone of the first level of Super Mario Bros. 3 , using the hero in Softdisk 's Dangerous Dave , calling the prototype Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement . When John Romero saw their work in action , he and the project chief at Softdisk Jay Wilbur suggested that they finish the PC clone of Super Mario Bros. 3 . This demo was later presented to Nintendo , who denied to allow their games on PCs , because they " were only made exclusively for their Nintendo consoles " . As a result , the first Mario @-@ style , side @-@ scrolling episode of Commander Keen was made on Softdisk 's computers at odd hours . Shortly afterwards , Softdisk suggested that the team form its own company , which became Id Software on February 1 , 1991 .

 = Fourth Fitna = 
 The Fourth Fitna or Great Abbasid Civil War involved conflict between the brothers al @-@ Amin and al @-@ Ma 'mun over the succession to the throne of the Abbasid Caliphate . Their father , Harun al @-@ Rashid , had named al @-@ Amin as the first successor , but had also named al @-@ Ma 'mun as the second , with Khurasan granted to him as an appanage , while a third son , al @-@ Qasim , had been designated as third successor . After Harun died in 809 , al @-@ Amin succeeded in Baghdad . Encouraged by the Baghdad court , al @-@ Amin began trying to subvert the autonomous status of Khurasan ; Qasim was quickly sidelined . In response , al @-@ Ma 'mun sought the support of the provincial élites of Khurasan and made moves to assert his own autonomy . As the rift between the two brothers and their respective camps widened , al @-@ Amin declared his own son Musa as his heir and assembled a large army . Al @-@ Amin 's troops marched towards Khurasan , but al @-@ Ma 'mun 's general Tahir ibn Husayn defeated them in the Battle of Rayy , and then invaded Iraq and besieged Baghdad itself . The city fell after a year , al @-@ Amin was executed , and al @-@ Ma 'mun became Caliph , but he remained in Khurasan and did not come to Baghdad . 
 This allowed the power vacuum which the civil war had fostered in the Caliphate 's provinces to grow , and several local rulers sprang up in Jazira , Syria and Egypt . In addition , the pro @-@ Khurasani policies followed by al @-@ Ma 'mun 's powerful chief minister , al @-@ Fadl ibn Sahl , and al @-@ Ma 'mun 's espousal of an Alid succession , alienated the traditional Baghdad élites , who saw themselves increasingly marginalized . Consequently , al @-@ Ma 'mun 's uncle Ibrahim was proclaimed rival Caliph at Baghdad in 817 , forcing al @-@ Ma 'mun to intervene personally . Fadl ibn Sahl was assassinated and al @-@ Ma 'mun left Khurasan for Baghdad , which he entered in 819 . The next years saw the consolidation of al @-@ Ma 'mun 's authority and the re @-@ incorporation of the western provinces , a process not completed until 827 . Some local rebellions , however , notably that of the Khurramites , dragged on for far longer . 
 Historians have interpreted the conflict variously ; in the words of the <unk> Elton L. Daniel , it has been regard as " a conflict over the succession between a rather incompetent , besotted al @-@ Amin and his shrewdly competent brother al @-@ Ma 'mun ; as the product of harem intrigues ; as an extension of the personal rivalry between the ministers al @-@ Fadl b . Rabi ' and al @-@ Fadl b . Sahl ; or as a struggle between Arabs and Persians for the control of the government " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The origins of the civil war lie in the succession arrangements of Harun al @-@ Rashid ( reigned 786 – 809 ) , as well as the internal political dynamics of the Abbasid Caliphate . The two main contenders , Muhammad al @-@ Amin and Abdallah al @-@ Ma 'mun , were born six months apart in AH 170 ( 786 – 787 ) , with al @-@ Ma 'mun being the elder . It was al @-@ Amin however who was named first heir in 791 or 792 , while al @-@ Ma 'mun followed in 797 , a sequence which was influenced by their lines of descent and their political implications : al @-@ Amin had a solidly Abbasid lineage , being Harun 's son by <unk> , herself descended from the second Abbasid Caliph al @-@ Mansur ( r . 754 – 775 ) , while al @-@ Ma 'mun 's mother was <unk> , a Persian concubine from <unk> in Khurasan . 
 While al @-@ Ma 'mun 's origin was less prestigious than the purely Arab al @-@ Amin , his ties to Khurasan and the Iranian @-@ dominated eastern provinces were an important factor in his choice as heir . In contrast to the exclusively Arab @-@ ruled Umayyad Caliphate , the Abbasid state was under heavy Iranian , and particularly Khurasani , influence . The Abbasid Revolution , which brought the Abbasids to power , originated in Khurasan , and the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators . Many of the original Khurasani Arab army ( <unk> ) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital , Baghdad , and became an elite group known as the abnaʾ al @-@ dawla ( " sons of the state / dynasty " ) . Khurasan retained a privileged position among the Caliphate 's provinces , and Harun al @-@ Rashid in particular was careful to cultivate his ties with the Iranian element of the Caliphate , not least through his promotion of the Khurasani Barmakid family to positions of power . Both al @-@ Amin and al @-@ Ma 'mun had been tutored in their youth by the Barmakids , al @-@ Amin by al @-@ Fadl ibn Yahya and al @-@ Ma 'mun by Ja 'far ibn Yahya . While al @-@ Amin would distance himself from the Barmakids and become closely associated with the abnaʾ aristocracy of Baghdad , al @-@ Ma 'mun remained influenced by Ja 'far and his associates . 
 In 802 , Harun and the most powerful officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca , where the definitive succession arrangement was drawn up : al @-@ Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad , but al @-@ Ma 'mun would remain al @-@ Amin 's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent Khurasan . A third son , al @-@ Qasim ( al @-@ Mu <unk> ) , was also added as third heir and received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire . The stipulations of the agreement , extensively recorded by the historian al @-@ Tabari , may however have been distorted by later apologists of al @-@ Ma 'mun , especially as regards the extent of the autonomy granted to al @-@ Ma 'mun 's eastern viceroyalty . 
 Almost immediately after it returned to Baghdad , in January 803 , the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt fall of the Barmakid family from power . On the one hand , this decision may reflect the fact that the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph 's liking , but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well : with al @-@ Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al @-@ Ma 'mun with the Barmakids , and the two camps becoming more estranged every day , if al @-@ Amin was to have a chance to succeed , the power of the Barmakids had to be broken . Indeed , the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ , many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad . 
 This led to unrest in the provinces , especially Khurasan , where , according to Elton L. Daniel , " Abbasid policies [ fluctuated ] between two extremes . One governor would attempt to extract as much wealth as he could from the province for the benefit of Iraq , the central government , and , not infrequently , himself . When the people protested loudly enough , such governors would be temporarily replaced by ones who would attend to local interests " . The Khurasani elites had a long @-@ standing rivalry with the abnaʾ . Although the latter now resided chiefly in what is now Iraq , they insisted on retaining control of Khurasani affairs and demanded that the province 's revenues be sent west to supply their salaries , something strongly resisted by the local Arab and Iranian elites . The resulting tension was eased when al @-@ Fadl ibn Yahya , universally praised as a model governor , was appointed to Khurasan in 793 , but was re @-@ fanned in 796 , when a member of the abnaʾ , Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan , was placed in charge of the province . His harsh taxation measures provoked increasing unrest , which expressed itself in Kharijite uprisings and , finally , a rebellion by the governor of Samarkand , Rafi ibn al @-@ Layth . This uprising forced Harun himself , accompanied by al @-@ Ma 'mun and the powerful chamberlain ( hajib ) and chief minister al @-@ Fadl ibn al @-@ Rabi , to travel to the province in 808 . Al @-@ Ma 'mun was sent ahead with part of the army to Marv , while Harun stayed at Tus , where he died on 24 March 809 . 
 = = Civil war between al @-@ Amin and al @-@ Ma 'mun , 809 – 813 = = 
 Upon Harun 's death , al @-@ Amin ascended the throne in Baghdad , where his popularity was great , while al @-@ Ma 'mun remained at Marv , from where he planned to campaign against the remaining rebels . However , al @-@ Amin recalled the army and treasury from the east , leaving al @-@ Ma 'mun with little in the way of military forces . It was in this time that al @-@ Ma 'mun came to rely upon his wazir , the former Barmakid protégé al @-@ Fadl ibn Sahl , who began to implement a policy of conciliation and cooperation with the local elites , whose autonomy and privileges were guaranteed . The covenant of 802 however soon began to fall apart over Baghdad 's centralizing ambitions and the dispute over the status of Khurasan : the abnaʾ , led by Ali ibn Isa , whom Harun had imprisoned but who was now set free and appointed head of the Caliph 's bodyguard , were joined by other influential officials , chief amongst them al @-@ Fadl ibn al @-@ Rabi , in demanding that Khurasan and its revenue return to the direct control of the central government , even if that meant breaking the stipulations of the Mecca agreement . 
 The rift between the two camps manifested itself in 810 , when al @-@ Amin added his own son , Musa , to the list of succession . Al @-@ Amin 's intention of overturning Harun 's stipulations in favour of a direct patrilineal succession to his own sons was not unusual : all Abbasid caliphs from al @-@ Mansur onwards had to struggle with their brothers or uncles to bequeath the throne to their sons , and Harun al @-@ Rashid was even imprisoned during the brief reign of his elder brother al @-@ Hadi ( r . 785 – 786 ) . It was only because al @-@ Ma 'mun resided far from the Caliph 's immediate area of control that he escaped sharing this fate . The younger brother , Qasim , was not so fortunate : after his accession , al @-@ Amin swiftly moved to sideline him : initially , Qasim was removed him from his governorship of the Jazira , but soon after he was stripped altogether of his place in the succession and placed under guard at Baghdad . In the same vein , al @-@ Amin sent a delegation to Marv , asking al @-@ Ma 'mun to return to Baghdad . After al @-@ Ma 'mun , fearing for his safety , refused , al @-@ Amin began to interfere with his brother 's domain : he protested al @-@ Ma 'mun 's pardon to Ibn al @-@ Layth after his surrender and asked for tribute from the governors of the western provinces of Khurasan as a sign of submission . He then demanded of his brother the cession of the western regions of Khurasan , the admission of caliphal tax and postal agents into the province , and the forwarding of the Khurasan 's revenue to Baghdad . Al @-@ Ma 'mun , who could not rely on large military forces and whose position was consequently weak , was at first inclined to accede to his brother 's demands , but al @-@ Fadl ibn Sahl dissuaded him from this course and encouraged him to seek support among the native population of Khurasan , who also opposed control by the caliphal court . 
 Al @-@ Ma 'mun , who was already favourably regarded after the excesses of Ali ibn Isa , consciously set about to cultivate the support of the local population , reducing taxes , dispensing justice in person , conceding privileges to the native princes , and demonstratively evoking episodes from the beginnings of the Abbasid movement in the province . He now became a " political magnet for Iranian sympathisers " ( El @-@ Hibri ) , refused to cede his province or return to Baghdad , and began to gather around him those dissatisfied with Baghdad 's centralizing policies or who had simply been left out of the share of spoils and power after the Abbasid Revolution . Under the influence of their respective chief ministers , al @-@ Amin and al @-@ Ma 'mun took steps that further polarized the political climate and made the breach irreparable . After al @-@ Ma 'mun symbolically removed al @-@ Amin 's name from his coins and from the Friday prayer , in November 810 al @-@ Amin removed al @-@ Ma 'mun and al @-@ Mu <unk> from the succession and nominated his own sons Musa and Abdallah instead . Al @-@ Ma 'mun replied by declaring himself imam , a religious title which shied of directly challenging the Caliph but nevertheless implied independent authority , as well as hearkening back to the early days of the Hashimiyya movement which had carried the Abbasids to power . 
 Despite the reservations of some of his senior ministers and governors , two months later , in January 811 , al @-@ Amin formally began the civil war when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan , placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40 @,@ 000 men , drawn from the abnaʾ , and sent him to depose al @-@ Ma 'mun . When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan , he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al @-@ Ma 'mun and carry him back to Baghdad . The news of Ali 's approach threw Khurasan into panic , and even al @-@ Ma 'mun considered fleeing . The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 men , under Tahir ibn al @-@ Husayn . Tahir was sent to confront Ali 's advance , but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission , even by Tahir 's own father . The two armies met at Rayy , on the western borders of Khurasan , and the ensuing battle ( 3 July 811 ) resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis , in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west . 
 Tahir 's unexpected victory was decisive : al @-@ Ma 'mun 's position was secured , while his main opponents , the abnaʾ , lost men , prestige and their most dynamic leader . Tahir now advanced westwards , defeated another abnaʾ army of 20 @,@ 000 under Abd al @-@ Rahman ibn Jabala after a series of hard @-@ fought engagements near Hamadan , and reached <unk> by winter . Al @-@ Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with Arab tribes , notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Banu Qays of Syria . The veteran Abd al @-@ Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa 's son , Husayn . However , al @-@ Amin 's efforts failed due to the long @-@ standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and <unk> , the Syrians ' reluctance to get involved in the civil war , as well as the unwillingness of the abnaʾ to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them . These failed efforts to secure Arab tribal support backfired on al @-@ Amin , as the abnaʾ began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him . In March 812 , Husayn ibn Ali led a short @-@ lived coup against al @-@ Amin in Baghdad , proclaiming al @-@ Ma 'mun as the rightful Caliph , until a counter @-@ coup , led by other factions within the abnaʾ , restored al @-@ Amin to the throne . Fadl ibn al @-@ Rabi , however , one of the main instigators of the war , concluded that al @-@ Amin 's case was lost and resigned from his court offices . At about the same time , al @-@ Ma 'mun was officially proclaimed caliph , while Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of Dhu ' l @-@ Ri <unk> ( " he of the two <unk> " ) , signifying his control over both civil and military administration . 
 In spring 812 , Tahir , reinforced with more troops under Harthama ibn A 'yan , resumed his offensive . He invaded Khuzistan , where he defeated and killed the <unk> governor Muhammad ibn Yazid , whereupon the <unk> of Basra surrendered to him . Tahir also took Kufa and al @-@ Mada 'in , advancing on Baghdad from the west while Harthama closed in from the east . At the same time , al @-@ Amin 's authority crumbled as supporters of al @-@ Ma 'mun took control of Mosul , Egypt and the Hejaz , while most of Syria , Armenia and Azerbaijan fell under the control of local Arab tribal leaders . As Tahir 's army closed on Baghdad , the rift between al @-@ Amin and the abnaʾ was solidified when the desperate Caliph turned to the common people of the city for help and gave them arms . The abnaʾ began deserting to Tahir in droves , and in August 812 , when Tahir 's army appeared before the city , he established his quarters in the suburb of <unk> , traditionally an abnaʾ stronghold . 
 The historian Hugh N. Kennedy characterized the subsequent siege of the city as " an episode almost without parallel in the history of early Islamic society " and " the nearest early Islamic history saw to an attempt at social revolution " , as Baghdad 's urban proletariat defended their city for over a year in a vicious urban guerrilla war . Indeed , it was this " revolutionary " situation in the city as much as famine and the besiegers ' professional expertise , that brought about its fall : in September 813 , Tahir convinced some of the richer citizens to cut the pontoon bridges over the Tigris that connected the city to the outside world , allowing al @-@ Ma 'mun 's men to occupy the city 's eastern suburbs . Al @-@ Ma 'mun 's troops then launched a final assault , in which al @-@ Amin was captured and executed at Tahir 's orders while trying to seek refuge with his old family friend Harthama . 
 = = <unk> dominance and reaction , 813 – 819 = = 
 The regicide of al @-@ Amin soured al @-@ Ma 'mun 's victory . Tahir was soon transferred out of the public eye to an unimportant post in al @-@ Raqqah , but his deed lastingly tarnished the prestige and image of the Abbasid dynasty . According to Elton Daniel , " It shattered the sacrosanct aura which had surrounded the person of the Abbasid caliphs ; For the first time , an Abbasid ruler had been humiliated and put to death by rebellious subjects " . As al @-@ Ma 'mun remained in Marv and made no signs of returning to the caliphal capital , a wave of Arab antipathy towards al @-@ Ma 'mun and his " Persian " supporters came to the fore in the western regions of the Caliphate , particularly in Baghdad and surroundings , which feared being degraded to a mere province . This was furthered when the new Caliph entrusted the governance of the state to Fadl ibn Sahl , who intended to permanently move the Muslim world 's centre of power eastwards to Khurasan , where he and his circle could control the reins of power to the exclusion of other groups . Fadl was also responsible for side @-@ lining many other supporters of al @-@ Ma 'mun ; thus , when Harthama ibn A 'yan went to Marv to inform al @-@ Ma 'mun of the real situation in the west , the Sahlids turned the Caliph against him and he was executed on charges of treason in June 816 . In response , Harthama 's son Hatim led a short @-@ lived revolt in Armenia . 
 The result of these policies was that revolts and local power struggles erupted across the Caliphate , with only Khurasan and the frontier districts with the Byzantine Empire exempt from this turmoil . Iraqi region in particular descended into near @-@ anarchy . The new governor of Iraqi region , Fadl 's brother al @-@ Hasan ibn Sahl , soon lost the support of the abnaʾ . The local population 's alienation from his regime was exploited by the Zaydi Alids , who on 26 January 815 rose in revolt at Kufa , led by former general Abu ' l @-@ Saraya al @-@ Sirri . The revolt spread quickly through Iraq region as various groups with old grievances against the Abbasids used the opportunity to exact revenge . Thus at Basra , the revolt was led by the Alid Zayd , a son of the imam Musa al @-@ Kadhim who had been executed in 799 on Harun al @-@ Rashid 's orders . The uprising came close to threatening Baghdad itself , and it was only through the intervention of the capable Harthama that it was quelled , with Abu ' l @-@ Saraya being captured and executed in October . Secondary pro @-@ Alid movements also seized control of Yemen ( under Ibrahim al @-@ Jazzar , another son of Musa al @-@ Kadhim ) and the <unk> , including Mecca , where Muhammad al @-@ <unk> , a grandson of the Alid imam Ja 'far al @-@ Sadiq , was proclaimed Caliph in November 815 . The suppression of these revolts was entrusted to Ali ibn Isa 's son <unk> , with an army of abnaʾ . <unk> was successful in subduing these provinces , but then attempted , unsuccessfully , to secede from the Caliphate himself . 
 In 816 , to bolster his flagging prestige , al @-@ Ma 'mun assumed the title " God 's Caliph " . Taking note of the widespread Alid support in his western provinces , al @-@ Ma 'mun not only spared the lives of the various Alid anti @-@ caliphs , but on 24 March 817 also named the Alid Ali ibn Musa al @-@ Rida , a third son of Musa al @-@ Kadhim , as his heir apparent , and even changed the official dynastic colour from Abbasid black to Alid green . Although the seriousness of al @-@ Ma 'mun 's commitment to the Alid succession is uncertain — there are suggestions that Ali al @-@ Rida was so old that he could hardly be expected to actually succeed al @-@ Ma 'mun — its impact was disastrous : not only did it fail to produce any tangible popular support , but also provoked an uproar among the members of the Abbasid dynasty in Baghdad . Hasan ibn Sahl had already been forced to abandon the city , where various factional leaders now shared power , and the news of the Alid succession ruined his attempts at conciliation . Instead , on 17 July 817 the members of the Abbasid family in Baghdad nominated a new Caliph of their own , Harun al @-@ Rashid 's younger brother Ibrahim . Ibrahim received broad backing from the Baghdad elites , from Abbasid princes like al @-@ Ma 'mun 's younger brother Abu Ishaq ( the future Caliph al @-@ Mu 'tasim , r . 833 – 842 ) , to old @-@ established members of the bureaucracy like Fadl ibn al @-@ Rabi ( who returned to his office as hajib ) , and leaders of the abnaʾ . As the scholar Mohamed <unk> commented , " in other words , it was a revival of the war between the two camps [ Baghdad and Khurasan ] , dormant since 813 " . 
 Ibrahim moved to secure control of Iraq region , but although he captured Kufa , Hasan ibn Sahl , who had made Wasit his base of operations , managed to get to Basra first . However , the governor of Egypt , Abd al @-@ Aziz al @-@ Azdi , recognized Ibrahim as Caliph . In Khurasan , the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad , falsely informing al @-@ Ma 'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor ( amir ) rather than Caliph . Finally , in December 817 Ali al @-@ Rida succeeded in revealing to al @-@ Ma 'mun the real situation in Iraq , and convinced him that that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it to be , and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary . Al @-@ Ma 'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire , and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad . Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February , probably on al @-@ Ma 'mun 's orders , although the rest of his family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids . Indeed , Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother 's position , and al @-@ Ma 'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters . Ali al @-@ Rida also died during the march on 5 September , possibly of poison . His burial place at <unk> , now known as Mashhad ( " the place of martyrdom " ) , was to become a major Shi 'a pilgrimage site . 
 In the meantime , back in Baghdad , Ibrahim faced desertions , rebellions and conspiracies , one of which involved his half @-@ brother al @-@ Mansur . Hasan ibn Sahl was able to use this turmoil and advance north , capturing Mada 'in . As the months passed , discontent in Baghdad grew . Ibrahim 's supporters , including Fadl ibn al @-@ Rabi , began abandoning him , and in April and July 819 there was a plot to take Ibrahim captive and surrender him to al @-@ Ma 'mun 's forces . Narrowly escaping from this conspiracy , Ibrahim abandoned the throne and went into hiding , opening the path for al @-@ Ma 'mun to reclaim Baghdad . On 17 August 819 , al @-@ Ma 'mun entered Baghdad without resistance , and the political turmoil quickly subsided . Al @-@ Ma 'mun now set about to reconcile himself with the opposition : he rescinded the Alid succession , restored black as the dynastic colour , sent Hasan ibn Sahl into retirement , and recalled Tahir from his exile in Raqqah . Al @-@ Ma 'mun did however retain the title of imam , which became part of the standard caliphal titulature . 
 During the 812 – 813 siege of Baghdad , Tahir had established close ties with the abnaʾ , which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al @-@ Ma 'mun . Tahir was further rewarded with the governorship of Khurasan in September 821 , and when he died in October 822 , he was succeeded by his son , Talha . For the next fifty years , the Tahirid line would provide the governors of a vast eastern province centred on Khurasan , while also providing the governors of Baghdad , securing the city 's loyalty to the caliphal government even after the capital was moved to Samarra . 
 = = Reunification and pacification of the Caliphate , 820 – 827 = = 
 At the time al @-@ Ma 'mun entered Baghdad , the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from effective Abbasid control , with local rulers claiming various degrees of autonomy from the central government . Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions , one under Ubayd Allah ibn al @-@ Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south , while his rival Ali ibn Abd al @-@ Aziz al @-@ Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled the north of the country around the Nile Delta . In addition , Alexandria was in the hands of a group of Andalusian exiles . In northern Syria and the Jazira , the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control , led by Abdallah ibn <unk> and Nasr ibn <unk> al @-@ Uqayli . Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids , while Yemen was troubled by pro @-@ Alid revolts . Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti @-@ Muslim Khurramite movement , which controlled large parts of Azerbaijan and Armenia . 
 To face these insurgencies , al @-@ Ma 'mun turned to another of Tahir 's sons , Abdallah ibn Tahir , to whom he entrusted the command of his army . Ibn Tahir first targeted Nasr ibn <unk> in northern Syria and the Jazira . Nasr was willing to acknowledge al @-@ Ma 'mun 's authority , but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to the Abbasids ' Persian officials , so that he had to be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital , <unk> , in 824 – 825 . After securing his northern flank , Ibn Tahir marched through Syria into Egypt . There the two rivals , although not opposed in principle to al @-@ Ma 'mun as Caliph , were eager to maintain the status quo , and had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad . Ibn Tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre both , so that Ali al @-@ Jarawi quickly went over to him , leaving Ubayd Allah to submit and face deportation to Baghdad . In Alexandria , Ibn Tahir secured the departure of the Andalusians , who left the city for the Byzantine island of Crete , which they conquered and transformed into a Muslim emirate . On his return to Baghdad in 827 , Abdallah ibn Tahir received a triumphal reception , and was appointed governor of Khurasan in 828 , replacing Talha . His place in the west was taken over by al @-@ Ma 'mun 's younger brother Abu Ishaq al @-@ Mu 'tasim . In Yemen , another Alid revolt broke out in 822 under Abd al @-@ Rahman ibn Ahmad , but al @-@ Ma 'mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations . 
 Elsewhere , however , the process of consolidation was harder , or failed completely : Aghlabid @-@ controlled Ifriqiya was confirmed in its autonomous status , effectively slipping entirely from Abbasid control , while in Azerbaijan , al @-@ Ma 'mun 's general Isa ibn Abi Khalid re @-@ established control over the various local Muslim lords in the cities , but was unable to suppress the Khurramite revolt . Expeditions were sent against the Khurramites under <unk> ibn Ali al @-@ Azdi in 824 and Muhammad ibn Humayd al @-@ Ta 'i in 827 – 829 , but both failed before the mountainous terrain and the Khurramites ' guerrilla tactics , with Ibn Humayd losing his life as well . It was not until the accession of al @-@ Mu 'tasim , who employed his new military corps composed of Turkish slave @-@ soldiers ( mawali or ghilman ) against the Khurramites , that their rebellion was suppressed , after years of hard campaigning , in 837 . Despite the restoration of caliphal authority in most provinces , the Caliphate continued to be troubled by rebellions : the rest of al @-@ Ma 'mun 's reign saw a series of uprisings by the Zutt in lower Iraq , a three @-@ year revolt against oppressive taxation in Egypt in 829 , in which both the Christian Copts and the Muslims participated , as well as the unsuccessful revolt of Ali ibn Hisham , Ibn Humayd 's successor as governor of Armenia and Azerbaijan . 
 = = Aftermath and impact = = 
 The long civil war shattered the social and political order of the early Abbasid state , and a new system began to emerge under al @-@ Ma 'mun , which would characterize the middle period of the Abbasid Caliphate . The most tangible change was in the elites who supported the new regime : the abnaʾ , the old Arab families and the members of the Abbasid dynasty itself lost their positions in the administrative and military machinery , and with them their influence and power . The provinces of the Caliphate were now grouped into larger units , often controlled by a hereditary dynasty , like the Tahirids in Khurasan or the Samanids in Transoxiana , usually of Iranian descent . At the same time , however , al @-@ Ma 'mun tried to lessen his dependence on the Iranian element of his empire , and counterbalanced them through the creation of two new military corps : his brother Abu Ishaq 's Turkish slaves , and the Arab tribal army of the Byzantine frontier , which was now reorganized and placed under the command of al @-@ Ma 'mun 's son al @-@ Abbas . This system was further elaborated and acquired its definite characteristics in the reign of Abu Ishaq ( al @-@ Mu 'tasim ) , who created a tightly controlled , centralized state , and expanded his Turkish corps into an effective military force with which he waged campaigns against the Byzantines and internal rebellions alike . The Turkish leaders came to political power as provincial governors , while the old Arab and Iranian elites were completely sidelined . Al @-@ Ma 'mun 's victory also had repercussions in the Abbasid official theological doctrine : in 829 , al @-@ Ma 'mun adopted Mu 'tazilism , in an attempt reconcile doctrinal differences in Islam and reduce social inequities . 
 At the same time , the willingness of al @-@ Ma 'mun and his successors to embrace the non @-@ Arab populations of the Caliphate , especially in the Iranian East , as well as to entrust the governance of these provinces to local dynasties with considerable autonomy , helped to end a long series of religious rebellions and reconciled these populations to Islam : the rate of conversion during al @-@ Ma 'mun 's reign increased markedly , and that was the time when most of the local princely families of the Iranian lands finally became Muslims . As El @-@ Hibri comments , " in time this development represented a prelude to the emergence of autonomous provincial dynasties in the east , which would relate to the caliphal centre in nominal terms of loyalty only " . 
 = Queen Elizabeth @-@ class aircraft carrier = 
 The Queen Elizabeth class is a class of two supercarriers currently under construction for the Royal Navy . The first , HMS Queen Elizabeth , was named on 4 July 2014 , with her ship commissioning planned for 2017 , and an initial operating capability expected in 2020 . The second , HMS Prince of Wales , is scheduled to be launched around 2017 , followed by commissioning in 2020 and service thereafter . On 5 September 2014 , at the NATO 2014 Wales summit , the Prime Minister announced that the second carrier will be brought into service , ending years of uncertainty surrounding its future . 
 The contract for the vessels was announced on 25 July 2007 , by the then Secretary of State for Defence , Des Browne , ending several years of delay over cost issues and British naval shipbuilding restructuring . The contracts were signed one year later on 3 July 2008 , after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group 's VT Shipbuilding , which was a requirement of the UK Government . 
 The vessels currently have a displacement of approximately 70 @,@ 600 tonnes ( 69 @,@ 500 long tons ) , but the design anticipates growth over the lifetime of the ships . The ships will be 280 metres ( 920 ft ) long and have a tailored air group of up to forty aircraft ( though are capable of carrying up to fifty at full load ) . They will be the largest warships ever constructed for the Royal Navy . The projected cost of the programme is £ 6 @.@ 2 billion . 
 The carriers will be completed as originally planned , in a Short Take @-@ Off and Vertical Landing ( STOVL ) configuration , deploying the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35B . Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review , the British government had intended to purchase the F @-@ 35C carrier version of this aircraft , and adopted plans for Prince of Wales to be built to a Catapult Assisted Take Off Barrier Arrested Recovery ( CATOBAR ) configuration . After the projected costs of the CATOBAR system rose to around twice the original estimate , the government announced that it would revert to the original design on 10 May 2012 .

 In May 1997 , the newly elected Labour government launched the Strategic Defence Review ( SDR ) which re @-@ evaluated every weapon system ( active or in procurement ) with the exception of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Vanguard @-@ class ballistic missile submarines . The report , published in July 1998 , identified that aircraft carriers offer the following : 
 Ability to operate offensive aircraft abroad when foreign basing may be denied . 
 All required space and infrastructure ; where foreign bases are available they are not always available early in a conflict and infrastructure is often lacking . 
 A coercive and deterrent effect when deployed to a trouble spot . 
 The report concluded : " the emphasis is now on increased offensive air power , and an ability to operate the largest possible range of aircraft in the widest possible range of roles . When the current carrier force reaches the end of its planned life , we plan to replace it with two larger vessels . Work will now begin to refine our requirements but present thinking suggests that they might be of the order of 30 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 tonnes and capable of deploying up to fifty aircraft , including helicopters . " 
 = = = Design studies = = = 
 The vessels , described as " supercarriers " by the media , legislators and sometimes by the Royal Navy , will displace approximately 70 @,@ 600 t ( 69 @,@ 500 long tons ) each , over three times the displacement of its predecessor , the Invincible class . They will be the largest warships ever built in the United Kingdom . The last large carriers proposed for the Royal Navy , the CVA @-@ 01 programme , were cancelled by the Labour government in 1966 . In November 2004 , giving evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee , First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Alan West explained that the sortie rate and interoperability with the United States Navy were factors in deciding on the size of the carriers and the composition of the carriers ' air @-@ wings : 
 The reason that we have arrived at what we have arrived at is because to do the initial strike package , that deep strike package , we have done really quite detailed calculations and we have come out with the figure of 36 joint strike fighters , and that is what has driven the size of it , and that is to be able to deliver the weight of effort that you need for these operations that we are planning in the future . That is the thing that has made us arrive at that size of deck and that size of ship , to enable that to happen . I think it is something like 75 sorties per day over the five @-@ day period or something like that as well . 
 I have talked with the CNO ( Chief of Naval Operations ) in America . He is very keen for us to get these because he sees us slotting in with his carrier groups . For example , in Afghanistan last year they had to call on the French to bail them out with their carrier . He really wants us to have these , but he wants us to have same sort of clout as one of their carriers , which is this figure at 36 . He would find that very useful , and really we would mix and match with that . 
 On 25 January 1999 , six companies were invited to tender for the assessment phase of the project – Boeing , British Aerospace , Lockheed Martin , Marconi Electronic Systems , Raytheon and Thomson @-@ CSF . On 23 November 1999 , the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) awarded detailed assessment studies to two consortia , one led by BAe ( renamed BAE Systems on 30 November 1999 ) and one led by Thomson @-@ CSF ( renamed Thales Group in 2000 ) . The brief required up to six designs from each consortium with air @-@ groups of thirty to forty Future Joint Combat Aircraft ( <unk> ) . The contracts were split into phases ; the first £ 5 @.@ 9 million phase was for design assessment which would form part of the aircraft selection , while the second £ 23 @.@ 5 million phase involved " risk reduction on the preferred carrier design option . "

 On 17 January 2001 , the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) with the United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) for full participation in the Joint Strike Fighter ( JSF ) programme , confirming the JSF as the <unk> . This gave the UK input into aircraft design and the choice between the Lockheed Martin X @-@ 35 and Boeing X @-@ 32 . On 26 October 2001 , the DoD announced that Lockheed Martin had won the JSF contract . 
 On 30 September 2002 , the MoD announced that the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force would operate the STOVL F @-@ 35B variant . Also announced was that the carriers would take the form of large , conventional carriers , initially adapted for STOVL operations . The carriers , expected to remain in service for fifty years , were designed for but not with catapults and arrestor wires . The carriers were thus planned to be " future proof " , allowing them to operate a generation of CATOBAR aircraft beyond the F @-@ 35 . Four months later on 30 January 2003 , the Defence Secretary , Geoff Hoon , announced that the Thales Group design had won the competition but that BAE Systems would operate as prime contractor . 
 When the Secretary of State for Defence announced the contract for the vessels , the cost was initially estimated at £ 3 @.@ 9 billion . The contracts were officially signed one year later on 3 July 2008 , after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group 's VT Shipbuilding which was a requirement of the UK Government . At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £ <unk> for two ships . The financial crisis led to a decision in December 2008 to slow production , delaying the first ship until May 2016 and the second by two years . This decision alone added £ <unk> to the cost . By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £ <unk> ; taking off the cost of capital led to a <unk> Capital DEL baseline cost of £ <unk> at this time . If the carriers had been abandoned in the 2010 SDSR then the MoD could have cancelled £ <unk> of planned spending on Queen Elizabeth and £ <unk> of planned spending on Prince of Wales , but the loss of VAT exemption meant that cancelling one or two carriers would have overall saved £ <unk> and £ <unk> respectively . These long term savings were less important than the short term costs , there would have been nearly an extra £ 1bn of expenditure on cancellation costs in the <unk> / 12 budget . In November 2013 the contract was renegotiated with a budget of £ <unk> and BAE agreeing to pay 50 % of any cost overruns rather than 10 % as previously . 
 Then in August 2009 , speculation mounted that the UK would drop the F @-@ 35B for the F @-@ 35C model , which would have meant the carriers being built to operate conventional take off and landing aircraft using the US @-@ designed Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System ( <unk> ) catapults . 
 = = = Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 = = = 
 On 19 October 2010 , the government announced the results of its Strategic Defence and Security Review . The review stated that only one carrier was certain to be commissioned ; the fate of the other was left undecided . The second ship of the class could be placed in " extended readiness " to provide a continuous single carrier strike capability when the other was in refit , or provide the option to regenerate more quickly to a two carrier strike ability . Alternatively , the second ship could be sold in " cooperation with a close ally to provide continuous carrier @-@ strike capability . " 
 It was also announced that the operational carrier would have catapult and arrestor gear ( CATOBAR ) installed to accommodate the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter rather than the short @-@ take off and vertical @-@ landing version . 
 The decision to convert Prince of Wales to CATOBAR was reviewed after the projected costs rose to around double the original estimate . On 10 May 2012 , the Defence Secretary , Philip Hammond , announced in Parliament that the government had decided to revert to its predecessor 's plans to purchase the F @-@ 35B rather than the F @-@ 35C , and to complete both aircraft carriers with " ski @-@ jumps " in the STOVL configuration . The total cost of the work that had been done on the conversion to a CATOBAR configuration , and of reverting the design to the original STOVL configuration , was estimated by Philip Hammond to be " something in the order of £ 100 million . " In later testimony before a parliamentary committee , Bernard Gray , Chief of Defence Materiel , revealed that even though the carriers had been sold as adaptable and easy to convert for CATOBAR , no serious effort had been made in this direction since 2002 . 
 = = = Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 = = = 
 On 23 November 2015 , the government published its 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review which confirmed its plans to bring into service both Queen Elizabeth @-@ class aircraft carriers , with one to be available at all times . The review also confirmed that one of the carriers would have enhanced amphibious capabilities . The government also reaffirmed its commitment to ordering 138 F @-@ 35 Lightning IIs , although the specific variant ( s ) was not mentioned . The review stated that 24 of these aircraft would be available to the aircraft carriers by 2023 .

 The ships ' company is 679 rising to 1 @,@ 600 with air element added . A more recent parliamentary reply stated the average crew size will be 672 . They will have a displacement of 65 @,@ 000 tonnes on delivery , but the design allows for this to reach over 70 @,@ 000 tonnes as the ship is upgraded through its lifetime . They have an overall length of 280 metres ( 920 ft ) , a width at deck level of 70 metres ( 230 ft ) , a height of 56 metres ( 184 ft ) , a draught of 11 metres ( 36 ft ) and a range of 10 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 000 mi ; 19 @,@ 000 km ) . The Ministry of Defence decided not to use nuclear propulsion due to its high cost , so power is supplied by two Rolls @-@ Royce Marine Trent <unk> 36 MW ( 48 @,@ 000 hp ) gas turbine generator units and four Wärtsilä diesel generator sets ( two 9 MW or 12 @,@ 000 hp and two 11 MW or 15 @,@ 000 hp sets ) . The <unk> and diesels are the largest ever supplied to the Royal Navy , and together they feed the low @-@ voltage electrical systems as well as four GE Power Conversion 's 20 MW Advanced Induction Motor ( arranged in tandem ) electric propulsion motors that drive the twin fixed @-@ pitch propellers . 
 Instead of a single island superstructure containing both the ship 's navigation bridge and flying control ( <unk> ) centres , the ships will have these operations divided between two structures , with the forward island for navigating the ship and the aft island for controlling flying operations . Under the flight deck are a further nine decks . The hangar deck measures 155 by 33 @.@ 5 metres ( 509 by 110 ft ) with a height of 6 @.@ 7 to 10 metres ( 22 to 33 ft ) , large enough to accommodate up to twenty fixed and rotary wing aircraft . To transfer aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck , the ships have two large lifts , each of which is capable of lifting two F @-@ 35 @-@ sized aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck in sixty seconds . The ships ' only announced self @-@ defence weapons are currently the Phalanx CIWS for airborne threats , with miniguns and 30 mm cannon to counter seaborne threats . 
 = = = Systems = = = 
 The ship 's radars will be the BAE Systems and Thales <unk> , the same as fitted to the Type 45 destroyers , for long @-@ range wide @-@ area search , the BAE Systems Artisan 3D Type 997 maritime medium @-@ range active electronically scanned array radar , and a navigation radar . BAE claims the <unk> has a fully automatic detection and track initiation that can track up to 1 @,@ 000 air targets at a range of around 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) . Artisan can " track a target the size of a snooker ball over 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) away " , with a maximum range of 200 km . ( Artisan will also be fitted to Type 23 frigates , the assault ships HMS Albion , HMS Bulwark and HMS Ocean . ) They will also be fitted with the Ultra Electronics Series 2500 Electro Optical System ( EOS ) and Glide Path Camera ( GPC ) . 
 Munitions and ammunition handling is accomplished using a highly mechanised weapons handling system ( <unk> ) . This is a first naval application of a common land @-@ based warehouse system . The <unk> moves <unk> munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas , along track ways and via several lifts , forward and aft or port and starboard . The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines , the hangar , weapons preparation areas , and the flight deck . In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned , the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location , and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use . This system speeds up delivery and reduces the size of the crew by automation . 
 = = = Crew facilities = = = 
 Crew facilities will include a cinema , physical fitness areas and four galleys manned by sixty @-@ seven catering staff . There are four large dining areas , the largest with the capacity to serve 960 meals in one hour . There are eleven medical staff for the eight @-@ bed medical facility , which includes an operating theatre and a dental surgery . There are 1 @,@ 600 bunks in 470 cabins , including accommodation for a company of 250 Royal Marines with wide assault routes up to the flight deck .

 The vessels are expected to be capable of carrying forty aircraft , a maximum of thirty @-@ six F @-@ 35s and four helicopters . The 2010 SDSR anticipated the routine peacetime deployment of twelve F @-@ 35Bs , rising to a surge force of 24 F @-@ 35Bs and a number of helicopters . Fourteen Merlin HM2 will be available as a Maritime Force Protection package on the carriers with typically nine in anti @-@ submarine configuration and five with Crowsnest for airborne early warning ; alternatively a Littoral Manoeuvre package could include a mix of RAF Chinooks , Army Apaches , Royal Navy Merlin HC4 and Wildcat AH1 . As of September 2013 six landing spots are planned , but the deck could be marked out for the operation of ten medium helicopters at once , allowing the lift of a company of 250 troops . The hangars are designed for CH @-@ 47 Chinook operations without blade folding and the V @-@ 22 Osprey tiltrotor , whilst the aircraft lifts can accommodate two Chinooks with unfolded blades . 
 = = = Fixed @-@ wing aircraft = = = 
 Although the size of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to accommodate most current and projected carrier @-@ based fixed @-@ wing aircraft , the lack of arresting gear means that , as initially completed , it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft , such as the AV @-@ 8B Harrier or F @-@ 35B Lightning , tiltrotor aircraft such as the V @-@ 22 Osprey , or aircraft that do not require either catapult assisted take @-@ off or arrested recovery . 
 = = = = F @-@ 35 Lightning II = = = = 
 With the retirement of the Harrier GR7 / 9 in 2010 , there remained no carrier @-@ capable fixed @-@ wing aircraft available to the Royal Navy or Royal Air Force . Their expected replacement is the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 Lightning II . 
 As originally intended , the ships will carry the STOVL version , the F @-@ 35B . The aircraft will be flown by pilots from the Fleet Air Arm and the Royal Air Force . The aircraft are expected to begin trials flying from Queen Elizabeth in 2018 with a carrier air wing fully operational by 2020 . 
 For a period following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review , the government had intended to purchase the F @-@ 35C carrier variant and modify one carrier to use the CATOBAR system to launch and recover these aircraft . This was because the cheaper F @-@ 35C variant has a greater range and can carry a larger and more diverse payload than the F @-@ 35B . On 10 May 2012 Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced in Parliament that the government had decided to revert to its predecessor 's plans to purchase the F @-@ 35B rather than the F @-@ 35C , and to abandon the completion of Prince of Wales to a CATOBAR configuration . The reason given was that " conversion to ' cats and traps ' will cost about double what was originally estimated – and would not be delivered until 2023 at the earliest . " On 19 July 2012 , Defence Secretary Philip Hammond indicated in a speech in the United States that the UK would order an initial 48 F @-@ 35B aircraft to be operated jointly by the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm . In November 2015 , the government announced its commitment to a full order of 138 F @-@ 35 aircraft , with 24 available for carrier duties by 2023 . 
 Although the F @-@ 35B is fully capable of performing vertical landing , in a similar fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated , this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with . As a consequence , to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions , the Royal Navy is developing the <unk> rolling vertical landing ( <unk> ) technique for its operation of the Lightning II . <unk> is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning 's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing , using its disc brakes , without the need of an arrestor wire .

 The AgustaWestland AW101 is a medium @-@ sized multi @-@ role helicopter . Two versions are in service with the UK armed forces , where it is known as Merlin . The utility version can carry up to twenty four troops seated or sixteen stretcher patients and the HM2 anti @-@ submarine warfare variant has a dipping sonar and sonar @-@ buoys , and a complete electronic warfare suite . 
 Both versions use a common airframe , with three Rolls @-@ Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines , their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option , is 750 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 390 km ; 860 mi ) , or six hours . However , range can be extended further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the cabin . Armament depends on mission , but includes anti @-@ ship missiles , torpedoes , three door @-@ mounted machine guns , multi @-@ purpose rocket , cannon pods , air @-@ to @-@ air missiles and air @-@ to @-@ surface missiles . At least 14 Merlin <unk> will be assigned to the carrier .

The HM2 maritime version can be armed with air @-@ to @-@ surface missiles , torpedoes , depth charges , cannons and heavy machine guns . The aircraft has a maximum range of 520 nautical miles ( 960 km ; 600 mi ) and an endurance of four and a half hours . 
 = = = Airborne early warning and control = = = 
 The 1982 Falklands War made clear the importance of airborne early warning and control and led to the development of the Sea King AEW2 , which was succeeded by the Sea King ASaC7 . This will be retired in the second half of 2018 and planning for its replacement was identified at an early stage as an integral part of the next @-@ generation aircraft carrier . The programme became known as the " Future Organic Airborne Early Warning " ( <unk> ) , and contracts were placed with BAE / Northrop Grumman and Thales in April 2001 . In April 2002 , BAE and Northrop Grumman received a follow @-@ on study contract for Phase II of the project , by then renamed Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control ( MASC ) . The MASC assessment phase began in September 2005 and by May 2006 three study contracts were awarded for MASC platform and mission systems options : one to Lockheed Martin UK for a Merlin helicopter fitted with AEW mission systems , another to AgustaWestland to maintain the present Sea King ASaC7 and finally to Thales UK to upgrade the Sea King 's mission systems . 
 The 2010 SDSR delayed the project which became a competition between Thales and Lockheed to supply Crowsnest , a bolt @-@ on sensor package that can be carried by any Merlin HM2 . The Thales pod is based on the Sea King 's Searchwater 2000 ; Lockheed had intended to use a derivative of the F @-@ 35 's APG @-@ 81 radar but is now believed to be using an Elta system . Both systems will begin flight trials in the summer of 2014 ahead of Main Gate in 2016 . Ten pods are planned with IOC in 2019 . Until the Crowsnest system is available , a small force of Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters will remain in service with 849 Naval Air Squadron after the final withdrawal of the remainder of the Royal Navy 's Sea Kings .

 During a speech on 21 July 2004 , Geoff Hoon announced a one @-@ year delay to allow contractual and cost issues to be resolved . The building of the carriers was confirmed in December 2005 . The building is being undertaken by four companies across seven shipyards , with final block integration and assembly at Rosyth : 
 BAE Systems Surface Ships – Govan ( Lower Blocks 3 and 4 ) , Scotstoun ( aft island ) and Portsmouth ( Lower Blocks 2 , 5 and forward island ) 
 Babcock Marine – Rosyth ( <unk> , Mast and Centre Blocks 5 and 6 ) and Appledore ( Lower Block 1 ) 
 A & P Group – Hebburn ( Centre Block 3 ) 
 Cammell Laird – Birkenhead ( Centre Blocks 2 and 4 ) 
 In December 2007 , eight diesel engines and electricity generators , four for each ship were ordered from Wärtsilä . On 4 March 2008 , contracts for the supply of 80 @,@ 000 tonnes of steel were awarded to Corus Group , with an estimated value of £ 65 million . Other contracts included £ 3 million for fibre optic cable , over £ 1 million for reverse osmosis equipment to provide over 500 tonnes of fresh water daily , and £ 4 million for aviation fuel systems . On 3 April 2008 , a contract for the manufacture of aircraft lifts ( worth £ 13m ) was awarded to MacTaggart Scott of Loanhead , Scotland . 
 In mid May 2008 , the Treasury announced that it would be making available further funds on top of the regular defence budget , reportedly allowing the construction of the carriers to begin . This was followed , on 20 May 2008 , by the government giving the " green light " for construction of the Queen Elizabeth class , stating that it was ready to sign the contracts for full production once the creation of the planned shipbuilding joint venture between BAE Systems and the VT Group had taken place . This joint venture , BVT Surface Fleet , became operational on 1 July 2008 . VT Group later sold its share to BAE Systems which renamed the unit BAE Systems Surface Ships . It will undertake approximately forty per cent of the project workload . 
 On 1 September 2008 , the MoD announced a £ 51 million package of important equipment contracts ; £ 34 million for the highly mechanised weapons handling system for the two ships , £ 8 million for supply of uptake and down @-@ take systems for both ships , £ 5 million for air traffic control software , £ 3 million for supply of pumps and associated systems engineering , and £ 1 million for emergency diesel generators . On 6 October 2008 , it was announced that contracts had been placed for " the carriers ' Rolls @-@ Royce gas turbines , generators , motors , power distribution equipment , platform management systems , propellers , shafts , steering gear , rudders and stabilisers " . 
 The construction of the two carriers involves more than 10 @,@ 000 people from 90 companies , 7 @,@ 000 of them in the six shipyards building the sections of the ships . 
 = = = Queen Elizabeth = = = 
 The first steel cut for the project , in July 2009 , signalled the start of construction of Lower Block 3 at BAE Systems Clyde , where production of Lower Block 4 started in January 2010 . Meanwhile , construction of the bow Lower Block 1 was carried out at Appledore , North Devon , and was completed in March 2010 . 
 On 25 January 2010 , it was announced that the Cammell Laird shipyard has secured a £ 44 million contract to build the flight decks of the carriers . That same day , construction began in Portsmouth of the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ tonne Lower Block 2 for Queen Elizabeth . On 16 August 2011 , the 8 @,@ 000 @-@ tonne Lower Block 03 of Queen Elizabeth left BAE Systems Surface Ships ' Govan shipyard in Glasgow on a large ocean @-@ going barge . Travelling 600 miles ( 970 km ) around the northern coast of Scotland , the block arrived at Rosyth on the evening of 20 August 2011 . Her forward island was built at BAE Portsmouth and attached on 14 March 2013 ; the aft island was attached in June 2013 and the ski jump in November 2013 . 
 Queen Elizabeth was christened on 4 July 2014 , and floated @-@ out on 17 July 2014 . Fitting out will take until the end of 2015 and the crew will move aboard in May 2016 ahead of sea trials beginning in August 2016 and delivery in May 2017 .

 = = = Prince of Wales = = = 
 The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review ( SDSR ) declared that the UK needed only one aircraft carrier ; however , penalty clauses in the contract meant that cancelling the second vessel would be more expensive than actually building it . The SDSR , therefore , directed that the second aircraft carrier , Prince of Wales , should be built but upon completion be either mothballed or sold . The SDSR also directed that the ship be converted to a CATOBAR configuration ; however , the costs associated with the conversion escalated to £ <unk> , leading the government to reverse its decision and build the ship to the original STOVL configuration . On 26 May 2011 , Defence Secretary Liam Fox cut the first steel for Prince of Wales . The Royal Navy 's 2012 / 13 yearbook stated " both carriers are likely to be commissioned and may even be capable of operating together " . In 2014 , the Prime Minister , David Cameron , announced that Prince of Wales would be brought into service . 
 As of 20 April 2016 , construction of Prince of Wales was announced to be 80 % complete . The ship is set to be handed over to the RN in 2019 and be fully ready for front @-@ line duties around the globe from 2023 . 
 In the period between handover and the restoration of operational Royal Navy fixed @-@ wing capability Mark Urban speculated on the BBC programme Newsnight that both ships could ' host ' USMC <unk> aircraft . 
 = Tropical Storm Aletta ( 1982 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Aletta was a weak but destructive tropical storm that killed 308 people while meandering off the coast of Central America in May 1982 . An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression on May 20 , and into a tropical storm around noon on May 21 . The cyclone turned northeast , reaching its peak as a strong tropical storm on May 23 . Aletta meandered and gradually weakened , dissipating a few hundred miles southwest of Acapulco on May 29 . Moisture from the tropical system spread over Honduras and Nicaragua , causing flooding . Throughout the two countries , 308 people were killed and total damage was at $ 457 million ( 1982 USD ) . In the aftermath of the storm , many programs provided relief to the victims of Aletta . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Aletta are from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on May 18 about 500 mi ( 800 km ) south @-@ southwest of Acapulco . On May 20 , satellite imagery showed evidence of a weak atmospheric circulation . Based on this , the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression . Moving northwest , the depression became Tropical Storm Aletta 36 hours later over 86 ° F ( 30 ° C ) sea surface temperatures . The system re @-@ curved towards the northeast due to strong upper @-@ level westerlies , reaching its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) on May 23 . 
 Shortly after its peak , Tropical Storm Aletta began to weaken . However , the tropical cyclone managed to maintain winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) for 30 hours before resuming a weakening trend . While the steering currents weakened on May 25 , Aletta slowed and moved in a large clockwise loop until May 28 . Shortly thereafter , Tropical Storm Aletta was downgraded into a depression . Tropical Depression Aletta dissipated on May 29 roughly 180 mi ( 290 km / h ) southwest of Acapulco .

 The outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Aletta produced torrential rains and high winds over Central America for several days , and precipitation totals were as high as 23 @.@ 3 in ( 590 mm ) in some areas with a peak of 57 @.@ 32 in ( 1 @,@ 456 mm ) in Chinandega . A red cross official stated that " Entire families were swept away by [ flood waters ] and we know nothing about them " . Because all sewers in Nicaragua were damaged , the water was contaminated . Ninety percent of the banana crop and 60 percent of the corn crop was completely destroyed . Throughout the country , 108 people were killed , ( 10 of which drowned in floodwaters ) . Roughly 20 @,@ 000 people were homeless and total damage was estimated at $ 365 million ( 1982 USD ) ; damage to highways , factories , and farms exceeded $ 100 million . In the northern portion of the country , a mudslide buried three small mountain villages , leaving 270 missing and only 29 survivors . About 15 @,@ 000 sought to two emergency shelters . Many bridges were damaged . Since the capital city of Leon was hardest hit , a disaster area was declared for the nearby area . Aletta was considered the worst disaster in the country in three years . 
 Across Honduras , 200 people were killed and 5 @,@ 000 people were without food or water in just 13 communities . A total of 80 @,@ 000 people were homeless which were later housed in schools , churches , and health victims . Total damage was placed at $ 101 million ( 1982 USD ) . 
 On May 27 , the governments of both Honduras and Nicaragua appealed for international aid . Soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries . A second appeal was made shortly afterwards , which proposed for $ 5 @.@ 1 million in medicine and other supplies . The red cross and United Nations ( UN ) appealed for $ 3 million in international relief . The UN granted Nicaragua a month 's worth of food supply , but officials feared that this would not be enough .

 = Ain 't = 
 Ain 't is a contraction for am not , is not , are not , has not , and have not in the common English language vernacular . In some dialects ain 't is also used as a contraction of do not , does not , and did not . The development of ain 't for the various forms of to be not , to have not , and to do not occurred independently , at different times . The usage of ain 't for the forms of to be not was established by the mid @-@ 18th century , and for the forms of to have not by the early 19th century . 
 The usage of ain 't is a perennial subject of controversy in English . Ain 't is commonly used by many speakers in oral or informal settings , especially in certain regions and dialects . Its usage is often highly stigmatized , and it may be used as a marker of low socio @-@ economic or regional status or education level . Its use is generally considered non @-@ standard by dictionaries and style guides except when used for rhetorical effect , and it is rarely found in formal written works . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Ain 't has several antecedents in English , corresponding to the various forms of to be not and to have not that ain 't contracts . The development of ain 't for to be not and to have not is a diachronic coincidence ; in other words , they were independent developments at different times . 
 = = = Contractions of to be not = = = 
 Amn 't as a contraction of am not is known from 1618 . As the " mn " combination of two nasal consonants is <unk> by many English speakers , the " m " of amn 't began to be elided , reflected in writing with the new form an 't . Aren 't as a contraction for are not first appeared in 1675 . In non @-@ rhotic dialects , aren 't lost its " r " sound , and began to be pronounced as an 't . 
 An 't ( sometimes a 'n't ) arose from am not and are not almost simultaneously . An 't first appears in print in the work of English Restoration playwrights . In 1695 an 't was used as a contraction of " am not " , in William Congreve 's play Love for Love : " I can hear you farther off , I an 't deaf " . But as early as 1696 Sir John Vanbrugh uses an 't to mean " are not " in The Relapse : " Hark thee shoemaker ! These shoes an 't ugly , but they don 't fit me " . 
 An 't for is not may have developed independently from its use for am not and are not . Isn 't was sometimes written as in 't or en 't , which could have changed into an 't . An 't for is not may also have filled a gap as an extension of the already @-@ used conjugations for to be not . Jonathan Swift used an 't to mean is not in Letter 19 of his Journal to Stella ( 1710 – 13 ) : It an 't my fault , ' tis Patrick 's fault ; pray now don 't blame Presto . 
 An 't with a long " a " sound began to be written as ain 't , which first appears in writing in 1749 . By the time ain 't appeared , an 't was already being used for am not , are not , and is not . An 't and ain 't coexisted as written forms well into the nineteenth century — Charles Dickens used the terms interchangeably , as in Chapter 13 , Book the Second of Little Dorrit ( 1857 ) : " ' I guessed it was you , Mr Pancks , " said she , ' for it 's quite your regular night ; ain 't it ? ... An 't it gratifying , Mr Pancks , though ; really ? ' " . In the English lawyer William Hickey 's memoirs ( 1808 – 1810 ) , ain 't appears as a contraction of aren 't ; " thank God we 're all alive , ain 't we ... " 
 = = = Contractions of to have not = = = 
 Han 't or ha 'n't , an early contraction for has not and have not , developed from the elision of the " s " of has not and the " v " of have not . Han 't appeared in the work of English Restoration playwrights , as in The Country Wife ( 1675 ) by William Wycherley : Gentlemen and Ladies , han 't you all heard the late sad report / of poor Mr. Horner . Much like an 't , han 't was sometimes pronounced with a long " a " , yielding hain 't . With H @-@ dropping , the " h " of han 't or hain 't gradually disappeared in most dialects , and became ain 't . 
 Ain 't as a contraction for has not / have not first appeared in dictionaries in the 1830s , and appeared in 1819 in Niles ' Weekly Register : Strike ! Why I ain 't got nobody here to strike .... Charles Dickens likewise used ain 't to mean haven 't in Chapter 28 of Martin Chuzzlewit ( 1844 ) : " You ain 't got nothing to cry for , bless you ! He 's <unk> than a <unk> ! " 
 Like with an 't , han 't and ain 't were found together late into the nineteenth century , as in Chapter 12 of Dickens ' Our Mutual Friend : " ' Well , have you finished ? ' asked the strange man . ' No , ' said <unk> , ' I ain 't ' .... ' You sir ! You han 't said what you want of me . ' "

 Ain 't meaning didn 't is widely considered a feature unique to African American Vernacular English , although it can be found in some dialects of Caribbean English as well . It may function not as a true variant of didn 't , but as a creole @-@ like tense @-@ neutral <unk> ( sometimes termed generic ain 't ) . Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African @-@ Americans acquired English as a second language ; it is also possible that early African @-@ Americans inherited this variation from colonial European @-@ Americans , and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage . Ain 't is rarely attested for the present @-@ tense constructions do not or does not . 
 = = Linguistic characteristics = = 
 Linguistically , ain 't is formed by the same rule that English speakers use to form aren 't and other contractions of auxiliary verbs . Most linguists consider usage of ain 't to be grammatical , as long as its users convey their intended meaning to their audience . In other words , a sentence such as " She ain 't got no sense " is grammatical because it generally follows a native speaker 's word order , and because a native speaker would recognize the meaning of that sentence . Linguists draw a distinction , however , between <unk> and acceptability : what may be considered grammatical across all dialects may nevertheless be considered not acceptable in certain dialects or contexts . The usage of ain 't is socially unacceptable in some situations . 
 Functionally , ain 't has operated in part to plug what is known as the " amn 't gap " – the anomalous situation in standard English whereby there are standard contractions for other forms of to be not ( aren 't for are not , and isn 't for is not ) , but no standard contraction for am not . Historically , ain 't has filled the gap where one might expect amn 't , even in contexts where other uses of ain 't were disfavored . Standard dialects that regard ain 't as non @-@ standard often substitute aren 't for am not in tag questions ( e.g. , " I 'm doing okay , aren 't I ? " ) , while leaving the " amn 't gap " open in declarative statements . 
 = = Prescription and stigma = = 
 Ain 't has been called " the most stigmatized word in the language , " as well as " the most powerful social marker " in English . It is a prominent example in English of a shibboleth – a word used to determine inclusion in , or exclusion from , a group . 
 Historically , this was not the case . For most of its history , ain 't was acceptable across many social and regional contexts . Throughout the 17th , 18th , and 19th centuries , ain 't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both educated and uneducated English speakers , and was found in the correspondence and fiction of , among others , Jonathan Swift , Lord Byron , Henry Fielding , and George Eliot . For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope , the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain 't freely , but in familiar speech only . Ain 't continued to be used without restraint by many upper middle class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century . 
 Ain 't was a prominent target of early <unk> writers . In the 18th and early 19th centuries , some writers began to propound the need to establish a " pure " or " correct " form of English . Contractions in general were disapproved of , but ain 't and its variants were seen as particularly " vulgar . " This push for " correctness " was driven mainly by the middle class , which led to an incongruous situation in which non @-@ standard constructions continued to be used by both lower and upper classes , but not by the middle class . The reason for the strength of the prescription against ain 't is not entirely clear . 
 The strong prescription against ain 't in standard English has led to many misconceptions , often expressed jocularly ( or ironically ) , as " ain 't ain 't a word " or " ain 't ain 't in the dictionary . " Ain 't is listed in most dictionaries , including the Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam @-@ Webster . However , Oxford states " it does not form part of standard English and should never be used in formal or written contexts , " and Merriam @-@ Webster states it is " widely disapproved as non @-@ standard and more common in the habitual speech of the less educated " . 
 Webster 's Third New International Dictionary , published in 1961 , went against then @-@ standard practice when it included the following usage note in its entry on ain 't : " though disapproved by many and more common in less educated speech , used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers esp. in the phrase ain 't I. " Many commentators disapproved of the dictionary 's relatively permissive attitude toward the word , which was inspired , in part , by the belief of its editor , Philip Gove , that " distinctions of usage were elitist and artificial . " 
 = = Regional usage and dialects = = 
 Ain 't is found throughout the English @-@ speaking world across regions and classes , and is among the most pervasive nonstandard terms in English . It is one of two negation features ( the other being the double negative ) that are known to appear in all nonstandard English dialects . Ain 't is used throughout the United Kingdom , with its geographical distribution increasing over time . It is also found throughout the United States , including in Appalachia , the South , New England , the Mid @-@ Atlantic , and the Upper Midwest . In its geographical ubiquity , ain 't is to be contrasted with other folk usages such as y 'all , which is confined to the South region of the United States . 
 In England , ain 't is generally considered a non @-@ standard or illiterate usage , as it is used by speakers of a lower socio @-@ economic class , or by educated people in an informal manner . In the nineteenth century , ain 't was often used by writers to denote regional dialects such as Cockney English . Ain 't is a non @-@ standard feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English , and in New Zealand , ain 't is a feature of Maori @-@ influenced English . In American English , usage of ain 't corresponds to a middle level of education , although it is widely believed that its use establishes of lack of education or social standing in the speaker . 
 The usage of ain 't in the southern United States is distinctive , however , in the continued usage of the word by well @-@ educated , cultivated speakers . Ain 't is in common usage of educated Southerners . In the South , the use of ain 't can be used as a marker to separate cultured speakers from those who lack confidence in their social standing and thus avoid its use entirely . 
 = = Rhetorical and popular usage = = 
 Ain 't can be used in both speech and writing to catch attention and to give emphasis , as in " Ain 't that a crying shame , " or " If it ain 't broke , don 't fix it . " Merriam @-@ Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary gives an example from film critic Richard Schickel : " the wackiness of movies , once so deliciously amusing , ain 't funny anymore . " It can also be used deliberately for what The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style describes as " tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek " or " reverse snobbery " . Star baseball pitcher Dizzy Dean , a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and later a popular announcer , once said , " A lot of people who don 't say ain 't , ain 't eatin ' . " 
 Although ain 't is seldom found in formal writing , it is frequently used in more informal written settings , such as popular song lyrics . In genres such as traditional country music , blues , rock n ' roll , and hip @-@ hop , lyrics often include nonstandard features such as ain 't . This is principally due to the use of such features as markers of " covert identity and prestige . " 
 Ain 't is standard in some fixed phrases , such as " You ain 't seen nothing yet " .

 = George III of the United Kingdom = 
 George III ( George William Frederick ; 4 June 1738 – 29 January 1820 ) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801 , after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death . He was concurrently Duke and prince @-@ elector of Brunswick @-@ Lüneburg ( " Hanover " ) in the Holy Roman Empire until his promotion to King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors he was born in Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover . 
 His life and with it his reign , which were longer than any other British monarch before him , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American Revolutionary War . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . 
 In the later part of his life , George III had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established , and George III 's eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent . On George III 's death , the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV . 
 Historical analysis of George III 's life has gone through a " kaleidoscope of changing views " that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them . Until re @-@ assessment occurred during the second half of the twentieth century , his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant and in Britain he became " the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 George was born in London at Norfolk House . He was the grandson of King George II , and the eldest son of Frederick , Prince of Wales , and Augusta of Saxe @-@ Gotha . As Prince George was born two months premature and was thought unlikely to survive , he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker , who was both Rector of St James 's and the Bishop of Oxford . 
 One month later , he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House , again by Secker . His godparents were the King of Sweden ( for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy ) , his uncle the Duke of Saxe @-@ Gotha ( for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy ) and his great @-@ aunt the Queen of Prussia ( for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy ) . 
 George grew into a healthy but reserved and shy child . The family moved to Leicester Square , where George and his younger brother Prince Edward , Duke of York and Albany , were educated together by private tutors . Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German , as well as comment on political events of the time , by the age of eight . He was the first British monarch to study science systematically . Apart from chemistry and physics , his lessons included astronomy , mathematics , French , Latin , history , music , geography , commerce , agriculture and constitutional law , along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing , fencing , and riding . His religious education was wholly Anglican . At age 10 George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison 's play Cato and said in the new prologue : " What , tho ' a boy ! It may with truth be said , A boy in England born , in England bred " . Historian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear " to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated " . 
 George 's grandfather , King George II , disliked the Prince of Wales and took little interest in his grandchildren . However , in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury , and George became heir apparent to the throne . He inherited one of his father 's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh . Now more interested in his grandson , three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales ( the title is not automatically acquired ) . 
 In the spring of 1756 , as George approached his eighteenth birthday , the King offered him a grand establishment at St James 's Palace , but George refused the offer , guided by his mother and her confidant , Lord Bute , who would later serve as Prime Minister . George 's mother , now the Dowager Princess of Wales , preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 In 1759 , George was smitten with Lady Sarah Lennox , sister of the Duke of Richmond , but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage . " I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation , " he wrote , " and consequently must often act contrary to my passions . " Nevertheless , attempts by the King to marry George to Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick @-@ Wolfenbüttel were resisted by him and his mother ; Sophie married the Margrave of Bayreuth instead . 
 The following year , at the age of 22 , George succeeded to the throne when his grandfather , George II , died suddenly on 25 October 1760 , two weeks before his 77th birthday . The search for a suitable wife intensified . On 8 September 1761 in the Chapel Royal , St James 's Palace , the King married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg @-@ Strelitz , whom he met on their wedding day . A fortnight later , both were crowned at Westminster Abbey . George remarkably never took a mistress ( in contrast with his grandfather and his sons ) , and the couple enjoyed a genuinely happy marriage . They had 15 children — nine sons and six daughters . In 1762 , George purchased Buckingham House ( on the site now occupied by Buckingham Palace ) for use as a family retreat . His other residences were Kew and Windsor Castle . St James 's Palace was retained for official use . He did not travel extensively , and spent his entire life in southern England . In the 1790s , the King and his family took holidays at Weymouth , Dorset , which he thus popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England . 
 = = Early reign = = 
 George , in his accession speech to Parliament , proclaimed : " Born and educated in this country , I glory in the name of Britain " . He inserted this phrase into the speech , written by Lord Hardwicke , in order to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears , who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain . 
 Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties , the first years of his reign were marked by political instability , largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years ' War . George was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers , which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat . On his accession , the Crown lands produced relatively little income ; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties . George surrendered the Crown Estate to Parliamentary control in return for a civil list annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of civil government . Claims that he used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts are disputed by historians who say such claims " rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition " . Debts amounting to over £ 3 million over the course of George 's reign were paid by Parliament , and the civil list annuity was increased from time to time . He aided the Royal Academy of Arts with large grants from his private funds , and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity . Of his art collection , the two most notable purchases are Johannes Vermeer 's Lady at the <unk> and a set of <unk> , but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered . The King 's Library was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library . 
 In May 1762 , the incumbent Whig government of the Duke of Newcastle was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory Lord Bute . Bute 's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King 's mother , and by exploiting anti @-@ Scottish prejudices amongst the English . John Wilkes , a Member of Parliament , published The North Briton , which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government . Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment ; he was expelled from the House of Commons , and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and libel . In 1763 , after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war , Lord Bute resigned , allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power . 
 Later that year , the Royal Proclamation of 1763 placed a limit upon the westward expansion of the American colonies . The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north ( to Nova Scotia ) and to the south ( Florida ) . The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers , but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government . With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes , the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions . The central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval , for there were no American seats in Parliament . The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to " no taxation without representation " . In 1765 , Grenville introduced the Stamp Act , which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America . Since newspapers were printed on stamped paper , those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax . Meanwhile , the King had become exasperated at Grenville 's attempts to reduce the King 's prerogatives , and tried , unsuccessfully , to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister . After a brief illness , which may have presaged his illnesses to come , George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry , and dismissed Grenville . 
 Lord Rockingham , with the support of Pitt and the King , repealed Grenville 's unpopular Stamp Act , but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt , whom George created Earl of Chatham . The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in New York City . Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767 , and the Duke of Grafton took over the government , although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768 . That year , John Wilkes returned to England , stood as a candidate in the general election , and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency . Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament . Wilkes was re @-@ elected and expelled twice more , before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner @-@ up as the victor . Grafton 's government disintegrated in 1770 , allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power . 
 George was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer , but his piety was not shared by his brothers . George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals . In 1770 , his brother Prince Henry , Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn , was exposed as an adulterer , and the following year Cumberland married a young widow , Anne Horton . The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride : she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession . George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign . The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament , including among George 's own ministers , but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772 . Shortly afterward , another of George 's brothers , Prince William Henry , Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh , revealed he had been secretly married to Maria , Countess Waldegrave , the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole . The news confirmed George 's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law : Maria was related to his political opponents . Neither lady was ever received at court . 
 Lord North 's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America . To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn , except for the tea duty , which in George 's words was " one tax to keep up the right [ to levy taxes ] " . In 1773 , the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard , an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party . In Britain , opinion hardened against the colonists , with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was " certainly criminal " . With the clear support of Parliament , Lord North introduced measures , which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists : the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house . Up to this point , in the words of Professor Peter Thomas , George 's " hopes were centred on a political solution , and he always bowed to his cabinet 's opinions even when sceptical of their success . The detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution . " Though the Americans characterised George as a tyrant , in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers . 
 = = American War of Independence = = 
 The American Revolutionary War was the culmination of the civil and political American Revolution resulting from the American Enlightenment . Brought to a head over the lack of American representation in Parliament , which was seen as a denial of their rights as Englishmen and often popularly focused on direct taxes levied by Parliament on the colonies without their consent , the colonists resisted the imposition of direct rule after the Boston Tea Party . Creating self @-@ governing provinces , they circumvented the British ruling apparatus in each colony by 1774 . Armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775 . After petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament were ignored , the rebel leaders were declared traitors by the Crown and a year of fighting ensued . The colonies declared their independence in July 1776 , listing grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace . Among George 's other offences , the Declaration charged , " He has abdicated Government here ... He has plundered our seas , ravaged our Coasts , burnt our towns , and destroyed the lives of our people . " The gilded equestrian statue of George III in New York was pulled down . The British captured the city in 1776 , but lost Boston , and the grand strategic plan of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant @-@ General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga . 
 George III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America , despite the opinions of his own ministers . In the words of the Victorian author George Trevelyan , the King was determined " never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans , and to punish their <unk> by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal . " The King wanted to " keep the rebels harassed , anxious , and poor , until the day when , by a natural and inevitable process , discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse " . However , more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory , and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe . After Saratoga , both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war ; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal , they remained a small minority . With the setbacks in America , Prime Minister Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham , whom he thought more capable , but George refused to do so ; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North 's administration , but Chatham refused to cooperate . He died later in the same year . In early 1778 , France ( Britain 's chief rival ) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States and the conflict escalated . The United States and France were soon joined by Spain and the Dutch Republic , while Britain had no major allies of its own . Lord Gower and Lord Weymouth both resigned from the government . Lord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign , but he stayed in office at George III 's insistence . Opposition to the costly war was increasing , and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the Gordon Riots . 
 As late as the Siege of Charleston in 1780 , Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory , as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House . In late 1781 , the news of Lord Cornwallis 's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London ; Lord North 's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year . The King drafted an abdication notice , which was never delivered , finally accepted the defeat in North America , and authorised peace negotiations . The Treaties of Paris , by which Britain recognised the independence of the American states and returned Florida to Spain , were signed in 1782 and 1783 . When John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785 , George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies . He told Adams , " I was the last to consent to the separation ; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable , I have always said , as I say now , that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power . " 
 = = Constitutional struggle = = 
 With the collapse of Lord North 's ministry in 1782 , the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time , but died within months . The King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him . Charles James Fox , however , refused to serve under Shelburne , and demanded the appointment of the Duke of Portland . In 1783 , the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox – North Coalition . The Duke of Portland became Prime Minister , with Fox and Lord North , as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively . 
 The King disliked Fox intensely , for his politics as well as his character ; he thought Fox was unprincipled and a bad influence on the Prince of Wales . George III was distressed at having to appoint ministers not of his liking , but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons , and could not be displaced easily . He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill , which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the East India Company to Parliamentary commissioners . Although the King actually favoured greater control over the Company , the proposed commissioners were all political allies of Fox . Immediately after the House of Commons passed it , George authorised Lord Temple to inform the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy . The bill was rejected by the Lords ; three days later , the Portland ministry was dismissed , and William Pitt the Younger was appointed Prime Minister , with Temple as his Secretary of State . On 17 December 1783 , Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a " high crime " and Temple was forced to resign . Temple 's departure destabilised the government , and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved ; the subsequent election gave Pitt a firm mandate . 
 = = William Pitt = = 
 For George III , Pitt 's appointment was a great victory . It proved that he was able to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons . Throughout Pitt 's ministry , George supported many of Pitt 's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt 's supporters in the House of Lords . During and after Pitt 's ministry , George III was extremely popular in Britain . The British people admired him for his piety , and for remaining faithful to his wife . He was fond of his children , and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively . Nevertheless , he set his children a strict regimen . They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning , and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue . When his children strayed from George 's own principles of righteousness , as his sons did as young adults , he was dismayed and disappointed . 
 By this time George 's health was deteriorating . He had a mental illness , which was possibly a symptom of the genetic disease porphyria , although this has been questioned . A study of samples of the King 's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic , a possible trigger for the disease . The source of the arsenic is not known , but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics . The King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765 , but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788 . At the end of the parliamentary session , he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate . It was the furthest he had ever been from London — just short of 100 miles ( 150 km ) — but his condition worsened . In November he became seriously deranged , sometimes speaking for many hours without pause , causing him to foam at the mouth and making his voice hoarse . With his doctors largely at a loss to explain his illness , spurious stories about his condition spread , such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia . Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards , and the King 's doctors , who included Francis Willis , treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm , or applying caustic poultices to draw out " evil humours " . 
 In the reconvened Parliament , Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of a regency during the King 's incapacity . While both agreed that it would be most reasonable for George III 's eldest son and heir apparent , the Prince of Wales , to act as regent , to Pitt ’ s consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales 's absolute right to act on his ill father 's behalf with full powers . Pitt , fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered , argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent , and wanted to restrict the regent 's authority . In February 1789 , the Regency Bill , authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent , was introduced and passed in the House of Commons , but before the House of Lords could pass the bill , George III recovered .

 After George ’ s recovery , his popularity , and that of Pitt , continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales . His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants , Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790 , contributed to his popularity . James Hadfield 's failed attempt to shoot the King in the Drury Lane Theatre on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister <unk> . George seemed unperturbed by the incident , so much so that he fell asleep in the interval . 
 The French Revolution of 1789 , in which the French monarchy had been overthrown , worried many British landowners . France declared war on Great Britain in 1793 ; in the war attempt , George allowed Pitt to increase taxes , raise armies , and suspend the right of habeas corpus . The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France , which included Austria , Prussia , and Spain , broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France . The Second Coalition , which included Austria , Russia , and the Ottoman Empire , was defeated in 1800 . Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte , the First Consul of the French Republic . 
 A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland , where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798 . In 1800 , the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state , known as the " United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland " . George used the opportunity to drop the title " king of France " , which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III . It was suggested that George adopt the title " Emperor of the British Isles " , but he refused . As part of his Irish policy , Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics . George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath , in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism . Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public , Pitt threatened to resign . At about the same time , the King had a relapse of his previous illness , which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question . On 14 March 1801 , Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons , Henry Addington . Addington opposed emancipation , instituted annual accounts , abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament . In October 1801 , he made peace with the French , and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens . 
 George did not consider the peace with France as real ; in his view it was an " experiment " . In 1803 , the war resumed but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war , and instead favoured Pitt . An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent , and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French . George 's review of 27 @,@ 000 volunteers in Hyde Park , London , on 26 and 28 October 1803 and at the height of the invasion scare , attracted an estimated 500 @,@ 000 spectators on each day . The Times said , " The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression . " A courtier wrote on 13 November that , " The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack , his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour 's warning " . George wrote to his friend Bishop Hurd , " We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion ... Should his troops effect a landing , I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine , and my other armed subjects , to repel them . " After Admiral Lord Nelson 's famous naval victory at the Battle of Trafalgar , the possibility of invasion was extinguished . 
 In 1804 , George 's recurrent illness returned ; after his recovery , Addington resigned and Pitt regained power . Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry , but George III refused . Lord Grenville perceived an injustice to Fox , and refused to join the new ministry . Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria , Russia , and Sweden . This Third Coalition , however , met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions , collapsing in 1805 . The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt 's health and he died in 1806 , reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry . Lord Grenville became Prime Minister , and his " Ministry of All the Talents " included Fox . The King was conciliatory towards Fox , after being forced to capitulate over his appointment . After Fox 's death in September 1806 , the King and ministry were in open conflict . To boost recruitment , the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces . George instructed them not only to drop the measure , but also to agree never to set up such a measure again . The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending , but refused to bind themselves in the future . They were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland as the nominal Prime Minister , with actual power being held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Spencer Perceval . Parliament was dissolved , and the subsequent election gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons . George III made no further major political decisions during his reign ; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little actual significance . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In late 1810 , at the height of his popularity but already virtually blind with cataracts and in pain from rheumatism , George III became dangerously ill . In his view the malady had been triggered by stress over the death of his youngest and favourite daughter , Princess Amelia . The Princess 's nurse reported that " the scenes of distress and crying every day ... were melancholy beyond description . " He accepted the need for the Regency Act of 1811 , and the Prince of Wales acted as Regent for the remainder of George III 's life . Despite signs of a recovery in May 1811 , by the end of the year George had become permanently insane and lived in seclusion at Windsor Castle until his death . 
 Prime Minister Spencer Perceval was assassinated in 1812 and was replaced by Lord Liverpool . Liverpool oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars . The subsequent Congress of Vienna led to significant territorial gains for Hanover , which was upgraded from an electorate to a kingdom . 
 Meanwhile , George 's health deteriorated . He developed dementia , and became completely blind and increasingly deaf . He was incapable of knowing or understanding either that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814 , or that his wife died in 1818 . At Christmas 1819 , he spoke nonsense for 58 hours , and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk . He died at Windsor Castle at 8 : 38 pm on 29 January 1820 , six days after the death of his fourth son , the Duke of Kent . His favourite son , Frederick , Duke of York , was with him . George III was buried on 16 February in St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle . 
 George was succeeded by two of his sons George IV and William IV , who both died without surviving legitimate children , leaving the throne to the only legitimate child of the Duke of Kent , Victoria , the last monarch of the House of Hanover . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 George III lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days : both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors . Only Victoria and Elizabeth II have since lived and reigned longer . 
 George III was dubbed " Farmer George " by satirists , at first to mock his interest in mundane matters rather than politics , but later to contrast his homely thrift with his son 's grandiosity and to portray him as a man of the people . Under George III , the British Agricultural Revolution reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry . There was unprecedented growth in the rural population , which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent Industrial Revolution . George 's collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now housed in the Science Museum , London ; he funded the construction and maintenance of William Herschel 's 40 @-@ foot telescope , which was the biggest ever built at the time . Herschel discovered the planet Uranus , which he at first named Georgium Sidus ( George 's Star ) after the King , in 1781 . 
 George III hoped that " the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires , nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve " , but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised . While very popular at the start of his reign , by the mid @-@ 1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists , though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal . The grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as " repeated injuries and usurpations " that he had committed to establish an " absolute Tyranny " over the colonies . The Declaration 's wording has contributed to the American public 's perception of George as a tyrant . Contemporary accounts of George III 's life fall into two camps : one demonstrating " attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign , when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power " , while the other " derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign , and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition " . 
 Building on the latter of these two assessments , British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , such as Trevelyan and Erskine May , promoted hostile interpretations of George III 's life . However , in the mid @-@ twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier , who thought George was " much maligned " , kick @-@ started a re @-@ evaluation of the man and his reign . Scholars of the later twentieth century , such as Butterfield and Pares , and <unk> and Hunter , are inclined to treat George sympathetically , seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness . Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain : " Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance . His capacity for synthesis , and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence ... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors ... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which , granted his original aberrations , was calculated to project the lines of his error , carrying his work still further from centrality or truth . " In pursuing war with the American colonists , George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes , rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives . In the opinion of modern scholars , during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power , and grew as the embodiment of national morality .

 In Great Britain , George III used the official style " George the Third , by the Grace of God , King of Great Britain , France , and Ireland , Defender of the Faith , and so forth " . In 1801 , when Great Britain united with Ireland , he dropped the title of king of France , which had been used for every English monarch since Edward III 's claim to the French throne in the medieval period .

 In Germany , he was " Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg , Archtreasurer and Prince @-@ elector of the Holy Roman Empire " until the end of the empire in 1806 . He then continued as duke until the Congress of Vienna declared him " King of Hanover " in 1814 .

 " Easy " is a pop and electro song that lasts three minutes and 36 seconds . A journalist from MTV UK described it as " a saucy slice of electro with a ravey chorus and naughty lyrics " . It was composed in the key of F major using common time at 118 beats per minute . " Easy " features heavy use of synthesizers — most notably a bass synthesizer , as well as a " grinding electro riff " . According to Fraser McAlphine of BBC , the chorus is reminiscent of songs performed by British girl group , Girls Aloud . Ian Mathers from Stylus Magazine described the first half of the chorus as a " Hellogoodbye / Van She style 80s dancefloor euphoria " . The song 's lyrical content is metaphorical and features sexual euphemisms . 
 Buchanan described the song during an interview that was published on the group 's official website , saying : " Easy is a very naughty and cheeky song – it ’ s the most sexy song we ’ ve ever done . It came about when Orson had an idea for a song . They played it to us – it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love . " She elaborated in a separate interview : " When we started working with the guys from Orson the sound just blew us away – it 's completely fresh sounding but at the same time has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career , so it 's perfect for this album !

 = = Early life = = 
 Joel Selwood was born to Bryce and Maree Selwood in the country town of Bendigo , Victoria . He was raised in a family of sportspeople . His mother Maree was a top runner and tennis player , and elder twins Adam and Troy were identified as talented footballers at a young age . As a two @-@ year @-@ old , Selwood was forced to wear splints on his leg to help overcome a walking disability . 
 Selwood displayed athletic talent from an early age . He was the state hurdling champion from under @-@ 10s through to the under @-@ 15s , and in one year held every running and jumping record at the Bendigo Sports Centre , except the 100 metres sprint . Growing up with his older brothers , Selwood was accustomed to playing with bigger teammates and opponents . By the time he was eight years old , he had played his first competitive game of football , against children four years his senior , and had kicked three goals . 
 Selwood attended Catholic College Bendigo and played junior football with the Sandhurst Football Club , until he was chosen to play for the Bendigo Pioneers in the TAC Cup competition throughout 2005 . 
 Although his age made him ineligible to enter the 2005 AFL Draft , Selwood 's accomplishments during the year led to AFL Talent Manager Kevin Sheehan rating him " the best 17 @-@ year @-@ old in Australia " . Bendigo Pioneers regional manager Ray Byrne noted that " ability @-@ wise , Joel was streets ahead of everyone . Even at an early age , he was a standout " . Byrne praised Selwood 's professionalism , noting that he had " never seen a kid prepare in the TAC Cup like Joel ( Selwood ) . He had a fantastic football brain , he could sort it out within 10 minutes of a game who should be where and ( doing ) what " . Selwood received an array of accolades and honours as a bottom @-@ aged player , winning mid @-@ year State honours for Victoria Country in the AFL National Championships . His performances in the championships earned him end @-@ of @-@ year All @-@ Australian honours and the Most Valuable Player award for Victoria Country . In addition , he was named in the TAC Cup Team of the Year , awarded a scholarship within the prestigious AIS @-@ AFL Academy , and subsequently captained his older teammates in the annual under @-@ 18s International Rules Series in Ireland . His performances in Ireland earned him the Ron Barassi Medal , as the adjudicated Most Valuable Player of the tour . Selwood 's achievements in local football were recognised when he was listed as a finalist in the 2006 Bendigo Sports Star of the Year Award . 
 Returning in 2006 with the Pioneers , Selwood entered his final year of junior football as one of the top rated prospects in his age group . His achievements at the junior level were recognised early by the AFL Player 's Association , when he was awarded the Mike Fitzpatrick Scholarship , and the AFL Life Members Education Fund Award . Rewarded with the captaincy of Bendigo for his final season , Selwood again won mid @-@ year State honours for Victoria Country . However , a knee injury occurred only six rounds into the competition forcing him to undergo surgery — his fourth knee operation within two years — prematurely ending his season .

 Selwood was drafted by the Geelong Football Club with their first selection , and was the seventh overall draft pick in the 2006 AFL Draft . Although many recruiting scouts viewed him as " the finest pure footballer in the draft " , and a potential top pick , there was still concern surrounding the durability of his knee . Nonetheless , as the equal highest @-@ ever draft pick for the Cats , Selwood made his debut in the opening round of the 2007 AFL Season and missed only four games during the regular season . 
 Selwood 's transition to the AFL drew positive comments throughout the footballing community ; former Brisbane coach Leigh Matthews noted how " from [ his ] first game ... he looked like he had played 200 of them " . Geelong coach Mark Thompson labelled the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Selwood the best youngster to have come under his tutelage during his time at the club . Geelong captain Tom Harley observed that an 18 @-@ year @-@ old Selwood had " an air of confidence - not arrogance but assuredness " that he had never seen before at that age . From the beginning , Selwood showed an ability to influence games ; in just his fourth appearance he led his older and more experienced teammates with a game of 25 disposals and nine tackles . This achievement , described as inspiring , earned him an AFL Rising Star Award nomination . The Geelong coaching staff had a highlights package made of this performance , to screen to the rest of the team during the match review later that week . Selwood 's impact on the game as a first – year player prompted numerous comparisons to Chris Judd , who a few years earlier had been lauded for his first @-@ year success as an 18 @-@ year @-@ old . 
 At the conclusion of the home and away period , Selwood 's regular contributions resulted in several individual accolades . Polling 44 out of a possible 45 votes , he was awarded the inaugural Ron Evans Medal as the winner of the AFL Rising Star Award . Selwood earned the maximum five votes from eight of the nine judges , the other awarding him four out of five . This meant that eight of the nine judges rated him as the best nominee . Selwood was also awarded the prestigious AFLPA Best First Year Player Award , winning over 70 % of all votes from his peers . He became only the fourth player to win both the major awards for first – year players . 
 Having helped Geelong finish first on the ladder and win the McClelland Trophy , Selwood made his finals debut in the 2nd Qualifying Final against the Kangaroos ( now North Melbourne ) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) . In front of nearly 80 @,@ 000 spectators , Selwood amassed 22 disposals , five marks , five clearances , six inside 50s , five tackles , and five score assists , helping Geelong to a club finals record 106 point victory . Although Selwood struggled to contribute in the Preliminary Final against Collingwood two weeks later , he returned to form for the 2007 AFL Grand Final at the MCG against Port Adelaide . With 18 disposals , five marks , five clearances — the most of any Geelong player — seven inside 50s , four tackles , and an equal game @-@ high four score assists , Selwood helped the Cats to a record 119 point win . At 19 years of age , Selwood became the youngest person to play in a winning Grand Final team in 10 years . He was also the first to win the AFL Rising Star Award and play in a premiership side within the same season , making him one of the most accomplished first year players in league history . Selwood 's debut year achievements resulted in him becoming the highest @-@ paid first – year player in AFL history . 
 Selwood finished the season ranked first among all first – year players in several major statistical categories ; total possessions ( 405 ) , disposals per game ( 19 @.@ 3 ) , kicks ( 216 ) , handpasses ( 189 ) , marks ( 109 ) , tackles ( 94 ) — the most ever by any first – year AFL player — and tackles per game ( 4 @.@ 5 ) . His 23 score assists during the season also ranked him within the top ten in the league . Selwood added to his list of first year honours at season 's end with the Geelong Football Club Best First Year Player Award , along with a top 20 placing in the Club Champion award . He also received several media end of year sporting awards . 
 Selwood continued to establish himself as a key player in the Geelong midfield during the 2008 AFL season , helping the Cats achieve a record @-@ equalling 21 @-@ win season and secure the McClelland Trophy for the second successive year . Selwood also claimed the third – longest all @-@ time winning streak by an individual player in VFL / AFL history ; 25 successive wins before a mid @-@ season loss to Collingwood . His standout season was rewarded when he was selected to play for Victoria in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match All @-@ Star event . In gaining selection for the Victorian team , Selwood , at 19 years of age , became the youngest player to represent " The Big V " in more than 12 years . He was also selected for the preliminary 2008 All @-@ Australian squad , placed sixth for the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFLPA Most Valuable Player , and finished third in voting for the Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award . Selwood also polled 19 votes in the Brownlow Medal , awarded to the " best and fairest " player in the AFL , to place fifth overall , and second among his teammates . Selwood 's consistency and performances over his first two seasons was also recognised by the AFL Coaches Association , who awarded him the Best Young Player Award .

However , Selwood signed a new two – year deal with the club , citing " club success and future opportunities " as his reasons for accepting the reduced salary .

 During the round seventeen Grand Final rematch against Hawthorn , Selwood achieved career highs of 42 disposals , 10 marks , and 11 tackles . Geelong midfielder Cameron Ling described Selwood 's performance as : " Absolutely amazing ... He just single @-@ handedly lifted the whole group with his intensity around the ball . It 's surprising that he 's only in his third year . He 's something pretty special " . Selwood helped Geelong compile an 18 – 4 win @-@ loss record during the season to become the first team in league history to produce three consecutive home and away campaigns with 18 or more wins .

Selwood finished the game with 24 disposals — including a team – high 12 contested possessions and equal game – high 16 handpasses — 4 marks , 6 clearances , a team – high 10 first possessions , 3 tackles , and 1 goal to help the Cats record a 12 point win and secure their second premiership in three seasons .

 Despite the club 's lack of any silverware for the first time in four years , Selwood 's individual season was recognised and rewarded on various fronts .

 After serving for two years in the club 's leadership group , Selwood was promoted to the vice @-@ captaincy position for the 2011 AFL Season . During the round eight match against Collingwood , Selwood made his 100th appearance for the club . He became the fifth @-@ quickest player in VFL / AFL history to play 100 games , reaching the milestone four years and forty @-@ two days after making his debut . Selwood 's consistency was highlighted by his ability to play in 100 of a possible 106 games since entering the league .

He also became the fourth @-@ fastest player in VFL / AFL history to play 200 games after achieving the milestone in 8 years and 129 days .

His ability to " buckle his knees , ( get ) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler 's arm goes up above the neck " has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as " almost impossible to stop at times " and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received . It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood — Carlton ’ s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to " get in low " because " he ’ s such a master at lifting the elbows , which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there ’ s no doubt it ’ s a skill " . Selwood has declared the technique as a " benefit and an advantage I ’ m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right . It ’ s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength , I can dip at the knees slightly " . Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees , stating " all he ’ s doing is keeping his feet , dropping his legs and he ’ s got a fantastic <unk> in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn ’ t be penalised because he ’ s stronger than the tackler . If I was playing today and I could develop that technique , I ’ d be looking at it " . 
 Selwood 's leadership ability has consistently been praised , culminating in his appointment as club captain at the age of 23 and national team captain at the age of 26 .

Selwood has summarised his leadership style on the field as " getting into that emotional state where you 'd just do anything for your teammates " , and off the field as " caring for your teammates and making sure they 're OK and you 're making them better people " . He considers his predecessors at Geelong , Tom Harley and Cameron Ling , as his greatest role models for leadership . Melbourne captain Nathan Jones declared that Selwood 's leadership qualities were those he respected and strove to emulate as a fellow AFL captain . 
 Selwood has stated his career intention to " work really hard on the basics " . Despite his admitting to being " not the fastest player , or most skillful " , his hard running , tackling and one percent plays are important elements to his overall game .
