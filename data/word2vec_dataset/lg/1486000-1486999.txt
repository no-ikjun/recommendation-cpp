 Originating as a county road by 1911 , SR 538 was designated Secondary State Highway 1G ( SSH 1G ) in 1937 . SSH 1G ran from Primary State Highway 1 ( PSH 1 ) , co @-@ signed as U.S. Route 99 ( US 99 ) , to SSH 1A . During the 1964 highway renumbering , SR 538 was created to replace SSH 1G , PSH 1 and US 99 were replaced with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) and SR 9 replaced SSH 1A . I @-@ 5 was not built until after 1966 and the western terminus of SR 538 was still US 99 . Between early June and late July 2007 , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) constructed a roundabout at the SR 9 and Schopf Lane intersection , the first in Skagit County . The new roundabout reduced the length of SR 538 by 0 @.@ 05 @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 08 km ) . In early 2009 , between I @-@ 5 and 18th Street , WSDOT repaved the highway and expanded the Riverside Drive intersection . <unk> Pacific Holdings was awarded the contract for repaving the road on January 20 and construction began with the closure of the Riverside Drive intersection on 31 May . The closure , which was delayed from 3 May , lasted until June 4 . Actual repaving happened in late June of that year .

 The Staten Island Railway ( SIR ) is the only rapid transit line in the New York City borough of Staten Island . Legally called the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority ( <unk> ) , a unit of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , it is considered a standard railroad line , but only freight service which runs along the western portion of the North Shore Branch is connected to the national railway system . 
 SIR operates with modified R44 New York City Subway cars , and is run by the New York City Transit Authority , an agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and operator of the New York City Subway . However , there is no direct rail link between the SIR and the subway system proper . SIR riders do get a free transfer to New York City Subway lines , and the line is included on official New York City Subway maps . Commuters who use the railway typically use the Staten Island Ferry to reach Manhattan ; the line is accessible from within the Ferry Terminal and most of its trains connect with the ferry . 
 The Staten Island Railway provides full @-@ time local service between Saint George and Tottenville along the east side of the borough . There is currently no subway service offered for those residents living on the western or northern sides of the borough , but Staten Island light rail has been proposed for these corridors , though not endorsed by the MTA . The line has a route bullet similar to other subway routes : the letters SIR in a blue circle . It is used only on timetables and on the MTA 's site , not on trains . The line runs 24 hours a day every day of the year ( since May 10 , 2015 , the overnight service is on a 30 @-@ minute headway ) and is one of only six mass @-@ transit rail lines in the United States to do so ( the others being the PATCO Speedline , the Red and Blue Lines of the Chicago ' L ' , the Green Line of the Minneapolis @-@ St. Paul METRO , the PATH lines , and the New York City Subway ) . 
 On weekdays , express service to St. George is provided between 6 : 15 a.m. and 8 : 15 a.m. and to Tottenville from 7 : 01 a.m. to 8 : 01 a.m. and 4 : 01 p.m. to 7 : 51 p.m. Morning express trains run non @-@ stop between St. George and New Dorp ; afternoon express trains run non @-@ stop from St. George to Great Kills southbound only . Express service is noted on trains by the presence of a red marker with the terminal and ' express ' directly underneath it .

 The Staten Island Railway was incorporated on August 2 , 1851 , after Perth Amboy and Staten Island residents petitioned for a Tottenville @-@ to @-@ Stapleton rail line . The railroad was financed through a loan from Cornelius " Commodore " Vanderbilt , the sole Staten Island @-@ to @-@ Manhattan ferry operator on the east shore , which was his first involvement in a railroad . The line was completed to Tottenville on June 2 , 1860 . Many stations were named after nearby large farms , such as Garretson 's or Gifford 's . There were more elaborate structures put in place at <unk> and <unk> , as their namesakes , the <unk> and Anna <unk> , were influential in financing the construction of the Staten Island Railway . Under the leadership of Commodore Vanderbilt 's brother Jacob H. Vanderbilt , the Staten Island Rail Road took over several independent ferries , and train service was increased . The Staten Island Railway and ferry line were making a modest profit until the explosion of the ferry ship " Westfield " at Whitehall Street Terminal on July 30 , 1871 . By July 1872 , the railroad and the ferry were in receivership . On September 7 , 1872 , the property of the company was sold to George Law and Horace <unk> . 
 Erastus Wiman , dubbed the " Duke of Staten Island , " became one of the most prominent residents of Staten Island after locating his residence in a mansion on the island . Because the Staten Island Railroad Company was barely operational by the late 1870s , New York State sued to have the company dissolved in May 1880 . Wiman organized the Staten Island Rapid Transit Company ( SIRT ) on March 25 , 1880 , and partnered with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad to build a large rail terminal on the island and centralize the six @-@ to @-@ eight ferry landings . At one point , Wiman secured an extension on a land purchase option from George Law by naming the place " St. George " in order to flatter him . 
 Construction on the Vanderbilt 's Landing to Tompkinsville portion of the North Shore Branch began on March 17 , 1884 , and the line opened for passenger service on August 1 , 1884 . The lighthouse department just above Tompkinsville impeded the line 's extension to St. George , but after the SIRT lobbied for an Act of Congress , construction of a two @-@ tracked , 580 @-@ foot ( 180 m ) tunnel under the lighthouse began in 1885 , for about $ 190 @,@ 000 . The SIR was leased to the B & O for 99 years in 1885 . The proceeds of the sale were used to complete the terminal facilities at Saint George , pay for two miles of waterfront property , complete the Rapid Transit Railroad , build a bridge over the Kill Van Kull at <unk> , and build other terminal facilities . The North Shore Branch opened for service on February 23 , 1886 , up to Elm Park . The Saint George Terminal opened on March 7 , 1886 , and all SIR lines were extended to this station . On March 8 , 1886 , the South Beach Branch opened for passenger service to Arrochar . The remainder of the North Shore Branch to its terminus at <unk> was opened in the summer of 1886 . The new lines opened by the B & O railroad were called the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railway , while the original line from Clifton to Tottenville was called the Staten Island Railway . 
 Various proposals were made by the B & O for a railroad between Staten Island and New Jersey . The accepted proposal consisted of a five and one quarter line from the Arthur Kill to meet the Jersey Central at Cranford , through Union County and the communities of Roselle Park and Linden . Construction on this road started in 1889 , and the line was finished in the latter part of that year . Congress passed a law on June 16 , 1886 authorizing the construction of a 500 @-@ foot ( 150 m ) swing bridge over the Arthur Kill , after three years of effort by Erastus Wiman . The start of construction was delayed for nine months by the need for approval of the Secretary of War , and another six months due to an injunction from the State of New Jersey . This required construction to continue through the brutal winter of 1888 because Congress had set a completion deadline of June 16 , 1888 , two years after signing the bill . The bridge was completed three days early on June 13 , 1888 , at 3 p.m. At the time of its opening , the Arthur Kill Bridge was the largest drawbridge ever constructed in the world . There were no fatalities in the construction of the bridge . On January 1 , 1890 , the first train operated from Saint George Terminal to Cranford Junction . Once the Arthur Kill Bridge was completed , pressure was brought upon the United States War Department by the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad to have the newly built bridge torn down and replaced with a bridge with a different design , claiming that it was an obstruction for the navigation of the large numbers of coal barges past Holland Hook on the Arthur Kill . They were however not successful in these efforts . 
 In 1889 , the South Beach Branch was extended from Arrochar to a new terminal at South Beach . In 1889 , the Southfield Beach Electric Railway , a non @-@ Staten Island Rapid Transit service was built for one mile from the SIRT 's South Beach to Midland Beach , which during this time was a popular resort , with hotels and a gambling casino . In 1897 , the terminal at Saint George , which served the railroad and the ferry to Manhattan , was completed . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Improvements were made to the SIRT after the Pennsylvania Railroad ( PRR ) took control of the B & O in 1900 . After PRR control , the B & O was profitable again and became a stronger railroad . On October 25 , 1905 , the city took ownership of the ferry and terminals , and ejected the B & O from Whitehall Street terminal . A new Saint George Terminal was then built by the city for $ 2 @,@ 318 @,@ 720 . 
 In anticipation of a tunnel under the Narrows to Brooklyn and a connection there with the New York subway system at the Bay Ridge – 95th Street station , the SIRT electrified its lines using third rail power distribution and cars similar to those of the Brooklyn – Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) . The first electric train was operated on the South Beach Branch between South Beach and Fort Wadsworth on May 30 , 1925 , and the other branches were electrified by November 1925 . The electrification brought no big increase in traffic , and the tunnel was never built . In the 1920s , a branch along the West Shore of Staten Island was built to haul materials to construct the Outerbridge Crossing . The branch was cut back to a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built . The Gulf Oil Corporation opened a dock and tank farm along the Arthur Kill in 1928 and in order to serve it , the Travis Branch was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island 's western shore to Gulfport . 
 On February 25 , 1937 , the Port Richmond – Tower Hill viaduct was completed , becoming the largest grade crossing elimination project in the United States . The viaduct was more than a mile long , and spanned eight grade crossings on the North Shore Branch of the SIRT . The opening of the viaduct marked the final part of a $ 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 grade crossing elimination project on Staten Island , which eliminated thirty @-@ four grade crossings on the north and south shores of Staten Island . Staten Island Borough President Joseph A. Palma proposed in 1936 to extend the Staten Island Rapid Transit to Manhattan across the Bayonne Bridge . The Port of New York Authority endorsed the same plan in 1937 , with a terminal at 51st Street in Manhattan near Rockefeller Center to serve the trains of Erie , West Shore , Lackawanna , Jersey Central , and trains from Staten Island . This original proposal would be brought back in 1950 , by Edward Corsi , a Republican candidate for mayor . 
 In the 1940s , freight and World War II traffic helped pay off some of the debt the SIRT had accumulated , and briefly made the SIRT profitable . During the second World War , all of the east coast military hospital trains were handled by the SIRT , with some trains stopping at Arlington on Staten Island to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital . The need to transport war material , POW trains , and troops , made the stretch of the Baltimore & New York Railway between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill extremely busy . The B & O also operated special trains for important officials such as Winston Churchill . On June 25 , 1946 , a fire wrecked the terminal at Saint George killing three people and causing damage worth $ 22 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . The fire destroyed the ferry terminal and the four slips used for Manhattan service , the terminal for Staten Island Rapid Transit trains . The replacement terminal would be opened in 1948 . 
 The number of passengers decreased from 12 @.@ 3 million passengers in 1947 to 4 @.@ 4 million in 1949 , due to passengers switching from SIRT to city @-@ operated buses due to a bus fare cut . On September 5 , 1948 , 237 of the previous 492 weekday trains were cut ; the express service would be reduced during rush hours , and all night trains after 1 : 29 A. M. would be cancelled . Thirty percent of the company 's personnel were laid off . On September 7 , 1948 , Borough President Hall of Richmond continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission hearing in Manhattan . Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to ferry boats and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads of passengers . Previously , they said , the trains pulled out with only one boatload of passengers . On September 13 , 1948 , the SIRT agreed to add four trains , and to extend the schedule of four others . On September 22 , 1948 , the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy , New Jersey ; the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries , Inc of Elizabeth , New Jersey on October 16 . 
 On June 8 , 1951 , a modern replacement terminal for Saint George opened , although portions of the terminal were phased into service at earlier dates . The SIRT discontinued passenger service on the North Shore Branch to Arlington and the South Beach Branch to Wentworth Avenue at midnight on March 31 , 1953 because of city @-@ operated bus competition ; the South Beach Branch was abandoned shortly thereafter , while the North Shore Branch continued to carry freight . By 1955 , the third rail on both of the lines were removed . On September 7 , 1954 , SIRT made an application to discontinue all passenger service on the Tottenville Branch on October 7 , 1954 . A large city subsidy allowed passenger service on the Tottenville Branch to continue . 
 In November 1957 , the Arthur Kill swing bridge was damaged by an Esso oil tanker , and was replaced by a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , single track , 558 foot vertical lift bridge in 1959 . The 2 @,@ 000 ton lift span was prefabricated , then floated into place . The new bridge was raised 135 feet and since the new bridge aided navigation on the Arthur Kill , the United States government assumed 90 percent of the $ 11 million cost of the project . Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25 , 1959 . In 1958 , the Travis Branch was extended to serve a new Consolidated Edison power plant in Travis , along Staten Island 's west shore , allowing long @-@ unit coal trains from West Virginia to serve the plant . The B & O continued to invest in its properties in New Jersey and Staten Island into the late 1950s . 
 The SIRT continued to lose money even as they rebuilt stations between Jefferson Avenue and New Dorp almost into the 1970s . Rail traffic via the Arthur Kill Bridge dropped dramatically with the closing of Bethlehem Steel in 1960 , and of U.S. Gypsum in 1972 . On July 1 , 1971 , operation of the Tottenville line was turned over to the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority , a division of the state 's Metropolitan Transportation Authority , and the line itself was purchased by the city of New York . As part of the agreement , freight along the line was to be continued to be handled by the B & O. On February 28 , 1973 , new R44 cars — the same as the newest cars then in use on the subway lines in the other boroughs — were put into service on the Staten Island Rapid Transit , replacing the PS Standard rolling stock that had been inherited from the B & O and had remained in continuous service since 1925 . 
 The B & O became part of the larger C & O system through a merger with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway . The freight operation on the island was renamed the Staten Island Railroad Corporation in 1971 . The B & O and C & O became isolated from their other properties in New Jersey and Staten Island , with the creation of Conrail on April 1 , 1976 , by merger of bankrupt lines in the northeast United States . As a result , their freight service was truncated to Philadelphia , however , for several years afterward , one B & O freight train a day ran to Cranford Junction , with B & O locomotives running through as well . By the year 1973 , the Jersey Central 's car float yard at Jersey Central was closed . Afterwards , the car float operation of the B & O was brought back to Staten Island at Saint George Yard . This car float operation was taken over by the New York Dock Railway in September 1979 , and was ended the following year . Only a few isolated industries on Staten Island were using rail service for freight , meaning that the yard at Saint George was essentially abandoned . The C & O system was forced to sell the Staten Island Railroad to the New York , Susquehanna & Western Railroad , which was owned by the Delaware Otsego Corporation in April 1985 , due to a lack of business . The Susquehanna then embargoed the track east of Elm Park on the North Shore Branch , ending rail freight traffic to Saint George . In 1990 , Procter & Gamble , the line 's largest customer closed , leading to a large drop in freight traffic . The last freight train over the bridge came in 1990 , and the operation ended on July 25 , 1991 , when the Arthur Kill bridge was taken out of service . Afterwards , the North Shore Branch and the Arthur Kill Bridge were taken over by CSX . The line as well as the bridge were purchased again in 1994 , this time by the New York City Economic Development Corporation ( NYCEDC ) , whose purchase was followed by a decade of false starts . 
 In 1994 , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority reinstituted the line 's original name ; the passenger portion of the line is called MTA Staten Island Railway .

 Only the north @-@ south Main Line is in passenger service . The terminal station at St. George provides a direct connection to the Staten Island Ferry . At St. George there are twelve tracks , only ten of which are presently used for service . At Tottenville , there is a three track yard , with two tracks on either side of a concrete station platform . 
 In general appearance , the current operating line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor line of the New York City Subway . Since the 1960s it has been grade separated from all roads , but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton , between the Grasmere and Old Town stations , and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville , the end of the line . It uses NYC Transit @-@ standard 600 V DC third rail power . Its equipment are R44 subway type cars specially modified with headlight dimmers , electric windshield <unk> , FRA <unk> cab signals and horns , and FRA regulation 223 required <unk> glazing , and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors , purchased at the same time and built in early 1973 , at the tail end of the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit ( the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company ) . Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at <unk> 's Clifton Shops . Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano @-@ Narrows Bridge to the subway 's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn . The right @-@ of @-@ way also includes elevated , embankment and open @-@ cut portions , and a tunnel near St. George . 
 The last passenger trains on both the North Shore Branch and the South Beach Branch ran on March 31 , 1953 . The right @-@ of @-@ way of the South Beach Branch was eventually de @-@ mapped and the tracks have been removed . On June 24 , 2001 , a small section of the easternmost portion of the North Shore Branch ( a few hundred feet ) was reopened to provide passenger service to the new Richmond County Bank Ballpark , home of the Staten Island Yankees minor @-@ league baseball team ; however , this service was discontinued on June 18 , 2010 . Plans to reopen the remainder of the North Shore Branch , to both freight and passenger service , are being studied , with one plan calling for the line to resume full operations between St. George and Arlington or Port Ivory , with even the possibility of through service between Arlington / Port Ivory and Tottenville , which the aforementioned Ballpark wye makes feasible . 
 Prior to 2007 , the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color position light signals , that dated back to when it was a B & O @-@ operated line . In 2007 , a $ 72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed . The system was replaced with an FRA @-@ compliant 100 Hz , track circuit based , Automatic Train Control ( ATC ) signal system . As part of the project , 40 R44 subway cars and 4 locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi @-@ directional movement . A new rail control center and back @-@ up control center was constructed as part of this contract . 
 Only the Dongan Hills , Saint George , Great Kills and Tottenville stations of the Staten Island Railway are currently in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 , with elevators and or ramps . However , the new nearly completed Arthur Kill Road station , which will replace the Atlantic and Nassau stations , will be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA , when it opens in November 2016 . With the opening of Arthur Kill , the Atlantic and Nassau stations will be demolished . There are Park and Ride facilities at the Prince 's Bay , Huguenot , <unk> , Great Kills , and Dongan Hills stations . Once the new Arthur Kill Road station opens , there will be Park and Ride facilities there as well . 
 Over the years there have been several proposals for connecting the SIR with the subway system ( including the incomplete Staten Island Tunnel and a possible line along the Verrazano @-@ Narrows Bridge ) , as it uses B Division @-@ sized cars and loading gauge , but various economic , political , and engineering difficulties have prevented this from happening . The Main Line used to provide freight for Nassau Smelting , the Staten Island Advance , and Pouch Terminal . 
 The current head of Staten Island Railway is Douglas Connett , who holds the position Vice President and Chief Officer since his appointment in June 2015 . The hourly employee workforce of around 200 employees is represented by United Transportation Union Local 1440 . 
 = = = Railroad Police = = = 
 Until June 2005 , the Staten Island Railway had a 25 @-@ officer armed Railroad Police force known as the " Staten Island Rapid Transit Police " . 
 On June 1 , 2005 , the Staten Island Rapid Transit Police Department was disbanded and the 25 Staten Island railroad Police Officers merged into the much larger Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police . The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police department was created in 1998 when the Long Island Rail Road Police and the Metro @-@ North Railroad Police Departments merged . In 2005 the MTA Police Department then opened their newest patrol district , Police District # 9 which began covering the Staten Island Railway . 
 = = = = Fares = = = = 
 The cash fare is $ 2 @.@ 75 , the same fare as on the New York City Subway and MTA Regional Bus Operations . Fares are paid on entry and exit only at St. George and Tompkinsville . Rides not originating or terminating at St. George or Tompkinsville are free . Prior to the 1997 introduction of " one @-@ fare zone " that came along with free transfers from the SIR to the subway system and MTA buses by using the MetroCard , fares were collected by the conductors on the trains for passengers boarding at stops other than St. George . In the past , passengers often avoided paying the fare by exiting at Tompkinsville , and taking a short walk to the St. George ferry terminal . Because of this , the MTA installed turnstiles at Tompkinsville , along with a new <unk> which opened on January 20 , 2010 . 
 Fare is payable by MetroCard . Since this card enables free transfers for a continuing ride on the subway and bus systems , for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR . Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus , SIR , and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry . Because of this , the SIR 's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0 @.@ 16 — that is , for every dollar of expense , 16 cents was recovered in fares , the lowest ratio of MTA agencies . The low farebox recovery ratio is part of the reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper is to simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line .

 During the early 2000s , plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were announced by the New York Port Authority . Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line , a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad . In order for all New England and southern freight to pass through the New York metropolitan area , a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island , and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville , New Jersey were planned . On December 15 , 2004 , a $ 72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was announced by the NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism . In June 2006 , the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed , and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies . 
 The Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was renovated in 2006 and began regular service on April 2 , 2007 , sixteen years after the bridge closed . As part of the project , a portion of the North Shore Branch was rehabilitated , the Arlington Yard was expanded , and 6 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 981 m ) of new track was laid along the Travis Branch to Fresh Kills . Soon after service restarted on the line , Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially commemorated the reactivation on April 17 , 2007 . Service was provided by CSX Transportation , Norfolk Southern Railway , and Conrail over the Travis Branch to haul waste from the Staten Island Transfer Station at Fresh Kills and ship container freight from the Howland Hook Marine Terminal and other industrial businesses . Along the remainder of the North Shore Branch , there are still tracks and rail overpasses in some places .

 A new , ADA compliant station named Arthur Kill , near the southern terminus of the present line , will open in April 2016 after numerous delays . The station is sited between , and will replace both the Atlantic and Nassau stations , which are in the poorest condition of all the stations on the line . The new station will be able to platform a four @-@ car train . MTA will also provide parking for 150 automobiles across the street . Ground was broken for the $ 15 @.@ 3 million station on October 18 , 2013 . The constructor is John P. <unk> , Inc . , which was awarded the contract on July 31 , 2013 . There is also discussion of rebuilding a Rosebank station , which would bridge the longest gap between two stations ( Grasmere and Clifton ) . A Rosebank station once existed on the now @-@ defunct South Beach Branch of the railway . 
 Elected officials on Staten Island , such as Diane Savino , have been demanding replacement of the Staten Island Railway 's aging R44 train cars . There is money allocated in the MTA 's 2015 @-@ 2019 capital program to replace the R44s with 75 new train cars from the R211 order . Until then , the R44s are undergoing another round of scheduled maintenance to extend their usefulness until at least 2023 .

 In an 2006 report , Staten Island Advance explored the restoration of passenger services on 5 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 2 km ) of the North Shore Branch between St. George Ferry Terminal and Arlington station . Completion of the study is necessary to qualify the project for the estimated $ 360 million it will require . A preliminary study found that ridership could hit 15 @,@ 000 daily . $ 4 million of federal funding was requested for a detailed feasibility study by senator Chuck Schumer from New York . 
 In 2012 , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority released an analysis of transportation solutions for the North Shore , which included proposals for the reintroduction of heavy rail , light rail , or bus rapid transit using the North Shore line 's right @-@ of @-@ way . Other options included transportation systems management which would improve existing bus service , and the possibility of future ferry and water taxi services . Bus rapid transit was the preferred for its cost and relative ease of implementation , which would require $ 352 million in capital investment . The analysis evaluated the alternatives according to their ability to " Improve Mobility " , " Preserve and Enhance the Environment , Natural Resources and Open Space " , and " <unk> Limited Financial Resources for the Greater Public Benefit " . Currently , the MTA is planning to utilize the old right @-@ of @-@ way for bus rapid transit .

 The North Shore Branch closed to passenger service at midnight on Tuesday , March 31 , 1953 . A small portion of the western end is used for freight service as part of the Howland Hook Marine Terminal <unk> system called ExpressRail , which opened in 2007 and connects to the Chemical Coast after crossing over the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge . A smaller eastern portion provided seasonal service to the passenger station for <unk> Ballpark , where the Staten Island Yankees play . This service operated from June 24 , 2001 to June 18 , 2010 . As of 2008 , restoration was being discussed along this mostly abandoned 6 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 8 km ) line as part of the Staten Island light rail plan . The North Shore Branch served Procter & Gamble , United States Gypsum , the Staten Island Ship Building , and a Car float at Saint George Yard . 
 = = = = South Beach Branch = = = = 
 The South Beach Branch opened on March 8 , 1886 to Arrochar , and was extended to South Beach in 1889 . The branch closed at midnight on Tuesday , March 31 , 1953 . It was abandoned and demolished except for three segments : a concrete embankment on Saint John 's Avenue , a trestle spanning Robin Road in Arrochar , and a filled @-@ in bridge which McClean Avenue crosses over . This 4 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 6 km ) line left the Main Line at 40 ° 37 ′ 08 ″ N 74 ° 04 ′ 18 ″ W , south of the Clifton station , and lay to the east of the Main Line . While the entire right of way has been redeveloped , most of the former right of way is still traceable on maps today . The Verrazano Narrows Bridge toll plaza sits on the former ROW . The South Beach Branch served Bachmann 's Brewery . 
 The Robin Road Trestle is the only remaining intact trestle along the former line . In the early 2000s developers purchased the property on either side of the trestle 's abutments , but the developers , the New York City Department of Transportation , and the New York City Transit Authority all claimed ownership of it . Consequently , townhouses have built up against both sides of it .

 The Mount Loretto Spur is an abandoned branch of the Staten Island Railway whose purpose was to serve the Mount Loretto Children 's Home . The spur diverged off of the Main Line south of Pleasant Plains . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad served the Mount Loretto non @-@ electrified branch until 1950 , which had some industry and a passenger station . The Mount Loretto branch track was removed in the 1960s and 1970s but some ties were visible until the 1980s . A coal dump trestle is all that remains , located behind the powerhouse .

 The Travis Branch is a branch of the Staten Island Railway in New York City , that operates from Arlington Yard to Fresh Kills , which is used for freight transportation along the West Shore , Staten Island . The branch was built in 1928 , in order to serve Gulf Oil along the Arthur Kill , and was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island 's western shore to Gulfport . In 1958 , the line was extended to Travis in order to serve the newly built Consolidated Edison power plant . In 2005 , the Travis Branch was being renovated and was extended from the old Consolidated Edison plant to the New York Sanitation dump at Fresh Kills . Regular service to the facility began in April 2007 . A proposed route alignment for light rail on the west shore of Staten Island would have the light rail go on the North Shore rail right @-@ of @-@ way to the Travis Branch of the line , and from there , onto the median of the West Shore Expressway . 
 = Maryland Route 5 = 
 Maryland Route 5 ( MD 5 ) is a 74 @.@ 34 @-@ mile ( 119 @.@ 64 km ) long state highway that runs north – south in the U.S. state of Maryland . The highway runs from Point Lookout in St. Mary 's County north to the Washington , D.C. border in Suitland , Prince George 's County . MD 5 begins as the two @-@ lane undivided Point Lookout Road which runs from Point Lookout , St. Mary 's County , to an intersection with MD 235 in the northern part of the county . Point Lookout Road passes through rural areas as well as the county seat of Leonardtown . After the MD 235 intersection , the route becomes the four @-@ lane divided Three Notch Road and continues into Charles County , where it becomes Leonardtown Road . Here , the route bypasses Hughesville and continues north toward the Waldorf area , which it bypasses to the east on Mattawoman Beantown Road . The route merges onto U.S. Route 301 ( US 301 , Crain Highway ) and enters Prince George 's County , splitting from US 301 at an interchange in Brandywine . From here , MD 5 continues north on Branch Avenue , running through suburban areas , before becoming a freeway as it passes Andrews Air Force Base and interchanges with Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) / I @-@ 495 ( Capital Beltway ) . Past the Capital Beltway , the route runs through suburban areas of Hillcrest Heights and Suitland before reaching the D.C. border , where Branch Avenue continues toward Pennsylvania Avenue . 
 MD 5 was designated in 1927 to run from Point Lookout to the Washington , D.C. border in Suitland . The route was realigned to follow Naylor Road to the Washington , D.C. line in 1939 , while MD 637 was designated along the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border . Between 1939 and 1949 , the route continued into Washington , D.C. as District of Columbia Route 5 ( DC 5 ) , which followed Naylor Road , Good Hope Road , 11th Street SE , and DC 4 ( Pennsylvania Avenue ) to US 1 and US 240 near the White House . MD 5 was realigned to head to the Washington , D.C. border along Branch Avenue in 1950 . During the course of the 1950s and 1960s , most of MD 5 between the MD 235 intersection and the Washington , D.C. border was widened into a divided highway . In 1993 , the route bypassed Leonardtown ; the original alignment was designated MD 5 Business ( MD 5 Bus . ) before it was decommissioned in 2012 . In 1997 , MD 5 was realigned to bypass Waldorf to the east along what had been designated as MD 205 in 1989 . The former alignment through Waldorf followed what is now MD 5 Bus. and US 301 . In Prince George 's County , multiple interchanges were built along MD 5 between MD 223 and the Capital Beltway in the 1990s and early 2000s . In 2007 , a four @-@ lane , divided bypass of Hughesville was completed , alleviating the traffic bottleneck within that town at the intersection of MD 231 . The former alignment through Hughesville became MD 5 Bus . The portion of MD 5 between US 301 and the Capital Beltway is slated to be upgraded to a full freeway , with an interchange at MD 373 ( Accokeek Road ) / Brandywine Road planned and the remainder still in the planning stages .

 In 1911 , the road between Leonardtown and Mechanicsville and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington , D.C. border was completed as a state highway while the sections between south of Beantown and the border between Charles and Prince George 's counties and between TB and Camp Springs were under contract . At this time , the road between Point Lookout and Leonardtown , Mechanicsville and Beantown , and the Charles @-@ Prince George 's county border and TB were proposed as state highways . By 1915 , the entire length of the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington , D.C. border was completed . This state highway was paved to the northwest of Leonardtown , between north of Morganza and Hughesville , between the Charles @-@ Prince George 's county border and north of TB , and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington , D.C. border while the remainder was an unpaved state road . 
 MD 5 was designated in 1927 to the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington , D.C. border , passing through Leonardtown , Hughesville , and Waldorf . MD 5 ran concurrent with MD 3 ( now US 301 ) between Waldorf and TB . In 1928 , the route was paved between north of TB and Camp Springs . By 1933 , MD 5 was paved between northwest of Leonardtown and north of Morganza and along the MD 3 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles @-@ Prince George 's county border . Also , the route was extended south along an unpaved road into Point Lookout State Park . In 1939 , MD 5 was rerouted to follow Naylor Road to the Washington , D.C. border while the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border was designated as MD 637 . DC 5 continued into Washington , D.C. along Naylor Road , Good Hope Road , and 11th Street SE to DC 4 ( Pennsylvania Avenue SE ) . By this time , the section of route between Hughesville and Waldorf was paved while the section between Point Lookout and Leonardtown was a bituminous road . By 1946 , MD 5 was paved between Great Mills and Leonardtown . Also , DC 5 was extended to follow DC 4 along Pennsylvania Avenue to US 1 and US 240 at the east side of the White House . In 1949 , the DC 5 designation was decommissioned . 
 In 1950 , MD 5 was rerouted to follow Branch Avenue to the Washington , D.C. border , replacing MD 637 ; MD 637 was designated onto Naylor Road between MD 5 and the Washington , D.C. border by 1966 . In addition , the route was widened into a divided highway along the US 301 concurrency between the Charles @-@ Prince George 's county border and TB and along Branch Avenue between south of the Henson Creek and the Washington , D.C. border . MD 5 was upgraded from a bituminous to a paved road between St. Mary 's City and Great Mills in 1953 . The same year , the portion of route along the US 301 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles @-@ Prince George 's county border was widened into a divided highway . MD 5 was relocated to a new alignment to the east between TB and north of Camp Springs in 1956 , with a northward extension of MD 381 designated onto the former alignment . This section of MD 381 , called Brandywine Road and Old Branch Avenue , was transferred to county maintenance in 1965 . In 1959 , MD 5 was paved between south of St. <unk> and St. Mary 's City . A year later , the remainder of the route south to Point Lookout was paved . In 1962 , MD 5 was widened into a divided highway between south of Newmarket and the St. Mary 's @-@ Charles county border and between MD 223 in Clinton and Camp Springs . An interchange was built at the northern terminus of the US 301 concurrency in 1963 . The route was upgraded to a divided highway in the Beantown area in 1964 . In 1965 , MD 5 was improved to a divided highway between MD 235 and south of Newmarket . The divided highway was extended south from Beantown to the MD 488 intersection in 1966 . In 1967 , the route was widened into a divided highway between the St. Mary 's @-@ Charles county border and MD 488 with the exception of the portion through Hughesville . MD 5 was upgraded to a divided highway between US 301 and MD 223 in 1969 . An interchange was constructed at MD 414 in 1970 . 
 MD 5 was routed to bypass Leonardtown by 1993 , with the former route becoming MD 5 Bus . During the 1990s and early 2000s , multiple interchanges were constructed along MD 5 in Prince George 's County . In 1992 , an interchange was built at MD 223 . The interchange with MD 337 was built in 1996 . In 1999 , an interchange was constructed at Coventry Way . In 2001 , an interchange was constructed with Manchester Drive and Linda Lane in Camp Springs . 
 What is now MD 5 between Leonardtown Road and Poplar Hill Road was constructed as a gravel road by 1927 . This road was designated part of MD 233 . In 1956 , MD 382 was extended west into Charles County along part of what had been MD 233 to MD 5 at Beantown . MD 382 was removed from Charles County in 1989 . That same year , MD 205 was assigned to the westernmost portion of Poplar Hill Road in Beantown and north along two @-@ lane Mattawoman – Beantown Road to US 301 and MD 5 at Mattawoman . The route was expanded to a four @-@ lane divided highway and was taken over as MD 5 's bypass of Waldorf in 1997 . The portion of MD 5 from what had been MD 205 's southern terminus west to US 301 became MD 5 Bus . 
 In February 2007 , a $ 56 million limited @-@ access bypass around Hughesville was completed , redirecting MD 5 to the east of the community . The bypass was built due to the heavy amount of congestion at the old intersection of MD 5 and MD 231 in Hughesville 's central business district . Groundbreaking for construction of the bypass took place on November 5 , 2004 , with $ 10 million in federal funds given to the project . The old portion of MD 5 that went through Hughesville received the official MD 625 designation in 2006 , even though it is signed as MD 5 Bus . The bypass was formally opened on August 8 , 2007 .

 There are plans to improve MD 5 in Prince George 's County due to traffic congestion along the route . An interchange is planned to be built with MD 373 and Brandywine Road in Brandywine that would widen the route to six lanes in the vicinity of the proposed interchange . Construction of Phase 1 , which widened MD 5 to 6 lanes in the vicinity of the future interchange , began in November 2009 and was completed in August 2011 . Phase 2 , which will build the interchange itself , went through the design phase , with construction bids expected in summer 2015 . In addition , the route is planned to be upgraded to a full freeway between US 301 and the Capital Beltway , with new interchanges at Burch Hill Road / Earnshaw Drive and Surratts Road . This project is currently in the planning stages with many alternatives including upgrading only portions to freeway , adding reversible lanes or high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes , and various interchange designs .

 = Stainforth and Keadby Canal = 
 The Stainforth and Keadby Canal is a navigable canal in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire , England . It connects the River Don Navigation at Bramwith to the River Trent at Keadby , by way of Stainforth , Thorne and Ealand , near Crowle . It opened in 1802 , passed into the control of the River Don Navigation in 1849 , and within a year was controlled by the first of several railway companies . It became part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation , an attempt to remove several canals from railway control , in 1895 . There were plans to upgrade it to take larger barges and to improve the port facilities at Keadby , but the completion of the New Junction Canal in 1905 made this unnecessary , as Goole could easily be reached and was already a thriving port . 
 The canal was a centre for boatbuilding between 1858 , when Richard Dunston moved his yard to Thorne from Torksey , and 1984 when the yard closed . Dunston 's company were pioneers in the use of welded construction and innovative tug propulsion systems . The operation was always restricted by the size of Keadby Lock , although vessels longer than the lock could pass through when the river was level with the canal and both sets of gates could be opened . The largest ship to be built required Dunston 's to build a dam across the canal , as the canal company feared that it might get stuck in the lock , resulting in flooding and draining of the canal . 
 The canal passes through a region which is largely rural , much of which is drained artificially . For most of its length , it is flanked by the North Soak Drain and the South Soak Drain , because it disrupted the established drainage scheme . Thorne Moors lie to the north and Hatfield Chase lies to the south . Until its demise in 1966 , the canal was crossed by the Axholme Joint Railway at Ealand . The swing bridge was retained for several years after closure , so that stators from the nearby Keadby Power Station could be taken away for repairs , as there were no road bridges which could support the weight . 
 = = History = = 
 The River Don , which flows through Sheffield and Doncaster , had originally split into two channels below Stainforth , one of which emptied into the River Trent near Adlingfleet , close to its junction with the River Ouse , while the other headed north to join the River Aire near Rawcliffe . Following the work of the Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden to drain Hatfield Chase , the Adlingfleet outlet was closed off , and the channel to the River Aire , passing through Newbridge , was improved to take all of the flow . The scheme was not entirely successful , and after severe flooding near Sykehouse , Fishlake and Snaith , accompanied by riots , a new channel was cut between Newbridge and the River Ouse near what became Goole . The old course of the Don gradually silted up . Navigation on the Don was improved by the construction of cuts and locks , with the lowest lock situated at Stainforth . From there to the Ouse , boats used the Dutch River , Vermuyden 's artificial drain , which was hazardous due to its fast flows , its tides and its shallowness at times . 
 The idea of reconnecting the Don to the Trent was first raised in 1763 , when James Brindley assisted the manager of the River Don Navigation to survey a route for a canal to do this . In 1772 a second survey was made , this time by John Thompson , the Don Navigation 's engineer , for a canal from Stainforth to Althorpe , some 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) above Keadby on the River Trent . An agreement to build the canal , which would have had three locks and cost £ 14 @,@ 614 , was reached , but no further action occurred . The plan was revived in 1792 , by which time the cost had risen to £ 24 @,@ 200 , and an Act of Parliament to authorise the work was obtained in 1793 . This allowed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal Navigation Company to raise £ 24 @,@ 200 by issuing shares , and a further £ 12 @,@ 000 if necessary . Work began at the Keadby end in late 1793 . A second Act , obtained in 1798 , allowed the company to raise an additional £ 20 @,@ 000 from shareholders , instead of the original £ 12 @,@ 000 , and to raise £ 10 @,@ 000 by mortgage . The canal opened without ceremony in early 1802 . 
 The canal had a lock at Thorne and another where it joined the River Trent at Keadby . This lock had four sets of gates , so that it could be used whether the level of the river was higher or lower than that of the canal . It could take keels up to 81 by 22 @.@ 5 feet ( 24 @.@ 7 by 6 @.@ 9 m ) , which could carry up to 200 tons . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 In 1828 , there was a proposal to build a canal from West <unk> on the River Trent to the River Don at Doncaster , which would have bypassed the Stainforth and Keadby . There was also a plan for a lower Don bypass , to connect direct to the Goole Canal , avoiding the difficult Dutch River . Neither scheme progressed any further , but the Keadby end of the canal was improved , and a new deep water jetty was constructed on the Trent in 1833 . Traffic improved , with boats using the canal as an easier way to reach the Don than the Dutch River . The Don Navigation Company then proposed a new canal from Stainforth to the River Ouse at Swinefleet in 1836 . They needed to buy 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of the Stainforth and Keadby from the Don towards Stainforth , and started to negotiate , while applying for an Act of Parliament . The Stainforth and Keadby opposed the bill , and an agreement was reached in May 1836 that the Don would buy the whole canal for £ 48 @,@ 000 . A bill to authorise the sale was opposed by some of the Stainforth and Keadby shareholders and was rejected by the House of Lords . After several more abortive plans at amalgamation , where the Stainforth and Keadby pulled out at the last minute , agreement was finally reached , and the Don Navigation took control of the canal on 1 January 1849 . A year later , it became part of the South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company , after the Don Navigation and the Doncaster and Goole Railway companies merged . 
 Under an Act of Parliament of 1874 , the South Yorkshire company was absorbed into the Manchester , Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway . Despite the railway competition , traffic levels remained healthy , with the waterways carrying a total of 982 @,@ 000 tons in 1878 , but there was a growing dissatisfaction with the situation , particularly the high tolls compared to the railways , and the refusal to allow steam haulage , which had been in use on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation for over 50 years . In an attempt to improve the situation , the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Ltd was formed in 1888 , with the intention of buying back the canals from the railway company , and upgrading them to offer effective competition to the railways . As a result of their efforts , the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Co was created by an Act of Parliament dated 26 August 1889 , with powers to raise £ 1 @.@ 5 million to purchase and improve four canals . These were the Sheffield Canal , the River Don Navigation , the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal . The intention was to upgrade the Don and the Stainforth and Keadby to take 300 or 400 ton barges , to investigate the use of compartment boats , and to build a new port facility at Keadby , where coal could be trans @-@ shipped to seagoing vessels . Negotiations with the railway company were long and bitter , and the Navigation company only managed to raise £ 625 @,@ 000 of the £ 1 @.@ 14 million purchase price , with the result that although ownership of the waterways was transferred to them , the railway company still nominated five of the ten directors , and thus retained significant control . 
 During the protracted negotiations , the company had also been talking to the Aire and Calder about compartment boats , which resulted in a proposal to jointly fund and build a canal from Bramwith to the Aire and Calder . The 5 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) New Junction Canal was authorised in 1891 , and finally opened in 1905 . This removed the need to build a new port at Keadby , and the planned upgrade to take larger vessels was also shelved , because the company were unable to raise significant working capital . Despite the lack of investment and the difficulties of the First World War , the waterways were still quite busy , with traffic recovering from 381 @,@ 727 tons in 1926 , the year of the general strike , to over 800 @,@ 000 tons in 1937 . Bramwith lock , the first on the Stainforth and Keadby , was lengthened in 1932 , and a new colliery <unk> was constructed to enable compartment boats to reach Hatfield Main Colliery . Stainforth lock , which connected the canal to the River Don , was closed in 1939 . The winter of 1947 was particularly severe , and the Stainforth and Keadby was closed for a period due to ice . After the Second World War , the canals of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation were nationalised on 1 January 1948 , together with most other operational canals in Britain . 
 They were initially managed by the British Transport Commission , but control passed to British Waterways with the passing of the Transport Act 1962 , which also disbanded the Transport Commission . The Transport Acts of 1968 and 1983 divided British canals into Commercial waterways , which were still carrying commercial traffic , cruising waterways , which had potential for leisure use , and remainder waterways , for which no economic use could be seen at the time . The Stainforth and Keadby was designated as a commercial waterway , and traffic was restricted to working boats carrying freight . With the steady demise of freight traffic , British Waterways encouraged the use of the canals for leisure cruising , walking and fishing , and later recognised their environmental value . Following the cessation of coal carrying from Hatfield Main colliery , and the closure of Dunston 's boatyard at Thorne , all use of the canal is now by leisure boaters . A further change of ownership took place in 2012 with the creation of the Canal & River Trust , which took over all of the assets of British Waterways . 
 = = Boatbuilding = = 
 Large numbers of boats were built beside the Stainforth and Keadby Canal . Richard Dunston set up a boatyard at Thorne , on the north bank just below the lock , in 1858 , after selling his previous boatyard at Torksey . He initially constructed clinker @-@ built sailing barges , capable of carrying up to 80 tons . The boatyard was fairly self @-@ contained , using timber which was grown locally and was sawn by hand at the yard . It included a ropewalk , which made ropes for many industries in the locality , as well as for rigging of the boats , and supplied sails , masts and chandlery to much of the Humber region . Gradually , carvel @-@ built barges with their smoother hulls replaced clinker @-@ built ones , and boat sizes became more standard , with Sheffield @-@ sized keels and larger sloops . Shortly after Richard 's grandson took over the yard in 1910 , it was remodelled to build iron and steel ships , and only one wooden boat was built subsequently . 
 One of the issues with the yard was that the size of boats that could be built was restricted by the locks at either side of the site . Sheffield @-@ sized boats were around 61 @.@ 5 by 15 @.@ 5 feet ( 18 @.@ 7 by 4 @.@ 7 m ) , and could leave the yard either by passing through Thorne Lock and on to the Don Navigation , or by travelling to Keadby and entering the Trent . <unk> were restricted to the Keadby route , because of their larger size , and the largest boats built at Thorne before the 1940s were 700 @-@ brake @-@ horsepower ( 520 kW ) tugs , 300 @-@ ton coasters and 300 @-@ ton lighters . From 1933 , the yard began experimenting with welded rather than riveted construction , and their first all @-@ welded steam tugs were constructed for the Admiralty in 1942 . They continued to lead the field with developments in tug propulsion in the 1960s , and by the last 1970s had build seventeen tugs with Kort nozzle or Kort rudder steering and twenty tugs with Voith @-@ Schneider propulsion systems at Thorne . With the yard at Hessle on the Humber , bought from Henry Scarr in 1932 , they were one of the largest un @-@ nationalised shipbuilders in Britain . 
 The Empire Laird , a self @-@ trimming diesel collier measuring 140 by 21 @.@ 5 feet ( 42 @.@ 7 by 6 @.@ 6 m ) with a draught of 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) , was one of the largest vessels ever constructed at Thorne . It was built for the Admiralty in 1943 for use in the Bristol area , delivering coal to power stations . It was fitted with a 275 bhp ( 205 kW ) Crossley engine and a single propeller . Keadby Lock is much shorter than the ship , and so it had to sail through when the river made a level with the canal , and both sets of gates could be opened at the same time . However , the canal company were worried that because of its width , it might jam in the lock , which would cause flooding of the hinterland at high tide , and draining of the canal at low tide . Dunston 's had to build a dam across the canal beyond the lock , to prevent both consequences . Once built , the ship successfully passed through the lock , and the dam was removed . During the Second World War , Dunston 's designed and built TID ( Tugs in Dock ) tugs . They were constructed from eight pre @-@ fabricated sections , manufactured by companies who were not normally involved in shipbuilding . The sections weighted less than 6 tons , with a maximum size of 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) by 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) by 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) , and were delivered by lorry to the yard . There they were joined together by welders , many of whom were women , and fitted with steam engines . The first TID tug was completed in February 1943 , and for more than a year , one left the yard every five days . 
 In the early 1980s , there were still 80 workers involved in construction work at Thorne , and 15 other staff . A total of 1 @,@ 358 vessels were built there between 1932 and the end of shipbuilding in 1984 . The yard closed completely in 1987 , and had been cleared by 1993 . Subsequently , it has become a housing estate , where a number of the roads reflect the former use of the site , including <unk> Rope Way and Dunstan Drive , although the spelling of " Dunston " is not quite the same . 
 = = Route = = 
 The Stainforth and Keadby follows a fairly direct course from west to east , running for 14 @.@ 9 miles ( 24 @.@ 0 km ) from Bramwith Junction , where it meets the New Junction Canal and the River Don Navigation , to Keadby Lock , where it joins the River Trent . There is a lock at both ends and one part way along at Thorne , which is smaller than the other two . Maximum boat sizes over the entire canal are 61 @.@ 7 feet ( 18 @.@ 8 m ) long by 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) wide . Boats can draw 7 @.@ 25 feet ( 2 @.@ 21 m ) and headroom is restricted to 10 @.@ 9 feet ( 3 @.@ 3 m ) . 
 The New Junction Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal leave the end of the River Don Navigation , and both head broadly north east , but whereas the New Junction Canal continues in a straight line for its entire length , the Stainforth and Keadby gradually turns to the east . Shortly after the junction , Bramwith Lock lowers the level of the canal . The River Don , after flowing under the New Junction Canal , joins the canal and continues close to the north bank for several miles . Bramwith Swing Bridge is the first of several swing bridges , most of which are operated by boaters . The tiny village of Kirk Bramwith is just to the north of the canal and river . Its notable buildings include the church of St Mary , much of which dates from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , with a twelfth @-@ century southern doorway . The building is a grade II * listed structure . The hamlet of South Bramwith lies to the south , with Bramwith Hall , a grade II listed 3 @-@ storey , 5 @-@ bay eighteenth @-@ century country house , which was rebuilt in the early nineteenth century , situated close to the canal . The canal passes to the north of Stainforth , where there is a fixed bridge . A basin , with its former connection to the Don , is now used as moorings by Thorne Cruising Club . This first section is now generally considered to be part of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal , although it was originally part of the Don Navigation as far as Stainforth Lock . 
 After a large pipe bridge , the canal widens to form a loading bay where coal from Hatfield Main Colliery was transferred to barges . A railway , which has now been dismantled , connected the site to the mine . About 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from Stainforth , the Don turns towards the north , while the canal continues to the east , passing under the M18 motorway . As it approaches Thorne , it passes under the Sheffield to Hull Railway near Thorne North railway station . Immediately beyond the bridge is <unk> Marina , followed by Thorne Lock , with a swing bridge crossing its head . The canal turns briefly to the south , to pass under the A614 road and the Doncaster to Cleethorpes railway near Thorne South railway station . The railway remains close to the northern bank for most of the way to Keadby . There is another marina near <unk> Lift Bridge , and after Moor 's Swing Bridge , the canal crosses open countryside . 
 The land besides the canal is low lying , and there is evidence of strip farming , with a series of farms each with a long thin strip of land behind it . In this case the strips were 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 4 ha ) strips , <unk> 220 by 22 yards ( 201 by 20 m ) in size . The land is crossed by drainage ditches . To the north are those of Thorne Moors , while to the south , the drains include Boating Dyke , which was used for the export of peat during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . The network of peat canals were largely destroyed by the cutting of the canal in 1802 , and Boating Dyke now feeds into the North Engine Drain , which crosses Hatfield Chase and discharges into the River Trent at Keadby . After Maud 's Swing Bridge is a long straight stretch , with the railway on the north bank . The North Soak Drain and South Soak Drain flank the canal on both sides , and were built because the canal disrupted the natural drainage of the area . Near to Crook o <unk> Swing Bridge was Medge Hall peat works , which exported peat from the moors by railway until it was closed in 1966 . 
 Just before <unk> Swing Bridge , the northern soak drain crosses to the north side of the railway . As the canal approaches Ealand there are some large lakes to the north , which are now used for sailing . Crowle Bridge carries the A161 road over the railway and the canal , and Crowle railway station is sandwiched between the canal and the North Soak Drain . A little further east are the remains of Crowle railway bridge . It carried the Axholme Joint Railway over the canal , and consisted of four arches built from bricks , with a central swinging section , to allow keels to sail along the canal . The bridge was retained after the railway was closed in 1966 , because stators from Keadby Power Station were too heavy to be transported over the A161 road bridge . The stators were carried by road to Ealand , loaded onto the railway , and crossed the bridge to Belton , where they were transferred back to a road vehicle . The process became unnecessary when Lindsey County Council rebuilt the A161 bridge in 1970 , and the railway bridge was demolished in 1972 . 
 On the outskirts of Keadby , there are two more bridges . <unk> Swing Bridge is a conventional swing bridge , but the railway crosses to the south side of the canal on a sliding bridge . The bridge deck is only around 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) above the level of the water . When boats need to pass , the deck is winched sideways , and clears the waterway because it crosses it at an angle . The bridge was built in 1925 @-@ 26 and rebuilt in 2004 , and is controlled from a signal box nearby . Beyond the bridge , Keadby gas @-@ fired power station is located on the north bank . The final bridge is Keadby Swing Bridge , situated at the head of Keadby Lock . The lock controls passage to the River Trent , which is tidal at this point , and it therefore has four sets of gates . The main structure of the lock dates from the opening of the canal , and is grade II listed . The gates and sills were replaced in 1932 . There are wharves on the river for larger ships , and Keadby pumping station is situated just to the south . It was built in the 1930s , and pumps water from Hatfield Chase into the Trent . Since 1945 it has also dealt with water from the North and South Soak Drains . When the South Yorkshire Railway opened their line along the banks of the canal in 1859 , it terminated beside the lock , but was diverted to the south to cross the Trent on Keadby Bridge in 1864 .

 = Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority = 
 The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority ( WMATA ) , commonly referred to as Metro , is a tri @-@ jurisdictional government agency that operates transit service in the Washington Metropolitan Area . WMATA was created by the United States Congress as an interstate compact between the District of Columbia , the State of Maryland , and the Commonwealth of Virginia . 
 WMATA provides rapid transit service under the Metrorail name , fixed @-@ route bus service under the Metrobus brand , and paratransit service under the MetroAccess brand . The authority is also part of a public @-@ private partnership that operates the DC Circulator bus system . WMATA has its own police force , the Metro Transit Police Department . 
 The authority 's Board of Directors consists of two voting representatives each from the District of Columbia , Maryland , Virginia , and the federal government . Each jurisdiction also appoints two alternate representatives . WMATA has no independent taxation authority and depends on its member jurisdictions for capital investments and operating subsidies . 
 In addition to ongoing operations , WMATA participates in regional transportation planning and is developing future expansions of its system . These projects include an extension of Metrorail to Dulles Airport , street car lines in the District and northern Virginia , and light rail in suburban Maryland . 
 = = History = = 
 Starting in the mid @-@ 19th century , the Washington area had been served by a variety of private bus lines and streetcar services , including extensions of Northern Virginia trolleys . Over time , most were absorbed into the Capital Transit Company , formed on December 1 , 1933 by the amalgamation of the Washington Railway , Capital Traction , and Washington Rapid Transit . Financier Louis Wolfson acquired the company in 1949 but had his franchise revoked in 1955 amidst a crippling strike . Congress then awarded a 20 @-@ year concession to O. Roy Chalk on the condition that he replace the city 's remaining streetcars with buses by 1963 . The company was thereafter known as DC Transit . 
 In that same year , the Mass Transportation Survey attempted to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet the needs of the Washington area in the year 1980 . In 1959 , the study 's final report called for the construction of two rapid transit subway lines in downtown Washington . Congress responded to the report by enacting the National Capital Transportation Act of 1960 to coordinate future transportation planning for the area . The act created a new federal agency called the National Capital Transportation Agency ( NCTA ) . However , the 1959 report also called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia . Residents successfully lobbied for a moratorium on freeway construction in what became part of a movement called the " freeway revolts . " 
 The NCTA 's November 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report included a proposal for an 89 @-@ mile ( 143 km ) , $ 793 million rail system . The total cost of the proposed highway and rail system was less than the 1959 plan due to the elimination of controversial freeways . The plan was supported by President Kennedy , but opposed by highway advocates in Congress who reduced the rail system to only 23 @-@ miles ( 37 km ) within the District of Columbia . However , that proposal was defeated in Congress shortly after President Kennedy 's death . The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 passed Congress , which promised 66 % federal funding for urban mass transportation projects . Encouraged by the new act , the NCTA recommended the formation of a private entity or a multi @-@ state authority to operate the system using more non @-@ federal funds . On September 8 , 1965 , President Johnson signed the National Capital Transportation Act of 1965 approving the construction of a 25 @-@ mile ( 40 km ) rapid transit system . 
 The NCTA negotiated with Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia for the formation of a new regional entity . The authority was created by an interstate compact , a special type of contract or agreement between one or more states . Pursuant to the Compact Clause of the U.S. Constitution , any such compact must be approved by Congress . After the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact was approved by the Maryland General Assembly in 1965 , and passed through the Virginia General Assembly and Congress in 1966 , WMATA was founded on February 20 , 1967 . 
 As a government agency , the compact grants WMATA sovereign immunity by all three jurisdictions in which it operates , and except for certain limited exceptions , the authority cannot be successfully sued unless it waives immunity . Under the provisions of the compact , the authority is legally incorporated in the District of Columbia , where WMATA maintains its headquarters . 
 WMATA broke ground for its train system in 1969 . The first portion of the Metrorail system opened March 27 , 1976 , connecting Dupont Circle to Rhode Island Avenue on the Red Line . The 103 miles ( 166 km ) of the original 83 @-@ station system was completed on January 13 , 2001 with the opening of Green Line 's segment from Anacostia to Branch Avenue . 
 WMATA 's bus system is a successor to four privately owned bus companies . While WMATA 's original compact provided only for rail service , by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led to calls for authority to overhaul the entire bus system as well . The compact was amended in 1971 , allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies . After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an agreed price , on January 14 , 1973 WMATA condemned DC Transit and its sister company , the Washington , Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired their assets for $ 38 @.@ 2 million . On February 4 , it acquired Alexandria , <unk> and Washington Transit Company , which operated in Northern Virginia , and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George 's County for $ 4 @.@ 5 million . While AB & W and WMA Transit were in better financial condition than DC Transit , their owners did not wish to compete with a publicly owned bus system , and requested takeover . 
 In 1979 , an organization known as Metro 2001 , Inc . , planned to write a history of the development of the Metro system for WMATA using such documents as Congressional hearing transcripts , correspondence , and maps . However , this plan , known as the Metro History Project , was abandoned in 1985 , and materials that had been collected up until that point ( 1930 @-@ 1984 ) were donated to The George Washington University . This collection of materials is currently under the care of GWU 's Special Collections Research Center , located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library . 
 In 1998 , Congress changed the name of the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with the law specifying that no money be spent to implement the name change . As a result , WMATA did not change the name of the National Airport station ( which never included the full name of the airport ) . In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed , WMATA stated that stations are renamed only at the request of the local jurisdiction . Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats , the name change was blocked . Finally , in 2001 , Congress made changing the station 's name a condition of further federal funding .

 In response to a demand for immediate repayment of a $ 43 million debt , WMATA sought a temporary restraining order against the KBC Bank Group . KBC claimed that the WMATA was in technical default of a contract following the collapse of AIG , which had guaranteed the loan that KBC made to WMATA in 2002 . The contract involved the sale to KBC of WMATA 's rail cars , which were then leased back to WMATA . WMATA asked for an injunction from the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia on October 29 , 2008 . 
 After three days of negotiations in federal court , Judge Rosemary M. Collyer announced a settlement on November 14 , 2008 . WMATA had 14 similar lease agreements with other financial institutions when the KBC case went to trial . <unk> were requested from the banks to allow WMATA time to replace AIG with another insurer or guarantees by the federal government . 
 In 2009 , WMATA issued two new series of municipal bonds bringing its total outstanding bonds to $ 390 @.@ 9 million , as of June 30 , 2010 . This includes $ 55 million of Build America Bonds issued in 2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that are partially subsidized by the federal government . However , most of the system 's debt is financed directly by each local jurisdiction . In addition , WMATA was authorized to receive $ 202 million in grants from the federal government for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act projects . The funds are spent in 30 projects which include information technology , facilities maintenance , and vehicles and vehicle parts . 
 On January 14 , 2010 , General Manager John B. Catoe announced his resignation from Metro , effective April 2 , 2010 . He was replaced on April 3 , 2010 by Interim General Manager Richard Sarles . Sarles became one of three finalists interviewing for the permanent position , and later became the permanent General Manager on January 27 , 2011 . Jack Requa became the Interim General Manager upon Sarles ' retirement January 16 , 2015 .

 = = = Board of directors = = = 
 WMATA was originally set up with a board of directors , of twelve members . Of those , six were voting members , and six were alternates . In response to the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 , the WMATA Compact was amended on August 19 , 2009 to allow the appointment of four additional board members by the federal government , bringing the total to sixteen . 
 As of January 2013 , there were a total of fifteen board members : seven voting members and eight alternates . Virginia , Maryland , and the District had each appointed two voting members and two alternate members . The Federal Government , through the General Services Administration , is authorized to appoint up to two voting and two alternate members , but had appointed just two voting and one alternate members . 
 Board members serve without pay , but may be reimbursed for actual expenses . The board appoints a General Manager as CEO to supervise the day @-@ to @-@ day operation of the Authority . Under the terms of the " Procedures for WMATA Board of Directors " , none of the individual board members , including the Chairman , have any power to act regarding the operations of the Authority or to issue instructions to the General Manager or employees ; only the entire board as a body has power to instruct the General Manager . 
 The board approves WMATA 's annual budget . The budget was $ 2 @.@ 10 billion in fiscal year 2010 . In fiscal year 2010 , 31 @.@ 1 % of revenues came from capital contributions , 20 @.@ 2 % from passenger revenues , 32 @.@ 1 % from local jurisdiction operating subsidies , 3 @.@ 5 % from interest income , 1 @.@ 9 % from advertising revenue , 1 @.@ 1 % from rental revenue , and 0 @.@ 1 % from other sources . 
 The WMATA board has the following standing committees : Safety and Security Committee , Finance and Administration Committee ( with an Audits and Investigations subcommittee ) , Customer Service and Operations Committee ( with a Technology Review subcommittee ) , Policy , Program Development and Intergovernmental Relations Committee and the Joint Development and Real Estate Committee . 
 The position of board chairman rotates between the three jurisdictions . Article III Section 5 of the Compact specifies the method of appointment . The Compact prohibits WMATA from paying board members . However , Maryland pays its voting board members $ 20 @,@ 000 per year and Virginia pays $ 50 per meeting . The District of Columbia does not compensate its board members . 
 On February 17 , 2011 , outgoing 2010 – 11 WMATA Board Chairman Peter Benjamin announced he was leaving the board and will be replaced by former Congressman Michael D. Barnes . On that date , the new Governance Committee of the WMATA board , which is chaired by Mary Hynes , held its first meeting and established a work plan to develop a new relationship between the board and WMATA management . The Committee will draft new bylaws that will better define the role and term of the WMATA Board Chairman . The Governance Committee will also draft a code of conduct for board members .

 The General Manager is the chief executive officer of WMATA and leads all staff except that the General Counsel , Inspector General and Board Secretary , who report directly to the board . WMATA has a Chief Safety Officer which reports to the general manager . The safety of the system is independently reviewed by the Tri @-@ State Oversight Committee and the National Transportation Safety Board . On March 4 , 2010 , the Federal Transit Administration issue an Audit of the State Safety Oversight ( SSO ) program overseeing Metro which criticised the SSO as being underfunded and poorly trained . In response , Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia have increased their SSO funding and training for their employees responsible for safety oversight at metro . 
 Jackson Graham , a retired general in the Army Corps of Engineers who supervised the planning and initial construction of the Metrorail system , was the first general manager . Graham retired in 1976 , and was replaced by Theodore C. Lutz . Richard S. Page , head of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration , took over as general manager of WMATA in 1979 . Page resigned in 1983 , amid increasing financial difficulties for <unk> and was replaced by Carmen E. Turner , who served for seven years . Former New York City Transit Authority chief , David L. Gunn , took over as head of WMATA in 1991 , followed by Lawrence G. Reuter in 1994 , and Richard A. White in 1996 . 
 White led efforts to improve accountability and dialogue with passengers during 2005 . This included independent audits , town hall meetings , online chats with White and other management officials , and improved signage in stations . White had three more years in his contract to work for Metro , but had come under fire for mismanagement ; however , he was also " widely credited with saving the Metrobus system from collapse and with keeping Metro running during the terrorist attacks of Sept . 11 , 2001 . " Despite these efforts , however , the Board of Directors dismissed White on January 11 , 2006 . Dan Tangherlini replaced White as interim General Manager , effective February 16 , 2006 . 
 Tangherlini was considered a leading candidate for Metro 's top job on a permanent basis before he resigned to work as D.C. City Administrator under Mayor Adrian Fenty . On November 6 , 2006 , Tangherlini was replaced as interim general manager by Jack Requa , Metro 's chief bus manager . John B. Catoe , Jr . , who was previously the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority , became the agency 's eighth permanent General Manager on January 25 , 2007 . He resigned three years later following the deadliest crash in the Metrorail system 's history . 
 On April 3 , 2010 , the Board of Directors appointed Richard Sarles , former Executive Director of New Jersey Transit , as interim General Manager . Sarles , 65 , was offered the position of permanent General Manager but declined the appointment at that time . However , on January 27 , 2011 , the Board announced that Sarles accepted the position as WMATA 's permanent General Manager . 
 With Sarles ' retirement , the post of General Manager was filled by Paul <unk> on November 30 , 2015 .

 The agency 's charter directs WMATA to create a unified regional transit system by coordinating other public and private agencies within its jurisdiction . Examples of its coordination efforts include : reducing unnecessary , duplicate services by other local transit systems ; providing " SmarTrip " farecards for buses operated by other local transit agencies ; and adding local bus schedules and commuter rail routes ( such as Maryland 's MARC and Virginia 's VRE ) to WMATA 's online " Trip Planner " guide .

This change was one of the requirements for the $ 1 @.@ 5 billion federal grant offered by the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 . Helen Lew became the Metro 's first Inspector General on May 14 , 2007 , establishing the WMATA Office of Inspector General .

 Since opening in 1976 , the Metrorail network has grown to include six lines , 91 stations , and 117 miles ( 188 km ) of track . It is the second @-@ busiest rapid transit system in the United States in number of passenger trips , after the New York City Subway . There were 215 @.@ 3 million trips , or 727 @,@ 684 trips per weekday , on Metrorail in fiscal year 2008 . In June 2008 , Metro set a new monthly ridership record with 19 @,@ 729 @,@ 641 trips , or 798 @,@ 456 per weekday . On April 2 , 2010 , Metrorail set a new ridership record of 891 @,@ 240 trips . During 2010 , Metrorail had 217 @.@ 2 million trips . Fares vary based on the distance traveled and the time of day . Riders enter and exit the system using a proximity card known as SmarTrip ; magnetic stripe tickets stopped being accepted on March 6 , 2016 . Metrorail 's frequency of service and fares vary depending on the available subsidy , the particular transit line , and the distance traveled . 
 As a part of 42 Metrorail stations , Metro offers parking for commuters . Most lots are on a first @-@ come , first @-@ served basis and fill up quickly each day . Thirty four stations offer reserved parking , with customers purchasing permits to park in specified spaces . Three Metrorail stations ( Greenbelt , Huntington , and Franconia @-@ Springfield ) have spaces reserved for multi @-@ day parking for up to ten days . Parking fees are paid by SmarTrip card , but 19 stations also accept credit cards . Cash payments are not accepted for parking fees .

 Metrobus ' fleet consists of 1 @,@ 505 buses covering an area of 1 @,@ 500 square miles ( 3 @,@ 900 km ² ) in Washington , D.C. , Maryland , and Virginia . There are over 300 bus routes serving 12 @,@ 216 stops , including 2 @,@ 398 bus shelters . In fiscal year 2009 , Metrobus provided more than 133 million trips . During 2010 , Metrobus had 123 @.@ 7 million trips . On a typical weekday , it provides more than 400 @,@ 000 trips . 
 Metro has currently awarded a five @-@ year contract with <unk> ( now New Flyer ) for the procurement of up to 654 new buses . The first batch of 85 <unk> diesel @-@ electric hybrid 42 @-@ foot buses is already on order , with delivery expected within a year . The new buses will replace some of Metro ’ s older Orion V , <unk> <unk> and New Flyer <unk> buses , which were delivered in 1997 @-@ 2002 . Going forward , the contract gives Metro the option to order up to 498 additional 42 @-@ foot buses and up to 71 60 @-@ foot buses over the five @-@ year period . Red / silver painted buses will be used on " Local " routes and blue / silver buses will be used on " <unk> " routes . These buses will have either a red stripe in front of the bus for " Local " routes or a blue stripe in front of the bus for " <unk> " routes for easy identification . The numbering represents its region of operation . To differ the regions numbering system , Maryland letter is ( prefix ) to the route number and Virginia letter is ( suffix ) to the route number . For example : <unk> ( Maryland ) & <unk> ( Virginia ) . 
 = = = MetroAccess = = = 
 MetroAccess is a paratransit service which WMATA provides through private contractors . It began operation in May 1994 , and since that time , annual ridership has grown from 200 @,@ 000 to over 2 @.@ 4 million passengers . MetroAccess operates 365 days a year , providing door @-@ to @-@ door , shared rides reserved from one to seven days in advance . It is now the sixth largest paratransit service in the United States with a fleet of over 600 vehicles and over 1 @,@ 000 employees . WMATA staff determines eligibility to use the service in response to written applications . The cost per passenger for MetroAccess is significantly higher than its fixed @-@ route counterparts , and Metro has worked to provide as many opportunities to encourage and facilitate the use of fixed @-@ route transit by its customers with disabilities . 
 = = Funding = = 
 Fares and other revenue fund 57 @.@ 6 % of the Metro 's daily operations while state and local governments fund the remaining 42 @.@ 4 % . Since the Metro 's inception , the federal government has provided grants for 65 % of the system 's capital costs . Metrorail is unusual among major public transportation systems in having no dedicated source of funding . Instead , each year WMATA must ask each local jurisdiction to contribute funding , which is determined by a formula that equally considers three factors : 
 population density , as of the 2000 Census ; 
 average weekday ridership ; 
 number of stations in each jurisdiction . 
 Under this formula , the District of Columbia contributes the greatest amount ( 34 % ) , followed by Montgomery County ( 18 @.@ 7 % ) , Prince George 's County ( 17 @.@ 9 % ) , Fairfax County ( 14 @.@ 3 % ) , Arlington County ( 9 @.@ 9 % ) , the City of Alexandria ( 4 @.@ 7 % ) , the City of Falls Church ( 0 @.@ 3 % ) , and the City of Fairfax ( 0 @.@ 3 % ) . From time to time , a local jurisdiction will agree to subsidize a specific fare , with the jurisdiction funding the cost of the subsidy in addition to its contribution under the above formula . For example , the District of Columbia subsidized the fares charged at Metrorail stations located in economically challenged neighborhoods . 
 The cost of Metrobus is allocated under a formula which considers the excess of expenses over revenues from specific bus routes . The cost of MetroAccess is allocated under a different formula , which divides MetroAccess costs by the number of trips requested by riders who reside in each jurisdiction . 
 In 2004 , the Brookings Institution released a report entitled " Deficits by Design " that found the agency 's serious budgetary challenges owe in large part to its problematic revenue base . Most notably , Brookings found that WMATA 's extraordinary lack of dedicated funding sources has necessitated an over @-@ reliance on annually appropriated support that makes the agency vulnerable to perennial financial crises . As a result , the region 's political and business leaders created a committee to look at new ways to fund the system , including some type of dedicated tax . 
 Title VI of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 , signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 16 , 2008 , authorized a grant of $ 1 @.@ 5 billion over a 10 @-@ year period for Metrorail capital maintenance projects . The grant was contingent upon the establishment of dedicated revenue sources for the Metro by the Compact jurisdictions . An amendment to the Metro 's Compact on August 19 , 2009 added the requirement for payments " from dedicated funding sources " by the Compact 's participating jurisdictions . In June 2010 , Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell threatened to withhold Virginia 's WMATA funding unless the composition of WMATA 's board is modified to allow Virginia 's Governor to appoint two of the four Virginia seats , instead of the localities . On June 17 , 2010 , Federal Transit Administrator Peter <unk> required a formal commitment from Virginia to match its share of the federal funds if the federal funding is to continue . On July 1 , 2010 , the WMATA Board of Directors agreed to provide matching funds without regard to McDonnell 's request for Board seats . Based on this agreement , the federal funds were reconfirmed , and WMATA was able to proceed with a contract to purchase 428 new <unk> cars . McDonnell pressed for a Board seat again in 2011 , and used his amendatory veto authority to amend the 2010 @-@ 11 budget to require the <unk> to appoint someone of the Governor 's choosing to fill one of the <unk> seats on the WMATA Board . 
 In the course of considering a continuing resolution for federal fiscal year 2011 , the U.S. House of Representatives sought to defund all " earmarks " including the $ 150 million annual installment toward the $ 1 @.@ 5 billion in federal matching funds . On February 16 , 2011 , Rep. Gerry Connolly ( D @-@ Va . ) offered an amendment to reallocate $ 150 million from farm subsidy payments to meet this obligation , but the amendment was ruled out of order . The suspension of the federal appropriation also calls into question the matching funds from the individual jurisdictions for capital projects . On March 1 , 2010 , Republican Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell wrote to Congress urging continuation of the federal funds . The continuing resolution for the remainder of 2011 ultimately included the federal matching funds . 
 On June 24 , 2010 , WMATA adopted a six @-@ year capital spending plan totalling $ 5 billion . The plan is funded by the $ 3 billion from the 2008 Act , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , and increased funding from the participating jurisdictions . The plan includes rebuilding much of its infrastructure for improved safety . The NTSB had recommended replacing Metrorail 's oldest series of railcars as <unk> , and the spending plan would replace those cars . 
 The 57 % funding of WMATA from fares and other revenue compares with New York City 's Metropolitan Transportation Authority which receives 53 % of its funding from fares and car tolls . The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority receives of 31 @.@ 8 % . of its funding from fares . 
 In an effort to gain revenues , WMATA has started to allow retail ventures in Metrorail stations . WMATA has authorized DVD @-@ rental vending machines and ticket booths for the Old Town Trolley Tours and is seeking additional retail tenants . 
 The WMATA staff preliminary budget for 2011 @-@ 12 shows an $ 89 million operating deficit . This deficit can be addressed by fare increases , service reductions , or increased subsidies from the participating local jurisdictions . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 = = = Safety = = = 
 In recent years , WMATA has drawn criticism for a neglect of safety in both its rail and bus systems . Problems include failures within the system designed to prevent train collisions and escalators failing or breaking apart while in service . The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) has recommended that WMATA invest $ 1 billion in needed safety improvements . A December 2008 report by the WMATA Inspector General documented that Metro 's System Safety and Risk Management Office was bypassed when changes were made to Metrorail 's operating procedures , even though that office 's review and approval was required as a matter of policy . On June 22 , 2009 , two Metrorail trains collided between the Takoma and Fort Totten Metro stations , killing nine . In February 2011 , the National Transportation Safety Board conducted a public hearing during which witnesses testified about problems with the safety culture at WMATA . The NTSB 's final report on the accident commented that " [ t ] he failure of WMATA engineers and technicians or managers to properly address track circuit anomalies is symptomatic of the larger safety culture issues within the organization . " 
 Safety concerns have grown to the point that the region 's Congressional delegation introduced the " National Metro Safety Act of 2011 , " which would establish federal safety standards for heavy rail mass transit systems . In response , WMATA is replacing its track control system and ordered an immediate inspection of all of its escalators . That inspection showed that over 10 percent of the escalators had faulty brakes . 
 Elevator and escalator service are a public concern prompting WMATA to post a webpage that is updated daily to notify users of elevator and escalator outages . The NTSB has criticised the ability of Metrorail 's Series 1000 cars to withstand collisions even at very low speeds . WMATA has ordered new cars to replace its Series 1000 fleet . 
 Closed @-@ circuit television cameras monitor every Metrobus and every Metrorail station . 
 = = = Discrimination = = = 
 There have been claims of discrimination within WMATA over the years . As of 2005 , the WMATA workforce is composed of people from the following demographic groups : 
 In 1990 , Christine Townsend sued WMATA in the Washington federal district court on the basis of sexual discrimination . She won , with the court noting in the outcome of Townsend v. Washington Metro . Area Transit <unk> that the WMATA explanation had " many unexplained inconsistencies , irregularities , and holes " . 
 Former Metro workers claim that WMATA consistently passes over non @-@ black applicants or workers for employment or promotion . 
 In May 2015 , the WMATA board voted to ban advocacy advertising after the American Freedom Defense Initiative sought to purchase advertisements in five subway stations and on twenty buses depicting Muhammad . The Metropolitan Transportation Authority previously attempted to deny similar anti @-@ Islam ads by the <unk> , but had their decision successfully challenged in court , and subsequently voted to ban non @-@ commercial advertising . 
 = = Future expansion = = 
 WMATA and its local jurisdictions developed a six @-@ year , $ 5 billion " Capital Improvement Program " ( CAP ) which took effect on July 1 , 2010 , and will expire on June 30 , 2016 . Under CAP , the local jurisdictions will fund capital projects ( through the sale of municipal bonds ) with matching funds provided by the federal government . CAP projects include purchasing new rail cars , rehabilitating three rail lines , replacing three bus garages , implementation of NTSB safety recommendations and purchasing new track maintenance equipment and overhauling Metrorail station elevators and escalators . 
 WMATA added another color to its system , silver . The Silver Line 's Phase I extended service to the Tysons Corner area of Virginia , with further extension planned to Dulles Airport and Loudoun County . Utility relocation for Phase I began in mid @-@ 2008 . Phase I through Tysons Corner to Reston ( Wiehle @-@ Reston East station ) opened July 26 , 2014 , while Phase II to Dulles is expected to be completed in 2018 . No stations will be opened until the completion of each phase . The Silver Line is financed through toll increases on the Dulles Toll Road as well as a $ 900 million federal grant and a special taxing district on adjacent commercial properties . In contrast , a proposed new $ 270 @-@ million Potomac Yards <unk> stop on the Blue and Yellow Lines north of Braddock Road is to be funded by a special taxing district that will cover commercial properties and perhaps residential properties as well . 
 There has also been speculation about an extension of the Green Line northward to Baltimore 's BWI Airport , There was also talk of extending the Green either to National Harbor or to White Plains via Waldorf . An extension from Franconia / Springfield to Fort Belvoir is also a possibility due to the Base Realignment and Closure process which relocated thousands of area defense jobs at Fort Belvoir in 2012 . While there has been much discussion about all of these extensions , none are in any official planning stage . There as also been plans to extend the Orange Line to Centreville and Bowie . 
 Regarding Metrobus improvements , General Manager Sarles reported , " Bus service will benefit from new technology that integrates fare box , destination signage and next bus systems to improve our reliability and customer information delivery . And , we will begin work in certain priority bus corridors that will deliver faster travel times for bus customers . Additionally , I look forward to working with the District of Columbia on potential bus rapid transit service improvements , such as curb running and signal preference to make bus service even more attractive , efficient , and an even more powerful antidote to traffic congestion . "

 = Julia Alvarez = 
 Julia Alvarez ( born March 27 , 1950 ) is a Dominican @-@ American poet , novelist , and essayist . 
 Alvarez rose to prominence with the novels How the García Girls Lost Their Accents ( 1991 ) , In the Time of the Butterflies ( 1994 ) , and Yo ! ( 1997 ) . Her publications as a poet include Homecoming ( 1984 ) and The Woman I Kept to Myself ( 2004 ) , and as an essayist the autobiographical compilation Something to Declare ( 1998 ) . Many literary critics regard her to be one of the most significant Latina writers and she has achieved critical and commercial success on an international scale . 
 Born in New York , she spent the first ten years of her childhood in the Dominican Republic , until her father ’ s involvement in a political rebellion forced her family to flee the country . Many of Alvarez ’ s works are influenced by her experiences as a Dominican in the United States , and focus heavily on issues of assimilation and identity . Her cultural upbringing as both a Dominican and an American is evident in the combination of personal and political tone in her writing . She is known for works that examine cultural expectations of women both in the Dominican Republic and the United States , and for rigorous investigations of cultural stereotypes . In recent years , Alvarez has expanded her subject matter with works such as In the Name of Salomé ( 2000 ) , a novel with Cuban rather than solely Dominican characters and fictionalized versions of historical figures . 
 In addition to her successful writing career , Alvarez is the current writer @-@ in @-@ residence at Middlebury College . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 Julia Alvarez was born in 1950 in New York City . When she was three @-@ months @-@ old , her family moved back to the Dominican Republic , where they lived for the next ten years . She grew up with her extended family in sufficient comfort to enjoy the services of maids . Critic Silvio Sirias believes that Dominicans value a talent for story @-@ telling ; Alvarez developed this talent early and was " often called upon to entertain guests " . In 1960 , the family was forced to flee to the United States after her father participated in a failed plot to overthrow the island ’ s military dictator , Rafael Trujillo , circumstances which would later be revisited in her writing : her novel How the García Girls Lost Their Accents , for example , portrays a family that is forced to leave the Dominican Republic in similar circumstances , and in her poem , " Exile " , she describes " the night we fled the country " and calls the experience a " loss much larger than I understood " . 
 Alvarez ’ s transition from the Dominican Republic to the United States was difficult ; Sirias comments that she " lost almost everything : a homeland , a language , family connections , a way of understanding , and a warmth " . She experienced alienation , homesickness , and prejudice in her new surroundings . In How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents , a character asserts that trying to raise " consciousness [ in the Dominican Republic ] ... would be like trying for cathedral ceilings in a tunnel " . 
 As one of the few Latin American students in her Catholic school , Alvarez faced discrimination because of her heritage and was often called a " <unk> ! " by her classmates . This caused her to turn inward and led to her fascination with literature , which she called " a portable homeland " . She was encouraged by many of her teachers to pursue writing , and from a young age , was certain that this was what she wanted to do with her life . At the age of 13 , her parents sent her to Abbot Academy , a boarding school , because the local schools were not considered sufficient . As a result , her relationship with her parents suffered , and was further strained when every summer she returned to the Dominican Republic to " reinforce their identities not only as Dominicans but also as proper young ladies " . These intermittent exchanges between countries informed her cultural understanding , the basis of many of her works . 
 After graduating from Abbot Academy in 1967 , she attended Connecticut College from 1967 to 1969 ( where she won the Benjamin T. Marshall Poetry Prize ) and then transferred to Middlebury College , where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree , summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa ( 1971 ) . She then received a master 's degree from Syracuse University ( 1975 ) . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 After acquiring a master 's degree in 1975 , Alvarez took a position as a writer @-@ in @-@ residence for the Kentucky Arts Commission . She traveled throughout the state visiting elementary schools , high schools , colleges and communities , conducting writing workshops and giving readings . She attributes these years with providing her a deeper understanding of America and helping her realize her passion for teaching . After her work in Kentucky , she extended her educational endeavors to California , Delaware , North Carolina , Massachusetts , Washington , D.C. , and Illinois . 
 In addition to writing , Alvarez holds the position of writer @-@ in @-@ residence at Middlebury College , where she teaches creative writing on a part @-@ time basis . Alvarez currently resides in the Champlain Valley in Vermont . She has served as a panelist , consultant , and editor , as a judge for literary awards such as the PEN / Newman 's Own First Amendment Award and the Casa de las Américas Prize , and also gives readings and lectures across the country . She and her partner , Bill <unk> , an ophthalmologist , created Alta Gracia , a farm @-@ literacy center dedicated to the promotion of environmental sustainability and literacy and education worldwide . Alvarez and her husband purchased the farm in 1996 with the intent to promote cooperative and independent coffee @-@ farming in the Dominican Republic . 
 = = Literary work = = 
 Alvarez is regarded as one of the most critically and commercially successful Latina writers of her time . Her published works include five novels , a book of essays , four collections of poetry , four children ’ s books , and two works of adolescent fiction . 
 Among her first published works were collections of poetry ; The Homecoming , published in 1984 , was expanded and republished in 1996 . Poetry was Alvarez ’ s first form of creative writing and she explains that her love for poetry has to do with the fact that " a poem is very intimate , heart @-@ to @-@ heart " . Her poetry celebrates nature and the detailed rituals of daily life , including domestic chores . Her poems portray stories of family life and are often told from the perspective of women . She questions patriarchal privilege and examines issues of exile , assimilation , identity , and the struggle of the lower class in an introspective manner . She found inspiration for her work from a small painting from 1894 by Pierre Bonnard called The Circus Rider . Her poems , critic Elizabeth Coonrod Martínez suggests , give voice to the immigrant struggle . 
 How the García Girls Lost Their Accents , Alvarez ’ s first novel , was published in 1991 , and was soon widely acclaimed . It is the first major novel written in English by a Dominican author . A largely personal novel , the book details themes of cultural hybridization and the struggles of a post @-@ colonial Dominican Republic . Alvarez illuminates the integration of the Latina immigrant into the U.S. mainstream and shows that identity can be deeply affected by gender , ethnic , and class differences . She uses her own experiences to illustrate deep cultural contrasts between the Caribbean and the United States . So personal was the material in the novel , that for months after it was published , her mother refused to speak with her ; her sisters were also not pleased with the book . The book has sold over 250 @,@ 000 copies , and was cited as an American Library Association Notable Book . 
 Released in 1994 , her second novel , In the Time of the Butterflies , has a historical premise and elaborates on the death of the Mirabal sisters during the time of the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic . In 1960 their bodies were found at the bottom of a cliff on the north coast of the island , and it is said they were a part of a revolutionary movement to overthrow the oppressive regime of the country at the time . These legendary figures are referred to as Las <unk> , or The Butterflies . This story portrays women as strong characters who have the power to alter the course of history , demonstrating Alvarez ’ s affinity for strong female protagonists and anti @-@ colonial movements . As Alvarez explains , " I hope that through this fictionalized story I will bring acquaintance of these famous sisters to English speaking readers . November 25 , the day of their murders is observed in many Latin American countries as the International Day Against Violence Toward Women . Obviously , these sisters , who fought one tyrant , have served as models for women fighting against injustices of all kinds . " 
 In 1997 , Alvarez published Yo ! , a sequel to How the García Girls Lost Their Accents , which focuses solely on the character of Yolanda . Drawing from her own experiences , Alvarez portrays the success of a writer who uses her family as the inspiration for her work . Yo ! could be considered Alvarez ’ s musings on and criticism of her own literary success . Alvarez ’ s opinions on the hybridization of culture are often conveyed through the use of Spanish @-@ English malapropisms , or Spanglish ; such expressions are especially prominent in How the García Girls Lost Their Accents . Alvarez describes the language of the character of Laura as " a mishmash of mixed @-@ up idioms and sayings " . 
 In the Name of Salomé ( 2000 ) is a novel that weaves together the lives of two distinct women , illustrating how they devoted their lives to political causes . It takes place in several locations , including the Dominican Republic before a backdrop of political turbulence , Communist Cuba in the 1960s , and several university campuses across the United States , containing themes of empowerment and activism . As the protagonists of this novel are both women , Alvarez illustrates how these women , " came together in their mutual love of [ their homeland ] and in their faith in the ability of women to forge a conscience for Out Americas . " This book has been widely acclaimed for its careful historical research and captivating story , and was described by Publishers Weekly as " one of the most politically moving novels of the past half century . " 
 = = Influence on Latin American literature = = 
 Alvarez is regarded as one of the most critically and commercially successful Latina writers of her time . As Elizabeth Coonrod Martínez observes , Alvarez is part of a movement of Latina writers that also includes Sandra Cisneros and Cristina García , all of whom weave together themes of the experience of straddling the borders and cultures of Latin America and the United States . Coonrod Martínez suggests that a subsequent generation of Dominican @-@ American writers , such as Angie Cruz , <unk> Maritza Pérez , Nelly Rosario , and Junot Díaz , have been inspired by Alvarez ’ s success . 
 Alvarez admits " the bad part of being a ' Latina Writer ' is that people want to make me into a spokesperson . There is no spokesperson ! There are many realities , different shades and classes " . 
 How the García Girls Lost Their Accents is the first novel by a Dominican @-@ American woman to receive widespread acclaim and attention in the United States . The book portrays ethnic identity as problematic on several levels . Alvarez challenges commonly held assumptions of multiculturalism as strictly positive . She views much of immigrant identity as greatly affected by ethnic , gendered , and class conflict . According to critic Ellen McCracken , " Transgression and incestuous overtones may not be the usual fare of the mainstream ’ s desirable multicultural commodity , but Alvarez ’ s deployment of such narrative tactics foregrounds the centrality of the struggle against abuse of patriarchal power in this Dominican American ’ s early contribution to the new Latina narrative of the 1990s . " 
 Regarding the women ’ s movement in writing , Alvarez explains , " definitely , still , there is a glass ceiling in terms of female novelists . If we have a female character , she might be engaging in something monumental but she ’ s also changing the diapers and doing the cooking , still doing things which get it called a woman ’ s novel . You know , a man ’ s novel is universal ; a woman ’ s novel is for women . " 
 Alvarez claims that her aim is not simply to write for women , but to also deal with universal themes that illustrate a more general interconnectedness . She explains , " What I try to do with my writing is to move out into those other selves , other worlds . To become more and more of us . " As an illustration of this point , Alvarez writes in English about issues in the Dominican Republic , using a combination of both English and Spanish . Alvarez feels empowered by the notion of populations and cultures around the world mixing , and because of this identifies as a " Citizen of the World " . 
 = = Grants and honors = = 
 Alvarez has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Ingram Merrill Foundation . Some of her poetry manuscripts now have a permanent home in the New York Public Library , where her work was featured in an exhibit , " The Hand of the Poet : Original Manuscripts by 100 Masters , From John Donne to Julia Alvarez . " She received the Lamont Prize from the Academy of American Poets in 1974 , first prize in narrative from the Third Woman Press Award in 1986 , and an award from the General Electric Foundation in 1986 . 
 How the García Girls Lost Their Accents was the winner of the 1991 PEN Oakland / Josephine Miles Literary Award for works that present a multicultural viewpoint . Yo ! was selected as a notable book by the American Library Association in 1998 . Before We Were Free won the Belpre Medal in 2004 , and Return to Sender won the Belpre Medal in 2010 . She also received the 2002 Hispanic Heritage Award in Literature .

 = Washington Blade = 
 The Washington Blade is a lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) newspaper in the Washington , D.C. metropolitan area . The Blade is the oldest LGBT newspaper in the United States and third largest by circulation , behind the Philadelphia Gay News and the Gay City News of New York City . The Blade is often referred to as America 's gay newspaper of record because it chronicled LGBT news locally , nationally , and internationally . The New York Times said the Blade is considered " one of the most influential publications written for a gay audience . " 
 The paper was originally launched by a group of volunteers as an independent publication in October 1969 with a focus on bringing the community together . In 2001 , the Blade was purchased by Window Media LLC , a group of gay @-@ oriented newspapers circulated throughout the United States with a staff composed of professional journalists , becoming a leading source of news for the readers both in Washington and around the nation . The paper publishes weekly on Fridays and celebrated its fortieth anniversary in October 2009 . 
 In November 2009 , the Blade and several related publications , including the Southern Voice , were shut down after Window Media announced it was closing business . After Blade staff members were told they no longer had jobs , plans were made for a new gay publication entitled DC Agenda , since the trademark for Washington Blade was still held by the now @-@ defunct Window Media . 
 It was announced on April 27 , 2010 that the DC Agenda would rename itself to the Washington Blade . The ownership group of the Agenda consisted of many former staff members of the Blade , whom purchased the trademark and paper archives out of bankruptcy court . The first issue of the newly independent Blade debuted on April 30 , 2010 .

 The Washington Blade , originally called The Gay Blade , published its first issue on October 5 , 1969 . Taking its roots from the Mattachine Society of Washington 's newsletter in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the Blade was conceived as a way to fill in a perceived gap in the organization of social communications within the gay community of Washington , D.C. The Blade was originally published as a single page and distributed hand @-@ to @-@ hand in a variety of gay bars throughout the city . Afraid of a backlash over the publication , many of the initial authors of writings in the Blade used pen names during the early years of publishing . The initial publications were entirely created by volunteers from the community with two editors , Nancy Tucker and Bart Wenger , leading the helm . Wenger stated the initial goals of the publication were to " ... engender a sense of community " and that it was " very important for gays to become acquainted with one another . " Published monthly from 1969 to 1973 , the newspaper evolved from its original size and shape of a single letter sized paper sheet . In June 1972 , the Gay Blade published its first multi @-@ page edition which consisted of four pages and in April 1973 , the paper expanded to eight pages and was printed on legal sized paper sheets , stapled in the middle and folded . As the looks of the paper evolved , so did the news coverage . The Gay Blade began to focus less on being a newsletter used to organize the community and more of a newspaper for the community .

 In July 1974 , the first newsprint edition was published and signaled an evolution in the history of the Gay Blade . A fifth anniversary edition of the paper was not published in October 1974 because of a lack of revenue and interest , marking the only time the paper failed to publish an edition in its history . The new focus on being a newspaper allowed the publication 's circulation to grow in 1974 and 1975 from five hundred copies distributed at less than a dozen sites to over 4 @,@ 000 copies available at thirty @-@ five locations throughout the city . The June 1975 edition of the Blade dropped the word ' Gay ' from the title of the publication after it was discovered that a newspaper in New York held the rights to the name Gay Blade . The new name of the publication was now The Blade . It continued to be published on newsprint paper and had no additional format changes until near the end of the decade . Incorporating as a non @-@ profit corporation under the title of " Blade Communications , Inc . " in November 1975 , the paper continued its growth . Don Michaels , an important voice on the pages of the publication , was named the editor of the paper in January 1978 . Michaels began strict enforcement of a policy that prohibited pen names from being used in <unk> . By November 1978 , the Blade was regularly featuring color printing on its pages and beginning in 1979 , the Blade changed into a bi @-@ weekly publication . Starting in October 1980 , the name of the publication changed to The Washington Blade and the corporation re @-@ incorporated as a for @-@ profit , employee @-@ owned business . In July 1981 , the Blade ran a front @-@ page story entitled " Rare , Fatal Pneumonia Hits Gay Men , " making the paper one of the first gay newspapers in the country to write about the disease that has come to be known as AIDS . In November 1981 , Don Michaels got promoted to the position of publisher , a position he would hold for over two decades . 
 = = = 1983 to 2000 = = = 
 The Blade started publishing weekly in January 1983 and coverage shifted to the AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease . The ever @-@ breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources with members of the community having to step in to support the work of the Blade . The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today . In June 1988 , the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time . The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade . In April 1993 , during the 1993 Gay March on Washington , the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages . The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade , followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York , called the New York Blade . In the later part of the century , coverage was expanded to include local and national news , as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community . 
 = = = 2001 to present = = = 
 On May 25 , 2001 , the print edition announced the sale of the Washington Blade to Window Media , LLC , a group of gay publications . With the new ownership came several changes to standardize the paper with other Window Media publications , such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades . Shortly after the sale of the paper , staff at the Blade sought a vote to unionize with the help of the Washington @-@ Baltimore Newspaper Guild . The Guild and the staff of the Blade brought a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks over this issue resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20 , 2001 . 
 Beginning in 2005 , the Washington Blade also ran a free news clipping service called the <unk> . This service collected news stories of interest to the LGBT community from a variety of local , state , regional , national , and selected international media sources . The service was generated by the Blades editors and was published on the internet . A feature of the <unk> also allowed it to be syndicated onto other websites using JavaScript . 
 During the 2008 U.S. presidential election , Senator John McCain 's decision to participate in a written interview with the Blade marked the first time a Republican presidential nominee agreed to be interviewed by a gay publication . 
 On November 16 , 2009 , the paper was abruptly shut down because of the financial status of its parent company , Window Media , and its majority shareholder , Avalon Equity Partners . Employees at the Blade were aware of Window Media 's financial troubles , but the timing and total closure of the publication came as a shock to the entire staff . Kevin Naff , editor of the Blade , said employees " found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting for us when we got to work this morning " . Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper , and because the debt @-@ ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication 's finances , the same day the Blade shut down , Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers " We 're all together . Our first meeting for our new venture is tomorrow morning . " Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the Blade had been a " weekly must @-@ read " , and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington 's LGBT community . 
 On November 20 , 2009 , a new venture , supported entirely by volunteering staff ( who consisted of the majority of the Blade 's editorial staff , as well as a few others , at the time of its closing ) , launched with its first issue . Called DC Agenda , no relation to the non @-@ profit organization of the same name , the new venture released the same week as the closing of the Blade . From the placeholder website <unk> : 
 " While we cannot save the name we can certainly save all that was the essence and spirit of our LGBTQ Community 's newspaper of record . The staff of the paper remains united and our mission to enlighten and inform remains steadfast . We will launch a new publication that will bring you what we have always worked to deliver - gay news and information that is critical to our Metro DC LGBTQ Community . " 
 Issues were handed out at Washington , D.C. Metro train stations , and an online copy is available at <unk> It is still unclear if DC Agenda will be a profitable publication . 
 On February 25 , 2010 , DC Agenda acquired the assets of The Washington Blade from the US Bankruptcy Court . Included were the archives , name , trademarks , website , and fixtures from the Washington Blade offices . About a month later on April 26 , 2010 , the DC Agenda publisher announced that the Washington Blade name would return to the masthead of the paper with the DC Agenda becoming the name of the arts and entertainment section . 
 = = Circulation and demographics = = 
 The Washington Blade was published weekly on Fridays with a circulation of 33 @,@ 874 printed copies of each edition . News coverage focuses mainly on global and regional political issues concerning LGBT persons with additional coverage of entertainment and nightlife in the Washington , D.C. area . The masthead of the printed paper includes the slogan " The gay and lesbian weekly of the national capital area since 1969 " and the online masthead proclaims " All the news for your life . And your style . " Distribution of the Blade includes locations throughout the Washington , D.C. area . Additional distribution points are located in Maryland , Virginia , and as far away as Rehoboth Beach , Delaware . The newspaper is primarily distributed through free @-@ standing newspaper boxes on street corners , newspaper racks at Metro stations , and in shops and restaurants . The main competition to the Washington Blade in Washington , D.C. is the weekly newsmagazine , Metro Weekly , and nationally the Bay Area Reporter of San Francisco . For a brief period starting in 1979 , the Blade also had competition from Blacklight , the city 's first African @-@ American gay monthly periodical . Archives of the Washington Blade were maintained at their Washington , D.C. offices and on Microfilm at the Microfilm Reading Room of the Library of Congress , and in the Alternative & Underground Press Collections of <unk> ( formerly called <unk> ) in Ann Arbor , Michigan . The newspaper is a member of the National Newspaper Association , the National Gay Newspaper Guild , and the Associated Press . 
 According to a survey conducted by Simmons Market Research in April 2000 for the Washington Blade , the median age of their readership was forty @-@ one and 85 % of their readers were between the ages of twenty @-@ five and fifty @-@ four years old . 92 % of the readership is employed with 70 % of the readers in professional and managerial jobs . The median income of readers was $ 57 @,@ 200 per year with readers median household income at $ 84 @,@ 000 . Overall , 79 % of the Blade 's readership holds a college degree with 42 % of the readers holding postgraduate degrees . 
 = = Awards = = 
 A series of articles from March 1985 and continuing for five months entitled " When Pretending Stops , " written by Lisa Keen , won local acclaim and awards for the coverage of the slow death of local lawyer Ray <unk> . This series of articles chronicled the impact of AIDS in the gay community and was ground @-@ breaking coverage in Washington . In 1995 , the Washington Blade won a Silver Gavel award from the American Bar Association for a four @-@ part series of articles entitled " Legal Challenges to Anti @-@ Gay Initiatives " which explored the legal consequences of anti @-@ gay ballot initiatives and the constitutional challenges to them . In 2007 , the paper won four Dateline Awards for Excellence in Local Journalism from the Society of Professional Journalists Washington , D.C. , Pro Chapter . 
 = = Criticism and controversy = = 
 Publication of the paper has not been without controversy over the years . The news coverage from the early years to the mid @-@ 1980s was perceived by some as being " white @-@ washed " for its lack of coverage of the gay African @-@ American population located in Washington , D.C. , a city where more than 70 percent of its residents were African @-@ American . This led to the creation of the short @-@ lived publication Blacklight , the city 's first African @-@ American gay monthly periodical in August 1979 , which attempted to compete with the Blade . Coverage of the City Council special election in April 1991 garnered intensive criticism of biased coverage and led to calls for reforming the paper 's editorial board . In 1993 , the Blade and its publishing company threatened to sue the Fairfax County Library over a potential ban on the distribution of the Blade at its branches . Also , the 2001 sale of the Washington Blade to Window Media , LLC led to intense criticism from former employees , editors , and media pundits of the consolidation of so many gay newspapers ' editorial boards into the same company , leading to fears of homogenizing of content and editorial control . A former staff writer has also accused the paper of playing politics through the mandated use of the capitalized version of the word ' Gay ' in order to make a political statement . 
 The newspaper has been accused from time @-@ to @-@ time of forcing public figures out of the closet . This policy of ' outing ' individuals surfaced in 1996 during the debate over the Defense of Marriage Act , when the Blade and The Advocate were going to out Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Mark Foley . Neither publication did out either politician , and both publications later denied ever intending to out the Congressmen . In recent years , these accusations have resurfaced as Kevin Naff , current editor of the Blade , has accused the Washington Post of ' straight @-@ washing ' stories about LGBT individuals . Naff wrote that " When someone is described as ' flamboyant , ' ' eccentric ' or ' a lifelong bachelor , ' we know what ’ s being implied ... Readers of the Washington Post had better hone their gaydar skills , because in story after story , the <unk> behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out . " When asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like the Blade , staff writer Greg <unk> wrote " Why do [ we ] insist on mentioning someone 's sexual orientation at all ? Because we 're a queer paper . " As reported in the Washington Post , former editor Chris Crain summarized the Blade 's editorial reasoning for the ' outings ' by stating that " It is 2004 , not 1954 , and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a ' private fact ' beyond the pale of inquiry . " The Blade , he wrote , " would investigate and report about whether influential Hill aides are gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti @-@ gay members of Congress for whom they work . " A former staff writer of the Washington Blade has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual orientations and has used a blog to register these objections . 
 In July 2005 , Jeff Gannon began writing editorials for the paper . His pieces included criticism of gay blogger John <unk> , who had helped uncover Gannon 's pornographic ads . Editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision , due to Gannon 's history of anti @-@ gay reporting as well as Gannon 's refusal to disclose his sexual orientation . He has said , “ My personal life is a private matter , despite the fact that I have become a public person . ” Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial and claimed the " steady stream of feedback / vitriol " had declined " a little " with each new Gannon article . 
 = Hypnotico = 
 " Hypnotico " is a song recorded by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez for her seventh studio album Love ? ( 2011 ) . It was originally written by RedOne , Lady Gaga , Aliaune " Akon " Thiam , Claude Kelly and Tami Chynn for Chynn 's second studio album Prima Donna in 2007 . RedOne and Akon flew Gaga and Kelly to Los Angeles to write songs for Chynn , with " Hypnotico " becoming the first song of several songs they had written together . The release of Prima Donna was cancelled and " Hypnotico " was thought to be a " lost cause " by its writers . That was until 2011 , when Lopez became interested in recording the song while working with RedOne , following her move to Island Records . 
 Jimmy Joker provided production for Lopez 's version of " Hypnotico " , while her vocals were produced by Kuk Harrell . " Hypnotico " is an up @-@ tempo dance song that contains a " chunky beat " and retro @-@ 1980s synths , with an " old @-@ school feel " . It received generally mixed reviews from music critics , who cited the song to single @-@ worthy . Some critics noticed similarities between " Hypnotico " and other Lady Gaga songs , such as " Poker Face " ( 2008 ) . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 " Hypnotico " was written by RedOne , Lady Gaga , Aliaune " Akon " Thiam , Claude Kelly and Tami Chynn . In 2007 , Gaga and Kelly were working with RedOne in a small recording studio in Queens , New York . Gaga was writing " what would later become " her debut studio album The Fame ( 2008 ) and Kelly was writing songs with RedOne to pitch to other artists . Kelly recalled the events by saying : " We were all friends and often rode the train together to get to the studio " . RedOne began working with Akon , who had signed Chynn to his record label . Akon and RedOne flew Gaga and Kelly to Los Angeles to write songs for Chynn 's second studio album Prima Donna . " Hypnotico " became the first of several songs they had written together . From that trip , according to Kelly , " Akon met , signed and helped launch Lady Gaga 's career " . Kelly credits the trip as also helping to launch his own songwriting career . He states that he and Akon became good friends and writing partners . Akon gave Kelly a CD of working tracks as a basis for composition . From that CD of tracks he wrote songs for Leona Lewis ( " Forgive Me " ) , Whitney Houston ( " Like I Never Left " , " I Got You " ) and Michael Jackson ( " Hold My Hand " ) . According to Kelly , " Hypnotico " is a " symbol of how dreams come true if you work hard , and a constant reminder of how far I 've come . I 'm still extremely grateful for all that I 've achieved " . 
 Chynn recorded " Hypnotico " in early 2008 at a studio in Atlanta , Georgia with Akon and RedOne producing , as part of her 13 @-@ track Prima Donna project initially intended for release in August 2008 . " Hypnotico " was considered as a possible single release for Chynn 's Prima Donna project , the second single after " Frozen " , but after the album was cancelled , Kelly thought the song to be a " lost cause " . The song remained unused by any artist until 2011 , when Lopez became interested in recording it while working with RedOne . Lopez 's version of the song was produced by Jimmy Joker . Her vocals were arranged by RedOne , produced by Kuk Harrell and recorded by Harrell and Josh Gudwin at Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles . Lopez 's vocals were then edited by Harrell and Chris " Tek " O 'Ryan . RedOne provided instruments for the song . The song was later mixed by Trevor Muzzy . 
 While working with RedOne , Lopez insists that he brought the best out of her , crediting this to his Moroccan , Swedish and American heritage . She stated : " He 's awesome . He 's one of the nicest people and has a beautiful spirit . He can create something the whole world will love and that is probably to do with his international background . Some people can do dance , others can do urban or pop , but Nadir does it all and understand what makes a hit on every level " . Lopez and Gaga did not work on the song together in person . According to Lopez , RedOne brought Gaga into the process because they have worked together a lot in the past . She cited the process as being " kind of cool " and that Gaga is a " great songwriter : I don 't just love her lyrics , but also her melodies " .

 " Hypnotico " is an up @-@ tempo dance song that contains a " chunky beat " and retro @-@ 1980s synths , with an " old @-@ school feel " . Categorized as a " synth @-@ heavy record " , the dancehall @-@ tinged track also contains handclaps and " boy @-@ toying , " with syllables and a " <unk> shoutout " , all running at 119 bpm . It opens with Lopez calling out : " All the girls that know they sexy , come on ! " . " They love me for my body / I 'm original sexy , " sings Lopez over the " bombastic bassline " before the chanting chorus kicks in : " All the boys are lovin ' when we do our thing / We just some silly <unk> tonight " . 
 DJ Shane Phoenix considered " Hypnotico " to be a " dub @-@ style track " . He wrote that it " has some great breaks " , a " serious electro key line " , and he thought the repetitive bassline would be good for dancing . According to Emily Exton of Popdust , the song 's " light and catchy " chorus " declares herself just one among a group of innocent flirts " ; it allows Lopez to showcase " some range " and provides a nice counter to the " repetitive , staccato breakdown of the song ’ s title that precedes it " . Exton also pointed out that " <unk> @-@ not , <unk> @-@ not @-@ <unk> " is almost identical to " On the Floor " ' s " up on the floor , up on the floor " . <unk> McFarlane from <unk> named the song as " euphoric " , adding that it was a " true club track .

 " Hypnotico " received generally mixed reviews from music critics . Several journalists noted the similarities between the song and other Gaga works , with Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly stating that it sounded like " a watered down version of ' Poker Face ' " and Scott Shetler of PopCrush elaborating that " like many of [ Lady ] Gaga 's songs " , it is " likely to stick in your head long after the song has ended " . Allison Stewart from The Washington Post further expanded on this view , stating that " without the slightest hint of noblesse oblige " to Gaga , " Hypnotico " is a synthy , " <unk> slip " of a song . Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy stated that the song seems to continue right where Lopez 's 1999 hit single " Waiting for Tonight " left off , " making us want to put on our short shorts and dance " . In addition , he concluded that " The thump that rides the song 's undercurrent of ethereal echoes and a group chant of the chorus is a pretty solid reminder that this is most definitely a Gaga jam , which quickly gained J. Lo 's approval " . Amos Barshad of Vulture showcased his displeasure with the song , elaborating that although " you can sort of tell " that Gaga wrote the song , that was not an indication that it would become an instant hit , casting it as " Bland and half @-@ baked " , and concluding that " it was certainly farmed out for a reason " . 
 Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a positive review of the song , stating that " the girls are going to love the lyrics . It brings total sex appeal and groove that starts the hips swinging and is so meant to break the set into a dark drive and into sensual exploration of a grind close contact dance rhythm " . Rich Lopez of the Dallas Voice cited the song as being one of the " better " songs of Love ? and was surprised it had " yet to be released as a single " . Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly complimented the potential of the song by stating that it is " sure to fit right into club DJ mixes and get people dancing " ; however , he criticized that Gaga was " all over the song ... as if Lopez went into the booth trying to emulate her delivery . " Emily Exton of Popdust agreed , adding that " you 'd be silly not to think " that the song 's chorus will become a dance @-@ floor chant among " slightly intoxicated females ( and males ) in bars across America this summer " . She additionally wrote that it was " impossible to get [ the song ] out of your head after more than one listen " although becoming " increasingly monotonous over nearly three and half minutes " Digital Spy 's Robert Copsey roughly expanded on this view , stating that " Hypnotico " is not anything " we haven 't heard before , " although elaborating that it is worthy of a standalone release . 
 Katie Hasty of HitFix was not impressed by the lyrical potential of the song , stating that with lines like " sunburned baby / hurts like crazy , " " we 're just some silly <unk> tonight " and rhyming " yum yum " with " some some " won 't get this song " very good scores on the SAT " . She concluded by stating that : " In fact , it seems that Lopez goes out of her way to sing with a little @-@ girl inflection to her 41 @-@ year @-@ old pipes . But it comes off youthful , upbeat , and a little lighter than the single [ ' On the Floor ' ] and her island @-@ inflected collaboration with Lil Wayne , ' I 'm Into You ' . " Amos Barshad of Vulture questioned Lopez ' music , stating that " with the other facets of her multimedia empire clicking [ ... ] why does she insist on continuing to make music ? Why not sit back , relax , and enjoy the fact that there is something that you do that people like ? [ ... ] Well , one can only assume , Jennifer Lopez keeps making music because Jennifer Lopez actually loves making music . And that 's admirable " .

 = Si Tjonat = 
 Si Tjonat ( Perfected Spelling : Si <unk> ) is a likely @-@ lost 1929 bandit film from the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) directed by Nelson Wong and produced by Wong and Jo Eng Sek . Based on the novel by <unk> <unk> , the silent film followed an indigenous man who , having killed his fellow villager , flees to Batavia ( today Jakarta ) and becomes a bandit . After kidnapping an ethnic Chinese woman , he is defeated and brought to justice . 
 A commercially oriented work aimed at ethnic Chinese audiences , Si Tjonat received mixed reviews ; box office proceeds are unclear . Although intended as a serial , no sequel was ever made ; the production house , Batavia Motion Picture , closed soon afterwards . However , several works in the same genre as this one were released soon afterwards , including Si Pitoeng , which used the same director and star . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Tjonat , a Sundanese youth , kills his friend and escapes to Batavia ( now Jakarta ) , the capital of the Dutch East Indies , where he finds work with a Dutch man . Tjonat soon robs the man of his wealth and seduces his mistress ( njai ) , then leaves the household to live the life of a bandit . When he asks Lie Gouw Nio ( Ku Fung May ) , the daughter of a peranakan Chinese farmer named Lie A <unk> , to be his lover , she refuses . Enraged , Tjonat kidnaps her , but Lie is rescued by her fiancé , Thio Sing Sang ( Herman Sim ) , who is well @-@ trained in martial arts . 
 = = Production = = 
 Si Tjonat was directed by Nelson Wong , who produced the film in conjunction with his business partner Jo Eng Sek . The two had established Batavia Motion Picture in 1929 . Wong had previously directed a single fiction film , the commercial flop Lily van Java ( 1928 ) , with funding from a high @-@ ranking General Motors employee in Batavia named David Wong . Jo Eng Sek , a shop owner , had never produced a film . 
 The story for Si Tjonat was based on the novel Tjerita Si Tjonat , written by reporter <unk> <unk> and first published in 1900 . The story had proved popular with ethnic Chinese readers . It was often adapted to the stage by Betawi stage troupes as a lenong stage performance . The story was selected by Jo Eng Sek . Several changes were introduced to the story . For instance , in the novel Lie A <unk> was a poor farmer , whereas in the film he was wealthy . Lie Gouw Nio , meanwhile , was not depicted as a poor Chinese woman , but the " a modern girl , dressed in a skirt , shoes , socks , and bobbed hair " . 
 The silent film was shot in black @-@ and @-@ white and starred Ku Fung May and Herman Sim . Sim , of peranakan Chinese descent , had previously acted in Shanghai , while Ku Fung May had no film experience . The martial arts sequences used in the film were inspired by Hollywood Westerns , then popular in the Indies . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Si Tjonat was released in 1929 . Although a work of fiction , it was advertised as based on a true story ; this had been common in works of Malay literature at the turn of the 20th century , including Tjerita Si Tjonat . The film was one in a line of domestic production targeted primarily at ethnic Chinese audiences , following Lily van Java and <unk> <unk> Darah ( both 1928 ) ; film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that this was evident from the predominantly Chinese production team and cast . Native audiences also enjoyed the film , particularly its action sequences . Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes that it was of distinctly commercial orientation , meant only to turn a profit . 
 Sales figures are unclear . Said writes that it was a commercial success , while Biran – noting that Batavia Motion Picture was dissolved not long after Si Tjonat 's release – suggests that returns were poor . Reviews were mixed . In general the press criticised the emphasis on murder and crime , while in Panorama magazine , Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that the film had been " fairly well produced " , emphasising Sim 's acting – particularly his martial arts skills . Kwee concluded that what few mistakes were found in the film were , ultimately , insignificant . 
 Although Si Tjonat was initially intended to be a serial , production of the second instalment halted after the closure of Batavia Motion Picture . Jo Eng Sek left the industry completely , only returning in 1935 to produce Poei Sie Giok Pa Loei Tay . Wong , meanwhile , remained active in the cinema together with his brothers Joshua and Othniel . Using the banner Halimoen Film they later cast Sim in their 1931 film Si Pitoeng . Ku Fung May did not act in another film . Several films centred on bandits , including Lie Tek Swie 's Si Ronda ( 1930 ) and the Wongs ' <unk> Preanger ( 1929 ) and Si Pitoeng ( 1931 ) , followed soon after Si Tjonat . 
 Si Tjonat is likely a lost film . The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , J.B. Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

 = Wood Badge ( Boy Scouts of America ) = 
 Wood Badge in the United States of America is the highest level of adult Scout leader training available . It was first presented in England by the founder of Scouting , Baden Powell , and he introduced the program into the United States during a visit in 1936 . The first course was held at the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation , but Americans did not fully adopt Wood Badge until 1948 . The National BSA Council staff provided direct leadership to the program through 1958 , when the increased demand encouraged them to permit local councils to deliver the training . 
 The program originally focused almost exclusively on Scoutcraft skills , some elements of the Patrol Method , and First Class Boy Scout requirements . In a major cultural shift during the 1970s , Wood Badge was modified to train Scouters in eleven specific leadership competencies . The National Council has updated it several times since then , and during 2001 – 2002 implemented an overhaul that emphasized a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership and problem @-@ solving skills . The training is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and a short outdoor camping experience . It is a key element of the overall leadership training program . 
 = = Course slowly adopted by U.S. Scouters = = 
 Francis Gidney , the first camp chief of Gilwell Park , came to the United States in 1922 at the instigation of Walter W. Head , a member of the Boy Scouts of America National Board , and later its President . While Gidney demonstrated some of the Scoutcraft tricks from Gilwell , his ideas did not arouse interest , but were treated as entertainment by the American audience . A number of American Scouters later traveled to England and took the British Wood Badge course . These included assistant director of Volunteer Training Gunnar Berg and assistant director of camping William C. Wessel . Though the national training department approved a " <unk> Training Camp " to be held at Camp Parsons in 1929 ( conducted by John A. Stiles , the Chief Scout Executive of Canada ) , the prevailing attitude of the Boy Scouts of America was that American men would not set aside eight days from their busy lives to attend the course . 
 = = = Shift away from the British course = = = 
 In 1935 , BSA President Walter W. Head attended the eighth International Boy Scout Conference in Stockholm , Sweden . He met with James E. West , Scouting 's founder Baden Powell , and his aide , Gilwell Park 's second camp chief John Skinner Wilson . Wilson was persuaded to visit the United States during 1936 and spend three months teaching others about Wood Badge . During May 1936 , he conducted two Wood Badge courses at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation . Wilson had been told to " follow the book " as it was done in England , which he faithfully did , including the English menu with dishes like boiled leg of lamb and boiled ham . Wilson had a reputation as a " dour Scot " and he brooked no discussion during his course . William Hillcourt was a participant in that first course and four days later , he was the senior patrol leader for the second course . He received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 and was appointed as the deputy camp director for Wood Badge . 
 Some American Scouters chafed under Wilson 's authoritarian attitude . They found the course much too restrictive , demanding , and altogether too " British . " They felt the course would not work in the United States and recommended to the National Council that the program should not be adopted , which was followed . Before further experimentation could be implemented , World War II interrupted any ideas of men taking time off for Scouting . 
 = = = Adapted for American training = = = 
 After the war ended , new Gilwell Park camp chief John Thurman was interested in persuading the Boy Scouts of America to adapt Wood Badge . The new Chief Scout Executive Elbert K. <unk> was an educator and training enthusiast . He was convinced to allow a few members of the Program Division and Volunteer Training Service to try a new National Wood Badge Course . Four national staff members were given the responsibility : Frank W. Braden ( assistant director of the Program Division and national coordinator of Training ) , William E. Lawrence ( director of the Boy Scouting Service ) , Joseph M Thomas ( assistant director of Volunteer Training ) , and William " Green Bar Bill " Hillcourt ( national director of Scoutcraft ) . 
 Hillcourt had received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 , making him the only national staff member eligible to serve as course Scoutmaster . He was appointed " Deputy Camp Chief of the United States . " The four men elected to include in the course all of the recently updated basic Boy Scout requirements for Tenderfoot to First Class , along with information on patrol work covered in the Handbook for Patrol Leaders ( authored by Hillcourt ) and troop organization and activities described in the Handbook for Scoutmasters ( also written by Hillcourt ) . 
 They added American touches to the course . They used the names of American birds for patrol names ; challenged patrols to make their own flags instead of using store @-@ bought flags ; introduced patrol totems and signatures ; and added singing Back to Gilwell when each patrol 's name was mentioned . Each member took turns as the patrol leader , and they met daily as the Patrol Leaders Council to conduct daily inspections . The staff taught course attendees basic Scout requirements and how to handle the U.S. flag . The patrols took an unsupervised patrol hike and overnight camp . Other American features included a program and a service patrol , a cracker barrel after each evening 's event , a feast , and other ceremonies . The first course , begun on July 31 , 1948 , was attended by 29 men from 12 states . Although it rained on four of the nine days , the Scouters were excited by the experience and enthusiastic about sharing it with others . 
 = = = New course tested = = = 
 Later in 1948 , six courses were led by members of the national BSA staff , with one at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation and another at Philmont Scout Ranch . Scouters were enthusiastic about the new course . " Perhaps the finest experience we have had in 35 years of Scouting was attending the Wood Badge course in New Mexico ... Any man who lived nine days in a Gilwell Troop would know how a troop is operated . " The new Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of America , Arthur A. Schuck , was a training enthusiast . He felt Wood Badge would be a great opportunity to train selected men who could return to their local councils and train others . Schuck was so enthusiastic about the Wood Badge course that he was responsible for sending invitations using his signature from his office to every participant . 
 = = = National council presents program = = = 
 From 1948 through 1958 , Wood Badge was presented exclusively by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America . In 1955 , John Thurman , the Camp Chief of Gilwell , toured a number of U.S. Wood Badge courses . His assessment and comments helped to continue to improve the program on both the national and local council levels . Attendees from local councils were carefully screened , needing the " unqualified endorsement of the Council 's Leadership Training Committee and the Scout Executive . " The first Cub Scout Wood Badge beads awarded to a woman were given to <unk> T. Weir in 1957 . Her husband , Rev. Thomas E. Weir , had already received his beads , which made them the first American couple to both receive Wood Badge beads . 
 Through 1958 , over 6000 individuals took Wood Badge and its popularity continued to expand . Local councils agitated for the opportunity to run their own Wood Badge courses . In 1953 , the first council @-@ run program was hosted by the Cincinnati Area ( later Dan Beard ) Council . Qualified local councils continued to provide advanced leadership training to Scoutmasters and other Scout leaders using Wood Badge . Two or more councils are allowed to join together to present Wood Badge with regional approval . 
 In the 1970s , the National Council moved its headquarters from North Brunswick , New Jersey to Irving , Texas , and the national training center from Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation to the Philmont Training Center . However , the majority of Wood Badge courses are held throughout the country at local council camps under the auspices of each BSA region .

 The Wood Badge program originally focused exclusively on teaching Scoutcraft skills , the Patrol Method and First Class Scouting requirements . 
 = = = White Stag program draws national attention = = = 
 Beginning in the 1950s , Béla H. Bánáthy , Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council , formulated the idea of an experimental leadership training program . He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology , the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree , which Bela had attended when he was 14 years old . With the active interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board , Bela continually improved his experimental program . In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela . They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention . In November 1963 , Dr. John W. Larson , a staff researcher for the National Council , observed the program 's annual <unk> at the Presidio of Monterey . Impressed with what he witnessed , he recommended that the national office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program . 
 During a thorough study , the national BSA staff interviewed participants , parents , and leaders . They distributed questionnaires to program participants , reviewed the White Stag literature , and observed the program in action . They also conducted a statistical analysis of troops taking part in White Stag and compared them to non @-@ participating units . In December 1965 , Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton received the White Stag Report . It stated that offering leadership development to youth was a unique opportunity for Scouting to provide a practical benefit to youth and would add substantial support to Scouting 's character development goals . It recommended that Wood Badge should be used to experiment with the leadership development principles of White Stag . The program had until this time taught the adults the same Scoutcraft skills a boy was required to learn to become a First Class Scout along with concepts of the patrol method . 
 = = = Focus shifts to leadership skills = = = 
 In February 1966 , Brunton appointed seven men to a National task force to lead the effort : Robert L. Calvert , head of the BSA Education Division , was chair of the committee composed of A. Warren Holm , John Larson , William E. Lawrence , Ben H. Love , Kenneth Wells , and Joseph W. Wyckoff . Their plan identified Wood Badge and senior patrol leader training as the best opportunities for providing leadership education within the BSA . Their report recommended that the National Council develop an experimental Wood Badge program as soon as possible to be tested at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation , to be followed by further testing in selected local councils . 
 In January 1967 , John Larson , along with Bob Perin , Assistant National Director of Volunteer Training , were tasked with working with Dr. Bánáthy to write a new Wood Badge staff guide focusing on the White Stag leadership competencies . 
 = = = Resistance to change = = = 
 Shifting from teaching primarily camping skills to leadership competencies was a paradigm shift . It required rethinking the underlying assumptions , concepts , practices , and values guiding how adults were trained as Scout leaders . Some individuals on the national staff and many volunteers across the nation resisted the idea of changing the focus of Wood Badge from training leaders in Scout craft to leadership skills . Among them was Bill Hillcourt , who had been the first United States Wood Badge Course Director in 1948 . He remained loyal to the idea that Wood Badge should teach Scoutcraft skills . Although he had officially retired on August 1 , 1965 , his opinion was still sought after and respected . 
 Larson later reported , " He fought us all the way ... He had a vested interest in what had been and resisted every change . I just told him to settle down , everything was going to be all right . " Hillcourt presented an alternative to Larson 's plan to incorporate leadership into Wood Badge . Chief Scout Brunton asked Larson to look at Hillcourt 's plan , and Larson reported back that it was the same camping @-@ oriented skills content , just reordered and rewritten . Larson 's plan for Wood Badge was approved and he moved ahead to begin testing the proposed changes . 
 = = = Pilot tests conducted = = = 
 In May 1967 , participants from six councils met at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation in New Jersey to train to prepare the new course and follow @-@ on courses . The first laboratory test was during June 1967 . Participants from five councils delivered the June course and follow @-@ on council courses . The councils represented were Del @-@ Mar @-@ Va Council in Wilmington , Delaware ; Baltimore Area Council in Baltimore , Maryland ; Valley Forge Council in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ; Onondaga Council in Syracuse , New York ; and the National Capital Area Council in Washington , D.C. 
 A second experimental course was held at Philmont in New Mexico beginning on June 17 , 1967 . Bob Perin was Scoutmaster , Louis Adin of the Circle Ten Council in Dallas was senior patrol leader , and John Larson was assistant senior patrol leader . Participants were primarily from the councils who would conduct the next step in laboratory @-@ testing the new program . One month later , on July 18 , the Circle Ten Council presented its first new Wood Badge program at Philmont , while Bob Perin and John Larson watched from the sidelines . 
 In September 1967 , after the program was revised , William E. Lawrence , director of the Volunteer Training Service , named six councils who would pilot @-@ test the next phase of the experimental Wood Badge courses during 1968 . The councils and Course Directors were : Monterey Bay Area Council , Béla H. Bánáthy ; Piedmont Council , Don Crawford ; Middle Tennessee Council , Jimmy Stevens ; Del @-@ Mar @-@ Va Council , Bill Whisler ; Hiawatha Seaway Council , Carson Buck ; and the Circle Ten Council , Louis Adin . 
 = = = Leaders and boys both trained = = = 
 In the Monterey Bay Area Council , Bánáthy implemented a unique approach to training both the adults and the boys . During 1967 , he recruited a select group of young men and their leaders from troops in the Monterey Bay Area . The individuals were chosen to pilot @-@ test teaching both adult leaders and their Scouts in sequence . In an application not since reproduced , all Wood Badge attendees were also asked to bring their troop to a single week of White Stag summer camp in August . 
 The leaders attended Wood Badge at Fort Ord , California over four weekends during January and February 1968 . Joe St. Clair served as Scoutmaster , Bánáthy was course director , and Fran Petersen was Senior Patrol Leader . John Larson , who had become National Director of Education , was also present . The following August , boys from the troops of the Scoutmasters who attended Wood Badge went to the White Stag Leadership Development Program summer camp . Many of the Wood Badge staff were also present during summer camp so they could follow up on the Wood Badge participant 's tickets and their application of the leadership skills learned at Wood Badge . During the summer camp , John Larson held a day @-@ long leadership symposium for all of the youth and adults . 
 = = = Experiment includes junior leader training = = = 
 The results were promising and John Larson was appointed Director of Leadership Development . He was charged with continuing support for the experiment . During 1969 , Gene Rutherford of the Circle Ten Council along with the Course Directors from the pilot programs — Crawford , Stevens , Whisler and Carl Marlowe of the Hiawatha Councils — were charged with evaluating the project . They continued pilot @-@ testing and experimenting with the program for three more years , through 1972 . They also began developing an experimental junior leader training program that utilized the White Stag competencies . 
 The Boy Scouts also obtained funding that year from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to evaluate the results of the unique experiment in leadership development by design . The grant underwrote continued testing of the junior leader instructor training program at the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico and the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation in New Jersey . 
 The junior leader training program was developed and named Troop Leader Development when it was published in 1974 . In 1991 , it was revised and rechristened Troop Leader Training Conference , and then in 1994 Junior Leader Training Conference . It was substantially revised and renamed again in 2004 as National Youth Leadership Training . 
 = = = National pilot @-@ tests begun = = = 
 The Wood Badge course was pilot @-@ tested still further in 1971 at Philmont , the five test councils , and in every national region excepting Region 8 . In 1972 , after five long years of testing and experimentation , the official new Wood Badge Staff Guide was published . The program was mandated for nationwide implementation and included for the first time teaching leadership skills over Scoutcraft skills . 
 An experimental Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge was field tested in 1976 . In 1978 the National Council decided in a half @-@ step backwards that Wood Badge needed to place greater emphasis on the practical aspects of good troop operation along with a variety of leadership exercises . Wood Badge was adopted as the official advanced training program for adult Cub Scout Leaders . The modified course blended Scoutcraft skills and troop management practices along with scaled @-@ down content about the leadership competencies . 
 = = = More recent modifications = = = 
 In 1994 , the National Council revised the course content again to add key concepts based on Ethics in Action which had been added to Boy Scout training and literature . The leadership competencies remained an essential part of Wood Badge until 1998 , when the National Council revised it again to use the unit meeting and a troop camping activity as a delivery model . This new version , re @-@ titled Wood Badge for the 21st Century , was initially revised to include principles of Situational Leadership . However , the Center for Leadership Studies , which owns the trademark for Situational Leadership , required the Boy Scouts to pay royalties for each Scouter attending Wood Badge nationwide . The Wood Badge Task Force decided to describe how groups change and evolve using more generic , non @-@ trademarked language free of royalties . The program emphasized the stages of team development based on the principles described by Bruce <unk> in 1965 as forming @-@ storming @-@ norming @-@ performing . 
 On January 1 , 2002 , the National Council required all councils to implement the updated Wood Badge for the 21st Century program which removed much of the Boy Scout @-@ specific information from the program . This allowed the National Council to designate Wood Badge as the advanced leadership training program for Cub Scout , Boy Scout , Varsity Scout , Venturing , council leaders , district leaders , and professional staff . It replaced both Boy Scout Leader Wood Badge and Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge . Unlike the prior Wood Badge course which was conducted entirely outdoors , the modified Wood Badge program is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and in a short outdoor camping experience . Participants spend the first three days in a classroom setting , and the last three days camping . Teaching aids include VCRs , laptop computers , and video projectors . Session titles include Leading Change , Problem Solving , <unk> People and Leveraging Diversity , Managing Conflict , and Coaching and Mentoring . At the conclusion of the course , the participants are presented a multimedia presentation titled " Leaving a Legacy . " It includes inspirational excerpts from the movie Mr. Holland 's Opus and from a John Prine song Hello in There , sung by Bette Midler . 
 Thus Wood Badge for the 21st Century , at one time based on eleven leadership competencies adapted from White Stag Leadership Development during the 1960s and 1970s , was 30 years later updated , given the 21st century imprint , yet still based on generic group leadership concepts from the 1960s . 
 = = Course effectiveness = = 
 During the 1960s and 1970s , the Boy Scouts spent more than five years studying the White Stag program before implementing a version of the program that included adaptations of the eleven competencies , but excluded the program 's symbolism , spirit and traditions . All subsequent revisions have been implemented in two years or less . The actual usefulness and practical effect of Wood Badge training in the United States has never been measured . The Boy Scouts of America wrote in its A History of Wood Badge in the United States that : 
 It should be stated at the start that there is no objective evidence that Wood Badge improved leadership in Scouting . The Boy Scouts of America has never undertaken to statistically validate the impact of Wood Badge by conducting before and after tests , or by comparing Wood Badge Scouters with Scouters who are not Wood Badge trained .

 The Winchester Model 1200 was introduced in 1964 as a low @-@ cost replacement for the venerable Model 12 . A small number of these weapons were acquired by the United States Army in 1968 and 1969 . The military style Model 1200 was essentially the same weapon as the civilian version , except it had a ventilated handguard , sling swivels , and a bayonet lug . The Model 1200 was succeeded by the Winchester Model 1300 in 1983 when U.S. Repeating Arms Company became the manufacturer of Winchester firearms . Production of the Model 1300 ceased in 2006 , when <unk> went bankrupt .

 The Winchester Model 1200 came in barrel lengths of 30 @-@ inch , and 28 @-@ inch with a fixed choke or the Win @-@ choke screw in choke tubes system and is a 12 , 16 , or 20 @-@ gauge , manually operated , slide action shotgun . The slide action , also known as a pump @-@ action , means that the shotgun has a moving bolt system which is operated by a " wooden or composite slide called the fore @-@ end " . The fore @-@ end is located on the underside of the barrel and moves front to back . The weapon can hold a maximum of five rounds total with four in the tubular magazine and one in the chamber . It has a hammerless action which means that there is no external hammer spur . There is only a firing pin which strikes the primer on the shell to ignite the powder in the round . 
 The Model 1200 was the first shotgun to utilize a rotary bolt with four locking lugs secured within the barrel extension . The 1200 was Winchester 's first shotgun to incorporate the company 's patented <unk> system , a quick change tube to allow the easy replacement of chokes . 
 = = Bayonet = = 
 A bayonet could be attached to the front end of the barrel of the Military version of the Model 1200 . The primary uses of the bayonet on the model 1200 are for close combat , guarding prisoners , and riot duty . The most commonly used bayonet with the Model 1200 was the M1917 bayonet . After World War I ended , there was a large surplus of the M @-@ 1917 bayonets because the Army decided to keep the <unk> Springfield as the standard issued rifle . The M @-@ 1917 bayonet did not fit the Springfield rifles so instead of just getting rid of them , the Army decided to make newer shotguns compatible with the bayonets . Model 1200 shotguns with bayonet lugs and ventilation ribs were still in U.S. Army inventories as late as the invasion of Iraq 2003 . During the Iraq war the Model 1200 shotguns were phased out in favor of <unk> 500 shotguns .

 Aaron Saxton ( born 1974 ) is a former Scientologist and member of the organisation 's elite group called the Sea Org . He contacted Senator Nick Xenophon of Australia , who quoted statements by Saxton about Scientology into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate in November 2009 . That speech caused a furor according to the The Courier @-@ Mail , The New Zealand Herald and other media .

 A New Zealander , Aaron Saxton 's parents were Scientologists . Saxton 's father committed suicide when he was 14 , and this had a significant impact on him . At age 15 he joined the Scientology group called the Sea Org , an elite unit within the organisation . After joining Scientology staff , Saxton moved to work with the organisation in Sydney , Australia . Saxton 's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old . Saxton was assigned to become a security officer for the organisation . According to Saxton staff in Scientology were not given sufficient drugs or medical attention , and so he removed his own teeth without usage of medication for pain . 
 Saxton received influential positions within the organisation , both in Sydney and the United States . Senator Nick Xenophon stated that Saxton " rose to a position of influence in Sydney and the United States " within Scientology . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Saxton " rose to a senior level " within the Sea Org , 3 News characterised the Sea Org as " Scientology 's senior management " . The Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of The Village Voice reported that Saxton served as " one of the Sea Org 's ruthless enforcers during the 1990s " . In their book Cults and New Religions , Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley describe the Sea Org writing , " Described by the Church as ' a fraternal religious order , ' members of the Sea Org ' occupy the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy ' . " Rolling Stone wrote , " Sea Org members staff all of the senior ecclesiastic positions in the church hierarchy " . In 2010 , there were 5 @,@ 000 members in the Sea Org . 
 Between 1989 and 1996 , Saxton worked for the Church of Scientology of Australia , as well as at the headquarters of Scientology in the U.S. In 1991 , Saxton was assigned to work at Scientology facilities in Florida . While in the Sea Org , Saxton spent the majority of his time assigned to Scientology facilities in Los Angeles . While in Los Angeles , Saxton worked at the division of International Management for Scientology . He also functioned within the organisation as an Ethics Officer , and worked out of the Communications Office . 
 In this role , Saxton learned policies relating to Scientology 's Flag Organization and its Office of Special Affairs . While a member of the Commodore 's Messenger Organization ( CMO ) , Saxton tried to make sure those under his supervision had adequate nourishment . As a recruiter for the CMO , Saxton tried to get Scientologists between ages 13 to 14 to join the organisation . Saxton left Scientology in 2006 . He came to question why he had done some of the actions within the Sea Org that he later came to regret . He felt ashamed for what he had witnessed , as well as the part he played in controversial acts in the organisation .

 In 2009 , Saxton lived in Perth , Australia , and worked as an information technology contractor . He contacted Senator Nick Xenophon of Australia , who read statements by Saxton about Scientology into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate . In a November 2009 speech , Xenophon said , " Aaron has now left the organisation and is willing to cooperate with police investigations into these matters . " Senator Xenophon characterised Saxton as a " victim " of Scientology that had written to him about the organisation . Saxton 's statement was tabled in Australian parliament . 
 Xenophon said , " In his statement Aaron also says he was forced to participate in the illegal confinement and torture of a follower who was kept under house arrest . ... He says while under control of Scientology he was involved in coercing female followers to have abortions ( because ) ... this was in line with a policy designed to keep followers loyal to the organisation and to allow them to keep working for the organisation . " He read into the record , " Aaron says women who fell pregnant were taken to offices and bullied to have an abortion . If they refused , they faced demotion and hard labour ... Aaron says one staff member used a coat @-@ hanger and self @-@ aborted her child for fear of punishment . He says she was released from the organisation and the files were destroyed . " Saxton said that while a member of the Scientology organisation , he had participated in actions including torture and blackmail . He stated that Scientology members deemed to be underperforming in their tasks were ordered to eat rations of beans and rice . 
 According to Xenophon , Saxton said he had participated in the " forced confinement and torture " of a woman in Scientology who had been relocated to a rural area in New South Wales . Senator Xenophon stated Saxton was , " ordered by superiors to remove documents that would link a Scientology staff member to murder " . While an official for Scientology , Xenophon stated Saxton had " ordered more than 30 people to be sent to Scientology 's work camps , where they were forced to undertake hard labour " . While in the organisation , Saxton had access to Auditing files on celebrity Scientologists , and he was later critical of the way information from these files could be used as leverage . 
 In response to the statements by former Scientologists read into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate by Senator Xenophon , the Australian PM Kevin Rudd said he would ponder opening an inquiry into Scientology . The Prime Minister called the concerns raised in the statements by former Scientologists including Saxton " grave " , and stated , " Many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology . I share some of those concerns . But let us proceed carefully , and look carefully at the material which he has provided , before we make a decision on further parliamentary action . " Senator Xenophon said that Saxton had been in touch with the office of the Prime Minister , and had offered to provide additional statements and testimony regarding the assertions made in the Australian Senate . In March 2010 , Xenophon 's call for an inquiry was " overwhelmingly rejected " by the Australian Senate , the senators voting 33 to 6 against , with 37 abstentions . 
 = = = = Scientology response = = = = 
 Scientology in November 2009 said that Saxton 's letter to Senator Xenophon was not reliable . The Church of Scientology released a statement in 2009 referring to Saxton as " a mean hateful young man " . The head of Scientology in New Zealand , Mike Ferriss , characterised Saxton as a " nutter " and a " consummate liar " . In a statement given by Ferriss to Campbell Live , he said , " There are no forced abortions in Scientology and if Aaron Saxton or anyone else coerced someone into having an abortion then they are way outside of the Church 's policy and ethical conduct . " 
 In February 2010 , Scientologist Sue Hunt tried to get an <unk> Violence Order ( AVO ) filed against Saxton . Hunt said Saxton had banged on her car window during a protest against Scientology . Saxton said that he did not know the individual . According to Today Tonight , " Scientologist Sue Hunt completed a course called ' PTS / SP ' . This course is designed to teach Scientologists how to attack , intimidate , harass , even lie about anyone or any group that criticises Scientology . " Saxton said that the AVO was an attempt to suppress his right to freedom of speech . Magistrate Paul Falzon questioned the legitimacy of Hunt 's assertions , and said the court would require demonstration of " reasonable apprehension " of a threatening or violent action . " Have you seen what happens to Nicole Kidman ? " , queried the Magistrate regarding Hunt 's assertions . 
 Senator Xenophon spoke out critically about Scientology 's actions against Saxton , and referenced the practice of Fair Game . " Since Aaron has spoken out he says he 's been harassed at work , his mother 's been visited by private investigators , he 's been getting a number of unexplained phone calls to his private number and you 've got to ask the question has this got anything to do with the Scientology doctrine of Fair Game ? Let me just quote you what L Ron Hubbard said about it . He said Scientology critics can be tricked , sued or lied to or destroyed . They are the words of the founder of Scientology , " said Senator Xenophon .

 The Courier @-@ Mail called Saxton a whistleblower against Scientology , and 3 News said that Saxton 's " whistleblowing about the Church has made it all the way to the Australian Parliament " . The New Zealand Herald described the statements given to Senator Xenophon by Saxton as " at the centre " of the Senator 's speech in the Australian Senate criticising Scientology . The New Zealand Herald commented , " Saxton 's allegations about behind @-@ the @-@ scenes church activities caused an uproar after they were quoted in the Australian Senate " , and reported that Saxton 's statements " formed part of a blistering attack in the Australian Senate " . The Australian current affairs program , produced by the Seven Network , Today Tonight , described Saxton 's revelations as " shocking " . Today Tonight commented , " He joined a group of former Scientologists in revealing stunning , shocking claims of abuse , tabled by federal independent Senator Nick Xenophon . " The Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of The Village Voice stated that Saxton 's statements comprised " some of the most cited after Xenophon 's speech " , and commented , " Saxton 's profile in Australia blew up overnight after Xenophon 's speech , and his story quickly became familiar there " . 
 = RaLa Experiment = 
 The RaLa Experiment , or RaLa , was a series of tests during and after the Manhattan Project designed to study the behavior of converging shock waves to achieve the spherical implosion necessary for compression of the plutonium pit of the nuclear weapon . The experiment used significant amounts of a short @-@ lived radioisotope lanthanum @-@ 140 , a potent source of gamma radiation ; the RaLa is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum . The method was proposed by Robert Serber and developed by a team led by the Italian experimental physicist Bruno Rossi . 
 The tests were performed with 1 / 8 inch ( 3 @.@ 2 mm ) spheres of radioactive lanthanum , equal to about 100 curies ( 3 @.@ 7 TBq ) and later 1 @,@ 000 Ci ( 37 TBq ) , located in the center of a simulated nuclear device . The explosive lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests . Some 254 tests were conducted between September 1944 and March 1962 . In his history of the Los Alamos project , David Hawkins wrote : “ RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design ” . 
 = = Experimental setup = = 
 The experiment was suggested on 1 November 1943 by Robert Serber . The idea was to measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere . The test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression . The gamma ray source was located in the center of a metal sphere . The increase of thickness ( of hollow shells ) and density ( of solid spheres ) as the compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of gamma rays outside of the sphere ; the lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough to interfere with the experiment . The gamma rays had to be intense and of the right energy . Too low energy , and they would be fully absorbed in the surrounding metal ; too high energy and the difference of attenuation during the implosion would be too low to be practical . The detectors had to provide high speed and large area ; fast ionization chambers , then under development , were the only devices then available satisfying the requirements . 
 Lanthanum @-@ 140 was chosen for having the right emitted gamma ray energy ( 1 @.@ 60 megaelectronvolts ( MeV ) , with fraction of 0 @.@ 49 MeV ) and a sufficient radiation intensity to provide satisfying signal from the ionization chambers , combined with a rapid radioactive decay into stable Cerium @-@ 140 ( reducing the radiation hazard for the operators after a period of several half lives ) . It was also potentially available in larger quantities because its parent nuclide barium @-@ 140 is an abundant fission product of uranium . As a consequence , Lanthanum @-@ 140 samples contained small amounts of barium @-@ 140 , caesium @-@ 140 , and especially strontium @-@ 90 , which still presents a radioactive contamination problem in the area of the tests . Lanthanum @-@ 140 has a specific activity of 5 @.@ 57 × 105 Ci / g ( 20 @.@ 6 PBq / g ) ; a 1 @,@ 000 Ci ( 37 TBq ) La @-@ 140 source therefore equals about 1 @.@ 8 mg of lanthanum . 
 A radiolanthanum sample , precipitated in a tip of a small cone , followed by a plug , was lowered into the center of the metal sphere of the experimental assembly with a device resembling a fishing rod . The cone and the plug were mated to the metal center of the assembly , together forming a metal sphere . A section of the explosive lensing was then returned to its place above the sphere . Several , typically four , ionization chambers were located around the experimental setup . Immediately after the detonation they generated signals that were displayed on <unk> in a blast @-@ proof shelter or a mobile laboratory in a tank , 150 feet ( 46 m ) away , and the oscilloscope traces recorded on cameras . A calibration measurement was performed before and after each test . The ionization chambers and their preamplifiers were destroyed during the explosion , but their simple design allowed their production in sufficient quantities . 
 The ionization chambers were cylindrical , 2 inches ( 51 mm ) in diameter , 30 inches ( 760 mm ) long , with a wire along the longitudinal axis . They were filled with a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide at 4 @.@ 5 standard atmospheres ( 460 kPa ) . Eight chambers were arranged in a tray and connected in parallel ; four trays were located in a tetrahedron around the experimental assembly , recording the gamma radiation around the sphere , sufficiently close to give a signal and sufficiently far away to not be destroyed by the blast before they could record the required information . The initiation of the explosives was initially performed by a <unk> <unk> system . The results were erratic , as the detonations weren 't sufficiently synchronized . Much better results were obtained after February 1945 , when exploding @-@ bridgewire detonators , developed by Luis Alvarez 's G @-@ 7 group , became available . 
 As plutonium was not available , it was substituted with material with similar mechanical properties . Depleted uranium was used but was not optimal because of its opacity for radiation ; iron , copper , or cadmium were other choices . Cadmium was the choice for most of the tests . The first shot was performed with an iron mockup of the plutonium pit . 
 The resulting signal was a fast dip , corresponding to the compression of the cadmium sphere , followed by slower increase , corresponding to the decompression and following dispersal of the sphere and the lanthanum . The differences between the four traces on the oscilloscope display , each indicating the average compression in the direction of the detector , allowed the assessment of the required synchronization accuracy for the detonators . 
 The RaLa sources were very radioactive . They had to be lowered to the test apparatus by a 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) long rod . The tests were initially observed from a sealed M4 Sherman tank ; the mobile laboratory consisted of two tanks . Each experiment was supposed to contaminate an area of about 3 @,@ 000 square meters ( 32 @,@ 000 sq ft ) for about a half year . When radiobarium was removed from the radiolanthanum , the short term contamination levels turned out to be insignificant . Tanks were then replaced with fixed shelters . One of the tanks was later lead @-@ plated , sealed , equipped with self @-@ contained air supply , and used for sampling of fission products in the post @-@ blast debris after the Trinity test . The sources posed a considerable radiation exposure risk ; the exposure rate of a 1 @,@ 000 Ci ( 37 TBq ) source at 1 meter ( 3 ft 3 in ) was 1 @,@ 130 R / h and 11 @,@ 000 R / h at 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) . Sources with activities up to 2 @,@ 300 Ci ( 85 TBq ) were used in some tests . 
 = = Radiation safety = = 
 The system for remote handling of the samples had flaws ; it took about six months to discover them all . The chemists , who operated on mixtures of fission products with batches reaching up to 2 @,@ 300 Ci ( 85 TBq ) each , were frequently exposed ( accidentally ) to undesirably high doses of radiation . The group handling the experiments themselves was less at risk ; they operated in close coordination with the Health Group , who was in charge of ensuring that radiation exposure of the people involved was survivable . The radioactive contamination posed a problem . The people working in the Bayo Canyon had to change their clothes and take showers after the work . Sometimes they would still trip detectors at security gates . 
 The experiments were performed in the Bayo Canyon in a location designated TA @-@ 10 ( " Technical Area 10 " ) ( but more commonly referred to as the Bayo Canyon Site ) in Los Alamos County and close to the border with Santa Fe County , northeast from the Los Alamos townsite . The site had several fixed structures . The lanthanum @-@ 140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building , TA @-@ 10 @-@ 1 . There were four firing sites . The instruments for firing the explosives and recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings ( TA @-@ 10 @-@ 13 and TA @-@ 10 @-@ 15 ) . 
 Large amounts of radioactive lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions ; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961 . In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there . The experiments were generally performed when the wind blew to the north , but occasionally the wind would change direction in the early morning . In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road ; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5 @-@ 10 mR / h and the road had to be closed for a while . 
 Each test released a plume of dispersed radioactive lanthanum . Three tests in 1950 are documented where the released radioactivity was tracked by a B @-@ 17 aircraft . In one case radiation was detected over a town 17 miles ( 27 km ) downwind . These tests were concurrent with the RaLa tests , and their aim was development of airborne detectors for tracking air burst nuclear tests . The size and altitude of the radioactive cloud was determined by the quantity of the explosive used . For the first 125 tests between 1944 and 1949 , meteorology and fallout monitoring were rare , but between 1950 @-@ 1954 closer monitoring was phased in , and was comprehensive afterwards . One cloud was reportedly tracked as far as 70 miles ( 110 km ) downwind , over Watrous , New Mexico . 
 = = Logistics and schedule = = 
 To handle the logistics of the tests , Luis Alvarez was appointed by Robert Oppenheimer , the director of the Los Alamos laboratory , as the head of the RaLa program ; his group was designated E @-@ 7 , RaLa and Electric <unk> Group . Bruno Rossi and Swiss physicist Hans Staub built the ionization chambers and electronics by late spring . At first the work proceeded at a leisurely pace as the implosion was only a backup project ; it was believed that the plutonium bomb would be of the Thin Man gun @-@ type nuclear weapon design . This turned out not to be the case , as the first tests on reactor @-@ produced plutonium in early summer 1944 showed unacceptably high spontaneous fission rates due to the presence of plutonium @-@ 240 , precluding the use of gun assembly . On 17 July the Thin Man design was abandoned , and all effort was focused on implosion . To meet the challenge , the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized — the X @-@ Division ( Explosive Division ) and the G @-@ Division ( Gadget Division , or Weapon Physics Division ) were formed . Rossi 's group was assigned to G @-@ Division as G @-@ 6 , or RaLa Group ; Alvarez 's group was G @-@ 7 , or Electric Detonator Group . 
 On 25 July 1944 the first preliminary test was fired in the Bayo Canyon as a rehearsal , test of equipment , and measurement of collapse times and detonation and shock wave velocities . The program was delayed by about a month by late radiobarium shipments , as the test scheduled for 15 August was not conducted until mid @-@ September . The first test with radiobarium was fired on 22 September . In late August and at the request of Rossi 's group , the RaLa group was reformed under the leadership of Rossi , and Alvarez and his group took over the exploding bridgewire detonator research . At the suggestion of Robert Christy solid spheres instead of the originally intended hollow ones were chosen for the pit , in order to reduce the problems with jets and spalling . The first solid @-@ sphere RaLa shot was performed in early December but the results were inconclusive . The shot from 14 December though , showed ( in the words of Robert Bacher ) " definite evidence of compression " . 
 The first tests using electric detonators and solid pits were performed on 7 and 14 February 1945 ; until then <unk> @-@ based initiation was employed . The electric detonators showed a significant improvement in the achieved compression degree and symmetry , and were used on all RaLa tests thereafter . Based on these results , by the end of February the design of the gadget , as the bomb was euphemistically known , was settled . Other test methods were also necessary , as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets that plagued the early implosion designs , but RaLa was the most important .

 = = = Barium @-@ lanthanum preparation = = = 
 The half @-@ life of La @-@ 140 is 40 @.@ 224 hours ; it undergoes beta decay to stable cerium @-@ 140 . It was prepared from barium @-@ 140 , a common fission product isolated from the spent fuel from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor , and later , after 1948 , also from the Hanford Site plutonium @-@ 239 producing nuclear reactors . Barium was isolated in a purpose @-@ built hot laboratory in Oak Ridge and shipped in a lead pig to Los Alamos , where it was used to extract lanthanum . The Oak Ridge laboratory was the first laboratory where remote manipulators were used for work with radioactive materials . The delivery was performed by a truck with a two @-@ person crew , driving 1 @,@ 500 miles ( 2 @,@ 400 km ) nonstop . 
 At Oak Ridge , uranium slugs were irradiated for 40 days , then left to cool down for 1 to 5 days , then dissolved . Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated ; the solid material was then shipped to Los Alamos . As of 1949 , full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs ( 34 @.@ 5 batches of 50 slugs ) . Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium slugs irradiated both on @-@ site and at Hanford ; afterward only Hanford material was processed . 
 At first the barium isolation was performed in building 3026 @-@ C ( 706 @-@ C ) , where an existing laboratory was converted for this purpose in 5 months ; the first run was finished in September 1944 . The 3026 @-@ C was designed for work with sources between 1 and 10 Ci ( 37 and 370 GBq ) , but conditions forced it to be adapted to work with 100 Ci ( 3 @.@ 7 TBq ) sources . Its capacity was insufficient as demand grew . In May 1945 a dedicated building 3026 @-@ D ( 706 @-@ D ) , adjacent to 3026 @-@ C and designed to process sources up to 1000 Ci , was completed . The first run in 3026 @-@ D was on 26 May 1945 , the same day as the last run in the 3026 @-@ C facility . 
 By March 1949 , 31 shipments averaging over 2000 Ci each were produced there for Los Alamos . Demand continued to grow though ; by July 1950 the production goal per shipment was 10 @,@ 000 Ci ( 370 TBq ) , and by the early 1950s the requirements went up to 50 @,@ 000 Ci ( 1 @,@ 800 TBq ) . By 1954 the shipments went up to 64 @,@ 805 Ci ( 2 @.@ <unk> PBq ) , and that year the AEC decided to build a new facility in Idaho National Laboratory for RaLa production . In October 1956 , Oak Ridge completed their 68th and last RaLa run . In total , Oak Ridge processed over 30 @,@ 000 uranium slugs and shipped over 500 @,@ 000 Ci ( 19 PBq ) to Los Alamos . 
 During preparation of RaLa volatile fission products were released . When dissolved , a batch of 50 slugs produced 2 @,@ 500 Ci ( 93 TBq ) of xenon @-@ 133 , 1 @,@ 300 Ci ( 48 TBq ) of iodine @-@ 131 ( high amounts , as the fuel had to be processed " fresh " ) , and a small amount of krypton @-@ 85 . As few precautions were used for limiting the fission product releases , the RaLa production was a major contributor to radioactive contamination at Oak Ridge . The iodine emissions were an important factor in the decision to move the facility to Idaho . Later improvements allowed a reduction of iodine emissions to levels about 100 times lower . 
 A serious accident with radioactivity release occurred in the 3026 @-@ D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954 . After the dissolution of the third batch of uranium slugs , the liquid in the <unk> tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours , which overheated due to decay heat . When the acid was added for the fourth batch , the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and the pipes . The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building . Radiation levels on the third floor of the building reached 100 roentgen per hour ( R / h ) , and were reduced to 100 mR / h by 7 am the next day . The highest exposure to a person was 1 @.@ 25 R of hard radiation and 4 @.@ 7 roentgen equivalent physical of soft radiation . 
 = = = Lanthanum preparation = = = 
 After delivery of the barium @-@ lanthanum material to Los Alamos , it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site . At first , the mixture was used as @-@ is , both barium and lanthanum together , but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that took a long time to disappear as the half @-@ life of barium @-@ 140 is 12 @.@ 5 days . Shortly after , the process was improved ; barium was removed chemically , by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate . 
 The process was improved again , to allow repeated separation of lanthanum from the barium solution , as the lanthanum built up . Initially , a phosphate process was used , where lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum phosphate . This was later abandoned when an oxalate or hydroxide method was developed ; lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum hydroxide and then converted to a filterable precipitate by addition of oxalate with a trace of fluoride . The oxalate method had to be performed quickly , as the oxalate ion was susceptible to radiolysis and the lanthanum had the tendency to go back into solution . The oxalate process could be performed by remotely operated devices . The batches contained about 100 curies ( 3 @,@ 700 GBq ) of radiolanthanum , the highest radiation levels people had ever worked with at that time . Special tools had to be developed for remote handling of the hot materials . Lead bricks were used for shielding the sources . The radiation dose limit for the personnel was set to 500 mrem ( 5 mSv ) per source preparation . Sometimes this limit was exceeded ; once the received dose was 2 rem ( 20 mSv ) . 
 The improved process that separated lanthanum from the barium chloride solution had the advantage that barium could be " milked " repeatedly , increasing radiolanthanum yield and allowing more experiments . The problems of radioactive contamination with barium @-@ 140 , with its half life of 12 @.@ 5 days , were eliminated ; the amount of contaminating strontium @-@ 90 was also significantly reduced . Use of purified lanthanum also allowed usage of a much smaller amount of material in the tests themselves . <unk> equipment for " lanthanum milking " ( the barium @-@ 140 isotope was nicknamed a " cow " ) was built in a sufficiently distant area , which avoided time @-@ consuming construction of a heavily shielded building . Early on , the process hit a snag when impurities of iron and other metals , probably introduced from an irradiated shipping container , were found to impair the lanthanum phosphate precipitation by forming phosphate gels that clogged filters . This problem was solved with better shipping containers . A similar " milking " process is now used for preparation of technetium @-@ 99m , used in nuclear medicine , from a molybdenum @-@ 99 " cow " in technetium @-@ 99m generators . 
 The separation process was performed in a dedicated facility in the Bayo Canyon , in the radiochemistry building , designated TA @-@ 10 @-@ 1 . The separated lanthanum was then shipped to the test site in a lead cask on the back of a truck . In 1951 , the separation work was moved to TA @-@ 35 . The tests were performed in a month @-@ long series , as the barium source decayed and was periodically " milked " for lanthanum . 
 = = Post @-@ war progress = = 
 The technology was improved , and by 1951 the four ionization chambers were replaced by twenty scintillation counters , each using five gallons of a liquid scintillator . The flashes from 100 US gallons ( 380 l ; 83 imp gal ) of burning scintillator were remarkably brilliant in the early morning times when the tests were usually performed . RaLa tests continued until 1962 , after which they were replaced by more advanced methods . Currently several other methods are used for hydrodynamic testing . 
 = = Long @-@ term contamination = = 
 Lanthanum @-@ 140 has a short half @-@ life of some 41 hours , and is not a threat after a fairly short time . Other radioisotopes , present as impurities , have a long enough half @-@ life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests ; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees in the area to not remove the trees cut in various parts of the Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials . The worst affected zones are fenced off ; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil , insects and trees in the surrounding areas . The neighbouring population was not informed about the tests until the mid @-@ 1990s , and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation . 
 = Battle of Mount Austen , the Galloping Horse , and the Sea Horse = 
 The Battle of Mount Austen , the Galloping Horse , and the Sea Horse , part of which is sometimes called the Battle of the Gifu , took place from 15 December 1942 to 23 January 1943 and was primarily an engagement between United States and Imperial Japanese forces in the hills near the Matanikau River area on Guadalcanal during the Guadalcanal Campaign . The U.S. forces were under the overall command of Alexander Patch and the Japanese forces were under the overall command of Harukichi Hyakutake . 
 In the battle , U.S. soldiers and Marines , assisted by native Solomon Islanders , attacked Japanese Army ( IJA ) forces defending well @-@ fortified and entrenched positions on several hills and ridges . The most prominent hills were called Mount Austen , the Galloping Horse , and the Sea Horse by the Americans . The U.S. was attempting to destroy the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal and the Japanese were trying to hold their defensive positions until reinforcements could arrive . 
 Both sides experienced extreme difficulties in fighting in the thick jungles and tropical environment that existed in the battle area . Many of the American troops were also involved in their first combat operations . The Japanese were mostly cut off from resupply and suffered greatly from malnourishment and lack of medical care . After some difficulty , the U.S. succeeded in taking Mount Austen , in the process reducing a strongly defended position called the Gifu , as well as the Galloping Horse and the Sea Horse . In the meantime , the Japanese decided to abandon Guadalcanal and withdrew to the west coast of the island . From that location most of the surviving Japanese troops were successfully evacuated during the first week of February 1943 .

 = = = Guadalcanal Campaign = = = 
 Eight months after the beginning of the Pacific war , on 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. ) landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia , and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long Guadalcanal campaign . 
 The Japanese were taken by surprise . By nightfall on 8 August , the 11 @,@ 000 Allied troops — primarily from the 1st Marine Division of the United States Marine Corps under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift — secured Tulagi and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal . The Allies later renamed the airfield Henderson Field . Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the " Cactus Air Force " ( CAF ) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal . To protect the airfield , the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point . Additional reinforcements over the next two months later increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal to more than 20 @,@ 000 . 
 In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army 's 17th Army — a corps @-@ sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake — with the task of retaking Guadalcanal . Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on 19 August to drive Allied forces from the island . 
 Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field , the Japanese were unable to use large , slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island . Instead , the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the Shortland Islands to carry their forces to Guadalcanal . The Japanese warships — mainly light cruisers or destroyers from the Eighth Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa — were usually able to make the round trip down " The Slot " to Guadalcanal and back in a single night , thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack . Delivering the troops in this manner , however , prevented most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , from being carried to Guadalcanal with them . These high @-@ speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the " Tokyo Express " by the Allies and " Rat Transportation " by the Japanese . 
 Using forces delivered to Guadalcanal in this manner , the Japanese tried three times to retake Henderson Field , but they were defeated each time . First , a reinforced battalion from the 28th Infantry Regiment was defeated in the Battle of the Tenaru on 21 August . Next , the augmented 35th Infantry Brigade was defeated in the Battle of Edson 's Ridge on 12 – 14 September . Finally , the 2nd Infantry Division augmented by one regiment from the 38th Infantry Division was defeated with heavy losses in the Battle for Henderson Field on 23 – 26 October . 
 Throughout the campaign , the Japanese used Mount Austen ( called Bear Height by the Japanese and Mount <unk> by the local Solomon Islanders ) , located west of the Lunga River and about 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from Henderson Field , to observe the American defenses around Lunga Point . <unk> artillery on Mount Austen delivered harassing fire on Henderson Field . The hill was also used as a defensive point to protect their positions around the upper Matanikau valley as well as to protect the Maruyama Road , which was a trail used by the Japanese to move men and supplies into the interior of the island . Mount Austen — with a summit of 1 @,@ 514 ft ( 461 m ) — was not a single peak , but a mixed ridgeline of rocky exposed and jungle @-@ covered ridges and hilltops . After the defeat in the Battle for Henderson Field , the Army Section of Imperial General Headquarters directed Hyakutake to increase the numbers of troops and artillery emplaced on the ridgeline to help prepare for the next planned attack on the Americans . Therefore , Hyakutake directed some of the units that were retreating from the Henderson Field battle area to fortify Mount Austen and nearby hilltops . The forces deployed to Mount Austen included the 124th Infantry Regiment under Colonel <unk> Oka and several artillery units . Later , surviving troops from the 230th Infantry Regiment — which had taken heavy losses during the Koli Point action and subsequent retreat — joined Oka 's forces around Mount Austen . 
 = = = Reinforcement and resupply = = = 
 On 5 , 7 , and 8 November , Tokyo Express missions landed most of the 38th Division 's 228th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion , 229th Infantry Regiment on Guadalcanal . On 10 November , Japanese destroyers landed Lieutenant General Tadayoshi Sano — commander of the 38th Infantry Division — plus his staff and 600 more troops from the 38th . Hyakutake used the newly arrived troops to help stop an American attack west of the Matanikau from 8 – 11 November , then sent the 228th and 229th Regiment 's units on 11 November to reinforce Oka 's forces . Japanese Major General Takeo Itō — commander of the 38th Division 's Infantry Group — later took command of the defenses around Mount Austen . 
 An attempt by the Japanese to deliver the rest of the 38th Division and its heavy equipment failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 12 – 15 November . Only 2 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 of the remaining 7 @,@ 000 troops from the division reached the island and most of their supplies , ammunition , and equipment were lost . Because of this failure , the Japanese canceled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field . 
 As December began , the Japanese experienced considerable difficulty in keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval attacks on the Japanese supply chain of ships and bases . The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops , who by 7 December 1942 , were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition , disease , and Allied ground or air attacks . The Japanese had delivered almost 30 @,@ 000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began , but by December only about 20 @,@ 000 of that number were still alive . Of those 20 @,@ 000 , about 12 @,@ 000 remained more or less fit for combat duty . On 12 December , the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned . Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders , who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies , Imperial General Headquarters , with approval from the Emperor , on 31 December , agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on New Georgia . The Japanese titled the evacuation effort of their forces from Guadalcanal Operation Ke ( ケ号作戦 ) and planned to execute the operation beginning on 14 January 1943 . 
 In the meantime , the U.S. continued to deliver additional troops to Guadalcanal . The three infantry regiments of the U.S. Army 's Americal Division , the 164th , the 182nd and the 132nd , were delivered to Guadalcanal on 13 October , 12 November , and 8 December , respectively . In addition , the U.S. Army 's independent 147th Infantry Regiment plus the 2nd Marine Division 's 8th Marine Regiment landed on 4 November . The reinforcements also included additional artillery , construction , aviation , naval , and support units . 
 On 9 December , U.S. Army Major General Alexander Patch — commanding general of the Americal Division — succeeded Vandegrift as commander of Allied forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi . That same day , the 5th Marine Regiment departed the island , followed by the rest of the 1st Marine Division by the end of the month . Patch was ordered to eliminate all Japanese forces remaining on Guadalcanal . Patch told his superior — Millard Harmon , who commanded all U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific — that he needed more troops to accomplish his mission . In response , Harmon ordered the 25th Infantry Division — which was in the process of relocating from Hawaii to the South Pacific area — to ship directly to Guadalcanal . The 25th 's units would arrive at Guadalcanal in stages during the last two weeks of December and the first week of January 1943 . In addition , the rest of the 2nd Marine Division 's units — including the 6th Marine Regiment — were ordered to Guadalcanal during the same time period . By 7 January , American forces on Guadalcanal would total just over 50 @,@ 000 men .

 On 12 December 1942 , a small group of Japanese soldiers from the 38th Field Engineer Regiment successfully infiltrated the American lines from the south , destroying a fighter aircraft and a fuel truck on Henderson Field before escaping back to friendly lines . Two days later , a U.S. Army patrol from the 132nd Infantry Regiment skirmished with a group of Japanese on the eastern slopes of Mount Austen . On 15 December , in yet another night infiltration raid onto Henderson Field , a Lieutenant Ono led four men equipped with picric acid blocks past American sentry positions destroying several P @-@ 39 Airacobra fighters . Throughout the Guadalcanal campaign , Japanese forces would continue night infiltration tactics against U.S. forces , but causing few American casualties . 
 General Patch , however , was convinced that these events illustrated an unacceptable risk to Henderson Field by Japanese troops stationed on and around nearby Mount Austen . Thus , on 16 December , in preparation for a planned general offensive to try to destroy all Japanese forces remaining on Guadalcanal , Patch elected to first secure the Mount Austen area . He therefore ordered the 132nd Infantry Regiment to immediately seize the objective . While the 132nd Infantry Regiment had little modern combat experience aside from jungle skirmishes and patrols , it was proud of its combat history , having participated in both the Civil War and World War I , and its young reserve officers and NCOs considered themselves skilled in rifle and machinegun tactics and marksmanship . 
 The 132nd 's commander — Colonel Leroy E. Nelson — directed his 3rd Battalion to lead the American assault on the first of several hills , followed by the regiment 's 1st Battalion . Artillery support was provided by 105 mm howitzers from the U.S. Army 's 246th Field Artillery Battalion and the 75 mm pack howitzers of the 2nd Battalion 10th Marines . 
 The exposed hills making up the Mount Austen complex were arbitrarily numbered by the Americans for reference purposes ( see map at right ) . On 17 December , Nelson 's 3rd Battalion — commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William C. Wright — advanced south of Hill 35 and began to climb toward Mount Austen 's summit near Hills 20 and 21 . In order to achieve its timetable set by the division commander , the battalion was forced to leave behind many of its support weapons , such as heavy mortars and machine guns , and to take only limited quantities of ammunition and supplies , all of which had to be hand @-@ carried along hacked @-@ out paths through thick jungle . At 09 : 30 on 18 December , as Wright 's lead elements approached , Japanese defenders pinned down the Americans with machine @-@ gun and rifle fire . Exhausted and dehydrated by their trek through the thick jungle , Wright 's troops — unable to deploy quickly out of column formation — made no headway against the Japanese defenses . 
 The next morning , after an artillery barrage and air strike from the CAF , Wright went forward with several artillery observers to investigate the terrain in front of his forces . Using concealed fire lanes , a Japanese machine @-@ gun team killed Wright with a burst of fire at 09 : 30 . Wright 's second in command , Major Louis Franco , was unable to get forward and take command until late in the day , preventing the battalion from continuing the attack . At the same time , Japanese riflemen infiltrated the American positions and effectively harassed the command posts of both the 3rd and 1st Battalions as well as the column of heavily loaded American supply and engineer parties on the hacked @-@ out jungle trail linking the battalions with the Lunga perimeter . Both U.S. battalions dug in for the night while artillery bombarded the Japanese positions . 
 Between 20 and 23 December , the Japanese apparently withdrew from the area , as aggressive U.S. Army patrols encountered no more enemy in the area of Hills 20 and 21 and further to the south . Nelson ordered the two battalions to move west to Hill 31 and then attack south towards Hill 27 . On 24 December , the 3rd Battalion was halted on the slopes of Hill 31 by intense machine @-@ gun fire from well @-@ concealed positions . 
 Facing the Americans was the most strongly fortified Japanese position on Guadalcanal , nicknamed the Gifu ( after Gifu Prefecture in Japan ) by the Japanese . The Gifu position sat between the summits of Mount Austen and Hills 27 and 31 and consisted of a 1 @,@ 500 yd ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) line of 45 – 50 interconnected , mutually supporting , well @-@ camouflaged pillboxes dug into the ground and forming a horseshoe shape with the open end to the west . Only about 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) of each pillbox was above ground with walls and roofs , constructed from logs and dirt , up to 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) thick . Each pillbox contained one to two machine @-@ guns and several riflemen ; some were sited underneath huge jungle trees . Each of these pillbox emplacements was sited to provide mutual support to the others . Numerous foxholes and trenches provided additional support and cover for additional riflemen and machine @-@ gunners . Behind the pillboxes , the Japanese had sited 81 mm and long @-@ range <unk> mortars . The Gifu was commanded by Major <unk> Inagaki with around 800 men from the 2nd Battalion , 228th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion , 124th Infantry . 
 Between 25 and 29 December , the Japanese defenders prevented the Americans from making any headway in their attempt to overrun the Gifu position . While the U.S. 3rd Battalion — with artillery support — conducted frontal attacks against the position to pin the defenders , the U.S. 1st Battalion attempted to flank the Gifu on the east . However , as the Japanese defenses were fully integrated , the flanking attempt was unsuccessful . By 29 December , U.S. losses had reached 53 killed , 129 wounded , and 131 sick , though morale remained high . Assisting the Americans in this battle were Fijian commandos led by officers and non @-@ commissioned officers from the New Zealand Expeditionary Force . 
 On 2 January , Nelson added his 2nd Battalion — commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George F. Ferry — to the offensive and sent them on a march around the Gifu toward Hill 27 . The battalion reached the lower slopes of the hill by 16 : 00 without meeting serious resistance from the Japanese . This same day , Nelson — who was apparently exhausted and / or sick — was replaced as commander of the 132nd by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander M. George . Some sources suggest that he was physically and mentally exhausted and / or suffering from malaria and either requested his own relief or was ordered to relinquish command . 
 The next day , elements of the 132nd 's 2nd Battalion occupied the summit of Hill 27 , surprised and killed a Japanese 75 mm artillery crew , and successfully repulsed , with help from heavy artillery fire , six Japanese counterattacks on their positions . By this time , the soldiers atop Hill 27 were running extremely short of ammunition and grenades , with Japanese forces returning 10 shots to each one fired by the Americans , and medical supplies were exhausted . The 2nd 's efforts to improve its position were made more difficult by the hard coral underneath the hill 's sod , which made the digging of foxholes difficult . The remainder of the 2nd Battalion , carrying ammunition , food , and medical supplies , reached Hill 27 and joined the battle , where they soon gained combat superiority over the attacking Japanese . At the same time , with the infusion of new leadership by Lieutenant Colonel George , the 1st and 3rd Battalions attacked and pushed a short way into the Gifu , killing 25 Japanese in the process , then closed the gaps between their units and consolidated their positions , while killing many of the Japanese defenders . One officer from the 2nd Battalion — who had brought his personal sniper rifle to the battle — witnessed the final disintegration of Japanese units attacking Hill 27 with a final flurry of suicidal frontal charges . The Japanese soldiers in the Gifu , who had apparently not been resupplied or replenished during the battle , consumed their last remaining food rations on 1 January . 
 Since the beginning of its offensive on Mount Austen , the 132nd had lost 115 killed and 272 wounded . The relatively high number of combat deaths were caused in part by wound infections in the tropical conditions and inability to medevac men wounded in the early stages of the operation . Even after intervention by the 2nd Battalion , wounded men continued to die , unable to withstand the arduous and slippery portage back down improvised jungle trails on a stretcher carried by two men . These losses , plus the effects of tropical diseases , heat , and combat exhaustion , temporarily rendered the 132nd 's 1st and 3rd Battalions incapable of further offensive action . Thus , on 4 January , the 1st and 3rd Battalions were ordered to dig in and hold positions surrounding the Gifu on the north , east , and south . 
 Reviewing the first Mount Austen offensive , former Marine officer and historian Samuel B. Griffith concluded , " As the thoroughly butchered Mount Austen operation dragged on into January , it became apparent that both Major General Patch and his assistant Division commander [ Brigadier General Edmund Sebree ] had much to unlearn , and perhaps even more to learn . " However , while Patch 's decision to attack Mount Austen was criticized , one participant noted the difficulties faced by the 132nd Regiment and its commanders , including the terrain , limited equipment ( light mortars and machineguns with limited ammunition supply , no flamethrowers or pole charges ) , and the necessity of assaulting thoroughly integrated , prepared , and roofed @-@ over Japanese defenses , which resisted direct hits by 75 mm and in some cases 105 mm shells . 
 For its part , once the 132nd was able to treat its wounded , morale remained high in the newly blooded regiment , which played a significant role in later combat operations on Guadalcanal . The 2nd Battalion , with just 27 killed , was immediately assigned to further offensive combat operations . 
 Losses among the Gifu defenders are unknown , but were estimated by one 2nd Battalion officer as of 9 January 1943 at 500 killed and wounded ; most of the latter would later die of their wounds when combined with illness and starvation . A Japanese officer 's recovered diary stated that the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties . Japanese prisoners captured in later operations referred to the combat at Hills 27 and 31 as The Battle of the Mountain of Blood . 
 = = = Arrival of American reinforcements = = = 
 On 2 January , with the arrival of the U.S. Army 's 25th Division and the rest of the U.S. Marine 2nd Division , all of the American units on Guadalcanal and Tulagi were together designated as the XIV Corps with Patch in command . Sebree took over as commander of the Americal Division . On 5 January , Patch issued his plan to begin operations to clear Guadalcanal of Japanese forces . The 2nd Marine Division was to push westward from the Matanikau River along the coast while the 25th Division was to finish clearing Mount Austen and to secure the hilltops and ridges located around the inland forks of the Matanikau . The Americal Division and the 147th Regiment would guard the Lunga perimeter . 
 The deep river ravines of the Matanikau 's upper forks naturally divided the U.S. 25th Division 's operations area into three distinct areas , with one main terrain feature dominating each area . East of the Matanikau was Mount Austen . In the wedge between the southeast and southwest forks of the Matanikau Hills 44 and 43 together formed a terrain feature that the Americans called the " Sea Horse " , because of its shape when viewed from above . Between the Matanikau 's southwest and northwest forks was a much larger hill mass labelled , also because of its shape , the " Galloping Horse " . 
 Major General J. Lawton Collins — commander of the 25th Division — assigned his 35th Infantry Regiment to clear the Gifu , secure the rest of Mount Austen , and to capture the Sea Horse . He ordered the 27th Infantry Regiment to seize the Galloping Horse from the north . The 35th and the 27th were then to link up on Hill 53 ( the Galloping Horse 's " Head " ) to finish clearing the nearby hills and ridges . Collins placed his 161st Infantry Regiment in reserve . Ammunition and supplies for the attacking troops would be transported along rough jeep trails as far forward as possible and then carried the rest of the way by native Solomon Islanders . 
 Having observed the arrival of the American reinforcements to the island , the Japanese were expecting the offensive . Hyakutake ordered the units on the hilltops around the Matanikau and in the Gifu to hold in place in their prepared positions . The Japanese hoped that as the Americans surrounded and intermingled with the Japanese defensive pockets that the close quarters fighting would prevent the Americans from employing their superior firepower in artillery and close air support . At night , the Japanese planned to infiltrate the American rear areas and interdict their supply lines to prevent the American assault forces from receiving sufficient ammunition and provisions to continue their attacks . The Japanese hoped to delay the Americans long enough for more reinforcements to arrive from Rabaul or elsewhere . 
 = = = Galloping Horse = = = 
 Viewed from overhead with north upward , the Galloping Horse appeared upside down , with Hills 54 and 55 forming the horse 's rear legs and Hill 57 forming the front legs . From east to west , Hills 50 , 51 , and 52 formed the horse 's body with the 900 ft ( 270 m ) high Hill 53 at the head . Colonel William A. McCulloch — commander of the 27th Regiment — ordered his 1st Battalion to attack Hill 57 and his 3rd Battalion to assault Hills 51 and 52 from Hill 54 , which was already in American hands . Defending the Galloping Horse and the nearby fork of the Matanikau were 600 Japanese soldiers from the 3rd Battalion , 228th Infantry Regiment under Major Haruka ( or <unk> ) Nishiyama . 
 The American attack commenced at 05 : 50 on 10 January with a bombardment by six battalions of artillery and airstrikes by 24 CAF aircraft on suspected Japanese positions in the valley between Hill 57 and the jumping @-@ off point for the 1st Battalion . Beginning their advance at 07 : 30 , the 1st Battalion successfully gained the summit of Hill 57 by 11 : 40 against light resistance . 
 From Hill 54 , the 3rd Battalion 's attack route was in the open and dominated by the high ground of Hills 52 and 53 . At 06 : 35 , the battalion commenced its assault and occupied Hill 51 without resistance . Continuing its advance , the battalion was stopped by heavy Japanese machine @-@ gun fire 200 yd ( 180 m ) short of Hill 52 's summit . After an airstrike by six CAF aircraft on Hill 52 and an artillery bombardment , the 3rd Battalion resumed their attack and successfully captured the summit by 16 : 25 , destroying six machine @-@ gun positions and killing about 30 Japanese on the hill . 
 At 09 : 00 on 11 January , the 3rd Battalion began its attack on Hill 53 . The Japanese quickly stopped the American advance with machine @-@ gun and mortar fire . The Americans — who had not received adequate replenishment in water — began to suffer extensive heat casualties . In one platoon , only 10 men remained conscious by the afternoon . 
 The next day , the 27th 's 2nd Battalion took over the assault on Hill 53 . Advancing up the hill , the Americans were stopped short of Hill 53 's summit . During the night , Japanese infiltrators cut the telephone line between the 2nd Battalion and its regimental headquarters , affecting unit communications . On 13 January , the Americans renewed the attack but were again halted by heavy Japanese machine @-@ gun and mortar fire . 
 A knoll on the south edge of the ridge ( the " horse 's neck " ) leading to Hill 53 was the fulcrum of the Japanese defenses . The knoll contained several machine @-@ gun and mortar positions which had effectively held off the American attacks across the ridge . The 2nd Battalion 's executive officer — Captain Charles W. Davis — volunteered to lead four other men against the knoll . Crawling on their bellies , Davis and his party crept to within 10 yd ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) of the enemy position . The Japanese defenders threw two grenades at them , but the grenades failed to explode . Davis and his men threw eight grenades at the Japanese , destroying several of their positions . Davis then stood up , and while shooting his rifle , then pistol with one hand , waved his men forward with the other as he advanced further onto the knoll . Davis and his men then killed or chased away the rest of the Japanese on the knoll . <unk> against the sky during the action , Davis was visible to the Americans all up and down the ridge . Inspired by his actions , plus replenished with water by a sudden thunderstorm , the American troops " came to life " and quickly assaulted and captured Hill 53 by noon . The Americans counted the bodies of 170 Japanese soldiers on and around the Galloping Horse . The Americans suffered fewer than 100 killed . 
 Between 15 and 22 January , the 161st Infantry Regiment hunted the remainder of Nishiyama 's battalion in the nearby gorge of the southwest Matanikau fork . In total , 400 Japanese were killed defending the Galloping Horse and surrounding area . Two hundred Japanese survivors , including Nishiyama , escaped to friendly lines on January 19 . 
 = = = Sea Horse = = = 
 In the last week of December 1942 , Colonel Robert B. McClure — the commander of the U.S. 35th Infantry Regiment — was assigned to capture the Sea Horse and complete the reduction of the Gifu on Mount Austen . For this operation , the 3rd Battalion of the 182nd Infantry Regiment — commanded by Lt. Col. Roy F. Goggin — and the 25th Division 's Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop were attached to the 35th Infantry . 
 Colonel McClure — commanding the 35th Infantry — ordered the 35th 's 2nd Battalion and the 25th 's Reconnaissance Troop to relieve the 132nd Infantry Regiment at the Gifu , with orders to pressure that strong point and keep in touch with Goggin 's 3rd Battalion , 182nd on the right . The 35th 's own 3rd Battalion — commanded by Lt. Col. William J. Mullen , Jr . — was to advance southwest from Hill 27 ( south of the Gifu on Mount Austen ) , and then swing north to seize Hills 43 and 44 . Lt. Col. James B. Leer 's 1st Battalion was to be initially in regimental reserve , following about a half day 's march behind Mullen 's battalion . The 3rd Battalion , <unk> Infantry , was assigned the task of protecting the 25th Division 's artillery positions on the open ground north of Mount Austen and east of the Matanikau by advancing south from Hill 65 to block the river gorge and the ravine between Hills 31 and 42 against Japanese infiltration . Maintaining contact with the 27th and 35th Regiments , Goggin 's battalion was to assault Sea Horse Ridge in concert with the other two regiments . By 30 December , Goggin 's 3rd Battalion , 182nd was in action against Japanese forces atop Sea Horse Ridge . 
 Colonel McClure next assigned his 2nd Battalion to the assault on the Gifu and sent his 1st and 3rd Battalions on a long march through the jungle to attack the Sea Horse from the south . Defending the Sea Horse and nearby valleys were the Japanese 124th Regiment 's 1st and 3rd Battalions , with Oka 's command post located nearby . The Sea Horse consisted of two hills , Hill 43 on the south with Hill 44 adjoining to the north . 
 After taking a 7 @,@ 000 yd ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) circuitous route through the jungle around Mount Austen , at 06 : 35 on 10 January , McClure 's 3rd Battalion launched its attack on Hill 43 . As the Americans closed on Hill 43 from the south , a group of Japanese soldiers near Oka 's command post spotted the U.S. soldiers as they crossed a stream and attacked immediately , threatening the flank of the American column . Two American soldiers — William G. Fournier and Lewis Hall — successfully repelled the Japanese attack with a machine @-@ gun but were killed in the process . Making progress against light resistance , the 3rd Battalion dug in for the night about 700 yd ( 640 m ) short of Hill 43 's summit . 
 The next day , the 1st Battalion of the 35th was added to the attack and the two units — with artillery support — drove through several Japanese machine @-@ gun positions and took Hill 43 by early afternoon . Continuing on towards Hill 44 against light opposition , the Americans captured the rest of the Sea Horse by nightfall , cutting off Japanese forces in the Gifu . The native Solomon Islanders who had been man @-@ packing supplies to the two American battalions during the attack were having difficulty delivering sufficient food and ammunition over the long trail between the Sea Horse and the Lunga perimeter . Thus , B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers were now used to air drop supplies to the American troops around the Sea Horse . 
 On 12 January , the two American battalions of the 35th continued their attack to the west toward the Galloping Horse , but were stopped by a Japanese strongpoint on a narrow ridge about 600 yd ( 550 m ) west of their point of departure . After trying to flank the position for two days , the Americans were able to smash the strongpoint with mortar and artillery fire , killing 13 Japanese defenders , and advanced to a ridge overlooking the southwest fork of the Matanikau by 15 : 00 on 15 January . That same day , Japanese survivors from the Sea Horse battle — including Oka and most of the 124th 's headquarters staff section and the 1st Battalion — were able to slip past the American forces and reach friendly lines further west . The Americans counted 558 Japanese dead around the Sea Horse , mostly from the 124th 's 3rd Battalion , and captured 17 . 
 = = = Second Mount Austen = = = 
 On 9 January , McClure 's 2nd Battalion — commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Peters — replaced the three battalions from the 132nd Regiment and prepared to assault the Gifu . Over the next four days , the Americans tried to feel out the Japanese positions with patrols . At the same time , the Gifu defenders attempted to wear down the Americans with night infiltration attacks . By 13 January , the 2nd Battalion had lost 57 killed or wounded . The battle casualties plus malaria reduced the battalion to 75 % of its effective strength by the next day . To assist the battalion , the 35th Regiment 's anti @-@ tank gun company personnel were attached to the battalion as infantry . 
 With the capture of the Sea Horse by the Americans , the Japanese in the Gifu were now isolated from the rest of the 17th Army . In a last message over his field phone before the line was cut , Inagaki refused an order from Oka to abandon his position and attempt to infiltrate back to friendly lines , instead vowing that his command would " fight to the last " . Inagaki apparently refused the order because to do so would have meant leaving his sick and injured men behind . 
 An American attack on the Gifu by the entire 2nd Battalion on 15 January was completely repulsed by the Japanese . In response , McClure relieved Peters of command on 16 January and replaced him with Major Stanley R. Larsen . Larsen decided to completely surround the Gifu and try to reduce it with a massive artillery bombardment on 17 January . 
 In the meantime , the Americans used a loudspeaker to broadcast a surrender appeal in Japanese to the Gifu 's defenders . Only five Japanese soldiers responded . One of the five reported that his company actually gathered to discuss the appeal , but decided not to surrender because they were too weak to carry their injured , non @-@ ambulatory comrades with them to the American lines . Instead , they elected to perish together as a unit . One Japanese officer defending the Gifu wrote in his diary , " I heard the enemy talking in Japanese over a loud speaker . He is probably telling us to come out - what fools the enemy are . The Japanese Army will stick it out to the end . Position must be defended in all conditions with our lives . " 
 At 14 : 30 hours on 17 January , twelve 155 mm and thirty @-@ seven 105 mm guns opened fire on the Gifu . Over the next one and a half hours , the American artillery fired 1 @,@ 700 shells into an area about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) square . Because of the lateness of the hour , the Americans were unable to follow the barrage with an immediate attack but instead had to wait until the next day , which allowed the Japanese time to recover . On 18 January , the Americans attacked into the weaker west side of the Gifu , making some headway and destroying several Japanese pillboxes over the next two days until heavy rain stopped the attack on 20 January . That night , 11 Japanese were killed trying to escape from the Gifu . 
 On 22 January , the Americans were able to move a light tank up their supply trail to Mount Austen . The tank proved to be the decisive factor in the battle . At 10 : 20 , the tank — protected by 16 – 18 riflemen — blasted three Japanese pillboxes and penetrated into the Gifu pocket . Proceeding onward , the tank completely traversed the Gifu and destroyed five more pillboxes , breaching a gap 200 yd ( 180 m ) wide in the Japanese line . The American infantry surged through the gap and took positions in the middle of the Gifu . 
 That night , around 02 : 30 , apparently realizing that the battle was lost , Inagaki led his staff and most of the remaining survivors of his command — about 100 men — in a final charge on the Americans . In the charge , Inagaki and the remainder of his troops were killed almost to the last man . At sunrise on 23 January , the Americans secured the rest of the Gifu . Sixty @-@ four men from the American 2nd Battalion , 35th Infantry were killed during the assaults on the Gifu between 9 and 23 January , bringing the total number of Americans killed taking Mount Austen to 175 . The Americans counted the bodies of 431 Japanese in the remains of the Gifu 's fortifications and 87 elsewhere around Mount Austen . Total Japanese losses in the Sea Horse and both Mount Austen battles were probably between 1 @,@ 100 and 1 @,@ 500 men . 
 = = = Coastal drive = = = 
 At the same time that the U.S. Army offensive was taking place in the hills around the upper Matanikau , the U.S. 2nd Marine Division — under the command of Brigadier General Alphonse <unk> — was attacking along the north coast of Guadalcanal . Facing the Marines in the hills and ravines south of Point Cruz were the remains of the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division , commanded by Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama , plus the 1st Battalion , 228th Infantry Regiment from the 38th Infantry Division under Major <unk> Hayakawa . 
 On 13 January , the 2nd and 8th Marine regiments began their offensive with the 8th Marines attacking along the coast and the 2nd Marines advancing further inland . The Japanese were pushed back in some places but held in others , with heavy fighting occurring at several locations in the hills and ravines near the coast . On 14 January , the 2nd Marines were relieved by the 6th Marine Regiment . 
 The Marines renewed the offensive on 15 January . The Japanese stymied the 8th Marines ' advance along the coast . Inland , however , the 6th Marines were able to successfully advance about 1 @,@ 500 yd ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) and threatened the flank of the Japanese forces emplaced in front of the 8th Marines . At 17 : 00 , Maruyama ordered his troops to retreat to a pre @-@ coordinated line about 1 @,@ 300 yd ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) to the west . 
 Early on 16 January , as many of Maruyama 's men attempted to comply with the order to retreat , the 6th Marines turned and drove to the coast , trapping most of Maruyama 's 4th and 16th Regiments between themselves and the 8th Marines . By 14 : 00 on 17 January , the Marines had destroyed the Japanese forces trapped in the pocket , killing 643 and capturing two . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On 15 January , an IJA representative from Rabaul reached Guadalcanal on a Tokyo Express mission and informed Hyakutake of the decision to withdraw Japanese forces from the island . Grudgingly accepting the order , the 17th Army staff communicated the Ke evacuation plan to their forces on 18 January . The plan directed the 38th Division to disengage and withdraw towards Cape Esperance on the western end of Guadalcanal beginning on 20 January . The 38th 's retirement would be covered by the 2nd Division and other units , which would then follow the 38th westward . Any troops unable to move were encouraged to kill themselves to " uphold the honor of the Imperial Army " . From Cape Esperance the Japanese navy planned to evacuate the army forces over the last few days of January and first week of February with a projected completion date of the evacuation of 10 February . 
 The U.S. and its Allies mistook Japanese preparations for Ke as another reinforcement attempt . With this in mind , Patch ordered his forces to launch another offensive against the Japanese forces west of the Matanikau . On 21 January , the 27th and 161st Regiments pushed westward from the area of the Galloping Horse . The Americans — unaware that the 38th Division was withdrawing in preparation to evacuate the island — were surprised to encounter light resistance . Advancing more quickly through the inland hills and ridges than the Japanese had anticipated , by 22 January the Americans were in position to capture Kokumbona on the coast , headquarters of the 17th Army , and completely cut off the remainder of the 2nd Division . 
 Reacting quickly to the situation , the Japanese hurriedly evacuated Kokumbona and ordered the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately . The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January . Although some Japanese units were trapped between the American forces and destroyed , most of the 2nd Division 's survivors escaped . 
 Over the next week , the Japanese rear @-@ guard — assisted by difficult terrain — effectively delayed the American advance westward from Kokumbona . General Patch — still believing that a Japanese reinforcement effort was imminent — kept most of his forces back to guard Henderson Field , sending only one regiment at time to continue the advance . Thus , the majority of the surviving Japanese army forces were able to gather at Cape Esperance by the end of January . On 1 , 4 , and 7 February , Japanese warships successfully evacuated 10 @,@ 652 army troops from the island . On 9 February , the Americans discovered that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure . 
 In hindsight , some historians have faulted the Americans — especially Patch and Admiral William Halsey , commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific — for not taking advantage of their ground , aerial , and naval superiority to prevent the successful Japanese evacuation of most of their surviving forces from Guadalcanal . Halsey had just been recently repulsed at the Battle of Rennell Island <unk> and Harmon 's insistence on taking Mount Austen has been cited as one of the factors that delayed the American 's main attack to the west , giving the 17th Army a chance to escape . Said Merrill B. Twining of the Japanese forces deployed on and around Mount Austen , " Theoretically these Japanese did offer a threat to our major force advancing westward along the coast , but as a practical matter these isolated groups were composed of sick and starving men unable to do anything more than die in place . Under the circumstances disclosed by subsequent events , it is obvious that Mt . Austen was just part of the scenery and of no significant import to either of the antagonists . " 
 Nevertheless , the successful campaign to recapture Guadalcanal from the Japanese was an important strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies . Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere , the Allies continued their campaign against Japan , ultimately culminating in Japan 's defeat and the end of World War II .

 James Jones wrote his novel The Thin Red Line based on his experiences during the battle of the Galloping Horse , the Sea Horse , and Kokumbona which he renamed " The Dancing Elephant " , " The Sea Slug " , and " <unk> " . The novel has spawned two film adaptations : one by Andrew Marton in 1964 , and one by Terrence Malick in 1998 .

 = Effects of Hurricane Dean in the Greater Antilles = 
 The effects of Hurricane Dean in the Greater Antilles were spread over six countries and included 20 deaths . Hurricane Dean formed in the Atlantic Ocean west of Cape Verde on August 14 as part of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season . The Cape Verde @-@ type hurricane tracked steadily westward into the Caribbean , where it rapidly intensified . Its outer bands swept over the Greater Antilles ; the storm surge was felt from the eastern side of Puerto Rico to the western tip of Cuba . It brushed the island of Jamaica as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale before striking Mexico 's Yucatán Peninsula at Category 5 strength . 
 National governments , domestic non @-@ governmental organizations , and international aid agencies established hundreds of shelters , evacuated hundreds of thousands of people , raised millions of dollars of resources , and rallied thousands of rescue workers as the powerful hurricane churned through the Caribbean . Despite a number of near misses , Hurricane Dean did not make landfall in the Greater Antilles and the islands were spared the brunt of the storm . 
 Six people were killed in the Dominican Republic and another fourteen in Haiti . Three were killed in Jamaica , which also suffered US $ 310 million of damage — the heaviest in the Caribbean . The most severe damage there was to the agricultural sector ; nearly the entire banana crop was destroyed . Global aid organizations contributed to the subsequent recovery effort ; immediate life @-@ saving needs were met within days , but the damage to Jamaica 's infrastructure and economy took much longer to repair . With loans and grants from the local government , the European Union , and the United Nations , normality was restored by the following summer .

 A tropical storm watch was issued for the south coast of the Dominican Republic on August 17 at 0300 UTC . Later that day the tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning . Additionally , a hurricane watch was issued from Cabo Beata to the Haitian border . This was further upgraded that night with a hurricane warning from Barahona to the Haitian border . Workers from World Vision , already on the island for unrelated humanitarian work , pre @-@ positioned food , clean water , medicines and emergency generators in the southern provinces where hurricane warnings had been issued . As the storm approached , 1 @,@ 580 of the island 's most vulnerable residents were evacuated to shelters . 
 A tropical storm watch was issued at 0900 UTC for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from Port @-@ au @-@ Prince to the Dominican border . This advisory was upgraded the next morning to a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch , and that night was further upgraded to a hurricane warning . The Haitian coastal authority advised all small craft to stay in port , while at Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , all flights to southern Haiti from Toussaint Louverture International Airport were canceled . More than 1 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from low @-@ lying areas and workers from World Vision again pre @-@ positioned relief supplies .

 On August 17 , when a hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica , Prime Minister of Jamaica Portia Simpson @-@ Miller convened an emergency meeting of Jamaica 's national disaster preparedness council . The Jamaican government finalized evacuation plans , which included converting the country 's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons . Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections to allow residents to prepare for the storm . The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency ( CDERA ) , which was already responding to Hurricane Dean 's impact in the Lesser Antilles , contacted the Jamaican Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management to confirm technical and logistics support , and to notify the Jamaican government that utilities teams had been placed on standby should they be needed . The North @-@ West Caribbean Donor Group also met to consider what action might it might undertake in Dean 's aftermath . 
 On August 18 the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning . Curfews were put in place for parts of the island , while off @-@ duty essential personnel were called back to work . The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed . Only one member of a United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination team arrived in Jamaica before all incoming flights were canceled . 
 More than 1 @,@ 000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters , but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm 's arrival . The country 's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes . UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1 @,@ 000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight , if possible . The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti , ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed , although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution .

 At 2100 UTC August 16 , 2007 a tropical storm watch was issued for Puerto Rico . At 0300 UTC August 17 this advisory was upgraded to a tropical storm warning . The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency , eager to make a good showing after its heavily criticized response to Hurricane Katrina , deployed a Federal Incident Response Support Team to the unincorporated territory of the United States ahead of Hurricane Dean . This five @-@ member team of disaster management experts was equipped with satellite communication systems to provide video @-@ teleconferencing and help make real @-@ time assessments of any damage . 
 On August 17 a tropical storm watch was issued for Cuba between the provinces of Camagüey and Guantánamo . This was upgraded on the afternoon of August 18 to a tropical storm warning . At 0300 UTC August 19 a tropical storm watch was issued for portions of central Cuba : Ciego de Ávila , Sancti Spíritus , Cienfuegos , Matanzas , and Isla de la Juventud . Had it been necessary , soldiers and emergency officials were prepared to convert schools and other government buildings into temporary shelters . More than 350 @,@ 000 people were evacuated by the Civil Defense in the coastal provinces , and the government in Havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm . 
 At 1500 UTC on August 18 a hurricane watch was issued for the Cayman Islands and the Emergency Operations Centre was activated . Twelve hours later , as Hurricane Dean continued to track west towards the islands , the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning . Major airlines added flights leaving the islands for tourists to evacuate . Tourists were barred from entering the islands starting August 17 . A mandatory evacuation order was imposed on the island of Little Cayman by Governor of the Cayman Islands Stuart Jack , and extra flights were initiated between Little Cayman and Cayman Brac . On August 19 , nineteen schools and civic centers were converted to shelters : fifteen on Grand Cayman , three on Cayman Brac , and , despite the mandatory evacuation order in effect , one on Little Cayman . Two Royal Navy ships of the Atlantic Patrol Task ( North ) , HMS Portland and RFA Wave Ruler , followed 240 km ( 150 mi ) behind the storm in order to arrive at Cayman as soon after the hurricane as possible .

 Hurricane Dean passed just south of the Greater Antilles from August 17 to August 21 . Having entered the Caribbean Sea as a Category 2 storm , it quickly strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane near Puerto Rico before weakening slightly to Category 4 strength as it swept under the rest of the Greater Antilles . It never made landfall in the island chain , but at Category 4 strength the storm passed just 40 km ( 25 mi ) south of Jamaica . Strengthening again as it passed the islands , Dean regained Category 5 strength off the eastern tip of Cuba before making landfall in Mexico . The storm 's winds , rains , and storm surge endangered life and property throughout the island chain . 
 = = = Hispaniola = = = 
 Hurricane Dean passed 270 km ( 170 mi ) south of the Dominican Republic 's capital , Santo Domingo , and although the island experienced relatively little wind , heavy rain flooded the streets . The moderate winds and heavy rains did not damage the agriculture sector as they did elsewhere in the Caribbean . Six deaths were attributed to the effects of the hurricane . The strong wave activity on the southern coastline attracted a crowd of onlookers and a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy was swept out to sea and drowned as he watched 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 8 m ) swells break over a road in Santo Domingo . Also , five fishermen drowned in the northern Santiago province after their boat capsized due to the effect of wind and torrential rain in the Tavera Dam , near the town of <unk> . The victims were fishing along with three others that managed to swim ashore , and were believed to have ignored warnings issued by civil defense authorities . Rough surf destroyed at least 5 houses along the southern coast and damaged 316 . 
 The outer fringes of Hurricane Dean swept over Haiti bringing heavy squalls . On Gonâve Island , thousands of people lost power and some took shelter in schools and churches . The roof of the <unk> St. Michel in Jacmel , damaged before the storm , leaked significantly leading to water damage in the operating room . Two people were killed in Tiburon and Moron , towns in the south and southeast of the island , respectively . Seven other storm @-@ related deaths were confirmed but few details were given . Another four were injured in a sailboat after disregarding warnings to stay in port . Several hundred homes were destroyed due to the resulting landslides . In the departments of South @-@ East , <unk> , Centre , and Artibonite , 5 @,@ 154 people retreated to temporary shelters . Hurricanes typically pose significant hazards to potable water in Haiti , but Hurricane Dean produced only a modest 2 @.@ 06 inches ( 52 mm ) of rainfall . As such , the storm caused no major problems with water and sanitation , except in the town of Bainet , where the temperamental water system was compromised . 
 = = = Jamaica = = = 
 In Jamaica , flooding was reported on the east of the island , and mudslides occurred on the northeast coast . In Kingston , buildings collapsed and houses had their roofing torn off by the strong winds , which felled trees and lampposts . A shoot @-@ out between police and looters occurred in the parish of Clarendon . Over 1 @,@ 500 roofs were lost , primarily to the hurricane @-@ force winds . 3 @,@ 127 houses were heavily damaged , 1 @,@ 582 of which were left totally uninhabitable . Two @-@ thirds of the homes in the southeastern parishes of Clarendon , St. Catherine , and Kingston / St. Andrew sustained significant damages . One man was killed in Clarendon by a collapsing roof , and a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl in <unk> , St. Thomas was killed by rock damage to her home . A third Jamaican was killed when he was struck by flying debris during the height of the storm . 
 Hurricane Dean affected 248 roads : 10 were blocked in the Kingston metropolitan region , 14 sections were blocked in St. Andrew , 43 were blocked in St. Catherine , 8 were blocked in the Western Region ( Saint James , Hanover , Westmoreland , and Trelawny ) , and 110 were blocked in the Northeast region . Furthermore , the road from Kingston to the airport was covered in sand , boulders , and downed power lines . 
 Agriculture damage was widespread . Across the country 40 % of the sugarcane crop , 80 – 100 % of the banana crop , 75 % of the coffee trees under three years old , and 20 % of the top layer of the cocoa crop were lost to the storm . Insured damage in Jamaica was initially estimated at around US $ 1 @.@ 5 billion , but post @-@ storm analysis showed that it was closer to US $ 310 million . 
 = = = Elsewhere = = = 
 Rain from Hurricane Dean closed several roads throughout Puerto Rico and there was heavy surf along the island 's coast , but no deaths or injuries were reported . The hurricane 's outer bands swept over Cuba between August 19 and August 21 , bringing heavy rain and high seas , but sparing the island its damaging winds . In the Cayman Islands , rain flooded roads and there were high waves along the coast , but no deaths or serious injuries were reported . There were localized power outages and the water supply was shut off briefly , but the rest of the island 's infrastructure was unaffected . Approximately 2 @,@ 000 people weathered the storm in temporary shelters .

 Despite the storm 's powerful intensity , Hurricane Dean 's damage was moderate . It did not have severe or lasting effects on infrastructure , and the non @-@ agricultural sectors of economies throughout the Greater Antilles recovered quickly .

 On August 23 the Haitian government sent food , sachets of potable water , mattresses , and medicines to the town of Bainet in the South @-@ East Department . On August 24 the Pan American Development Foundation sent food to all people living in temporary shelters and Venezuela delivered 11 tonnes of emergency food to the South @-@ East Department in 500 family bags . Hurricane assistance was then compounded by the country 's standard humanitarian assistance programs and became indistinct from the country 's continued poverty crisis . 
 = = = Jamaica = = = 
 The World Food Program immediately placed 5 @,@ 500 Jamaicans on complementary food assistance , a daily ration of 1900 kJ ( 450 kcal ) of High Energy Biscuits , for two weeks . On August 22 , three days after the hurricane struck the island , the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) sent US $ 398 @,@ 000 of emergency supplies to Jamaica 's Norman Manley International Airport . These supplies included mattresses , blankets , plastic sheeting , hygiene kits and water containers . The Inter @-@ American Development Bank ( IDB ) provided a US $ 200 @,@ 000 grant to support the relief effort . The Chinese Red Cross , despite dealing with Typhoon <unk> , sent US $ 30 @,@ 000 to its Jamaican counterpart for the purchase of emergency relief supplies . 
 On August 24 Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller announced that her government would provide JA $ 225 million in emergency assistance to the country 's agriculture sector , especially the parishes of Portland , Clarendon , St. Thomas , Manchester , St. Catherine and St. Elizabeth . JA $ 100 million was immediately allocated to the purchase of fertilizers , JA $ 25 million to the Blue Mountain coffee farmers , and the Agriculture Ministry 's JA $ 50 million fruit tree programme was accelerated . She also announced that the National Housing Trust had established a JA $ 500 million programme to provide loans at 6 % per annum for emergency repairs . The National Housing Trust also made JA $ 200 million available to the Hurricane Relief Fund . The government provided tarpaulins , 10 @,@ 000 of which were shipped in after the storm , free of charge to patch houses with damaged roofs . 
 The Jamaican general election scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3 , at which point they went ahead as planned . Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson @-@ Miller of unnecessarily extending the state of emergency ( and related curfews ) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted by the opposition . She and her party ultimately did lose the election , although Dean 's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor . 
 By the end of the summer of 2008 , banana production in Jamaica was returning to pre @-@ Dean levels . With the help of JA $ 1 @.@ 1 billion of aid from the EU 's Banana Support Programme , thousands of acres were replanted . Banana chips were the first products ready for export at the beginning of the summer , with fresh banana production following shortly thereafter as the agricultural industry returned to normal .

 Air Mata Iboe ( Perfected spelling : Air Mata Ibu ; Malay for A Mother 's Tears ) is a 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) directed and written by Njoo Cheong Seng . Starring Fifi Young , Rd Ismail , Ali Sarosa , and Ali Joego , it followed a mother who raises her children lovingly but is ultimately betrayed by her eldest sons when she falls upon hard times . The film , billed as a musical extravaganza , featured a soundtrack by R. Koesbini , and an eponymous title song written by Njoo . 
 The last production completed by Fred Young 's Majestic Film Company , Air Mata Iboe was released in December 1941 , shortly before the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies . This film , now possibly lost , received positive reviews . A remake was produced under the same title in 1957 ; Young retook her role . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Soegiati ( Fifi Young ) is the mother of four children : sons Achmad ( Rd Ismail ) , Idris ( S Poniman ) and Soemadi ( Ali Sarosa ) , and a daughter named Soepinah ( Soelami ) . She loves them all , but Soemadi receives the most of her attention because he receives little from his father , the merchant Soebagio ( Ali Joego ) . As the children grow , they marry and move away , and eventually only Soemadi is left . Although he begins a relationship with a young woman named <unk> ( Soerip ) , he does not marry her as his income is not enough to support them . 
 On the night of Eid al @-@ Fitr , the family gathers for the holiday . Unknown to the family , Soebagio is leading a double life as a robber , and that evening the police come to arrest him . To protect his father , Soemadi declares himself the culprit , and he is exiled . Feeling guilty for his sins , Soebagio falls ill and dies soon afterwards . Because of their debts , their home and belongings are repossessed , leaving Soegiati to fend for herself . 
 Though wealthy , Achmad and Idris refuse to take Soegiati in , fearing their respective wives <unk> ( Titing ) and Mariam ( Ning @-@ Nong ) . Soepinah and her husband Bakar ( Koesbini ) are willing to take her in , but they live in poverty . Unwilling to burden them , ultimately Soegiati decides to leave and find her own way , depending on the kindness of strangers . Years pass , and Soemadi returns from exile . Encountering his mother , who now lives in poverty , he decides to take revenge on his brothers . 
 = = Production = = 
 The Malang @-@ based Majestic Film Company announced Air Mata Iboe in June 1941 together with two other films , Boedi <unk> ( Hidden Wisdom ) and <unk> Karam ( <unk> Ark ) . Production began soon afterwards and , by early December 1941 , over 55 reels had been shot , as well as 60 sound reels . 
 Air Mata Iboe was written and directed by Njoo Cheong Seng under his penname M. d 'Amour ; he had previously directed <unk> Hati ( Heart and Soul ; 1941 ) , which also had a tragic ending , for the company . The film was produced by the company 's owner , Fred Young . It starred Njoo 's wife Fifi Young ( no relation to Fred ) , Rd Ismail , Ali Sarosa , and Ali Joego . Other roles were held by established singers of keroncong ( traditional music with Portuguese influences ) , including Soerip , Titing , Soelami , Ning Nong , and Poniman . The film , which used make @-@ up to make Fifi Young age into an old woman over the course of its plot , was the actress ' first for Majestic ; she had been ill during the production of her husband 's debut for the company . 
 The black @-@ and @-@ white film featured eleven keroncong songs written by music director R. Koesbini , who also had a role in the film . Backing music was provided by Koesbini 's troupe , the <unk> <unk> , while songs were performed by the cast . Notes and lyrics for the film 's title song , " Air Mata Iboe " , were published in the December 1941 edition of Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film . 
 = = Release and legacy = = 
 Air Mata Iboe , which was rated for all ages , was distributed by Columbia Pictures and premiered at Sampoerna Theatre in Surabaya on 24 December 1941 . Also advertised under the Dutch title Tranen <unk> Moeder ( a literal translation from Malay ) , the film was promoted as a " musical extravaganza " ; other advertisements emphasised the size of the cast . An anonymous review in the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad noted the extensive use of keroncong and praised the acting and singing , suggesting that native audiences would flock to see the film . 
 Air Mata Iboe was the last film produced by Majestic Film Company , which closed following the Japanese occupation . During the occupation Njoo , Fifi Young , and Fred Young established their own travelling theatrical troupe , Pantjawarna , though all returned to cinema in the 1950s . Joego likewise returned to film after spending the occupation in theater . Poniman , Sarosa , Ismail , and Soerip all returned to cinema , the men in the 1950s and Soerip in 1973 . Soelami is not recorded as acting in any further productions . 
 A remake of Air Mata Iboe was produced in 1957 , after Indonesia had obtained its independence . Directed by Fred Young , the film had Fifi Young retake her role as <unk> , while Rd Ismail took the role of Subagio . The remake 's other cast members had not appeared in the original film . The sons Achmad , Idris , and Soemadi were portrayed by Sukarno M. Noor , Boes Boestami , and <unk> , respectively . The couple 's daughter , renamed Atikah , was played by Farida <unk> . 
 Air Mata Iboe may be lost . Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film , and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara 's warehouse in 1952 , old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed . Thus , the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider wrote that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , JB Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

 = 2008 Italian Grand Prix = 
 The 2008 Italian Grand Prix ( formally the <unk> Gran Premio Santander d 'Italia ) was a Formula One motor race held on 14 September 2008 at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza , Monza , Italy . It was the 14th race of the 2008 Formula One season . The 53 @-@ lap race was won by Sebastian Vettel for the Toro Rosso team after starting from pole position . Heikki Kovalainen finished second in a McLaren , and Robert Kubica third in a BMW Sauber . 
 Vettel began the race , started under the safety car , ahead of Kovalainen in second . Red Bull 's Mark Webber started from third . Rain early in the race allowed Vettel to establish a solid lead over Kovalainen , which he extended as the track dried . Kubica and Fernando Alonso finished in the top four after starting from 11th and eighth , respectively . McLaren driver and Drivers ' Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was able to move through the field after qualifying in 15th , finishing in seventh , one place behind rival Felipe Massa , of Ferrari . 
 Vettel 's victory made him the youngest driver to win a Formula One race , at 21 years 73 days in addition to giving Toro Rosso ( which was formerly Minardi team ) its maiden Formula One win . Vettel 's record was broken by Max Verstappen aged 18 years and 228 days at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix . Massa scored one point more than Hamilton , narrowing the McLaren driver 's lead in the Championship once more with four races remaining . However , Kovalainen 's second @-@ placed finish put McLaren closer to catching Ferrari in the Constructors ' Championship . 
 = = Report = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Heading into the 14th race of the season , McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers ' Championship with 76 points ; Ferrari driver Felipe Massa was second on 74 points , two points behind Hamilton . Behind Hamilton and Massa in the Drivers ' Championship , Robert Kubica was third on 58 points in a BMW Sauber , and Massa 's Ferrari teammate Kimi Räikkönen fourth on 57 points . Kubica 's teammate Nick Heidfeld was fifth on 49 points . In the Constructors ' Championship , Ferrari were leading on 131 points and McLaren were second on 119 points , 12 points behind . BMW Sauber were third with 107 points . In the battle for fourth @-@ place Toyota had 41 points , ahead of Renault with 36 points . 
 After the previous race , Hamilton was penalised for cutting a chicane and gaining an advantage over Räikkönen in the closing laps . This meant that Hamilton was demoted from first to third position , giving victory to Massa . While McLaren had lodged an appeal against the decision , the result would not be heard until September 23 . Reflecting on the controversy , Norbert Haug , Vice President of Mercedes @-@ Benz Motorsport , said : 
 Our disappointment was big , when the stewards took away victory from him [ Hamilton ] and the team . However , we are fighters . If we would have needed a better motivation for the last five races of the season we have it now . When we went to the airport last Sunday evening , Lewis said to me - preferably we now want to win all remaining races , don 't we ? I have no objection . 
 Following the rain @-@ soaked Belgian Grand Prix , Massa expressed his hope that the Italian Grand Prix would be held on a dry track , saying " it would be nice not to have the rain here and not have any opportunity to have a consistent race . " The close nature of the Championship meant that Ferrari 's home race had the potential to be a turning point in the season . Testing at the Monza circuit in early September had indicated that the performance gap between McLaren and Ferrari had narrowed . Despite this , Ferrari were hoping that their straight @-@ line speed would be better suited to Monza 's long straights . Ferrari confirmed on September 12 that Räikkönen would continue to drive for the team until at least 2010 , ending media speculation that he could be about to retire . 
 = = = Practice and qualifying = = = 
 Three practice sessions were held before the race : the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon . Both sessions lasted 90 minutes . The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour . All three sessions were affected by rain , with only the second giving teams any chance to run dry @-@ weather tyres . Adrian Sutil was quickest with a time of 1 : 32 @.@ 842 in the first session , more than half a second quicker than the next fastest drivers Rubens Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella . Timo Glock was the next quickest , almost four seconds behind Sutil . Conditions were so poor that six drivers , including both McLarens , failed to set times . The session was stopped four minutes early , though by that time no cars had entered the track for at least ten minutes . The track dried out in the second session ; Räikkönen adapted best to the changed conditions with a lap of 1 : 23 @.@ 861 , significantly quicker than his morning time . Kubica was the next fastest , with his BMW teammate Heidfeld in third . Hamilton , Nico Rosberg and Massa rounded out the top six . Glock was fastest in the final session with a time of 1 : 35 @.@ 464 , followed by Sebastian Vettel , Rosberg , Jarno Trulli , Kazuki Nakajima and Heidfeld . Hamilton only completed eight laps , and finished last with a time almost 11 seconds behind Glock . 
 The qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three parts . The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 16th or lower . The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 15 . The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth , and decided pole position . Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race , and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions . 
 Vettel became the youngest driver in the history of Formula One to take pole position , with a time of 1 : 37 @.@ 555 in very wet conditions . He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kovalainen . Mark Webber qualified third after his final lap pushed Sébastien Bourdais into fourth position . Massa took sixth position behind Rosberg . Trulli , Fernando Alonso , Glock and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten . Kubica qualified 11th , blaming late rain in the second qualifying session for his position . Fisichella qualified 12th to give Force India its best grid position of the season . Both Räikkönen and Hamilton blamed a late entry into the second session for their poor qualifying times , which saw them eliminated in 14th and 15th positions , respectively . Hamilton originally ran on the standard wet @-@ weather tyres , and by the time he had changed to extreme wet @-@ weather tyres the rain had intensified . This was McLaren 's only result outside the top ten in qualifying all season and the first time in Hamilton 's career that he had failed to progress into the final qualifying session .

 Heavy rain prior to the race made the track very slippery , with more rain expected throughout the day . The air temperature at the track was 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) . Jenson Button and Kazuki Nakajima started the race from the pit @-@ lane , their teams choosing to make adjustments from qualifying to the set @-@ ups of their cars . All cars were using extreme wet @-@ weather tyres . The race began at 14 : 00 local time ( UTC + 1 ) behind the safety car because of the rain , meaning that there would be a rolling start . Bourdais ' car stalled on the grid , and was pushed back to the pits . By the time his team restarted the car , he was in last position and one lap down . 
 The safety car pulled into the pit @-@ lane at the end of the second lap . Vettel retained his lead into the first corner , followed by Kovalainen , Webber , Rosberg and Massa . Kubica passed Heidfeld at the first chicane ; Glock passed Alonso later in the lap . Vettel immediately opened a lead of two seconds over Kovalainen ; the McLaren driver experienced visibility problems as a result of the spray off the back of the Toro Rosso . Alonso regained seventh from Glock when he passed him at the first chicane on lap four as the track began to dry . Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Coulthard on the same lap to take 12th and 13th positions , respectively . The next lap , Hamilton attempted to pass Räikkönen at the third corner , but overshot , cutting the chicane . Emerging ahead of the Ferrari , he gave the place back , returning the advantage and avoiding a penalty . Glock spun on lap seven , losing one place to Kubica . 
 Vettel continued to open his lead on Kovalainen ; by lap eight it stood at 6 @.@ 3 seconds . Both Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Fisichella in separate manoeuvres over the next two laps . Hamilton took 11th position from Räikkönen on lap 11 , <unk> the Ferrari at turn four . Fisichella collided with Coulthard two laps later . As a result of the contact , the Force India 's front wing broke loose and lodged under the car . Consequently , Fisichella lost control at turn nine , spinning into the gravel trap and retiring . Massa overtook Rosberg for fourth on the same lap , beginning a close fight where both drivers repeatedly exchanged positions over the next three laps . Massa eventually consolidated fourth position on lap 15 . Hamilton passed Heidfeld , Glock , Kubica and Alonso in separate manoeuvres , to sit in seventh by lap 19 . 
 Vettel pitted from first position on lap 18 . Kovalainen , Webber and Massa pitted four laps later . Light rain began to fall on lap 26 , though only lasted five minutes . Glock , Trulli , Räikkönen and Hamilton completed their first pit stops over the following laps . Coulthard was the first driver to try intermediate wet @-@ weather tyres when he pitted on lap 28 . He lost grip in the wet and went straight through the first chicane . Alonso , Heidfeld , Kubica and Piquet took their only pit stops for the race soon after , all changing to intermediate tyres . By lap 36 the majority of the field were running on intermediate tyres . Webber was passed at turn eight by Massa on lap 35 . The Australian spun after the corner , though managed to retain seventh position . A lap later , however , Hamilton <unk> Webber at turn three and demoted the Red Bull driver to eighth . 
 Hamilton began lapping fastest , recording a 1 : 32 @.@ 869 on lap 38 , more than a second faster than first @-@ placed Vettel . Lap 45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps ; Kubica 's 1 : 32 @.@ 366 was beaten by Webber with a 1 : <unk> They were then superseded by Räikkönen , who set a 1 : 31 @.@ 691 . On lap 49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane , but the two cars touched wheels . Webber was forced down the escape road , and when he emerged in front of Hamilton , he returned the position . Räikkönen continued to move through the field ; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninth position . Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turn nine , but succeeded only in turning into the Red Bull RB4 , sending it into the gravel trap . Coulthard pitted for a new front wing , which dropped him to 17th . Vettel crossed the finish line on lap 53 by 12 @.@ 5 seconds over Kovalainen , becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix . The one @-@ stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth , respectively . Heidfeld , Massa , Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight . Räikkönen finished in ninth position , setting the fastest laptime of 1 : 28 @.@ 047 on the final lap .

 The top three finishers appeared on the podium and in the subsequent press conference . Vettel acknowledged the support of his team , saying the set @-@ up of the car perfectly suited the way the race developed . Other drivers congratulated Vettel ; Hamilton said that " with all that pressure it is easier to make mistakes , and he obviously didn 't , so congratulations to him . He did a good job . " The Grand Prix also marked the first win by Toro Rosso , the first non @-@ Ferrari Italian @-@ based team to win since 1957 . Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali paid tribute to the team , who use Ferrari engines , saying " They deserve it , they are close to us , and we are happy to work with them because we are giving them our engine . " 
 Kovalainen expressed his disappointment in finishing second , saying : 
 Clearly not possible to win today . Sebastian and Toro Rosso have been strong all weekend . I had a little bit of a problem earlier on in the race , in the first couple of stints , especially with the extreme wet tyre and some problems also to warm up my brakes , so I was just struggling to find more time and trying to go faster . We kept pushing and towards the end it got a little bit better but I think it was the maximum we could do today . We picked up some good points and we can look forward to the next grand prix . 
 Hamilton was satisfied with his performance in the race , saying " today was all about damage control : I came away with some points and kept my lead in the world drivers ' championship . " Massa said that he had hoped to do better , but added " I 've managed to make up a point on my nearest rival so this is absolutely not a negative result . " Massa took three points from the race , compared to Hamilton 's two , and narrowed the gap in the Drivers ' Championship to one point with four races remaining . Kovalainen 's second @-@ placed finish closed the gap in the Constructors ' Championship between Ferrari and McLaren from twelve to five points . 
 Third @-@ placed Kubica said that his strategy allowed him to capitalise on the changing track conditions , as his only stop seemed the best time to change to intermediate tyres . The Polish driver said that racing in Italy was particularly special for him , having lived in the country for five years : " That is why we divided the helmet into two pieces . One was Italian colours , one was Polish colours . " Alonso , who used a similar strategy , said " the result today is very good because Monza was supposed to be the race that we were looking forward to the least . " Toyota 's failure to score at the race meant that they were tied with Renault on 41 points .
