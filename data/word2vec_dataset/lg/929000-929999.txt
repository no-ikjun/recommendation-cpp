 This episode received positive reviews . Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic said she found the episode both " <unk> " and " engaging " , as well as later adding that it was " sad " and " frightening " when Jake O 'Connor was accused of murdering his father . Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russell ’ s house , she said that she wanted to " smack " Megan for doing so , saying " What was she thinking ? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn 't let her in . Yet , she went back to find the door open and walked right in . Megan 's intelligent enough to know that something wasn 't right but she 's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation . For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police " . Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they " delve deeper " into Megan 's father 's death , saying that it was " certainly a turning point for the character and I 'd love to know more " .

 = Vincent van Gogh = 
 Vincent Willem van Gogh ( Dutch : [ <unk> <unk> vɑn <unk> ] ; 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890 ) was a Dutch Post @-@ Impressionist painter whose work had a far @-@ reaching influence on 20th @-@ century art . In just over a decade he produced over 2100 artworks , including around 860 oil paintings , the majority created in the last two years of his life . They include portraits , self @-@ portraits , landscapes , still lifes , olive trees , cypresses , wheat fields and sunflowers , and are characterised by symbolic colourisation and dramatic , impulsive and highly expressive paintwork . He sold only one painting during his lifetime and was largely unnoticed by critics until his suicide , aged 37 , which followed years of restless anxiety , poverty and mental illness . 
 Born into an upper @-@ middle @-@ class family , Van Gogh drew as a child , was thoughtful and intellectual but evidenced signs of mental instability . He worked as an art dealer as a young man , but became depressed after he was transferred to London . He turned to religion , spending time as a preacher in southern Belgium , and later drifting in ill health and solitude . He was keenly aware of modernist trends in art , music and literature , and after moving back home with his parents , took up painting in 1881 ; supported financially by his younger brother Theo with whom he had a long correspondence of letters . His early works are mostly depictions of common and peasant labourers , and contain few signs of the vivid colourisation that distinguished his mature period . In 1886 he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists . From then his paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in 1888 . There he lived in the so @-@ called " Yellow house " , and with Paul Gauguin developed a concept of colour that would symbolise inner emotion . 
 Van Gogh suffered from continued psychotic episodes and delusions . His friendship with Gauguin came to an end after a violent encounter during which he threatened the Frenchman with a razor , and in a rage , cut off most of his own right ear . He committed himself to a psychiatric hospital in Saint @-@ Remy , where his condition stabilised , leading to one of the more productive periods of his life . After he moved to Auberge <unk> ( now a French historic landmark ) in the village of Auvers @-@ sur @-@ Oise under the care of the homeopathic doctor and artist , Dr. Gachet . While he was there , Theo wrote that he could no longer support him financially ; a few weeks later , on 27 July 1890 , Van Gogh walked into a wheat field and shot himself in the chest with a revolver . He died two days later . 
 Considered a madman and failure in his lifetime , Van Gogh 's emotionally charged paintings , spontaneous vivid colours , broad oil brushstrokes and early death have led to his current position in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius . His widespread critical , commercial and popular success began after his adoption by the early 20th @-@ century German Expressionists and <unk> . His reputation grew steadily during the 20th century ; today he is remembered as an important but tragic painter , whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist . Art historians typically view him as an exceptionally talented , major influential artist whose mental instability inhibited and frustrated his artistic progression . 
 = = Letters = = 
 The most comprehensive primary source for understanding Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother , the art dealer Theo van Gogh , who saved all of his brother 's letters . Theo provided his brother with financial and emotional support , and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene . The brothers ' lifelong friendship and most of what is known of Vincent 's thoughts and theories of art is recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged between 1872 and 1890 . There are more than 600 from Vincent to Theo , and 40 from Theo to Vincent . Many are undated , but art historians have been able to mostly place them in chronological order . Problems remain , mainly with those from Arles . While there , Vincent wrote around 200 letters , in Dutch , French and English . The period when he lived in Paris is the most difficult to analyse because the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond . Along with those to and from Theo there are other surviving letters , including to Van Rappard , Émile Bernard , Van Gogh 's sister Wil and her friend Line <unk> . 
 The letters were annotated by Theo 's widow , Johanna van Gogh @-@ Bonger , who later said that she was reluctant to publish because she wanted to avoid details of the artist 's life overshadowing his work . She had the letters published in 1913 . Art historian and editor of the letters Arnold <unk> writes : " For the serious reader and the art historian , the publication of these letters added a fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh 's artistic achievement , an understanding granted us by virtually no other painter . " 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot @-@ Zundert , in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands . He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh , a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church , and Anna Cornelia <unk> . Vincent was given the name of his grandfather , and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth . His father , Theodorus , was a clergyman , his mother came from a petite bourgeoisie family in The Hague . The two met when Anna 's younger sister , Cornelia , married Theodorus 's older brother Vincent ( Cent ) . Vincent 's parents married in May 1851 and moved to Zundert . Anna was a rigid and religious woman who raised her family in accordance with Victorian respectability . She emphasised the importance of family to the point of claustrophobia for those around her . Vincent was a common name in the family : his grandfather , Vincent ( 1789 – 1874 ) , received a degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811 , and had six sons , three of whom became art dealers . His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857 . There was another brother , Cor , and three sisters : Elisabeth , Anna , and <unk> ( known as " Wil " ) . In later life Vincent remained in touch only with <unk> and Theo . 
 The family took walks together , and gardened in Anna 's large flower garden . Meals were important , family history was recited and they read aloud each night . In Zundert they represented the top of the social hierarchy . Although Theodorus ' salary was modest , the Church supplied the family with a house , a maid , two cooks , a gardener , a carriage and horse , and Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family 's social position . 
 Vincent took after his fretful mother . He resembled her , moved quickly like her , learned to draw from her , and as a child his attachment was strong , but as he grew older he perceived her coldness toward him as rejection . <unk> and Smith describe him as a difficult child to raise . The frequent and severe punishment he endured at the hand of his parents alienated him from the home and he turned to nature . He enjoyed exploring the countryside alone , taking long walks , often at night in the rain . He was devoted to his brother Theo , four years younger , but the attachment was strained during these years . 
 A serious and thoughtful child , Vincent was taught at home by Anna and a governess , and in 1860 was sent to the village school . In 1864 he was placed in a boarding school at <unk> , where he felt abandoned , and campaigned to come home . In 1866 he moved to the middle school in Tilburg , where he was deeply unhappy . Vincent 's interest in art began at a young age ; his early drawings are expressive , but do not approach the intensity developed in his later work . Constantijn C. Huysmans , a successful artist in Paris , taught the students at Tilburg . His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things , particular nature or common objects . Vincent 's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons and had little effect . In March 1868 , Van Gogh abruptly returned home . Later he wrote that his youth was " gloomy and cold and sterile . " 
 In July 1869 , Vincent 's uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague . Just after Christmas in 1871 his parents moved from Zundert to <unk> . After completing his training in 1873 , Vincent was transferred to Goupil 's London branch , at 17 Southampton Street , and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road , Stockwell . This was a happy time for Vincent ; he was successful at work , and at 20 was earning more than his father . Theo 's wife later remarked that this was the best year of his life . He became infatuated with his landlady 's daughter , Eugénie <unk> , but was rejected after confessing his feelings ; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger . Vincent grew more isolated , and religiously fervent . His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris , where he became difficult and resentful at issues such as the commodification of art , and was eventually dismissed by Goupil . 
 Vincent returned to England , taking unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate . When the proprietor relocated to Isleworth , Middlesex , Van Gogh moved with him . The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister 's assistant . His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten ; in 1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht . He was unhappy in the position and spent his time either doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English , French and German . He immersed himself in religion , became increasingly pious and monastic . According to his room @-@ mate of the time , ( Paulus van Görlitz ) , Van Gogh ate frugally , avoiding meat . 
 To support Vincent 's religious convictions and his desire to become a pastor , in 1877 the family sent him to stay with an uncle in Amsterdam to begin studies in theology . Vincent prepared for the entrance examination with his uncle Johannes Stricker , a respected theologian . He failed the exam , and left his uncle Jan 's house in July 1878 . He undertook , but also failed , a three @-@ month course at the <unk> <unk> , a Protestant missionary school in Laeken , near Brussels . 
 In January 1879 , Vincent took a post as a missionary at Petit <unk> in the coal @-@ mining district of <unk> in Belgium . As a show of support for his impoverished congregation , he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person , and moved to a small hut where he slept on straw . His squalid living conditions did not endear him to church authorities , who dismissed him for " undermining the dignity of the priesthood " . He then walked the 75 kilometres ( 47 mi ) to Brussels , returned briefly to <unk> in the <unk> , but gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten . He stayed there until around March 1880 , which caused concern and frustration for his parents . There was particular conflict between Vincent and his father , who considered committing him to the lunatic asylum at <unk> . 
 Vincent returned to <unk> , where he lodged with a miner until October . He was interested in the people and scenes around him , and recorded his time there in his drawings after Theo 's suggestion that he take up art in earnest . He travelled to Brussels later in the year , to follow Theo 's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs , who persuaded him – in spite of his aversion to formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux @-@ Arts . He registered at the Académie in November 1880 , where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modeling and perspective . 
 = = = Etten , Drenthe and The Hague = = = 
 Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents . He continued to draw , often using his neighbours as subjects . In August 1881 , he went on long walks with his recently widowed cousin , Kee Vos @-@ Stricker , daughter of his mother 's older sister <unk> and Johannes Stricker . Kee was seven years older and had an eight @-@ year @-@ old son . Vincent surprised everyone by declaring to her his love and proposing marriage . She refused with the words " No , nay , never " ( " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> " ) . After Kee went back to Amsterdam , Van Gogh went to The Hague to sell paintings and to meet with his cousin , Anton Mauve . Van Gogh wanted to apprentice himself to Mauve who was successful , had a nice studio , was , according to <unk> and Smith , " the artist Vincent wanted to be " . Mauve invited Van Gogh to return in a few months and suggested he spend the time working in charcoal and pastels ; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed that advice . 
 Late that November , Van Gogh wrote a strongly worded letter to Johannes Stricker , and left for Amsterdam . Kee would not meet him , her parents wrote that his " persistence is disgusting . " In desperation , he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp , with the words : " Let me see her for as long as I can keep my hand in the flame . " He did not recall the event well , but later assumed that his uncle blew out the flame . Kee 's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry , largely because of Van Gogh 's inability to support himself . 
 From Amsterdam , Van Gogh returned to The Hague and asked Mauve to take him on as a student . Mauve introduced him to watercolours , which Van Gogh spent the next month working on , before his father came to take him home for Christmas . That Christmas he refused to attend church , quarreling with his father as a result , and left the same day for The Hague . He relocated to The Hague in January 1882 . Mauve introduced him to painting in oil and lent him money to set up a studio . Within the month , they fell out , possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts . Van Gogh could only afford to hire people from the street as models , which Mauve seems to have disapproved of . In June he suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital . Soon after , he first began to paint in oil , using money borrowed from Theo . He liked the medium , and spread the oils liberally , scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush . He wrote that he was surprised at how good the results were . 
 Mauve seems to have suddenly gone cold towards Van Gogh and stopped replying to his letters . Van Gogh supposed that Mauve had learned of his new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute , <unk> Maria " Sien " <unk> ( 1850 – 1904 ) , and her young daughter . He had met Sien towards the end of January 1883 , when she had a five @-@ year @-@ old daughter and was pregnant . She had previously borne two children who died , but Van Gogh was unaware of this ; on 2 July , she gave birth to a baby boy , Willem . When Van Gogh 's father discovered the details of their relationship , he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children . Vincent at first defied him , and considered moving the family out of the city , but in late 1883 he left Sien and the children . Perhaps lack of money pushed Sien back into prostitution ; the home became less happy and Van Gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development . Sien gave her daughter to her mother , and baby Willem to her brother . 
 Willem remembered a visit with his mother in Rotterdam around aged 12 , when his uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry in order to legitimise the child . Willem recalled his mother saying , " But I know who the father is . He was an artist I lived with nearly 20 years ago in The Hague . His name was Van Gogh . " She then turned to Willem and said " You are called after him . " He believed Van Gogh was his father , but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely . In 1904 , Sien drowned herself in the River Scheldt . Van Gogh moved to the Dutch province of Drenthe , in the northern Netherlands . That December , driven by loneliness , he went to stay with his parents , who had been posted to Nuenen , North Brabant . 
 = = = Emerging artist = = = 
 = = = = Nuenen and Antwerp ( 1883 – 86 ) = = = = 
 In Nuenen , Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing . He completed several sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages . In late 1884 , Margot <unk> , a neighbour 's daughter and ten years his senior , often joined him on his painting forays . She fell in love , and he reciprocated – though less enthusiastically . They decided to marry , but the idea was opposed by both families . As a result , Margot took an overdose of strychnine . She was saved when Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital . On 26 March 1885 , his father died of a heart attack . 
 There was interest from collectors in Paris . In May he completed his first major work , The Potato Eaters , and the series of " peasant character studies " ; the culmination of several years of work . In August his work was first exhibited in the windows of the paint dealer <unk> in The Hague . After one of his young peasant sitters became pregnant that September , Van Gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her and the village priest forbade parishioners to model for him . 
 Van Gogh painted several groups of still lifes in 1885 . During his two @-@ year stay in Nuenen , he completed numerous drawings and watercolours and nearly 200 oil paintings . His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones , particularly dark brown , and showed no sign of the vivid colouration that distinguishes his later work . When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris , his brother responded that the paintings were too dark and not in line with the current style of bright Impressionist paintings . Van Gogh moved to Antwerp in November 1885 , where he rented a small room above a paint dealer 's shop in the Rue des Images ( Lange <unk> ) . He lived in poverty and ate poorly , preferring to spend the money Theo sent on painting materials and models . Bread , coffee and tobacco were his staple intake . In February 1886 , he wrote to Theo saying that he could only remember eating six hot meals since May 1885 . His teeth became loose and painful . In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of colour theory and spent time in museums — particularly studying the work of Peter Paul Rubens — and broadened his palette to carmine , cobalt blue and emerald green . Van Gogh bought Japanese ukiyo @-@ e woodcuts in the docklands , later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings . 
 Van Gogh began again to drink heavily , especially absinthe . He was treated by Amadeus <unk> , possibly for syphilis ; the treatment of alum irrigation and sitz baths was jotted down by Van Gogh in one of his notebooks . Despite his rejection of academic teaching , he took the higher @-@ level admission exams at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp , and in January 1886 matriculated in painting and drawing . For most of February , he was ill and run down by overwork , a poor diet and excessive smoking . 
 = = = = Paris ( 1886 – 88 ) = = = = 
 Van Gogh relocated to Paris in March 1886 , beginning a series of moves that the art historian Melissa McQuillan believes also reflects later changes " in style , his reorientation of his enterprise [ which ] might be linked " . She believes that " moving on became a way of avoiding conflict , " and a coping mechanism for when the highly idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation . 
 In Paris he shared Theo 's Rue Laval apartment in Montmartre , and studied at Fernand Cormon 's studio . In June , they took a larger flat at 54 Rue Lepic . Because they had no need to write letters to communicate with each other , little is known about this stay in Paris . In Paris , he painted portraits of friends and acquaintances , still life paintings , views of Le Moulin de la Galette , scenes in Montmartre , Asnières , and along the Seine . During his stay , he collected more Japanese ukiyo @-@ e woodblock prints ; he became interested in <unk> when , in 1885 in Antwerp , he used them to decorate the walls of his studio . He collected hundreds of prints . In The Courtesan or <unk> ( after <unk> Eisen ) ( 1887 ) , Van Gogh traced the figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine Paris Illustre , which he then graphically enlarged in the painting . 
 After seeing the portrait of Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli at the Galerie <unk> , Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack , particularly in paintings such as his <unk> at Saintes @-@ Maries ( 1888 ) . Two years later , Vincent and Theo paid for the publication of a book on Monticelli paintings , and Vincent bought some of his works to add to his collection . 
 For months , Van Gogh worked at Cormon 's studio , where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist John Peter Russell , and met fellow students Émile Bernard , Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse @-@ Lautrec – who painted a portrait of Van Gogh with pastel . The group congregated at Julien " Père " Tanguy 's paint store ( which was , at that time , the only place where Paul Cézanne 's paintings were displayed ) . He had easy access to Impressionist works in Paris . In 1886 , two large exhibitions were staged , in which Neo @-@ Impressionism was first exhibited , bringing attention to Georges Seurat and Paul Signac . Though Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on Boulevard Montmartre , Van Gogh seemingly had problems acknowledging the new developments in art . 
 Conflicts arose between the brothers . At the end of 1886 , Theo found that living with Vincent was " almost unbearable " . By early 1887 , they were again at peace , and Vincent had moved to Asnières , a northwestern suburb of Paris , where he became acquainted with Signac . He adopted elements of <unk> , a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas such that – when seen from a distance – they create an optical blend of hues . The style stresses the value of complementary colours – including blue and orange – to form vibrant contrasts that are enhanced when juxtaposed . 
 While in Asnières , Van Gogh painted parks and restaurants and the Seine , including Bridges across the Seine at Asnières . In November 1887 , Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris . Towards the end of the year , Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard , Anquetin , and probably Toulouse @-@ Lautrec , at the Grand @-@ Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet , 43 Avenue de Clichy , Montmartre . In a contemporary account , Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris . There Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings , and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin . Discussions on art , artists , and their social situations started during this exhibition , and continued and expanded to include visitors to the show , like Pissarro and his son Lucien , Signac and Seurat . In February 1888 , feeling worn out from life in Paris , he left , having painted over 200 paintings during his two years there . Only hours before his departure , accompanied by Theo , he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio .

 = = = = Arles ( 1888 – 89 ) = = = = 
 Ill from drink and suffering from smoker 's cough , Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles . He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding a utopian art colony ; The Danish artist Christian <unk> @-@ Petersen became his companion for two months , and at first Arles appeared exotic . In a letter , he described it as a foreign country : " The Zouaves , the brothels , the adorable little <unk> going to their First Communion , the priest in his surplice , who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros , the people drinking absinthe , all seem to me creatures from another world . " 
 Van Gogh was enchanted by the local landscape and light and his works from this period are richly draped in yellow , ultramarine and mauve . He made several excursions into nature during his time there . His paintings include harvests , wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area , including The Old Mill ( 1888 ) , a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields . This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont @-@ Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange for works with Paul Gauguin , Émile Bernard , Charles Laval and others . Van Gogh 's portrayals of the Arles landscape are informed by his Dutch upbringing ; the patchwork of fields and avenues appear flat and lacking perspective , but excel in their colourisation . His newfound appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work . That March he painted landscapes using a gridded " perspective frame " ; three of which were shown at the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants . In April , he was visited by the American artist Dodge MacKnight , who was living nearby at <unk> . On 1 May , he signed a lease for 15 francs per month in the eastern wing of the Yellow House at No. 2 Place Lamartine . The rooms were unfurnished and uninhabited for some time . 
 He moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare on 7 May , having befriended the proprietors , Joseph and Marie Ginoux . The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in , but Van Gogh was able to use it as a studio . He wanted a gallery to display his work , a series of paintings including Van Gogh 's Chair ( 1888 ) , Bedroom in Arles ( 1888 ) , The Night Café ( 1888 ) , Cafe Terrace at Night ( September 1888 ) , Starry Night Over the Rhone ( 1888 ) , and Still Life : Vase with Twelve Sunflowers ( 1888 ) , all intended for the <unk> for the Yellow House . Van Gogh wrote that with The Night Café he tried " to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself , go mad , or commit a crime . " In his letters he said that he sought to express the " terrible passions of humanity " by means of red and green . When he visited Saintes @-@ Maries @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Mer that June , he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant – Paul @-@ Eugène Milliet – and painted boats on the sea and the village . MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to Eugène Boch , a Belgian painter who stayed at times in <unk> , and the two exchanged visits in July . 
 = = = = Gauguin 's visit = = = = 
 When Gauguin agreed to visit Arles , Van Gogh hoped for friendship , and the realisation of his utopian idea of an artists ' collective . While waiting that August he painted sunflowers . When Boch visited again , Van Gogh painted a portrait of him , as well as the study The Poet Against a Starry Sky . Boch 's sister Anna ( 1848 – 1936 ) , also an artist , purchased The Red Vineyard in 1890 . 
 In preparation for Gauguin 's visit , Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from his friend , the station 's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin , whose portrait he painted . On 17 September he spent the first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House . When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him , Van Gogh started to work on The <unk> for the Yellow House , probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook . Van Gogh completed two chair paintings : Van Gogh 's Chair and Gauguin 's Chair . 
 Gauguin , after much pleading from Van Gogh , arrived in Arles on 23 October , and that November the two finally painted together . Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his The Painter of Sunflowers : Portrait of Vincent van Gogh , while , uncharacteristically , Van Gogh painted pictures from memory ( deferring to Gauguin 's ideas ) and his The Red Vineyard . Among these " imaginative " paintings is Memory of the Garden at Etten . Their first joint outdoor venture was at the <unk> , when they produced Les <unk> pendants . 
 They visited Montpellier that December , where they saw works by Courbet and Delacroix in the Musée Fabre . Their relationship began to deteriorate ; Van Gogh admired Gauguin and desperately wanted to be treated as his equal , but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering , traits that frustrated Van Gogh . They often quarrelled ; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him and the situation , which Van Gogh described as one of " excessive tension , " rapidly headed towards crisis point . 
 = = = = December 1888 = = = = 
 The exact sequence of events that led to Van Gogh 's removal of his ear is not known . Gauguin claimed , fifteen years later , that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour . Their relationship was complex , and there may have been money owed by Theo to Gauguin , who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially . Van Gogh seems to have attacked Gauguin on the night of 23 December , possibly with a razor , but this is uncorroborated . It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave and that there had been some kind of contretemps between the two . That evening , Van Gogh wholly severed his left ear with a razor , inducing a severe haemorrhage . A note from his doctor Félix Rey , written in 1930 for Irving Stone and including a drawing of the severed ear , made clear that Van Gogh had cut off his whole ear , except for a small part of the lobe . He bandaged the wound , wrapped the ear in paper , and delivered the package to Gabrielle <unk> , a farmer 's daughter nicknamed Rachel , a teenager who worked at a brothel frequented by both him and Gauguin . Van Gogh was taken by Roulin to either his home or a hotel , where he collapsed . He would have likely bled to death had he not been found unconscious the next morning by the police and hospitalised . 
 Gauguin 's account implies that Van Gogh left his ear with the doorman as a memento for Gauguin . Van Gogh had no recollection of the event , and it is plain that he had suffered an acute psychotic episode . Family letters of the time make it clear that the breakdown had not been unexpected . He had suffered a nervous collapse three years before in Antwerp , and as early as 1880 his father had proposed committing him to an asylum at <unk> . The hospital diagnosis was " generalised delirium " , and within a few days the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care . 
 During the first days of his treatment , Van Gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin . The French artist asked a policeman attending the case to " be kind enough , Monsieur , to awaken this man with great care , and if he asks for me tell him I have left for Paris ; the sight of me might prove fatal for him . " Gauguin wrote of Van Gogh , " His state is worse , he wants to sleep with the patients , chase the nurses , and washes himself in the coal bucket . That is to say , he continues the biblical <unk> . " Theo was notified by Gauguin and visited , as did Madame Ginoux and Roulin . Gauguin fled Arles , never to see Van Gogh again . 
 Despite the pessimistic diagnosis , Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House by the beginning of January , but spent the following month between hospital and home , suffering from hallucinations and delusions of poisoning . That March , the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople ( including the Ginoux family ) who described him as " le <unk> roux " ( the redheaded madman ) . Paul Signac spent time with him in the hospital , and Van Gogh was allowed home in his company . In April , he moved into rooms owned by his physician Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home . Around this time , he wrote , " Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish , sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant . " Two months later , he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in Saint @-@ Rémy @-@ de @-@ Provence . 
 = = = = Saint @-@ Rémy ( May 1889 – May 1890 ) = = = = 
 Van Gogh entered the hospital at Saint Paul @-@ de @-@ <unk> on 8 May 1889 accompanied by his carer , Frédéric Salles , a Protestant clergyman . The hospital was a former monastery in Saint @-@ Rémy less than 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) from Arles , and at the time run by a former naval doctor , Dr. Théophile Peyron . He had two small rooms : adjoining cells with barred windows . The second was to be used as a studio . 
 During his stay , the clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings . He made several studies of the hospital interiors , such as Vestibule of the Asylum and Saint @-@ Remy ( September 1889 ) . Some of his work from this time are characterised by swirls , including The Starry Night . He was allowed short supervised walks , which led to paintings of cypresses and olive trees , such as Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889 , Cypresses 1889 , Cornfield with Cypresses ( 1889 ) , Country road in Provence by Night ( 1890 ) . That September , he produced a further two versions of Bedroom in Arles . 
 Limited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter . He was left to work on interpretations of other artist 's paintings , such as Millet 's The Sower and Noon – Rest from Work ( after Millet ) , as well as variations on his own earlier work . Van Gogh was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton , Gustave Courbet and Millet , and he compared his copies to a musician 's interpreting Beethoven . Many of his most compelling works date from this period . His The Round of the Prisoners ( 1890 ) was painted after an engraving by Gustave Doré ( 1832 – 1883 ) . It is suggested that the face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting and looking toward the viewer is Van Gogh himself , although the Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker discounts this . 
 Between February and April 1890 he suffered a severe relapse . Nevertheless , he was able to paint and draw a little during this time , and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases " from memory ... reminisces of the North . " Amongst these was Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow @-@ Covered Field at Sunset . Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time . He comments that – save for this short period – Van Gogh 's illness had hardly any effect on his work , but sees a reflection of Van Gogh 's mental health at the time . Also belonging to this period is <unk> Old Man ( " At Eternity 's Gate " ) , a colour study that Hulsker describes as " another unmistakable remembrance of times long past . " 
 In February 1890 , he painted five versions of L 'Arlésienne ( Madame Ginoux ) , based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888 . The version intended for Madame Ginoux is lost . It was attempting to deliver this painting to Madame Ginoux in Arles that precipitated his February relapse . His work was praised by Albert Aurier in the Mercure de France in January 1890 , when he was described as " a genius " . That February , he was invited by Les XX , a society of avant @-@ garde painters in Brussels , to participate in their annual exhibition . At the opening dinner , Les XX member Henry de <unk> insulted Van Gogh 's work . Toulouse @-@ Lautrec demanded satisfaction , while Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh 's honour if Lautrec surrendered . Later , while Van Gogh 's exhibit was on display with the Artistes Indépendants in Paris , Claude Monet said that his work was the best in the show . In February 1890 , following the birth of his nephew , he wrote about the new addition to the family " I started right away to make a picture for him , to hang in their bedroom , branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky . " 
 = = = = Auvers @-@ sur @-@ Oise ( May – July 1890 ) = = = = 
 In May 1890 , Van Gogh left the clinic in Saint @-@ Rémy to move nearer to both Dr. Paul Gachet in Auvers @-@ sur @-@ Oise and to Theo . Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists . Camille Pissarro had recommended him . Van Gogh 's first impression was that Gachet was " <unk> than I am , it seemed to me , or let 's say just as much . " In June 1890 , he painted several portraits of his doctor , including Portrait of Dr. Gachet , and his only etching . In each the emphasis is on Gachet 's melancholic disposition . 
 During his last weeks at Saint @-@ Rémy , Van Gogh 's thoughts returned to his " memories of the North " , and several of the approximately 70 oils painted during as many days in Auvers @-@ sur @-@ Oise , are reminiscent of northern scenes . Barbizon painter Charles <unk> had moved to Auvers in 1861 , and in turn drew other artists there , including Camille Corot and Honoré Daumier . In July 1890 , Van Gogh completed two paintings of <unk> 's Garden ; one of which is likely his final work . There are other paintings that show evidence of being unfinished , including Thatched Cottages by a Hill . 
 Van Gogh 's late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities , according to art critic Robert Hughes , " longing for concision and grace " . Many of these works are somber , and reflective of a desire to return to lucid mental health . Yet some reflect deepening concerns . In July 1890 , Van Gogh wrote that he had become absorbed " in the immense plain against the hills , boundless as the sea , delicate yellow . " He had become captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green . In July he described to Theo " vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies " . He wrote that they represented his " sadness and extreme loneliness " , and that the " canvases will tell you what I cannot say in words , that is , how healthy and invigorating I find the countryside . " Wheatfield with Crows is a painting Hulsker discusses as being associated with " melancholy and extreme loneliness . " Hulsker identifies seven oil paintings as following the completion of the Wheatfield with Crows in July 1890 while in Auvers .

 = = = Development = = = 
 Van Gogh was a later starter . He drew and painted with watercolours while at school , but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged . When he took up art as an adult , he began at an elementary level . In early 1882 , his uncle , Cornelis Marinus , owner of a well @-@ known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam , asked for drawings of The Hague . Van Gogh 's work did not live up to expectations . Marinus offered a second commission , specifying the subject matter in detail , but was again was disappointed with the result . Nevertheless , Van Gogh persevered . He improved the lighting of his studio by installing variable shutters and experimented with different drawing materials . For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborated studies in " Black and White " , which at the time gained him only criticism . Today , they are recognised as his first masterpieces . 
 In August 1882 , Theo gave Vincent a donation , used to purchase materials conducive to working en plein air . Vincent wrote that he could now " go on painting with new vigour " . From early in 1883 he worked on multi @-@ figure compositions , on which he based on his drawings . He had some of them photographed , but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness , he destroyed them and turned to oil painting . Van Gogh turned to renowned Hague School artists like <unk> and <unk> , and received technical support from them , as well as from painters like De Bock and Van der <unk> , both second generation Hague School artists . When he moved to Nuenen after the intermezzo in Drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them . The Potato Eaters and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived . Following a visit to the Rijksmuseum , Van Gogh was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of technical experience . So in November 1885 he travelled to Antwerp and later to Paris to learn and develop his skill . 
 Theo criticised The Potato Eaters for its dark palette , which he thought unsuitable for a modern style . During Van Gogh 's stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887 , he quickly tried to master a new , lighter palette . His Portrait of Père Tanguy ( 1887 ) , shows his success with the brighter palette ; with its colour innovations it is evidence of an evolving personal style . Charles Blanc 's treatise on colour interested him intensely , which led him to work on with complementary colours . Van Gogh came to the conclusion that colour went beyond descriptive ; he said that " colour expresses something in itself " ( <unk> ) . According to Hughes , Van Gogh perceived colour as having a " psychological and moral weight " , as characterised in the garish reds and greens of The Night Cafe , a work he wanted " to express the terrible passions of humanity " . Yellow was the colour that meant the most to him , which he spent the most time in mastering , because it symbolized emotional truth . Yellow was the colour he used as a symbol for sunlight , life , and God . 
 Throughout his career Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and of nature , and during his first summer in Arles he brought the more modern palette to bear on landscapes and traditional rural life . His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power , or the essence of nature in his art , sometimes through the use of symbols . His renditions of the sower , at first copied from Jean @-@ François Millet , reflect Van Gogh 's own religious beliefs : the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun . These were themes and motifs he returned to often to revise , rework and develop . His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism but not traditional Christian iconography ; rather he made up his own where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life . In the summer in Arles , under a hot sun and having gained confidence after a bout of painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight , he was ready to paint The Sower . The juxtaposition of saturated complementary colours and the single figure in the landscape represents a unique innovative style . 
 Van Gogh stayed within what he called the " guise of reality " , and was critical of overly abstract or stylised works . He did try his hand at stylisation and abstraction , notably with Starry Night – but he said about that painting that reality had " receded too far in the background " . Hughes describes Starry Night as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy : the stars are in a great whirl , reminiscent of Hokusai 's Great Wave , the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below , and the painter 's vision is " translated into a thick , emphatic plasma of paint . " 
 Between 1885 and his death in 1890 , he appears to have been building an oeuvre , a collection that not only reflected his personal vision , but could be commercially successful . He was influenced by Blanc 's definition of style , that a true painting required optimal use of colour , perspective and brushstrokes . Van Gogh applied the word " purposeful " to paintings he thought he had mastered , as opposed to those he thought of as studies . He painted studies and went so far as to create many series of studies . Most of his studies were of still lifes , many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends . The finished paintings – such as Night Cafe and Starry Night , are the works he considered part of his oeuvre . The work in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre : those he thought the most important from that time were The Sower , Night Cafe , Memory of the Garden in Etten and Starry Night . With their broad brushstrokes , inventive perspectives , colours , contours and designs , these are the paintings that represent the style he sought . He considered The Bedroom his best work of that period , because the inventive use of perspective , combined with Impressionist techniques , resulted in the style he sought . 
 In the end , the style he found was revolutionary " in the very look of his pictures , their coarseness and deliberately unfinished quality , the vigor with which they were painted . " His art , with its emphasis on the common people and a wish for a better world , is the precursor to the 20th century and to Modernism . 
 = = = Major series = = = 
 Van Gogh 's stylistic developments are usually linked to periods he spent living in different locations across Europe . He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions , although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout . His evolution as a painter was slow , and he was aware of his painterly limitations ; many of his early works could be described as gauche . He moved home often , perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimulants and through exposure develop his technical skill . 
 = = = = Portraits = = = = 
 Van Gogh is best known for his landscapes , but he seemed to have believed that portraits were his greatest ambition . He said of portrait studies , that they were " the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite . " He wrote to his sister that he " should like to paint portraits which appear after a century to people living then as apparitions ... I do not endeavour to achieve this through photographic resemblance , but my means of our impassioned emotions – that is to say using our knowledge and our modern taste for colour as a means of arriving at the expression and the intensification of the character . " Those closest to him are mostly absent from his portraits ; he rarely painted Theo , van Rappard or Bernard . The portraits of his mother were from photographs . 
 Portraiture represented his best opportunity of earning money . Some of the portraits are studies . Those with greater significance , which he considered finished paintings , are identifiable with the subject holding an object such as a book , and tend to exhibit more stylisation than his other work . In December 1888 , he painted La Berceuse – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflower still lifes . It had a limited palette , varied brushstrokes and simple contours . 
 = = = = Cypresses = = = = 
 The cypresses , numbering some fifteen canvases , are among Van Gogh 's most popular and widely known series . In mid @-@ 1889 , at his sister Wil 's request , he made several smaller versions of Wheat Field with Cypresses . The trees , traditionally associated with death and cemeteries , held a symbolic value for Van Gogh , and he brought life to them . The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto , and include one of his best @-@ known paintings , The Starry Night . 
 Other works include Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background ( 1889 ) Cypresses ( 1889 ) , Cypresses with Two Figures ( 1889 – 90 ) , Road with Cypress and Star ( 1890 ) and Starry Night Over the Rhone ( 1888 ) . Road with Cypress and Star ( 1890 ) is as compositionally unreal and artificial as The Starry Night . It represents an exalted experience of reality , what both Van Gogh and Gauguin referred to as an " abstraction " . Referring to Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background , on or around 18 June 1889 , in a letter to his brother , Van Gogh wrote , " At last I have a landscape with olives and also a new study of a Starry Night . " While in the asylum , he went outside to paint olive trees ; these are rendered as gnarled and arthritic ; as Hughes explains , they are seemingly filled with " a continuous field of energy of which nature is a manifestation " . 
 = = = = Orchards = = = = 
 The series of Flowering Orchards , also the Orchards in Blossom , are among the first groups of work that Van Gogh completed after his arrival in Arles in February 1888 . The 14 paintings are optimistic , joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring . They are delicately sensitive , silent , quiet and unpopulated . He painted swiftly , and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism , a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period . The transience of the blossoming trees , of the passing of the season , seemed to align itself with his own sense of transience and belief in a new beginning in Arles , and it presented him with a world of Japanese motifs which he revelled in . Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 and said he had 10 orchards and : " one big [ painting ] of a cherry tree , which I 've spoiled " . 
 During this period he mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and bringing light to the forefront of the trees as if the trees and blossoms themselves are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner . Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards , including View of Arles , Flowering Orchards . Van Gogh was consumed by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France , and often visited the farm gardens near Arles . Because of the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened . 
 = = = = Flowers = = = = 
 Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers , including the View of Arles with Irises , and Irises , Sunflowers , and the lilacs and roses sequences . Some reflect his interests in the language of colour , and also in Japanese ukiyo @-@ e woodblock prints . He completed two series of sunflowers . The first dated from his 1887 stay in Paris , the second during his visit to Arles the following year . The Paris series shows living flowers in the ground , in the second , they are dying in vases . The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist . He intended them to decorate a bedroom where Gauguin was supposed to stay in Arles that August , when the two would create the community of artists Van Gogh had long hoped for . The flowers are rendered with thick brushstrokes and heavy layers of paint . 
 He wrote to Theo in August 1888 , " I 'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse , which won 't surprise you when it 's a question of painting large sunflowers ... If I carry out this plan there 'll be a dozen or so panels . The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow . I work on it all these mornings , from sunrise . Because the flowers wilt quickly and it 's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go . " 
 = = = = Wheat fields = = = = 
 Van Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles . He made paintings featuring harvests , wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area , including The Old Mill ( 1888 ) ; a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond . At various points , Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague , Antwerp , Paris . These works culminated in The Wheat Field series , which depicted the view he could see from his adjoining cells in the asylum at Saint @-@ Rémy . 
 Many of Van Gogh 's late paintings are sombre , but essentially optimistic and , right up to the time of his death , reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health . Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns . Writing in July 1890 , from Auvers , Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed " in the immense plain against the hills , boundless as the sea , delicate yellow . " He was captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green . His <unk> at Auvers with White House shows a more subdued palette of yellows and blues , against the growing wheat and corn , which creates a sense of idyllic harmony . 
 The weather worsened in July . He wrote to Theo of " vast fields of wheat under troubled skies " . In particular , the work Wheatfield with Crows serves as a compelling and poignant expression of the artist 's state of mind in his final days , a painting Hulsker describes as a " doom @-@ filled painting with threatening skies and ill @-@ omened crows . " Its dark palette and heavy brushstrokes conveys a sense of impending doom , of menace . 
 = = = = Self @-@ portraits = = = = 
 Van Gogh produced many self @-@ portraits during his lifetime ; he drew or painted more than 43 between 1886 and 1889 . Generally the self @-@ portraits were studies ; he wanted to learn to paint figures , but lacked models and so used himself . They vary in intensity and colour ; some portray the artist with beard , some without , and others with bandages – in the period after he had severed his ear . Self @-@ portrait without beard , from late September 1889 , was one of the most expensive paintings at the time of its 1998 sale , when it sold for $ 71 @.@ 5 million in New York . It was Van Gogh 's last self @-@ portrait , intended as a birthday gift to his mother . 
 Self @-@ portraits from Saint @-@ Rémy show the head from the right , hiding his severed ear . During the final weeks of his life in Auvers @-@ sur @-@ Oise , he produced many paintings , but no self @-@ portraits , as he returned to painting the natural world . 
 His self @-@ portraits reflect the intense degree of self @-@ scrutiny that is seldom if ever apparent in an artist , according to Hughes . 
 = = Death = = 
 He underwent a further crisis in February 1890 . Although depressed and unable to bring himself to write , he continued , however , to draw and paint . For a year he " had fits of despair and hallucination during which he could not work , between long clear months in which he could and did , punctuated by extreme visionary ecstasy . " 
 On 27 July 1890 , aged 37 , Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver . There were no witnesses . The location of the shooting may have been in the wheat field he had been painting recently , or a local barn . The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine . He was able to walk back to the Auberge <unk> , where he was attended by two doctors . Without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed . The doctors tended to him as best they could , then left him alone in his room , smoking his pipe . The following morning , Theo rushed to his brother as soon as notified , and found him in surprisingly good health . But within hours Vincent began to fail , suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound . He died that evening , 29 hours after the gunshot . According to Theo , Vincent 's last words were : " The sadness will last forever " . 
 He was buried on 30 July , in the municipal cemetery of Auvers @-@ sur @-@ Oise . The funeral was attended by Theo van Gogh , Andries Bonger , Charles Laval , Lucien Pissarro , Émile Bernard , Julien Tanguy and Dr. Gachet among twenty family , friends and locals . Theo suffered from syphilis and his health declined rapidly after Vincent 's death . Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent 's absence , he died six months later , on 25 January , at Den <unk> , and he was buried in Utrecht . In 1914 , the year she had Van Gogh 's letters published , Jo Bonger had Theo 's body exhumed , moved from Utrecht and re @-@ buried with Vincent at Auvers @-@ sur @-@ Oise . 
 There has been numerous debates as to the nature of Van Gogh 's illness and its effect on his work . Over 150 psychiatrists have attempted to label its root , with 30 different diagnoses . These have included schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , syphilis , poisoning from swallowed paints , temporal lobe epilepsy , and acute intermittent porphyria . Any of these could have been the culprit , and could have been aggravated by malnutrition , overwork , insomnia and alcohol , especially absinthe . 
 = = Posthumous fame = = 
 Vincent van Gogh is one of the most famous artists in the world , despite that he was virtually unrecognized during his lifetime . After his first exhibitions in the late 1880s , his reputation grew slowly but steadily among artists , art critics , dealers and collectors . In 1887 André Antoine installed Van Gogh 's paintings alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac , at the Théâtre Libre in Paris some of which were acquired by Julien Tanguy . In 1898 his work was described in " Le <unk> " by the poet Albert Aurier as characterised by " fire , intensity , sunshine " . 
 Soon after Van Gogh 's death in July 1890 his work was collected by Gauguin , Émile <unk> and Émile Bernard . Some works were resold fairly quickly , as in the case of Gauguin who consigned his versions of Sunflowers around 1895 to Ambroise Vollard , who sold them , but failed to pay . Theo 's death in January 1891 removed his most vocal and well connected champion . Theo 's widow , Johanna van Gogh @-@ Bonger , was left with only an apartment in Paris filled with a few items of furniture and the then near valueless works of her brother @-@ in @-@ law Vincent . Memorial exhibitions were held in Brussels , Paris , The Hague and Antwerp . His work was shown in a number of high @-@ profile exhibitions in 1890 , including six works at Les XX , in Brussels that January , ( in 1891 a retrospective ) , and ten paintings were shown at the " Société des Artistes Indépendants " . The following year the art critic Octave Mirbeau wrote that Van Gogh 's suicide was " infinitely sadder loss for art ... even though the populace has not crowned to a magnificent funeral , and poor Vincent van Gogh , whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius , has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he lived . " 
 In 1896 , the Fauvist painter Henri Matisse , then an unknown art student , visited the artist John Peter Russell on the island of Belle Île off Brittany . Russell was an Impressionist painter ; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly , and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days , saying , " I couldn 't stand it any more . " The next year he returned as Russell 's student and abandoned his earth @-@ coloured palette for bright Impressionist colours , later stating , " Russell was my teacher , and Russell explained colour theory to me . " Russell who had been a close friend of Vincent van Gogh ( who was unknown at the time ) introduced Van Gogh 's work to Matisse and gave Matisse a Van Gogh drawing . 
 Retrospectives were held in Paris in 1901 and 1905 , and at the Stedelijk , Amsterdam in 1905 . Important group exhibitions with the Sonderbund artists in Cologne in 1912 , the Armory Show , New York in 1913 , and Berlin in 1914 followed . In 1905 his work was exhibited at <unk> Ernst Arnold in Dresden , which influenced German painters of the Die Brücke – particularly Erich <unk> , Karl Schmidt @-@ Rottluff , and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner . After that exhibition Henk Bremmer was instrumental in teaching and talking about Van Gogh . By 1906 Johanna van Gogh @-@ Bonger could still show a complete set of his works . Johanna was in correspondence with artists , galleries , critics , dealers throughout Europe , and her correspondence shows the role she played with Berlin dealer Paul Cassirer who put on 10 exhibitions , and staged tours to see Vincent 's work . His fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before World War I , aided by the publication of his letters in three volumes in 1914 . These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who both suffered for his art , and died young . 
 In 1934 American novelist Irving Stone published an account of Vincent van Gogh 's life entitled Lust for Life , and according to Stone he relied on Van Gogh 's letters to Theo . This book and later the 1956 movie of the same name added to further enhance the artist 's fame . 
 In 1957 , Francis Bacon based a series of paintings on reproductions of Van Gogh 's The Painter on the Road to Tarascon , the original of which was destroyed during World War II . Bacon was inspired by both an image he described as " haunting " , and by Van Gogh himself , whom he regarded as an alienated outsider , a position which resonated with him . Bacon identified with Van Gogh 's theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo : " [ R ] <unk> painters do not paint things as they are ... [ T ] hey paint them as they themselves feel them to be . " 
 Today his works are among the world 's most expensive paintings . Those sold for over US $ 100 million ( today 's equivalent ) include Portrait of Dr. Gachet , Portrait of Joseph Roulin and Irises . A Wheatfield with Cypresses was acquired in 1993 for US $ 57 million , and Self @-@ Portrait with <unk> Ear was sold privately in the late 1990s for an estimated US $ 80 – 90 million . 
 = The Watch ( 2012 film ) = 
 The Watch ( previously known as Neighborhood Watch ) is a 2012 American science fiction comedy film directed by Akiva Schaffer and written by Jared Stern , Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg . It stars Ben Stiller , Vince Vaughn , Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade . The film follows Evan ( Stiller ) , Bob ( Vaughn ) , Franklin ( Hill ) , and Jamarcus ( Ayoade ) , a group of neighbors who form a suburban neighborhood watch group . When they uncover an alien plot threatening the world , they are forced into action . 
 The film began its development in 2008 under producer Shawn Levy as a teen @-@ targeted project written by Jared Stern . Between 2009 and late 2010 it saw different directors and stars join the project until November 2010 , when it moved in a new direction under Rogen and Goldberg ( who rewrote the script for an adult audience ) . Filming began in October 2011 in the state of Georgia , concluding in January 2012 . 
 The film 's marketing campaign was affected by the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood @-@ watch member . As a result , the campaign was refocused on the alien premise instead of the film leads and the film 's name was changed from Neighborhood Watch to The Watch . Released on July 27 , 2012 , the film received generally negative reviews , with critics focusing on the plot , frequent " vulgar and offensive " jokes and numerous product placements . However , the lead cast was more positively received . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the town of Glenview , Ohio , Evan Trautwig ( Ben Stiller ) is an active participant in the community and senior manager of the local Costco store . His life is disrupted when the store 's night security guard is murdered . The local police have no leads , and show no interest in investigating further . Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice , Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch . However , he only manages to recruit Bob ( Vince Vaughn ) , a construction worker and loving father ; Franklin ( Jonah Hill ) , a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written , physical , and mental @-@ health tests ; and Jamarcus ( Richard Ayoade ) , a recent divorcé . 
 The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun ( much to Evan 's annoyance ) . While driving on patrol , they accidentally hit something . They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly @-@ destructive weapon , and deduce that it is of alien origin . Meanwhile , several more townspeople are mysteriously killed . The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien , which attacks them . Evan ( apparently ) kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob 's house . The creature regains consciousness and escapes , stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town . The watch theorizes that the aliens are stealing their victims ' skin and disguising themselves as humans , so anyone in Glenview could be an alien . Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea ( Erin Moriarty ) , and does not trust her boyfriend Jason ( Nicholas Braun ) . Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby ( Rosemarie DeWitt ) because he is infertile , and revealing that it may cause her to leave . 
 Evan suspects that one of his neighbors is an alien ( due to his strange , stiff way of speaking and because he always seems to be watching him ) . As the watch scouts the neighbor 's house , Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason . Bob disobeys Evan 's orders , and rushes to the party with Franklin . Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea , but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes . Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone , discovering that he ( only ) hosts orgies in his basement . When Bob returns , he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch . Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything . Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby , who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out . 
 Evan then receives an urgent visit from Jamarcus , who confesses that he is one of the aliens but has decided to side with humanity after experiencing human culture ( and oral sex ) . He warns the group that the aliens are building a transmitter ( beneath the Costco store ) which will summon their armada to destroy the earth , and is expelled from the watch for his deception . Bob , Franklin , Evan and Abby arm themselves and infiltrate the Costco to destroy the transmitter . Bob encounters Jason who reveals that he is also an alien , and they fight . Evan and Franklin attempt to disable the transmitter , but are surrounded by aliens . Jamarcus arrives and saves the pair , revealing that the aliens ' brains are located in their crotch ; Bob kills Jason by ripping off his penis . Evan discovers that the transmitter is powered by the metallic orb and removes it , disabling the machine . More aliens arrive , forcing the group to flee . The watch uses the metallic orb to destroy the Costco building , killing all of the aliens inside . 
 In the epilogue , Evan and Abby rekindle their passion and adopt a daughter . Bob is closer to Chelsea and accepts her new boyfriend ( who is intimidated by stories of how Bob killed Jason by " ripping his dick off " ) . Franklin is finally accepted by the Glenview Police Department , and Jamarcus continues participating in the secret neighborhood orgies . The group maintains the watch , continuing to protect Glenview from criminals ( and aliens ) .

 The film began its development as Neighborhood Watch in early 2008 , with Levy developing the project over three years ( based on an idea by 20th Century Fox executive John Fox ) . Levy described his original vision as a " PG @-@ 13 kind of Ghostbusters @-@ y thing . " The original screenplay was written by Jared Stern . In May 2009 , David Dobkin and Will Ferrell were negotiating to direct and star , respectively ( with Dobkin 's involvement progressing to revising Stern 's script ) . However , by August Dobkin and Ferrell had left the project . 
 In December 2009 Peter Segal was in negotiations to direct the film , but by November 2010 the project had not named a director . Also in November , Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were brought onto the project to rewrite the script as an adult @-@ oriented , R @-@ rated film . By June 2011 , Saturday Night Live alumnus Akiva Schaffer was given the option to direct his second feature film ( following the 2007 comedy Hot Rod ) . On May 4 , 2012 ( two months before the film 's release ) , it was renamed The Watch .

 Principal photography began in October 2011 in Georgia , with filming occurring in Atlanta ( including Inman Park ) and several areas in Cobb County ( including the Oakleigh , Echo Mill , and Amberton subdivisions in the city of Powder Springs ) . Filming also took place at Marietta Square in the city of Marietta , where businesses were renamed and an alley behind Hemingway 's Bar & Grill was treated to artificially age the buildings . One of the Marietta scenes filmed involved a young boy on a skateboard being abducted by aliens . Scenes were also filmed in the Brookhaven community . On October 25 , 2011 , a casting call was made for extras to fill the football stadium during two nights of filming on November 2 – 3 at Campbell High School in Smyrna , Georgia . On November 23 , 2011 a minor , walk @-@ on role in the film was auctioned to benefit the Stiller Foundation ; the role was sold for $ 23 @,@ 000 to an undisclosed bidder . 
 In late November 2011 , the site of a former BJ 's Wholesale Club in Norcross , Georgia was converted in appearance to a Costco for shooting . On January 23 , 2012 , Hill announced that filming had concluded . Multiple scene takes were made , allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations . Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens . The alien costume featured an animatronic head , remotely controlled by three people . The suit was hot even in cold areas , and had to be <unk> to let Doug Jones cool off between takes . The costume was enhanced with CGI in a number of ways , including replacing arms and dilating pupils ( which Schaffer thought made the creature seem more alive ) . 
 = = = Marketing = = = 
 The Neighborhood Watch marketing campaign began on February 29 , 2012 with the release of a teaser poster , trailer and the unveiling of the film 's website , <unk> The film 's trailer was nominated for a Golden Trailer award , recognizing achievements in marketing . On March 27 , 2012 , it was reported that 20th Century Fox had the poster and trailer removed from Florida theaters in response to increasing controversy surrounding the February shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford , Florida by neighborhood @-@ watch captain George Zimmerman . The trailer featured Hill imitating a gun with his hand pretending to shoot at teenagers , while the poster featured a bullet @-@ ridden , alien @-@ themed neighborhood @-@ watch sign . According to insiders Fox intended to move into the next phase of the marketing campaign as soon as possible ( focusing on the film 's science @-@ fiction aspects ) , while replacing previous posters with images of the cast . Fox maintained that the July 27 , 2012 , release date would remain unchanged by the Martin case or the marketing changes . 
 In a statement about the changes Fox said , " We are very sensitive to the Trayvon Martin case , but our film is a broad alien @-@ invasion comedy and bears absolutely no relation to the tragic events in Florida ... these initial marketing materials were released before this incident ever came to light . The teaser materials were part of an early phase of our marketing and were never planned for long @-@ term use . " The alien @-@ focused campaign began on May 4 , 2012 with the release of a new trailer , coinciding with Fox 's changing the film 's title to The Watch to further distance the film from the Martin case .

 The premiere of The Watch took place on July 23 , 2012 at Grauman 's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . It was released in North America on July 27 , 2012 . On July 25 , Harkins Theatres ( the sixth @-@ largest North American cinema chain ) announced it would not be showing the film after failing to reach a financial agreement with Fox . 
 = = = Box office = = = 
 The film earned $ 35 @.@ 4 million in North America and $ 32 @.@ 9 million from markets elsewhere for a worldwide total of $ 68 @.@ 3 million . In the week before release , pre @-@ release tracking showed that up to 25 percent of North American audiences were reluctant to visit cinemas following the mass murder in a Colorado cinema the previous week . This , plus competition from the simultaneous launch of the 2012 Summer Olympics , would negatively impact ticket sales for The Watch . Tracking showed that the film could earn $ 13 – 15 million during its opening weekend . 
 The film earned an estimated $ 4 @.@ 5 million on its opening day . During its opening weekend it earned $ 12 @.@ 7 million from 3 @,@ 168 theaters – an average of $ 4 @,@ 025 per theater – ranking third behind Ice Age : Continental Drift ( $ 13 @.@ 3 million ) and The Dark Knight Rises ( $ 62 @.@ 1 million ) .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The Watch received negative reviews from critics . On the review @-@ aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes , it has garnered a 17 % approval rating from 154 reviews , with an average rating of 4 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , " The Watch uneasily mixes sci @-@ fi elements with gross @-@ out gags and strands its talented cast with a script that favors vulgarity over wit at nearly every turn . " Metacritic gave it a score of 36 out of 100 , from 35 critics , indicating " generally unfavorable reviews " . CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a " C + " on an A + to F scale . 
 The Hollywood Reporter 's Sheri Linden described the film as feeling like " part three of a past @-@ its @-@ prime franchise " , criticizing the plot as moving " lazily from setup to punchline to setup , with no particular point and almost no punch " . Roger Ebert awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars , stating that the film " has lots of energy but not much inspiration " . Ebert commented that the comic timing of the lead actors benefits the dialog , but frequent instances of " crude , vulgar and offensive " comedy became unwelcome and unamusing . The Rolling Stone 's Peter Travers awarded the film 1 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars , stating that it should have been a " Ghostbusters lite " and " should be crazy , stupid fun but settles for just stupid . " He was also critical of the use of Costco in the plot , which he considered product placement . However , he praised Hill 's " scene @-@ stealing " performance . 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Lisa Schwarzbaum commented that the film struggles to find a " coherent " style between the " PG @-@ 13 rated aliens " and adult themes and dialogue . The A.V. Club 's Keith Phipps also unfavorably compared the film to Ghostbusters , stating that it struggles to replicate that film 's successful formula but fails to innovate with the story or characters . He also criticized the frequent Costco promotion . Phipps praised Ayoade : " ... he lends an unpredictable element to the group dynamic , and to the film . It ’ s the sort of performance that ought to be plucked for use in another , better movie . " Variety 's Justin Chang complimented the interaction between the four leads , but criticized the film for relegating ethnic characters to murder victims and female characters " to be protected or consoled " . He described the film as a " lowbrow , lame @-@ brained mash @-@ up of buddies @-@ on @-@ patrol comedy and sci @-@ fi actioner , held together ( barely ) by an endless string of penis jokes " . However , he praised Ayoade 's " mellow , nerdy @-@ funky appeal [ that represents ] one of the [ film 's ] few novel aspects " . 
 The Los Angeles Times ' Betsy Sharkey was more positive , stating that " the funniest stuff comes from the kind of situational misfires that can happen when dudes try to do things , like catch aliens , that they are clearly not cut out to do " . She considered that Schaffer 's previous experience directing short comic videos for Saturday Night Live was partially responsible for individual comic moments broken up by transitions where " things tend to fall apart " . <unk> 's Matt Singer was positive , calling the film funny and praising the improvisational feel of the scenes and " ingenious " set @-@ pieces , but was critical of the promotion of Costco and Costco products throughout . Boxoffice 's James Rocchi offered a positive stance , stating that the " plot moves , the supporting cast is lively and the action stays small @-@ scale and intimate , never overwhelming the laughs " ; he felt that the profanity and vulgarity never became " stale " . Rocchi , however , commented that the film was forgettable and " disposable " .

 = Terra Nova : Strike Force Centauri = 
 Terra Nova : Strike Force Centauri is a 1996 tactical first @-@ person shooter video game developed and published by Looking Glass Technologies . Set in a science @-@ fictional depiction of the 24th century , the game follows a faction of humans who colonize the Alpha Centauri star system to escape from the Hegemony , a totalitarian Earth government . The player assumes the role of Nikola ap Io , the leader of an Alpha Centauri military unit , and undertakes missions against pirates and the Hegemony . 
 Terra Nova has been cited as one of the first squad @-@ oriented games with three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) graphics ; the player is often assisted by artificially intelligent teammates who may be given tactical commands . Conceived by Looking Glass after the completion of their first game , Ultima Underworld : The Stygian Abyss , Terra Nova was subject to a long and difficult development process , caused in part by the production of its full motion video cutscenes . The game 's engine can render 3D outdoor environments and simulate physics ; the latter enables such effects as procedural animation . 
 Terra Nova 's critical reception was highly positive . Reviewers praised its tactical elements , and several compared it to the 1995 video game MechWarrior 2 : 31st Century Combat . However , reception of its graphics was mixed , and many noted the game 's steep system requirements . Despite critical acclaim and sales in excess of 100 @,@ 000 units , the game was a commercial failure : it did not recoup its development costs . While it was intended to be the first in a series , its low sales led the company to cancel plans for a sequel . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 As a tactical first @-@ person shooter , Terra Nova focuses on combat and takes place from a character 's eye view in a three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) graphical environment . The protagonist wears powered battle armor ( PBA ) that features lock @-@ on targeting , <unk> for limited flight , infrared and zoomed vision , and a rechargeable energy shield that protects against attacks . The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to aim weapons and manipulate the heads @-@ up display ( HUD ) interface . As with Looking Glass Technologies ' earlier game System Shock , the HUD contains three " Multi @-@ Function Displays " ( MFDs ) . These screens may be configured to display tactical information , such as squad command menus , maps and weapon statistics . 
 The player is usually accompanied by up to three artificially intelligent squadmates , who may be given tactical orders such as holding a position , taking cover or rushing enemies . <unk> may be commanded as a group or individually ; for example , one half of a squad may be used to distract enemies while the other half attacks an objective . Each squad member specializes in weapons , reconnaissance , repairs , demolitions or electronics . Those in the latter four categories may be given special commands , such as repairing a teammate 's armor or setting explosive charges . During missions , squad members radio in enemy sightings and status assessments . 
 The game takes place in 37 missions . Each begins with a briefing that describes such details as objectives , squad size and enemies . Objectives range from rescues and assaults to reconnaissance photography . Additional missions — whose contents may be selected by the player — are available through the game 's " Random Scenario Builder " . Before undertaking missions , the player outfits the squad and protagonist with PBA suits and equipment . The three types of PBA — Scout , Standard and Heavy — vary in ability ; for example , the Scout armor is fast and light , while the Heavy armor is slow and powerful . Each may be fitted with weapons and an " Auxiliary Suit Function " ( <unk> ) ; the latter ranges from increased <unk> power to deployable automatic turrets . Only a small amount of equipment is available at the outset , but more becomes accessible as the game progresses . Between missions , the player may read e @-@ mails , news and military files , and a " library " that details the game 's setting . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 Terra Nova is set in a science fictional depiction of the year 2327 and takes place in the Alpha Centauri star system . The setting 's early inspirations were the novels Starship Troopers and The Forever War , and PC Gamer UK compared it to that of the 1986 action film Aliens . Over two hundred years before the beginning of the game , Earth is subsumed by a world government called the Hegemony , whose " <unk> " philosophy PC Zone summarized as " communism without the economic restrictions " . The Hegemony annexes colonies throughout the Solar System , but the inhabitants of Jupiter 's moons reach an agreement that allows them to relocate to Alpha Centauri , where they settle on the Earth @-@ like <unk> and the frozen Thatcher planets . The settlers divide into twelve " Clans " — each with a military " Strike Force " to defend against bandits — and create the Centauri Council to govern the system . Trade is established with the Hegemony . As the game begins , an elite Strike Force called Strike Force Centauri is formed in response to increasing pirate activity . 
 The protagonist of Terra Nova is Nikola ap Io , the squad leader of Strike Force Centauri . His older brother , Brandt ap Io , is one of his subordinates , and the two share a mutual animosity . Other members of the squad include Sarah Walker , the daughter of a Centauri Council member ; Ernest Schuyler , who is known for his sense of humor ; and the frank and abrasive Simon Ashford . Each member was given a personality so that the player would form connections with the squad . Commander Arlen MacPherson assumes overall charge of the squad , and he has regular dealings with Hegemony ambassador Creon Pentheus . Live @-@ action full @-@ motion video cutscenes depicting character interaction occasionally play between missions . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 As the game begins , pirates steal a shipment of highly destructive " <unk> grenades " . A reconnaissance mission by Nikola identifies the grenades at a heavily defended pirate base , and they are recovered en route to a transport ship . Without the grenades , the base is assaulted by Strike Force Centauri , and Hegemony equipment is found there . When MacPherson confronts Pentheus about the incident , he denies involvement . Proof of the Hegemony 's intentions is later found at a Thatcher smuggling base , and Pentheus declares war on the Centauri colonies . Now knowing the pirates are funded by the Hegemony , MacPherson suspects that a previous information leak was in fact the work of a Hegemony spy ; Nikola questions Brandt , who responds with <unk> . After a series of missions against the Hegemony , Nikola 's aircraft is ambushed and shot down , and he is captured by Pentheus . During this time , Pentheus tells him that a traitor within Strike Force Centauri is responsible for the ambush . The squad rescues Nikola , but Schuyler is killed in the assault . At his funeral , Ashford accuses Nikola as the traitor . 
 It soon becomes clear that MacPherson is being poisoned . Nikola believes that Brandt is responsible , because of his recent disappearances , but is proven wrong . After MacPherson dies , Sarah Walker takes his place as commander of Strike Force Centauri . Walker sends Nikola , disguised as a pirate , on an espionage mission to discover the traitor 's identity . Nikola finds information that incriminates Ashford , who , when confronted , boasts of his actions and leaps to his death from a docking bay . The squad continues the war , and the Hegemony is eventually forced to gather its remaining forces at a base on Thatcher . The squad destroys the facility by detonating a highly explosive fuel tank inside it . Following its defeat , the Hegemony denies involvement in the war , declares Pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to the system . While angered by the announcement , Strike Force Centauri celebrates its victory as the game ends . 
 = = Development = = 
 Terra Nova was conceived in 1992 , around the time that Looking Glass Technologies ' first game , Ultima Underworld : The Stygian Abyss , was completed . Company co @-@ founder Paul Neurath wrote a design document for a tactical , squad @-@ based game with a science fiction setting , and he helped the team initiate its development . Artist Robb Waters created concept art . It was originally titled Freefall , because of the way the soldiers enter combat by dropping from aircraft . Development was initially led by a newly hired programmer who envisioned the game as an exact simulation , in which every element was as realistic as possible . Programmer Dan Schmidt created the game 's artificial intelligence , and he attempted to make squadmates intelligently follow orders and provide assistance , instead of merely " staying out of your way " . Schmidt hired Eric Brosius and Terri Brosius , then @-@ members of the band Tribe , to compose the game 's music , which was called " orchestrally flavored " by the Boston Herald . As with their 1995 video game Flight Unlimited , Looking Glass Technologies self @-@ published Terra Nova . 
 The game began production alongside the company 's second project , Ultima Underworld II : Labyrinth of Worlds , and remained in development after that game 's 1993 release . It then continued through the creation of their titles System Shock ( released in 1994 ) and Flight Unlimited . The game was subject to numerous delays , which Schmidt later attributed to its lack of a set deadline . He stated that the team was " trying to go with the same philosophy " as the company 's earlier games , in that they would " develop the systems and the game would come out of it " . However , the team 's development priorities regularly changed , and the programmer who led the project left several years into production . According to Schmidt , his departure meant that " there was no @-@ one left who was psyched about making this really [ realistic ] simulation " . Despite this fact , the team continued using the idea , even though serious difficulties were involved in achieving it . Schmidt said that the game 's development status was uncertain after the programmer left , and that he inherited the role of lead programmer around that time merely because the position had to be filled . He later assumed the role of project leader . In January 1995 , Looking Glass showed Terra Nova alongside Flight Unlimited at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show , under their " Immersive Reality " marketing label . 
 In the team 's original plan , Terra Nova consisted of missions that were bookended by simplistic cutscenes , akin to those of the 1990 Origin Systems video game Wing Commander . However , in 1994 , Origin released Wing Commander III : Heart of the Tiger , which features live @-@ action full @-@ motion video ( FMV ) cutscenes . This pressured Looking Glass into incorporating FMV into Terra Nova . Schmidt later said , " Lots of A @-@ list games were including more and more FMV , and it was felt by management that if Terra Nova didn 't have any , it would look second @-@ rate . " The decision to include it came when the game was already overdue , and a large portion of the game 's funding was redirected toward cutscene production . A scriptwriter from outside the company was hired to write the cutscenes ; because of the interplay between the cutscenes and missions , the script underwent numerous rewrites . The game 's delays and large budget resulted in the removal of a planned online multiplayer component , and the FMV cutscenes , which were expensive to produce , increased the number of sales needed to recoup development costs . A patch was planned to add the online multiplayer functionality after release , but it did not materialize . Schmidt called the cutscenes a " giant distraction " for the team and himself as project leader : he later described them as " <unk> than most " of those from the period and noted that " I wince a lot looking back on [ them ] " . Schmidt believed that they were likely an error from a business standpoint , as they further increased the game 's budget and production length , but ultimately did not increase sales . 
 Roughly a year before its release , the team concluded that Terra Nova 's realistic , simulation @-@ style gameplay was not enjoyable . However , Schmidt said that the game 's already lengthy development meant that it had to be released ; otherwise , he believed that it would be canceled , or that its high cost would bankrupt the company . As a result , the game was completely redesigned to be " much more arcadey " only a few months before release . Schmidt said that , in the new game , " you were going around blowing people up " and " your enemies have brackets on them showing their health and it 's very bright and <unk> and green " . He believed that these elements drastically increased the game 's enjoyability . He summarized , " Six months before it shipped the game wasn 't fun at all and we actually ended up shipping something that was at least somewhat enjoyable to play " . The game was released on March 5 , 1996 ; by this time , its graphical technology had been surpassed by other video games , according to Schmidt . Lead programmer Art Min later expressed dissatisfaction with the game : he believed that , while the team coalesced at the end of development , they shipped the game too soon because of " an overexcited VP of Product Development " . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 Unlike Looking Glass ' previous first @-@ person games — Ultima Underworld , Ultima Underworld II and System Shock — Terra Nova takes place in outdoor environments . The game 's engine supports weather conditions , day and night environments , real @-@ time water reflections and moving clouds , among other effects . Most of the work on the outdoor renderer was done by programmer Eric Twietmeyer ; however , contemporary computers were not powerful enough to display fully three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) outdoor environments . The problem was solved by programmer James Fleming : the game 's engine renders and applies textures to foreground objects in full 3D graphics , but — according to PC Gamer US — it displays a " bitmapped background in the distance " to provide the " illusion of detail " . As with Flight Unlimited and the CD @-@ ROM release of System Shock , Terra Nova was designed to support head @-@ mounted displays . The game features QSound technology . Describing QSound 's effect before the game 's release , Suzanne <unk> Kirschner of Popular Science wrote that " you 'll hear the rustle of leaves from the right speaker a split second before you hear it in the left [ , ] signaling you that the enemy is approaching from the right " . 
 The game 's characters are procedurally animated via simulated physics models and inverse kinematics ( IK ) — a system designed by programmer Seamus Blackley . Basic physics are used to move character models through the environment , and the models are animated by the IK system in accordance with this movement . Designer Richard Wyckoff later compared the character physics to those of a marble , and Schmidt described the technique as akin to putting each character in a hamster ball . The system 's imperfect nature can result in animation glitches . A more realistic simulation of bipedal movement was originally planned , but it was simplified before release because of coding difficulties . Schmidt later said that the original method " almost always worked " , but that " every thirty minutes someone would put their foot down slightly wrong ... and then go flying off across the map " . A physics model is also used to simulate weapon recoil , the arc of projectiles and the gravity of each planet ; for example , projectiles travel farther in low gravity environments . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Although Terra Nova sold more than 100 @,@ 000 units , it was a commercial failure because it did not recoup its development costs . Designer Tim Stellmach later characterized its performance as " a disaster " . Despite this , the game was acclaimed by critics , and several publications drew comparisons to the 1995 video game MechWarrior 2 : 31st Century Combat . 
 John Payne of The Washington Post wrote , " Depending on your point of view , Terra Nova is either a stripped @-@ down <unk> or a souped @-@ up Doom . " However , he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken . While he described the game 's animation as " fluid " , he found its graphics in general to be " fairly blocky , even at a distance " . He finished his review by stating that the game " requires more practice than action fans are used to " but provides " a nice payoff " . Next Generation Magazine wrote , " Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay , and it has done it again with Terra Nova " . The magazine considered the game to be " an all around stunning effort " . 
 The Sunday Star @-@ Times ' Peter Eley found the game to be extremely complex , and he noted the originality of its " real @-@ time , full motion and 3D combat simulation " . He called its sound and music " stunning " but found that its graphics " aren 't as crisp as some other games " , and he described performance issues . Lee Perkins of The Age also found the game 's performance and graphics lacking , but he said , " In spite of its visual shortcomings , Terra Nova has the same level of inherent player appeal as System Shock " . He concluded that the game 's " tactical demands ... are probably its strongest point " , and that it " isn 't quite up in the <unk> 2 league , [ but ] it 's making some very loud noises with avid mech @-@ combat fans " . Computer Games Strategy Plus ' Tim Royal offered similar praise for its strategic elements ; however , like the other two , he noted the game 's performance issues , and he called its graphics " above average , but not mind @-@ boggling " . He finished , " I ... won 't say it beats System Shock . It doesn 't . ... But Terra Nova offers a wonderful variety of terrain , mission types , and scenarios " . 
 William Wong of Computer Shopper called it " a great game that is backed by good graphics and sound , and will keep you going for hours " ; he also praised its cutscenes . He concluded , " If the [ upcoming ] multiplayer pack is as good as the standalone version , Terra Nova could be a strike force to be reckoned with . " PC Gamer UK 's James Flynn praised the game 's graphics , sense of realism , and free @-@ form missions ; about the latter , he wrote , " There 's no right or wrong way to complete any of the missions in Terra Nova , and this is one of its strongest assets . " He noted that it was " virtually impossible to recommend " the game to those with lower @-@ end computers , but he believed that it was also " impossible to condemn Looking Glass for programming the game this way , because it feels so real , and its authenticity is what makes it so much fun " . Daniel Jevons of Maximum approved of the graphics but disliked the focus on long @-@ range combat and the use of the mouse to move a crosshair rather than the entire viewpoint . However , he concluded that the game " has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack , the plot is strangely involving and despite the initial control difficulties , with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around the battlefields " . Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine praised the game 's artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality " spectacular " , but found its movement controls to be " awkward " . He concluded , " Terra Nova is an exceptional game that combines frenetic , fast @-@ paced action with real @-@ time squad @-@ level tactics . It doesn 't get much better than this " .

 The New York Times has cited Terra Nova as one of the first 3D games with squad @-@ oriented gameplay . GameSpy 's Bill Hiles said that the game " preceded the ' tactical squad @-@ based , first @-@ person shooter ' action genre by a full two years " , and that " In 1996 , ... Terra Nova didn 't feel like any other game out there " . Hiles called Tribes 2 " a spiritual descendent of Terra Nova if there ever was one " . Project leader Dan Schmidt later said that he had " a bit of a negative experience overall because the thing dragged on forever " , but he noted that " there are people who regard it highly so it can 't have been that terrible " . The 1998 video game Jurassic Park : Trespasser features a procedural animation system very similar to the one used in Terra Nova . 
 While Schmidt said before the game 's release that the team wanted to develop " a whole series of games that take place in the Terra Nova world " , the game 's poor sales made the creation of a sequel " impractical " , according to Paul Neurath . As the game 's publisher , Looking Glass took on the full burden of its commercial underperformance , which contributed to the company 's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000 . Neurath later said , " If we could do Terra Nova over , I would have dumped the cinematics and done online team play instead . Who knows , maybe then the Tribes II and Halo teams would be talking about the influence of Terra Nova on their games " . 
 = Weather ship = 
 A weather ship , or Ocean Station Vessel , was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting . They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans , reporting via radio . In addition to their weather reporting function , these vessels aided in search and rescue operations , supported transatlantic flights , acted as research platforms for oceanographers , monitored marine pollution , and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models . Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography , including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science . 
 The idea of a stationary weather ship was proposed as early as 1921 by Météo @-@ France to help support shipping and the coming of transatlantic aviation . They were used during World War II but had no means of defense , which led to the loss of several ships and many lives . On the whole , the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II for Europe and North America that the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) established a global network of weather ships in 1948 , with 13 to be supplied by Canada , the United States , and Europe . This number was eventually negotiated down to nine . The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1985 . 
 Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies , as commercial shipping tended to avoid weather systems for safety reasons , whereas the weather ships did not . They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea , such as tropical cyclones . Beginning in the 1970s , their role was largely superseded by weather buoys because of the ships ' significant cost . The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts leading up to the Great Storm of 1987 . The last weather ship was Polarfront , known as weather station M ( " Mike " ) , which was removed from operation on January 1 , 2010 . Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation . 
 = = Function = = 
 The primary purpose of an ocean weather vessel was to take surface and upper air weather measurements , and report them via radio at the synoptic hours of 0000 , 0600 , 1200 , and 1800 Universal Coordinated Time ( UTC ) . Weather ships also reported observations from merchant vessels , which were reported by radio back to their country of origin using a code based on the 16 @-@ kilometer ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) square in the ocean within which the ship was located . The vessels were involved in search and rescue operations involving aircraft and other ships . The vessels themselves had search radar and could activate a homing beacon to guide lost aircraft towards the ships ' known locations . Each ship 's homing beacon used a distinctly different frequency . In addition , the ships provided a platform where scientific and oceanographic research could be conducted . The role of aircraft support gradually changed after 1975 , as jet aircraft began using polar routes . By 1982 , the ocean weather vessel role had changed too , and the ships were used to support short range weather forecasting , in numerical weather prediction computer programs which forecast weather conditions several days ahead , for climatological studies , marine forecasting , and oceanography , as well as monitoring pollution out at sea . At the same time , the transmission of the weather data using Morse code was replaced by a system using telex @-@ over @-@ radio .

 The director of France 's meteorological service , Météo @-@ France , proposed the idea of a stationary weather ship in 1921 in order to aid shipping and the coming of transatlantic flights . Another early proposal for weather ships occurred in connection with aviation in August 1927 , when the aircraft designer Grover Loening stated that " weather stations along the ocean coupled with the development of the seaplane to have an equally long range , would result in regular ocean flights within ten years . " During 1936 and 1937 , the British Meteorological Office ( Met Office ) installed a meteorologist aboard a North Atlantic cargo steamer to take special surface weather observations and release pilot balloons to measure the winds aloft at the synoptic hours of 0000 , 0600 , 1200 , and 1800 UTC . In 1938 and 1939 , France established a merchant ship as the first stationary weather ship , which took surface observations and launched radiosondes to measure weather conditions aloft . 
 Starting in 1939 , United States Coast Guard vessels were being used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce , as a response to the crash of Pan American World Airways Hawaii Clipper during a transpacific flight in 1938 . The Atlantic Weather Observation Service was authorized by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on January 25 , 1940 . The Germans began to use weather ships in the summer of 1940 . However , three of their four ships had been sunk by November 23 , which led to the use of fishing vessels for the German weather ship fleet . Their weather ships were out to sea for three to five weeks at a time and German weather observations were enciphered using Enigma machines . By February 1941 , five 327 @-@ foot ( 100 m ) United States Coast Guard cutters were used in weather patrol , usually deployed for three weeks at a time , then sent back to port for ten days . As World War II continued , the cutters were needed for the war effort and by August 1942 , six cargo vessels had replaced them . The ships were defenseless , which led to the loss of the USCGC <unk> ( WAG @-@ 48 ) with 121 aboard on September 9 , 1942 . In 1943 , the United States Weather Bureau recognized their observations as " indispensable " during the war effort . 
 The flying of fighter planes between North America , Greenland , and Iceland led to the deployment of two more weather ships in 1943 and 1944 . Great Britain established one of their own 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) off their west coast . By May 1945 , frigates were used across the Pacific for similar operations . Weather Bureau personnel stationed on weather ships were asked voluntarily to accept the assignment . In addition to surface weather observations , the weather ships would launch radiosondes and release pilot balloons , or <unk> , to determine weather conditions aloft . However , after the war ended , the ships were withdrawn from service , which led to a loss of upper air weather observations over the oceans . Due to its value , operations resumed after World War II as a result of an international agreement made in September 1946 , which stated that no fewer than 13 ocean weather stations would be maintained by the Coast Guard , with five others maintained by Great Britain and two by Brazil .

 The establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) had established a global network of 13 weather ships by 1948 , with seven operated by the United States , one operated jointly by the United States and Canada , two supplied by the United Kingdom , one maintained by France , one a joint venture by the Netherlands and Belgium , and one shared by the United Kingdom , Norway , and Sweden . The United Kingdom used Royal Navy corvettes to operate their two stations , and staffed crews of 53 Met Office personnel . The ships were out at sea for 27 days , and in port for 15 days . Their first ship was deployed on July 31 , 1947 . 
 During 1949 , the Weather Bureau planned to increase the number of United States Coast Guard weather ships in the Atlantic from five at the beginning of the year to eight by its end . Weather Bureau employees aboard the vessels worked 40 to 63 hours per week . Weather ship G ( " George " ) was dropped from the network on July 1 , 1949 , and Navy weather ship " Bird Dog " ceased operations on August 1 , 1949 . In the Atlantic , weather vessel F ( " Fox " ) was discontinued on September 3 , 1949 , and there was a change in location for ships D ( " Dog " ) and E ( " Easy " ) at the same time . Navy weather ship J ( " Jig " ) in the north @-@ central Pacific ocean was placed out of service on October 1 , 1949 . The original international agreement for a 13 ship minimum was later amended downward . In 1949 , the minimum number of weather ships operated by the United States was decreased to ten , and in 1954 the figure was lowered again to nine , both changes being made for economic reasons . Weather vessel O ( " Oboe " ) entered the Pacific portion of the network on December 19 , 1949 . Also in the Pacific , weather ship A ( " Able " ) was renamed ship P ( " Peter " ) and moved 200 miles ( 320 km ) to the east @-@ northeast in December 1949 , while weather vessel F ( " Fox " ) was renamed N ( " Nan " ) . 
 = = = 1950s = = = 
 Weather ship B ( " Baker " ) , which had been jointly operated by Canada and the United States , became solely a United States venture on July 1 , 1950 . The Netherlands and the United States began to jointly operate weather ship A ( " Able " ) in the Atlantic on July 22 , 1950 . The Korean War led to the discontinuing of weather vessel O ( " Oboe " ) on July 31 , 1950 in the Pacific , and ship S ( " Sugar " ) was established on September 10 , 1950 . Weather ship P 's ( " Peter " ) operations were taken over by Canada on December 1 , 1950 , which allowed the Coast Guard to begin operating station U ( " Uncle " ) 2 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 200 mi ) west of northern Baja California on December 12 , 1950 . As a result of these changes , ship N ( " Nan " ) was moved 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) to the southeast on December 10 , 1950 . 
 Responsibility for weather ship V ( " Victor " ) transferred from the United States Navy to the United States Coast Guard and Weather Bureau on September 30 , 1951 . On March 20 , 1952 , Vessels N ( " November " ) and U ( " Uncle " ) were moved 32 to 48 kilometres ( 20 to 30 mi ) to the south to lie under airplane paths between the western United States coast and Honolulu , Hawaii . Weather vessel Q ( " Quebec " ) began operation in the north @-@ central Pacific on April 6 , 1952 , while in the western Atlantic , the British corvettes used as weather ships were replaced by newer Castle @-@ class frigates between 1958 and 1961 .

 In 1963 , the entire fleet won the Flight Safety Foundation award for their distinguished service to aviation . In 1965 , there were a total of 21 vessels in the weather ship network . Nine were from the United States , four from the United Kingdom , three from France , two from the Netherlands , two from Norway , and one from Canada . In addition to the routine hourly weather observations and upper air flights four times a day , two Russian ships in the northern and central Pacific ocean sent meteorological rockets up to a height of 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) . For a time , there was a Dutch weather ship stationed in the Indian Ocean . The network left the Southern Hemisphere mainly uncovered . South Africa maintained a weather ship near latitude 40 ° South , longitude 10 ° East between September 1969 and March 1974 .

 When compared to the cost of unmanned weather buoys , weather ships became expensive , and weather buoys began to replace United States weather ships in the 1970s . Across the northern Atlantic , the number of weather ships dwindled over the years . The original nine ships in the region had fallen to eight after ocean vessel C ( " Charlie " ) was discontinued by the United States in December 1973 . In 1974 , the Coast Guard announced plans to terminate all United States stations , and the last United States weather ship was replaced by a newly developed weather buoy in 1977 . 
 A new international agreement for ocean weather vessels was reached through the World Meteorological Organization in 1975 , which eliminated Ships I ( India ) and J ( <unk> ) , and left ships M ( " Mike " ) , R ( " Romeo " ) , C ( " Charlie " ) , and L ( " Lima " ) across the northern Atlantic , with the four remaining ships in operation through 1983 . Two of the British frigates were refurbished , as there was no funding available for new weather ships . Their other two ships were retired , as one of the British run stations was eliminated in the international agreement . In July 1975 , the Soviet Union began to maintain weather ship C ( " Charlie " ) , which it would operate through the remainder of the 1970s and 1980s . The last two British frigates were retired from ocean weather service by January 11 , 1982 , but the international agreement for weather ships was continued through 1985 . 
 Because of high operating costs and budget issues , weather ship R ( " Romeo " ) was recalled from the Bay of Biscay before the deployment of a weather buoy for the region . This recall was blamed for the minimal warning given in advance of the Great Storm of 1987 , when wind speeds of up to 149 km / h ( 93 mph ) caused extensive damage to areas of southern England and northern France . The last weather ship was Polarfront , known as weather station M ( " Mike " ) at 66 ° N , 02 ° E , run by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute . Polarfront was withdrawn from operation on January 1 , 2010 . Despite the loss of designated weather ships , weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation , whose number has decreased since 1985 . 
 = = Use in research = = 
 Beginning in 1951 , British ocean weather vessels began oceanographic research , such as monitoring plankton , casting of drift bottles , and sampling seawater . In July 1952 , as part of a research project on birds by Cambridge University , twenty shearwaters were taken more than 161 kilometres ( 100 mi ) offshore in British weather ships , before being released to see how quickly they would return to their nests , which were more than 720 kilometres ( 450 mi ) away on Skokholm Island . 18 of the twenty returned , the first in just 36 hours . During 1954 , British weather ocean vessels began to measure sea surface temperature gradients and monitored ocean waves . In 1960 , weather ships proved to be helpful in ship design through a series of recordings made on paper tape which evaluated wave height , pitch , and roll . They were also useful in wind and wave studies , as they did not avoid weather systems like merchant ships tended to and were considered a valuable resource . 
 In 1962 , British weather vessels measured sea temperature and salinity values from the surface down to 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) as part of their duties . Upper air soundings launched from weather ship E ( " Echo " ) were of great utility in determining the cyclone phase of Hurricane Dorothy in 1966 . During 1971 , British weather ships sampled the upper 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) of the ocean to investigate plankton distribution by depth . In 1972 , the Joint Air @-@ Sea Interaction Experiment ( <unk> ) utilized special observations from weather ships for their research . More recently , in support of climate research , 20 years of data from the ocean vessel P ( " Papa " ) was compared to nearby voluntary weather observations from mobile ships within the International Comprehensive Ocean @-@ Atmosphere Data Set to check for biases in mobile ship observations over that time frame . 
 = Zelda Fitzgerald = 
 Zelda Fitzgerald ( née Sayre ; July 24 , 1900 – March 10 , 1948 ) was an American socialite and novelist , and the wife of American author F. Scott Fitzgerald , whose work she strongly influenced . 
 Born in Montgomery , Alabama , she was noted for her beauty and high spirits , and was dubbed by her husband as " the first American Flapper " . She and Scott became the emblem of the Jazz Age , for which they are still celebrated . The immediate success of Scott 's first novel This Side of Paradise ( 1920 ) brought them into contact with high society , but their marriage was plagued by wild drinking , infidelity and bitter recriminations . Ernest Hemingway , whom Zelda disliked , blamed her for Scott 's declining literary output , though she has also been portrayed as the victim of an overbearing husband . After being diagnosed with schizophrenia , she was increasingly confined to specialist clinics , and the couple were living apart when Scott died suddenly in 1940 . Zelda died later in a fire at her hospital in Asheville , North Carolina . 
 Recent writers and scholars have portrayed Zelda as a creative talent ignored by the patriarchal society of the day . A 1970 biography by Nancy Milford was on the short list of contenders for the Pulitzer Prize . In 1992 , Zelda was inducted into the Alabama Women 's Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early life and family background = = 
 Born in Montgomery , Alabama , Zelda Sayre was the youngest of six children . Her mother , Minerva Buckner " Minnie " Machen ( November 23 , 1860 – January 13 , 1958 ) , named her after characters in two little @-@ known stories : Jane Howard 's " Zelda : A Tale of the Massachusetts Colony " ( 1866 ) and Robert Edward <unk> 's " Zelda 's Fortune " ( 1874 ) . A spoiled child , Zelda was doted upon by her mother , but her father , Anthony Dickinson Sayre ( 1858 – 1931 ) — a justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama and one of Alabama 's leading jurists — was a strict and remote man . 
 The family was descended from early settlers of Long Island , who had moved to Alabama before the Civil War . By the time of Zelda 's birth , the <unk> were a prominent Southern family . Her great @-@ uncle , John Tyler Morgan , served six terms in the United States Senate ; her paternal grandfather edited a newspaper in Montgomery ; and her maternal grandfather was Willis Benson Machen , who served a partial term as a U.S. senator from Kentucky . Her siblings were Anthony Dickinson Sayre , Jr . ( 1894 – 1933 ) , Marjorie Sayre ( Mrs. Minor Williamson Brinson ) ( 1886 – 1960 ) , Rosalind Sayre ( Mrs. Newman Smith ) ( 1889 – 1979 ) and <unk> Sayre ( Mrs. John Palmer ) ( 1891 – 1986 ) . 
 As a child Zelda Sayre was extremely active . She danced , took ballet lessons and enjoyed the outdoors . In 1914 , Sayre began attending Sidney Lanier High School . She was bright , but uninterested in her lessons . Her work in ballet continued into high school , where she had an active social life . She drank , smoked and spent much of her time with boys , and she remained a leader in the local youth social scene . A newspaper article about one of her dance performances quoted her as saying that she cared only about " boys and swimming . " She developed an appetite for attention , actively seeking to flout convention — whether by dancing the Charleston , or by wearing a tight , flesh @-@ colored bathing suit to fuel rumors that she swam nude . Her father 's reputation was something of a safety net , preventing her social ruin , but Southern women of the time were expected to be delicate , docile and accommodating . Consequently , Sayre 's antics were shocking to many of those around her , and she became — along with her childhood friend and future Hollywood starlet Tallulah Bankhead — a mainstay of Montgomery gossip . Her ethos was encapsulated beneath her high @-@ school graduation photo : 
 Why should all life be work , when we all can borrow . 
 Let 's think only of today , and not worry about tomorrow . 
 = = F. Scott Fitzgerald = = 
 Zelda first met the future novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in July 1918 , when he had volunteered for the army , and was stationed at Camp Sheridan , outside Montgomery . Scott began to call her daily , and came into Montgomery on his free days . He talked of his plans to be famous , and sent her a chapter of a book he was writing . He was so taken by Zelda that he redrafted the character of Rosalind Connage in This Side of Paradise to resemble her . He wrote , " all criticism of Rosalind ends in her beauty , " and told Zelda that " the heroine does resemble you in more ways than four . " Zelda was more than a mere muse , however — after showing Scott her personal diary , he used verbatim excerpts from it in his novel . At the conclusion of This Side of Paradise , the soliloquy of the protagonist Amory Blaine in the cemetery , for example , is taken directly from her journal . 
 According to Nancy Milford , Scott and Zelda 's first encounter was at a country club dance in Montgomery , which Scott later portrayed fictionally by writing it into his novel , The Great Gatsby , when he describes Jay Gatsby 's first encounter with Daisy Buchanan , although he transposed the location in the novel to a train station . Scott was not the only man courting Zelda , and the competition only drove Scott to want her more . In the ledger that he meticulously maintained throughout his life , Scott noted in 1918 , on September 7 , that he had fallen in love . Ultimately , she would do the same . Her biographer Nancy Milford wrote , " Scott had appealed to something in Zelda which no one before him had perceived : a romantic sense of self @-@ importance which was kindred to his own . " 
 Their courtship was briefly interrupted in October when he was summoned north . He expected to be sent to France , but was instead assigned to Camp Mills , Long Island . While he was there , the Armistice with Germany was signed . He then returned to the base near Montgomery , and by December they were passionately inseparable . Scott would later describe their behavior as " sexual recklessness . " On February 14 , 1919 , he was discharged from the military and went north to establish himself in New York City . 
 They wrote frequently , and by March 1920 , Scott sent Zelda his mother 's ring , and the two became engaged . Many of Zelda 's friends and members of her family were wary of the relationship , however , as they did not approve of Scott 's excessive drinking , and Zelda 's Episcopalian family did not like the fact that he was a Catholic . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 By September , Scott had completed his first novel , This Side of Paradise , and the manuscript was quickly accepted for publication . When he heard the novel had been accepted , Scott wrote to his editor Maxwell Perkins , urging an accelerated release : " I have so many things dependent on its success — including of course a girl . " In November , he returned to Montgomery , triumphant with the news of his novel . Zelda agreed to marry him once the book was published ; he , in turn , promised to bring her to New York with " all the iridescence of the beginning of the world . " This Side of Paradise was published on March 26 , Zelda arrived in New York on March 30 , and on April 3 , 1920 , before a small wedding party in St. Patrick 's Cathedral , they married . According to <unk> and Birch ( and Fitzgerald himself ) , this first novel was Fitzgerald 's " ace in the hole " , a poker term . Scott saw the novel 's publication as the way to Zelda 's heart . 
 Scott and Zelda quickly became celebrities of New York , as much for their wild behavior , as for the success of This Side of Paradise . They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness . Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square . Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them , as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi . Parker said , " They did both look as though they had just stepped out of the sun ; their youth was striking . Everyone wanted to meet him . " Their social life was fueled with alcohol . Publicly , this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties , but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights . To their delight , in the pages of the New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success — enfants <unk> of the Jazz Age . 
 On Valentine 's Day in 1921 , while Scott was working to finish his second novel , The Beautiful and Damned , Zelda discovered she was pregnant . They decided to go to Scott 's home in St. Paul , Minnesota to have the baby . On October 26 , 1921 , she gave birth to Frances " Scottie " Fitzgerald . As she emerged from the anesthesia , Scott recorded Zelda saying , " Oh , God , <unk> I 'm drunk . Mark Twain . Isn 't she smart — she has the hiccups . I hope it 's beautiful and a fool — a beautiful little fool . " Many of her words found their way into Scott 's novels : in The Great Gatsby , the character Daisy Buchanan expresses a similar hope for her daughter . 
 Zelda never became particularly domestic , nor showed any interest in housekeeping . By 1922 , the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter , a couple to clean their house , and a laundress . When Harper & Brothers asked her to contribute to Favorite Recipes of Famous Women she wrote , " See if there is any bacon , and if there is , ask the cook which pan to fry it in . Then ask if there are any eggs , and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them . It is better not to attempt toast , as it burns very easily . Also , in the case of bacon , do not turn the fire too high , or you will have to get out of the house for a week . Serve preferably on china plates , though gold or wood will do if handy . " 
 In early 1922 , Zelda again became pregnant . Although some writers have said that Scott 's diaries include an entry stating " Zelda and her abortionist " , there is , in fact , no such entry . Zelda 's thoughts on the second pregnancy are unknown , but in the first draft of The Beautiful and Damned , the novel Scott was completing , he wrote a scene in which the main female character Gloria believes she is pregnant and Anthony suggests she " talk to some woman and find out what 's best to be done . Most of them fix it some way . " Anthony 's suggestion was removed from the final version , a change which shifted focus from the abortion choice to Gloria 's concern that a baby would ruin her figure . 
 As The Beautiful and Damned neared publication , Burton <unk> , the freshly appointed literary editor of the New York Tribune , approached Zelda for an opportunity to entice readers with a cheeky review of Scott 's latest work . In her review , she made joking reference to the use of her diaries in Scott 's work , but the lifted material became a genuine source of resentment : 
 To begin with , every one must buy this book for the following aesthetic reasons : First , because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $ 300 in a store on Forty @-@ second Street , and , also , if enough people buy it where there is a platinum ring with a complete circlet , and , also , if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat , although the one he has has done well enough for the last three years ... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage , and , also , scraps of letters which , though considerably edited , sound to me vaguely familiar . In fact , Mr. Fitzgerald — I believe that is how he spells his name — seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home . 
 The piece led to Zelda receiving offers from other magazines . In June , a piece by Zelda Fitzgerald , " Eulogy on the Flapper , " was published in Metropolitan Magazine . Though ostensibly a piece about the decline of the flapper lifestyle , Zelda 's biographer Nancy Milford wrote that the essay was " a defense of her own code of existence . " Zelda described the flapper : 
 The Flapper awoke from her lethargy of sub @-@ <unk> @-@ ism , bobbed her hair , put on her choicest pair of earrings and a great deal of audacity and rouge and went into the battle . She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one @-@ piece bathing suit because she had a good figure ... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do . Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances , to teas , to swim and most of all to heart . 
 Zelda continued writing , selling several short stories and articles . She helped Scott write the play The Vegetable , but when it flopped the Fitzgeralds found themselves in debt . Scott wrote short stories furiously to pay the bills , but became burned out and depressed . In April 1924 , they left for Paris . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 After arriving in Paris , they soon relocated to Antibes on the French Riviera . While Scott was absorbed writing The Great Gatsby , Zelda became infatuated with a dashing young French pilot , Edouard Jozan . She spent afternoons swimming at the beach and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan . After six weeks , Zelda asked for a divorce . Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan , but instead dealt with Zelda 's demand by locking her in their house , until she abandoned her request for divorce . Jozan did not know she 'd asked for a divorce . He left the Riviera later that year , and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again . Later in life he told Zelda 's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary : " They both had a need of drama , they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination . " From Fitzgerald 's , " A Life in Letters , " Fitzgerald referred to the Jozan affair in his August letter to Ludlow Fowler , of lost illusions in The Great Gatsby as his lost certainty in Zelda 's fidelity , the book reflected the dramatized pivotal aspects of his and Zelda 's love , of courtship , break , restoration with financial success , and the Jozan betrayal : " I feel old too , this summer ... the whole burden of this novel — the loss of those illusions that give such color to the world that you don 't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory . " The Great Gatsby was in draft form during the July 1924 Jozan crisis , with the typescript sent to <unk> at the end of October . Fitzgerald wrote in his notebooks , " That September 1924 , I knew something had happened that could never be repaired . " 
 After the fight , the Fitzgeralds kept up appearances with their friends , seemingly happy . In September , Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills . The couple never spoke of the incident , and refused to discuss whether it was a suicide attempt or not . Scott returned to writing , finishing The Great Gatsby in October . They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri , but both were unhappy and unhealthy . When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title : Trimalchio in West Egg , just Trimalchio or Gatsby , Gold @-@ hatted Gatsby , or The High @-@ bouncing Lover . It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby . It was also on this trip , while ill with colitis , that Zelda began painting . 
 In April 1925 , back in Paris , Scott met Ernest Hemingway , whose career he did much to promote . Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald became firm friends , but Zelda and Hemingway disliked each other from their very first meeting , and she openly described him as " bogus , " " that fairy with hair on his chest " and " phoney as a rubber check . " She considered Hemingway 's domineering macho persona to be merely a posture ; Hemingway in turn , told Scott that Zelda was crazy . Her dislike was probably not helped by Scott 's repeated insistence that she recount the story of her affair with Jozan to Hemingway and his wife , Hadley . In an embellishment , the Fitzgeralds told the Hemingways that the affair ended when Jozan committed suicide . It was through Hemingway , however , that the Fitzgeralds were introduced to much of the Lost Generation expatriate community : Gertrude Stein , Alice B. Toklas , Robert McAlmon and others . 
 One of the most serious rifts occurred when Zelda told Scott that their sex life had declined because he was " a fairy " and was likely having a homosexual affair with Hemingway . There is no evidence that either was homosexual , but Scott nonetheless decided to have sex with a prostitute to prove his heterosexuality . Zelda found condoms that he had purchased before any encounter occurred , and a bitter fight ensued , resulting in lingering jealousy . She later threw herself down a flight of marble stairs at a party because Scott , engrossed in talking to Isadora Duncan , was ignoring her . 
 Literary critic Edmund Wilson , recalling a party at the Fitzgerald home in Edgemoor , Delaware , in February 1928 , described Zelda as follows : 
 I sat next to Zelda , who was at her iridescent best . Some of Scott 's friends were irritated ; others were enchanted , by her . I was one of the ones who were charmed . She had the waywardness of a Southern belle and the lack of inhibitions of a child . She talked with so spontaneous a color and wit — almost exactly in the way she wrote — that I very soon ceased to be troubled by the fact that the conversation was in the nature of a ' free association ' of ideas and one could never follow up anything . 
 I have rarely known a woman who expressed herself so delightfully and so freshly : she had no ready @-@ made phrases on the one hand and made no straining for effect on the other . It evaporated easily , however , and I remember only one thing she said that night : that the writing of Galsworthy was a shade of blue for which she did not care . 
 = = Obsession and illness = = 
 Though Scott drew heavily upon his wife 's intense personality in his writings , much of the conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing . She would often interrupt him when he was working , and the two grew increasingly miserable throughout the 1920s . Scott had become severely alcoholic , Zelda 's behavior became increasingly erratic and neither made any progress on their creative endeavors . 
 Zelda had a deep desire to develop a talent that was entirely her own , perhaps a reaction to Scott 's fame and success as a writer . At age 27 , she became obsessed with ballet , which she had studied as a girl . She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child , and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill , it appears that she did have a fair degree of talent . But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife 's desire to become a professional dancer , considering it a waste of time . 
 She rekindled her studies too late in life to become a truly exceptional dancer , but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice ( up to eight hours a day ) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion . In September 1929 she was invited to join the ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples , but , as close as this was to the success she desired , she declined . While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor , friends noted that the partying of the Fitzgeralds had somewhere gone from fashionable to self @-@ destructive — both had become unpleasant company . 
 In April 1930 , Zelda was admitted to a sanatorium in France where , after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe 's leading psychiatrists , Doctor Eugen Bleuler , she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic . Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris , she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux , Switzerland . The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments , and as a result of her profound psychological problems , she was moved to a psychiatric facility in Prangins on the shores of Lake Geneva . She was released in September 1931 , and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery , Alabama , where her father , Judge Sayre , was dying . Amid her family 's bereavement , Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood . Her father died while Scott was gone , and her health again deteriorated . By February 1932 , she had returned to living in a psychiatric clinic . 
 = = Save Me the Waltz = = 
 In 1932 , while being treated at the Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , Zelda had a swell of creativity . Over the course of her first six weeks at the clinic , she wrote an entire novel and sent it to Scott 's publisher , Maxwell Perkins . 
 When Scott finally read Zelda 's book , a week after she 'd sent it to Perkins , he was furious . The book was a semi @-@ autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds ' marriage . In letters Scott berated her and fumed that the novel had drawn upon the autobiographical material that he planned to use in Tender Is the Night , which he 'd been working on for years , and which would finally see publication in 1934 . 
 Scott forced Zelda to revise the novel , removing the parts that drew on shared material he wished to use . Though the Great Depression had struck America , Scribner agreed to publish her book , and a printing of 3 @,@ 010 copies were released on October 7 , 1932 . 
 The parallels to the Fitzgeralds were obvious . The protagonist of the novel was Alabama Beggs , like Zelda , the daughter of a Southern judge , who marries David Knight , an aspiring painter who abruptly becomes famous for his work . They live the fast life in Connecticut , before departing to live in France . Dissatisfied with her marriage , Alabama throws herself into ballet . Though told she has no chance , she perseveres and after three years becomes the lead dancer in an opera company . Alabama becomes ill from exhaustion , however , and the novel ends when they return to her family in the South , as her father is dying . 
 Thematically , the novel portrayed Alabama 's struggle ( and hence Zelda 's as well ) to rise above being " a back @-@ seat driver about life " and to earn respect for her own accomplishments — to establish herself independently of her husband . Zelda 's style was quite different from Scott 's . The language used in Save Me the Waltz was filled with verbal flourishes and complex metaphors . The novel was also deeply sensual ; as literary scholar Jacqueline Tavernier @-@ Courbin would write in 1979 , " The sensuality arises from Alabama 's awareness of the life surge within her , the consciousness of the body , the natural imagery through which not only emotions but simple facts are expressed , the overwhelming presence of the senses , in particular touch and smell , in every description . " 
 In its time , however , the book was not well received by critics . To Zelda 's dismay it sold only 1 @,@ 392 copies , for which she earned $ 120 @.@ 73 . The failure of Save Me the Waltz , and Scott 's scathing criticism of her having written it — he called her " <unk> " and a " third @-@ rate writer " — crushed her spirits . It was the only novel she ever published . 
 = = Remaining years = = 
 From the mid @-@ 1930s , Zelda spent the rest of her life in various stages of mental distress . Some of the paintings that she had drawn over the previous years , in and out of sanatoriums , were exhibited in 1934 . As with the tepid reception of her book , Zelda was disappointed by the response to her art . The New Yorker described them merely as " Paintings by the almost mythical Zelda Fitzgerald ; with whatever emotional overtones or associations may remain from the so @-@ called Jazz Age . " No actual description of the paintings was provided . She became in turns violent and reclusive . In 1936 , Scott placed her in the Highland Hospital in Asheville , North Carolina , writing ruefully to friends : 
 Zelda now claims to be in direct contact with Christ , William the Conqueror , Mary Stuart , Apollo and all the stock paraphernalia of insane @-@ asylum jokes ... For what she has really suffered , there is never a sober night that I do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness . In an odd way , perhaps incredible to you , she was always my child ( it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages ) ... I was her great reality , often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her . 
 Zelda remained in the hospital while Scott returned again to Hollywood for a $ 1 @,@ 000 a week job with MGM in June 1937 . Without Zelda 's knowledge , he began a serious affair with the movie columnist Sheilah Graham . Despite the excitement of the affair , Scott was bitter and burned out . When their daughter Scottie was thrown out of her boarding school in 1938 , he blamed Zelda . Though Scottie was subsequently accepted to Vassar College , his resentment of Zelda was stronger than ever before . Of Scott 's mindset , Milford wrote , " The vehemence of his rancor toward Zelda was clear . It was she who had ruined him ; she who had made him exhaust his talents ... He had been cheated of his dream by Zelda . " 
 After a drunken and violent fight with Graham in 1938 , Scott returned to Asheville . A group from Zelda 's hospital had planned to go to Cuba , but Zelda had missed the trip . The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own . The trip was a disaster even by their standards : Scott was beaten up when he tried to stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized . The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again . 
 Scott returned to Hollywood and Graham ; Zelda returned to the hospital . She nonetheless made progress in Asheville , and in March 1940 , four years after admittance , she was released . She was nearing forty now , her friends were long gone , and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money . Scott was increasingly bitter at his own failures and his old friend Hemingway 's continued success . They wrote each other frequently until his death in December 1940 . Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville , Maryland . 
 Zelda read the unfinished manuscript of the novel Scott was writing upon his death , The Love of the Last Tycoon . She wrote to the literary critic Edmund Wilson , who had agreed to edit the book , musing on his legacy . Zelda believed , her biographer Milford said , that Scott 's work contained " an American temperament grounded in belief in oneself and ' will @-@ to @-@ survive ' that Scott 's contemporaries had relinquished . Scott , she insisted , had not . His work possessed a vitality and stamina because of his indefatigable faith in himself . " 
 After reading The Last Tycoon , Zelda began working on a new novel of her own , Caesar 's Things . As she missed Scott 's funeral , so she missed Scottie 's wedding . By August 1943 she returned to the Highland Hospital . She worked on her novel while checking in and out of the hospital . She did not get better nor did she finish the novel . On the night of March 10 , 1948 , a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen . Zelda was locked into a room , awaiting electroshock therapy . The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft , spreading onto every floor . The fire escapes were wooden , and caught fire as well . Nine women , including Zelda , died . 
 Their daughter , Scottie , wrote after their deaths : 
 I think ( short of documentary evidence to the contrary ) that if people are not crazy , they get themselves out of crazy situations , so I have never been able to buy the notion that it was my father 's drinking which led her to the sanitarium . Nor do I think she led him to the drinking . 
 Scott and Zelda were buried in Rockville , Maryland — originally in the Rockville Union Cemetery , away from his family plot . In 1975 , however , Scottie successfully campaigned for them to be buried with the other Fitzgeralds at Saint Mary 's Catholic Cemetery . Inscribed on their tombstone is the final sentence of The Great Gatsby : " So we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Scott believed himself a failure when he died suddenly in 1940 and Zelda 's death in 1948 , too , was little noted . However , posthumously , interest in the Fitzgeralds resurged . In 1950 , screenwriter Budd Schulberg , who knew Scott from his Hollywood years , wrote The Disenchanted , which presented an F. Scott Fitzgerald @-@ inspired character who was an alcoholic failure . It was followed in 1951 when Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener wrote The Far Side of Paradise , a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald , which rekindled interest in the couple among scholars . Mizener 's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly , and a story about the work written in Life magazine , then one of America 's most read and discussed periodicals . Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure ; Zelda 's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential . 
 A play of The Disenchanted opened on Broadway in 1958 . Also that year , Scott 's Hollywood mistress Sheilah Graham published a memoir , Beloved Infidel , about his last years . Beloved Infidel became a bestseller and later a film starring Gregory Peck as Scott and Deborah Kerr as Graham . The book and movie painted him in a more sympathetic light than the earlier works . In 1970 , however , Scott and Zelda 's marriage saw its most profound revision , when Nancy Milford , a graduate student at Columbia University , published Zelda : A Biography , the first book @-@ length treatment of Zelda 's life . It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award , and figured for weeks on The New York Times best @-@ seller list . The book recast Zelda as an artist in her own right , whose talents were belittled by a controlling husband . Thus Zelda became an icon of the feminist movement in the 1970s — a woman whose unappreciated potential had been suppressed by patriarchal society . When Tennessee Williams dramatized their lives in the 1980s Clothes for a Summer Hotel , he drew heavily on Milford 's account . A caricature of Scott and Zelda emerged : as epitomizing the Jazz Age 's glorification of youth , as representatives of the Lost Generation , and as parable about the pitfalls of too much success . 
 Zelda was the inspiration for " <unk> Woman " the song of seductive <unk> written by Don Henley and Bernie Leadon for the Eagles , after Henley read Zelda 's biography , of the muse , the partial genius behind her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald , the wild , bewitching , mesmerizing , quintessential " flapper " of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties embodied in The Great Gatsby as the uninhibited and reckless personality of Daisy Buchanan . Zelda 's behavior in the lyrics of " <unk> Woman " refer to her partying excesses that were detrimental to her psyche : " She drove herself to madness with the silver spoon , " is a reference to Zelda 's time in a mental institution and the <unk> , slotted silver spoon used to dissolve sugar cubes with absinthe . 
 Zelda 's name served as inspiration for Princess Zelda , the eponymous character of the The Legend of Zelda series of video games . Series co @-@ creator Shigeru Miyamoto explained , " [ Fitzgerald ] was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts , and I liked the sound of her name . So I took the liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title . " New York City 's borough of Manhattan 's Battery Park 's resident wild turkey Zelda ( d . 2014 ) was also named after her , because according to legend during one of Fitzgerald 's nervous breakdowns , she went missing and was found in Battery Park , apparently having walked several miles downtown . Of Zelda 's legacy in popular culture , biographer Cline wrote , " Recently myth has likened Zelda to those other twentieth @-@ century icons , Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana . With each she shares a defiance of convention , intense vulnerability , doomed beauty , unceasing struggle for a serious identity , short tragic life and quite impossible nature . " In 1989 , the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald museum opened in Montgomery , Alabama . The museum is in a house they briefly rented in 1931 and 1932 . The museum is one of the few places where some of Zelda 's paintings are kept on display .

 Following Milford 's biography , scholars and critics began to look at Zelda 's work in a new light . In a 1968 edition of Save Me the Waltz , F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli wrote , " Save Me the Waltz is worth reading partly because anything that illuminates the career of F. Scott Fitzgerald is worth reading — and because it is the only published novel of a brave and talented woman who is remembered for her defeats . " But as Save Me the Waltz was increasingly read alongside Milford 's biography , a new perspective emerged . In 1979 , scholar Jacqueline Tavernier @-@ Courbin wrote rebutting Bruccoli 's position : " Save Me the Waltz is a moving and fascinating novel which should be read on its own terms equally as much as Tender Is the Night . It needs no other justification than its comparative excellence . " 
 Save Me the Waltz became the focus of many literary studies that explored different aspects of her work : how the novel contrasted with Scott 's take on the marriage in Tender Is the Night ; how the commodity culture that emerged in the 1920s placed stress on modern women ; and how these attitudes led to a misrepresentation of " mental illness " in women . 
 Zelda Fitzgerald 's collected writings ( including Save Me the Waltz ) , edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli , were published in 1991 . New York Times literary critic Michiko Kakutani wrote , " That the novel was written in two months is amazing . That for all its flaws it still manages to charm , amuse and move the reader is even more remarkable . Zelda Fitzgerald succeeded , in this novel , in conveying her own heroic desperation to succeed at something of her own , and she also managed to distinguish herself as a writer with , as Edmund Wilson once said of her husband , a ' gift for turning language into something iridescent and surprising . ' " 
 Scholars continue to examine and debate the role that Scott and Zelda may have had in stifling each other 's creativity . Zelda 's biographer Cline wrote that the two camps are " as diametrically opposed as the Plath and Hughes literary camps " — a reference to the heated controversy about the relationship of husband – wife poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath . 
 Zelda 's artwork also has been reappraised as interesting in its own right . After spending much of the 1950s and ' 60s in family attics — Zelda 's mother even had much of the art burned because she disliked it — scholars began to examine the art . Exhibitions of her work have toured the United States and Europe . A review of the exhibition by curator <unk> Adair noted the influence of Vincent van Gogh and Georgia O 'Keeffe on her paintings and concluded that her surviving corpus of art " represents the work of a talented , visionary woman who rose above tremendous odds to create a fascinating body of work — one that inspires us to celebrate the life that might have been . " 
 In 1992 , Zelda was inducted into the Alabama Women 's Hall of Fame .

 " Spinning Around " is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her seventh studio album , Light Years ( 2000 ) . It won the 2000 ARIA Music Award for Best Pop Release . Written by Ira <unk> , Osborne Bingham , Kara DioGuardi , and Paula Abdul , " Spinning Around " was initially meant to be recorded by Abdul for her own album , but was given to Minogue after the plan never came to fruition . Produced by Mike Spencer , the disco @-@ influenced dance @-@ pop song was then released as the lead single from Light Years on 19 June 2000 . Lyrically , the song addresses the theme of reinvention , with Minogue claiming that she has changed as a person and learned from the past . 
 Upon its release , " Spinning Around " received favourable reviews from music critics , who singled it out as one of the highlights from the album and praised Minogue for returning to her signature musical style . Commercially , the song was a success and became Minogue 's " comeback " single following the critical and commercial disappointment of her sixth studio album Impossible Princess ( 1997 ) . It entered the Australian Singles Chart at number one , becoming the singer 's first chart @-@ topper since " Confide in Me " ( 1994 ) . The song also debuted at number one in the United Kingdom , where it became her first single to peak atop the chart since " Tears on My Pillow " in 1990 . Elsewhere , it reached the top five in Ireland and New Zealand . " Spinning Around " was certified platinum and silver in Australia and the United Kingdom , respectively . 
 The accompanying music video for " Spinning Around " was directed by Dawn Shadforth , and features Minogue dancing and enjoying herself in a disco . It became popular for the gold hotpants she sported in most of the scenes and led to her bottom gaining extensive coverage from the media . The hotpants are considered to be " iconic " and have been displayed in exhibitions of Minogue 's fashion . " Spinning Around " has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours , with the exception of the Anti Tour .

 In 1997 , Minogue released her sixth studio album , Impossible Princess . The album represented a drastic change in the singer 's musical direction , shifting from her signature dance @-@ pop styles to incorporate elements of electronica and pop rock . It was her second album to be released on British record label Deconstruction and became a success in her native Australia , peaking at number four on the ARIA Albums Chart . In the United Kingdom Impossible Princess was less successful than Minogue 's previous albums and peaked at number ten on the UK Albums Chart . The album also suffered from poor reviews in the UK as commentators criticised its different musical approach ; many also considered that Minogue 's career was over . Despite embarking on a successful promotional tour , Minogue was dropped by Deconstruction in 1999 . Minogue then signed to Parlophone , another British record label . 
 After various discussions , Minogue decided to do what she did " best " and record a simple pop album inspired by disco and Europop , entitled Light Years . " Spinning Around " was included as the opening track of the album and was written by Ira <unk> , Osborne Bingham , Kara DioGuardi and Paula Abdul , and produced by Mike Spencer . Abdul had based the song on her divorce from clothing designer Brad Beckerman and had originally intended to record it for her own studio album , but it was given to Minogue after the album failed to materialise . The song was the first major songwriting project for DioGuardi , who had not been offered any notable projects previously . In an interview discussing the development of Light Years , Minogue revealed that the song had initially been found as a demo in New York by her A & R executive Jamie Nelson , who believed it would be " perfect " for the singer . After listening to the demo , Minogue agreed to record it and felt the song had the potential to be a hit . " Spinning Around " was then released as the lead single from the album on 13 June 2000 in Australia , and 19 June in the United Kingdom . Minogue was photographed by Liz Collins for the artwork of the record . In her 2012 fashion retrospective book Kylie / Fashion , she wrote of the collaboration : " With ' Spinning Around ' it was time to be pop @-@ tastic again . Liz Collins 's aesthetic was very much about a natural beauty . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 Similar to most of the songs from Light Years , " Spinning Around " is a " string @-@ laden " dance @-@ pop track with prominent influences from disco music . According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com , it is composed in the key of F ♯ minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute . Minogue 's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5 . Addressing the theme of reinvention , the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes ; it contains lines like " I 'm spinning around / Move out of my way ... I 'm not the same " and " Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe . " In an analysis of the lyrics of the song , Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them , in the line " I know you 're feelin [ g ] me [ be ] cause you like it like this . " The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh , evidenced in lines like " Threw away my old clothes , got myself a better wardrobe . " The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is . The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook " You know you like it like this , " with Minogue 's voice being vocoded . Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics , Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision .

 " Spinning Around " received favourable reviews from music critics . Chris True from AllMusic selected it as a highlight from the album and said it was a " fun and string @-@ laden declaration that she may have made a mistake back in 1997 . " Pom Avoledo praised Minogue for returning to her signature dance @-@ pop style and complimented her for giving " Spinning Around " an " air of elegance and sensuality which was lacking in her early material . " A very positive review came from Siobhan Grogan of NME , who favoured the chorus of the song and commended Minogue for coming back to " what she knows best . " The critic felt the song would become a hit in gay clubs and commented that " [ Spinning Around ] is made of the same fizzing , giddy disco @-@ pop that made Kylie famous in the first place . " Gary Crossing from Yahoo ! Music , who gave Light Years a mixed review , felt that " Spinning Around " was one of the better tracks from the album and called it a " slinky little number . " In his review of Minogue 's 2004 greatest hits album Ultimate Kylie , Jason <unk> from About.com praised the inclusion of songs like " Spinning Around " and other tracks from Light Years , calling them " a blessing for domestic music consumers , since that disc has never found its way onto official US release , though with any collection of Minogue hits , one simply has to look at what they have in their collection versus what they don 't . " At the 14th ARIA Music Awards ceremony in 2000 , " Spinning Around " won the award for " Best Pop Release " .

 The accompanying music video for " Spinning Around " was directed by Dawn Shadforth . As the song was meant to be Minogue 's " comeback " single and mark a " decisive return " to pop music following Impossible Princess , the video did not contain any dark themes and put the " emphasis firmly upon dance , fun , and freedom . " The video begins with a shot of Minogue 's feet as she enters a disco @-@ like setting . She is then shown dancing on the floor with a man , whom she later flirts with on a sofa . Scenes of her performing a dance routine on and in front of a bar and laying on neon blue and gold lights are interspersed throughout the video . Most of the shots are focused on Minogue 's body and various scenes feature her wearing gold lamé hotpants .

 Following its release , the music video became popular for the gold hotpants Minogue sported . It resulted in a media sensation regarding her bottom . British national broadsheet newspaper The Sunday Times deemed her bottom a " wonder of nature " and The Sun sponsored a campaign to " have Kylie Minogue 's rear @-@ end heritage @-@ listed , preserved for " <unk> " on the grounds that it 's an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . " Readers were requested by the tabloid newspaper to persuade the government to make sure " [ Minogue 's ] bum remains in safe hands - by turning it into a national institution . " Rumours and speculations claiming Minogue had undergone plastic surgery to make her bottom look more appealing also began to arise during this time . In the same year , English broadcaster and journalist Johnny Vaughan commented " if an alien landed on Earth he would think Kylie 's arse is the world 's leader . " Minogue 's stylist and close friend William Baker explained his decision to " showcase " her bottom in the video , saying " Kylie 's bottom is like a peach - sex sells and her best asset is her bum . " The singer 's response to the attention regarding her bottom was " dry , " claiming " You never know what the future holds . It could become a pear . " It was reported that Minogue had her bottom insured for five million dollars . 
 The hotpants were deemed " iconic " and were said to be the reason behind " Spinning Around " becoming a " musical and visual anthem in 2000 . " According to the catalogue entry for the hotpants at the Performing Arts Collection at the Arts Centre , Melbourne , British artist and photographer Katerina Jebb bought them for fifty pence from a flea market and they were only selected for use in the video the night before the shoot , though Minogue had worn them previously for a website photoshoot . She was surprised by the attention they attracted , commenting " I never imagined what impact a 50p pair of hotpants would have . " She also said that the revealing nature of the hotpants made her feel insecure during the shooting , saying " I actually wasn 't confident [ in them ] , that 's the crazy thing . I remember feeling quite self @-@ conscious and kept wrapping a robe around me on set and would discard [ it ] right before the take . " The garment is often referred to as " those hotpants , " and have become a symbol for the singer 's vitality and youthfulness . Considered to be one of her trademark looks , the attire she wore in the music video was put on display at Kylie : The Exhibition , an exhibition that featured " costumes and memorabilia collected over Kylie 's career " , held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London , England , and at Kylie : An Exhibition , a similar exhibition held at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney , Australia . It was also included in Minogue 's official fashion photography book Kylie / Fashion , which was released on 19 November 2012 by Thames and Hudson to celebrate Minogue 's completion of 25 years in music . In February 2014 , Minogue donated the hotpants to the Performing Arts Collection museum at the Arts Centre in her hometown of Melbourne .

It was released as the album 's lead single via digital download on 16 August 2010 , in Sweden , and one day later in the United States . An acoustic version of the song had previously been included on Body Talk Pt . 1 , in June 2010 . The song was written and produced by Klas Åhlund , who wrote it for Swedish singer Paola Bruna who originally recorded it in 2002 . Åhlund re @-@ wrote it , added a chorus and made it more uptempo for Robyn 's version . The electropop song carries a club beat , with synth arpeggios and energetic bass . Lyrically , it speaks of falling in love and being scared , and trust in a relationship . 
 The song was met with generally positive reviews from critics , who compared it to her previous singles " With Every Heartbeat " and " Dancing on My Own " . The single reached number two on the Sverigetopplistan chart , becoming Robyn 's eighth top ten hit in her native country . It also reached the top ten on the Norwegian chart , and the Hot Dance Club Songs chart in the US . The accompanying music video was directed by Max Vitali when Robyn was on tour in the United Kingdom . The clip shows scenes from concerts , her tour bus , in @-@ store appearances and Robyn 's sightseeing in London . The concept behind the video was Robyn wanting to make a simple video to show all the touring she had done in 2010 . Robyn performed the acoustic version of the song on an episode of Gossip Girl , and included it on the set list for the Body Talk Tour ( 2010 – 11 ) .

 " Hang with Me " was written and produced by Klas Åhlund , and was originally recorded by Åhlund 's then @-@ wife , Paola Bruna , for her debut studio album <unk> Girl ( 2002 ) . Åhlund played some of his old songs for Robyn , and re @-@ wrote " Hang with Me " for her . Originally , the song did not have a chorus and Robyn noted that Bruna 's version " sounded very different " from her own . Robyn 's version was one of the first songs recorded for the Body Talk series , but she decided to save it for a later release to give it a chance of becoming a single . In an interview with Gary Graff of The Macomb Daily , she spoke of covering Bruna 's song and altering the lyrics , " It didn ’ t have a chorus when we started working on it . It had a shorter verse and it was a ballad , so I decided if I could make Klas [ Åhlund ] turn it into a more uptempo and bring the BPM up , it could work . So we started there and he kept writing the song while we were recording , and it came out great . " Robyn felt that she could be " seductive and sweet in a [ sic ] uncompromising way " on the song . 
 The song was announced as the first single from Body Talk Pt . 2 , on 19 July 2010 . The single artwork was posted on Robyn 's official website on the same date , and the song premiered online the following day . An acoustic version of the song was previously featured on the preceding album , Body Talk Pt . 1 . The single was released digitally in Sweden on 16 August 2010 , and one day later in the United States . A CD single was released in Germany on 3 September 2010 .

 " Hang with Me " is an electropop song , written and produced by Klas Åhlund , and a reworked version of Paola Bruna 's song . Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club noted the similar " anthemic , emotional beats " of " Cry When You Get Older " from Body Talk Pt . 1 . Tom Ewing of The Guardian compared its musical style to that of the Pet Shop Boys . Comparisons were also drawn towards her previous singles , " With Every Heartbeat " , " Be Mine ! " and " Dancing on My Own " .

" In the chorus , Robyn sings " Just don 't fall recklessly , headlessly in love with me . " According to Nick Levine of Digital Spy , Robyn " urges on this ode to friendship , mutual support and generally not being a fool who rushes in . " Tyler Grisham of Pitchfork noted that Robyn 's " vocals are echoed by a robotic self @-@ harmony " and that " she seems to be encouraging herself twice as hard to believe the song 's words . " Speaking of the song , Robyn said , " It ’ s a sweet song . Beautiful and bitter sweet , It ’ s about falling in love and being scared . "

 Erika Berlin of Rolling Stone said that the song proves that Robyn " can crank out catchy jams as fast as pop 's biggest hitmakers . " Tyler Grisham of Pitchfork noted Robyn 's ability to synthesize " disparate moods and feelings in a single track . " He concluded by saying that " it would take lesser pop artists an entire album to explore the wide spectrum of emotions that she can express in less than four minutes . " Robert Ballantyne of music website <unk> described it as " both a peppy pop track and a ballad " , and called it Robyn 's best single yet , stating , " Producer and long @-@ time Robyn collaborator Klas Åhlund adds just the right amount of au courant electro @-@ pop into the mix , but not too much to doom the track to the dance @-@ club ghetto . " Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars , and wrote that " What began life as a subdued @-@ but @-@ beautiful strings ' n ' piano ballad is now a strident electropop tune that percolates as <unk> as your next door neighbour 's brand new coffee maker . " 
 In her review for Daily Star , Sarah @-@ Louise James wrote that the " rousing pop gem could be the sequel to the <unk> @-@ tickling [ With ] Every Heartbeat . " Tom Ewing of The Guardian referred it to as the " perfect counterpoint " to " Dancing on My Own " , and praised it for " sound [ ing ] like the best Pet Shop Boys record in 15 years . " MTV News named the song the twenty @-@ first best of 2010 , with James Montgomery calling it a " rather fragile , heartbreaking exploration of those first tentative steps into ( or out of ) love " . Montgomery pointed out that " Robyn cautions us not to fall “ recklessly , headlessly ” in love with her , but when she makes songs as good as “ Hang With Me , ” it 's sort of difficult not to . "

 Melbourne Airport ( IATA : MEL , ICAO : <unk> ) , also known as Tullamarine Airport , is the primary airport serving the city of Melbourne , and the second busiest airport in Australia . It was opened in 1970 to replace the nearby Essendon Airport . Melbourne Airport is the sole international airport of the four airports serving the Melbourne metropolitan area . 
 The airport is 23 km ( 14 mi ) from the city centre . The airport has its own postcode — Melbourne Airport , Victoria ( postcode 3045 ) . This is adjacent to the suburb of Tullamarine . 
 The Melbourne – Sydney air route is the third most @-@ travelled passenger air route in the world . The airport features direct flights to 33 domestic destinations of Australia in addition to destinations in the Pacific , London , Asia and North America . Melbourne Airport is the number one arrival / departure point for the airports of four of Australia 's seven other capital <unk> Melbourne serves as a major hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia , while Jetstar Airways and Tiger Airways Australia utilise the airport as home base . There is no rail link from the airport to the city centre , a regular coach service provides public transport to and from the city . Melbourne is the busiest airport for international export freight as of August 2011 , while second busiest for import freight . Domestically , Melbourne serves as headquarters for Australian air Express and Toll Priority and handles more domestic freight than any other airport in the nation . 
 In 2003 , Melbourne received the International Air Transport Association Eagle Award for service and two National Tourism Awards for tourism services . The airport comprises four terminals : one international terminal , two domestic terminals and one budget domestic terminal . Most recently Melbourne Airport was awarded by Skytrax for having the best Airport hotel in the Australia / Pacific in the World Airport Awards . Melbourne Airport was also ranked the 43rd best airport for 2012 . Melbourne reached 30 million passengers for the first time in the 12 months ending July 2013 . This increased to 33 @.@ 1 million passengers per annum by July 2015 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 Before the opening of Melbourne Airport , Melbourne 's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially designated an international airport in 1950 . In the mid @-@ 1950s , over 10 @,@ 000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent . Essendon Airport 's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel ; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers , by the mid @-@ 1950s , an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar . Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary , the airport had become surrounded by residential housing , meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible . 
 The search for a replacement for Essendon commenced in February 1958 , when a panel was appointed to assess Melbourne 's civil aviation needs . 
 In 1959 the Commonwealth Government acquired 5 @,@ 300 ha ( 13 @,@ 000 acres ) of grassland in then @-@ rural Tullamarine . 
 In May 1959 it was announced that a new airport would be built at Tullamarine , with Prime Minister Robert Menzies announcing on 27 November 1962 a five @-@ year plan to provide Melbourne with a A $ 45 million " jetport " by 1967 . The first sod at Tullamarine was turned two years later in November 1964 . In line with the five @-@ year plan , the runways at Essendon were expanded to handle larger aircraft , with Ansett Australia launching the Boeing 727 there in October 1964 , the first jet aircraft used for domestic air travel in Australia . 
 On 1 July 1970 , Melbourne Airport was opened to international operations by Prime Minister John Gorton , ending Essendon 's near 2 @-@ decade run as Melbourne 's international airport . Essendon still was home to domestic flights for one year , until they were transferred to Melbourne Airport on 26 June 1971 , with the first arrival of a Boeing 747 occurring later that year . In the first year of operations , Melbourne handled six international airlines and 155 @,@ 275 international passengers . 
 Melbourne Airport was originally called ' Melbourne International Airport ' . It is at Tullamarine , a name derived from the indigenous name <unk> . Locally , the airport is commonly referred to as Tullamarine or simply as Tulla to distinguish the airport from the other three Melbourne airports : Avalon , Essendon and <unk> . 
 On opening , Melbourne Airport consisted of three connected terminals : International in the centre , with Ansett to the South and Trans Australia Airlines to the North . The design capacity of the airport was eight Boeing 707s at a rate of 500 passengers per hour , with minor expansion works completed in 1973 allowing Boeing 747s to serve the airport . By the late 1980s peak passenger flows at the airport had reached 900 per hour , causing major congestion . 
 In late 1989 , Federal Airports Corporation Inspector A. <unk> was put in charge of a bicentennial project to rename streets in Melbourne Airport to honour the original inhabitants , European pioneers and aviation history . Information on the first two categories was provided by Ian Hunter , <unk> researcher , and Ray Gibb , local historian . The project was completed but was shelved , with the only suggested name , Gowrie Park Drive , being allocated , named after the farm at the heart of the airport . During the 1920s , the farm had been used as a landing site for aircraft , which were parked at night during World War II in case Essendon Aerodrome was bombed . 
 = = = Expansion and privatisation = = = 
 In 1988 , the Australian Government formed the Federal Airports Corporation ( FAC ) , placing Melbourne Airport under the operational control of the new corporation along with 21 other airports around the nation . In April 1994 , the Australian Government announced that all airports operated by Federal Airports Corporation would be privatised in several phases . Melbourne Airport was included in the first phase , being acquired by the newly formed Australia Pacific Airports Corporation Limited for $ 1 @.@ 3 billion . The transfer was completed on 30 June 1997 on a 50 @-@ year long @-@ term lease , with the option for a further 49 years . Melbourne Airport is categorised as a Leased Commonwealth Airport . 
 In July 1997 , the Melbourne Airport website was launched , providing Australia 's first real @-@ time flight operations data over the internet . 
 The first major upgrades at the airport were carried out at the domestic terminals , with an expansion of the Ansett domestic terminal approved in 1989 and completed in 1991 , adding a second pier for use by smaller regional airlines . Work on an upgrade of the international terminal commenced in 1991 , with the ' <unk> ' retail complex completed in late 1993 on a site flanking the main international departure gates . The rest of the work was completed in 1995 , when the new three @-@ level satellite concourse was opened at the end of the existing concourse . Diamond shaped and measuring 80 m ( 260 ft ) on each side , the additional 10 aerobridges provided by the expansion doubled the international passenger handing capacity at Melbourne Airport . 
 Since privatisation , further improvements to infrastructure have begun at the airport , including expansion of runways , car parks and terminals . The multi @-@ storey carpark outside the terminal was completed between 1995 and August 1997 at a cost of $ 49 million , providing 3 @,@ 100 parking spaces , the majority undercover . This initially four @-@ level structure replaced the previous open air carpark outside the terminal . Work commenced on the six @-@ story 276 @-@ room Hilton Hotel ( now Park Royal ) above the carpark in January 1999 , which was completed in mid @-@ 2000 at a cost of $ 55 million . Expansion of the Qantas domestic terminal was completed in 1999 , featuring a second pier and 9 additional aircraft stands . 
 In December 2000 , a fourth passenger terminal was opened : the Domestic Express Terminal , located to the south of the main terminal building at a cost of $ 9 million . It was the first additional passenger terminal facility to be built at Melbourne Airport since 1971 . 
 Expansion of carparks has also continued with a $ 40 million project commenced in 2004 , doubling the size of the short term carpark with the addition of 2 @,@ 500 spaces over six levels , along with 1 @,@ 200 new spaces added to the 5 @,@ 000 already available in the long term carpark . Revenue from retail operations at Melbourne Airport broke the $ 100 million mark for the first time in 2004 , this being a 100 per cent increase in revenue since the first year of privatisation . 
 Widening of the main north – south runway by 15 m ( 49 ft ) was completed over a 29 @-@ day period in May 2005 , enabling the operation of the Airbus A380 . The works were followed in March 2006 by a 5 @,@ 000 m2 ( 54 @,@ 000 sq ft ) expansion of Terminal 2 , and the construction of an additional level of airline lounges above the terminal . In 2008 a further 25 @,@ 000 m2 ( 270 @,@ 000 sq ft ) expansion of Terminal 2 commenced , costing $ 330 million with completion in 2011 . The works added 5 additional aerobridges on a new passenger concourse , and a new 5 @,@ 000 m2 ( 54 @,@ 000 sq ft ) outbound passenger security and customs processing zone .

 Melbourne Airport 's terminals have 56 gates : 40 domestic and 16 international . There are five dedicated freighter parking positions on the Southern Freighter Apron . The current terminal numbering system was introduced in July 2005 ; they were previously known as Qantas Domestic , International , and South ( formerly Ansett Domestic ) . 
 = = = Terminal 1 = = = 
 Terminal 1 hosts domestic and regional services for Qantas Group airlines , Qantas and QantasLink ( which is located to the northern end of the building ) . Departures are located on the first floor , while arrivals are located on the ground floor . The terminal has 16 parking bays served by aerobridges ; 12 are served by single aerobridges whilst four are served by double aerobridges . There are another five non @-@ <unk> gates , which are used by QantasLink . 
 Opened with Melbourne Airport in 1970 for Trans Australia Airlines , the terminal passed to Qantas in 1992 when they acquired the airline . Work on improving the original terminal commenced in October 1997 and was completed in late 1999 at a cost of $ 50 million , featuring a second pier , stands for 9 additional aircraft , an extended access roadway and the expansion of the terminal . 
 Today , a wide range of shops and food outlets are situated at the end of the terminal near the entrance into Terminal 2 . Qantas has a Qantas Club , Business Class and a chairman 's lounge in the terminal . 
 = = = Terminal 2 = = = 
 Terminal 2 handles all international , and limited domestic , flights out of Melbourne Airport , and was opened in 1970 . The terminal has 20 gates with aerobridges . Cathay Pacific , Malaysia Airlines , Qantas ( which includes two lounges in Terminal 2 , a First lounge and a Business lounge / Qantas Club ) , Singapore Airlines , Air New Zealand , United Airlines and Emirates Airline all operate airline lounges in the terminal . 
 The international terminal contains works by noted Australian Indigenous artists including Daisy Jugadai Napaltjarri and Gloria Petyarre . 
 A $ 330 million expansion programme for Terminal 2 was announced in 2007 and was completed in 2012 . The objectives of this project include new lounges and retail facilities , a new satellite terminal , increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas . A new satellite terminal features floor @-@ to @-@ ceiling windows offers views of the North @-@ South runway . The new concourse includes three double @-@ decker aerobridges which are gates 16 , 18 and 20 , each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single <unk> . The baggage handling capacity will be increased , and two new baggage carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic . Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011 but was opened in 2012 . 
 Although described as a satellite terminal , the terminal building is connected by an above @-@ ground corridor to Terminal 2 . Departures take place on the lower deck ( similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11 ) , with arrivals streamed on to the first floor to connect with the current first floor arrivals deck . All gates including 18 and 20 are now handling passengers . 
 = = = Terminal 3 = = = 
 Terminal 3 – opened with the airport as the Ansett Australia terminal , but is now owned by Melbourne Airport . Terminal 3 is home to Virgin Australia and Virgin Australia Regional Airlines . It currently has eleven parking bays served by single aerobridges and eight parking bays not equipped with aerobridges . 
 An expansion of the terminal was approved in 1989 and completed in 1991 when a second pier was added by Ansett to the south for use by smaller regional airline Kendell . The terminal was used exclusively by the Ansett Group for all its domestic activities until its collapse in 2001 . It was intended to be used by the " New " Ansett , under ownership of <unk> – however , following the <unk> group 's withdrawal of the purchase of Ansett in 2002 , the terminal was sold back to Melbourne Airport by Ansett 's administrators . As a result , Melbourne Airport undertook a major renovation and facelift of the terminal , following which Virgin Australia ( then Virgin Blue ) moved in from what was then called Domestic Express ( now Terminal 4 ) , and has since began operating The Lounge in the terminal , using the former Ansett Australia Golden Wing Lounge area . Regional Express also operates an airline lounge in the terminal . 
 = = = Terminal 4 = = = 
 Terminal 4 – originally called the Domestic Express or South Terminal – is dedicated to budget airlines and is the first facility of its kind at a conventional airport in Australia . It was originally constructed for Virgin Blue ( Virgin Australia ) and Impulse Airlines . Virgin Blue eventually moved into Terminal 3 following the demise of Ansett . A $ 5 million refit began in June 2007 along the lines of the budget terminal model at Singapore Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport . Lower landing and airport handling fees are charged to airlines due to the basic facilities , lack of jet bridges , and fewer amenities and retail outlets compared to a conventional terminal . However , the terminal is located next to the main terminal building , unlike in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur . The terminal was rebuilt by Tiger Airways Australia , which has used it as its main hub since it operated its first domestic flight on 23 November 2007 . 
 Jetstar Airways confirmed its involvement in discussions with Melbourne Airport regarding the expansion of terminal facilities to accommodate for the growth of domestic low @-@ cost services . The expansion of Terminal 4 includes infrastructure to accommodate Tiger Airways Australia and Jetstar Airways flights . The development cost hundreds of millions of dollars . In March 2012 it was announced that in October the same year T4 is to break ground , an expected completion of July 2014 was released , but was pushed back to late August 2015 and opened on 18 August 2015 . The new T4 terminal is 35 @,@ 000 m2 ( 380 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and linked " under one roof " with T3 . Terminal 4 is currently used by Tigerair Australia , Regional Express Airlines , Jetstar and <unk> .

In 2004 , the environmental management systems were accredited ISO 14001 , the world 's best practice standard , making it the first airport in Australia to receive such accreditation . 
 = = = Airbus A380 = = = 
 Construction works were undertaken to prepare the airport for the arrival of the double @-@ decker Airbus A380 . The A380 has been purchased by several airlines using the airport , namely Malaysia Airlines , Qantas , Qatar Airways , Thai Airways , China Southern Airlines , Singapore Airlines , Etihad Airways and Emirates . The improvements included the construction of dual <unk> ( Gates 9 and 11 ) with the ability to board both decks simultaneously to reduce turnaround times , the widening of the North @-@ South runway and remote stands and taxiways by 15 m ( 49 ft ) , the extension of the international terminal building by 20 m ( 66 ft ) to include new penthouse airline lounges , and the construction of an additional baggage carousel in the arrivals hall . As a result , the airport was the first in Australia to be capable of handling the A380 . The A380 made its first test flight into the airport on 14 November 2005 . On 15 May 2008 the A380 made its first passenger flight into the airport when a Singapore Airlines Sydney @-@ bound flight was diverted from Sydney Airport because of fog . 
 Beginning services in October 2008 , Qantas was the first airline to operate the A380 from the airport , flying nonstop to Los Angeles International Airport twice a week . This was the inaugural route for the Qantas A380 . 
 = = = Runways = = = 
 Melbourne Airport has two intersecting runways : one 3 @,@ 657 m ( 11 @,@ 998 ft ) north – south and one 2 @,@ 286 m ( 7 @,@ 500 ft ) east – west . Due to increasing traffic , several runway expansions are planned , including an 843 m ( 2 @,@ 766 ft ) extension of the north @-@ south runway to lengthen it to 4 @,@ 500 m ( 14 @,@ 764 ft ) , and a 1 @,@ 214 m ( 3 @,@ 983 ft ) extension of the east – west runway to a total of 3 @,@ 500 m ( 11 @,@ 483 ft ) . Two new runways are also planned : a 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 843 ft ) runway parallel to the current north – south runway and a 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 843 ft ) runway south of the current east – west runway . The 3rd runway is expected to cost $ 500 million and will be open by 2020 . Traffic movement is expected to reach 248 @,@ 000 per annum by 2017 , necessitating a third runway . 
 On 5 June 2008 , it was announced that the airport would install a Category III landing system , allowing planes to land in low visibility conditions , such as fog . This system will be the first of its kind in Australia , and was commissioned March 2010 at a cost of $ 10 million . 
 = = = Melbourne Centre = = = 
 In addition to the onsite control tower , the airport is home to Melbourne Centre , an air traffic control facility that is responsible for the separation of aircraft in Australia 's busiest flight information region , Melbourne FIR . Melbourne FIR monitors airspace over Victoria , Tasmania , southern New South Wales , most of South Australia , the southern half of Western Australia and airspace over the Indian and Southern Ocean . In total , the centre controls 6 % of the world 's airspace .

 Melbourne Airport is 23 km ( 14 mi ) from the city centre and is accessible via the Tullamarine Freeway . One freeway offramp runs directly into the airport grounds , and a second to the south serves freight transport , taxis , buses and airport staff . In June , 2015 , the Airport Drive extension was completed , creating a second major link to the airport . The link starts at the <unk> Western Ring Road and provides direct access to Melrose Drive 1 @.@ 5 kilometres from the terminal area . Melbourne Airport has five car parks , all of which operate 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . The short @-@ term , multi @-@ level long @-@ term , business and express carparks are covered , while the long @-@ term parking is not . The main multi @-@ level carpark in front of the terminal was built in the late 1990s , replacing the pre @-@ existing ground @-@ level car parking . It has been progressively expanded ever since .

 The <unk> Super Shuttle bus service is the main public transport link to the airport , taking approximately 20 minutes to reach Southern Cross Station in the Melbourne central business district . From Southern Cross , travellers can access V / Line regional and Metro Trains Melbourne suburban trains , Yarra Trams and interstate train and bus services . 
 There are local bus services to Melbourne Airport . The route 901 <unk> service was introduced in September 2010 , as a frequent local bus service . 
 There are nine other bus companies serving the airport , with services to Ballarat , Bendigo , Dandenong , Frankston , Mornington Peninsula , Geelong , Melbourne 's suburbs , Shepparton and the Riverina . These provide alternatives to transfer onto V / Line services . 
 = = = = Proposed Melbourne Airport Rail Link = = = = 
 There is no railway connection between the airport and the city . The possibility of installing a rail link from what was known as the Broadmeadows ( now the Craigieburn Suburban Line ) to the airport was debated in the 1960s , but little progress was made . 
 In 2001 , the state government investigated the construction of a heavy rail link to the airport under the Linking Victoria programme . Two options were considered ; the first branched off the Craigieburn Suburban Line to the east , and the second branched off the Albion Goods Line , which passes close to the airport 's boundary to the south . The second option was preferred . Market research concluded most passengers preferred travelling to the airport by taxi or car , and poor patronage of similar links in Sydney and Brisbane cast doubt on the viability of the project . This led to the project being deferred until at least 2012 . On 21 July 2008 , the Premier of Victoria reaffirmed the government 's commitment to a rail link and said that it would be considered within three to five years . To maximise future development options , the airport is lobbying for the on @-@ grounds section of the railway to be underground . 
 In 2010 , Martin Pakula of the Labor Party , newly appointed State Minister for Public Transport announced that the rail link had been taken off the agenda with new freeway options being explored instead , however a change of government at the 2010 Victorian State Election to Liberals , saw policy for the introduction of the rail link return to the agenda , with a promise by the incoming Coalition government to undertake planning for its construction . 
 Proposals in January 2013 to improve the bus service to the airport involving turning emergency lanes into bus lanes on the freeway and the Bolte Bridge and putting <unk> on a <unk> fare , were challenged by CityLink operator <unk> , because it would limit its toll revenue , and by Melbourne Airport , because it would reduce its car parking profits . Similar objections would apply to a rail link . 
 On 13 March 2013 , the Victorian Liberal government under the newly installed Premier , Denis <unk> , announced that the Melbourne Airport Rail Link ( MARL ) would be constructed sometime in the future running from the CBD via Sunshine station and the Albion – Jacana railway line .

 On 29 May 2003 , Qantas Flight 1737 from Melbourne to Launceston Airport was hijacked shortly after takeoff . The hijacker , a passenger named David Robinson , intended to fly the aircraft into the Walls of Jerusalem National Park , located in central Tasmania . The flight attendants and passengers successfully subdued and restrained the hijacker , and the aircraft returned to Melbourne . 
 On 20 March 2009 , Emirates Airline Flight 407 , an Airbus A340 @-@ 500 , was taking off from Melbourne Airport on Runway 16 for a flight to Dubai International Airport and failed to become airborne in the normal distance . When the aircraft was nearing the end of the runway , the crew commanded nose @-@ up sharply , causing its tail to scrape along the runway as it became airborne , during which smoke was observed in the cabin . The crew dumped fuel and returned to the airport . The damage caused to the aircraft was considered substantial . The aircraft damaged a strobe light at the end of the runway as well as an antenna on the localiser , which led to the ILS being out of service for some time causing some disruptions to the airport 's operation .

 = Blair Swannell = 
 Major Blair Inskip Swannell ( 20 August 1875 – 25 April 1915 ) was an English @-@ born international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Northampton , and internationally for the British Isles and later Australia . He was invited to tour with the British Isles on their 1899 tour of Australia and then their 1904 tour of Australia and New Zealand . He played a total of seven Test matches on these tours , and scored one Test try – against Australia during the 1904 tour . After settling in Australia , Swannell played a single game for his new home when they faced New Zealand . He was viewed as a violent player , and this made his unpopular with other players . Former Australian captain Herbert Moran said of him that " ... his conception of rugby was one of trained violence " . 
 During the Second Boer War , Swannell served in the British Army in South Africa , rising to the rank of lieutenant . During the First World War he joined the Australian Imperial Force and was appointed with the rank of major , serving with the 1st Battalion . He was killed on 25 April 1915 while taking part in the Landing at Anzac Cove , during the first day of the Gallipoli Campaign . 
 = = Personal history = = 
 Swannell was born in Weston Underwood , Buckinghamshire on 20 August 1875 to William and Charlotte Swannell , and was the third child of at least five siblings . His father was a farmer , who ran a 423 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 71 km2 ) farm which employed 17 adults and children . He was home schooled as an infant before beginning his formal education at Repton School . After leaving school he attended the Thames Nautical Training College where he gained qualifications as a second mate . He remained single throughout his life . 
 In 1897 he made his first visit to Australia , as a mate on a schooner . On his return to Britain , Swannell joined the British Army and served in South Africa during the Second Boer War , where he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 35th Battalion ( Buckinghamshire ) Imperial Yeomanry on 20 January 1902 . He retained the rank of honorary lieutenant when he resigned his commission on 3 February 1903 . It was reported that during his time in South Africa , he was personally recommended on the field for a commission by General Lord Methuen . 
 Swannell was a keen self @-@ promoter , claiming a number of exploits that were so abounding , that his adventures were " too numerous to be recorded " . These claims included : fighting among the insurrectionists in Uruguay , to have hunted seal down the South American coast and around Cape Horn as well as Labrador , and to have played rugby in France , Germany , South Africa , India and North and South America . Many of these claims are unsubstantiated . One claim that is problematic , was made by the Fielding Star newspaper in 1909 , that he took part in the Cape Frontier war . This cannot be a reference to the Xhosa Wars as the last of that series of wars ended in 1879 , when he was merely the age of four . An article from 1925 , claimed he represented Wales and Argentina . 
 After touring Australia with the British Isles team for the second time in 1904 , he settled in Sydney . A keen all @-@ round sportsman he coached not only rugby but also hockey , was vice @-@ president of the Sydney Swimming Club , and training senior military cadets for surf life @-@ saving examinations . He also joined the Australian Militia , and by 1914 had reached the rank of captain and had passed the promotion exams for the rank of major . 
 = = Rugby career = = 
 Swannell played as a forward , and in his last Test specifically at number eight . He was an unconventional and hard rugby player , known for his violent play . He would turn up for training in unwashed kit , and wore the same pair of breeches for every game , again unwashed . His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style , made him an unpopular character in the eyes of other players . 
 Swannell first came to note as a rugby player when he represented English club team Northampton . It was while with Northampton that Swannell was invited to tour with Matthew <unk> 's British Isles team , on their 1899 tour of Australia . <unk> played in 17 matches of the tour including three of the four Tests against the Australian national team , missing only the opening defeat . Swannell scored in only one game on the tour , a try in a win over the New South Wales Waratahs on 29 July 1899 . 
 Swannell returned to Britain with the touring team , and was reselected for the 1904 tour , this time taking in Australia and New Zealand . Swannell played in 15 games , including all four Test Matches , three against Australia and the final Test against New Zealand . In the third Test , Swannell scored his first and only international points , a try against Australia in Sydney . The British Isles were victorious over the Australians , but lost the New Zealand match , this was the first international game that Swannell had been on the losing side . In the New Zealand clash , Swannell 's violent playing style , was targeted by countering with equally rough play . He left the field at the end of the match with two black eyes , and bleeding , but with his spirit undaunted . 
 When the touring British team returned home after the 1904 campaign , Swannell along with team @-@ mates David Bedell @-@ Sivright , and Dr. Sidney Crowther decided to remain in Australia , to begin new lives , although Crowther later returned to England . Swannell joined club team Northern Suburbs , based in Sydney . In 1905 he was selected to play for the Australian national team , even though he had already faced them as an opponent on six occasions . The match was against New Zealand , and was the first overseas tour the Australians had undertaken ; Australia lost 14 – 3 . Wallaby captain Herbert Moran didn 't mince words when speaking of Swannell in <unk> Winds saying " Swannell was , for a number of years , a bad influence in Sydney football ... his conception of rugby was one of trained violence " 
 With his playing career behind him , Swannell continued his involvement with the sport by coaching at youth and school level , namely at St Joseph 's College where he coached the team to a number of championships . He was an advocate for team training and in particular for forwards to rehearse scrummaging and break @-@ down techniques . He argued that the forwards won or lost the game . In 1909 , he became Secretary of the Metropolitan Rugby Union , and in 1910 the club raised his salary from £ 200 to £ 250 . Financial stress on the club lead him to resign in 1911 to save expense , but he continued in an ' honorary position ' . He also served as a referee from 1911 to 1914 , earning praise for his ability to control the game . 
 While in Australia , Swannell was often approached by the sporting press for his opinion on rugby matters . Particularly on clashes between British and Antipodean teams , including the 1905 New Zealand tour . He was vocal in his support for maintaining the amateur nature of rugby , but did not side with Bedell @-@ Sivright in denying that a stipend had been paid during the 1904 tour . In 1908 he was also hired to write a series of articles for the Star on the topic of forward play , and scrummaging . 
 = = Gallipoli and death = = 
 With the outbreak of the First World War , Swannell enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force , was appointed to the rank of major and posted to Egypt , travelling on the SS <unk> . In April 1915 , Swannell was part of the Australian forces sent to partake in the Gallipoli Campaign ; an attempt to capture the Ottoman city of Istanbul . Swannell and his men from D Company of the 1st Battalion , transported on the troopship SS <unk> , landed at the peninsula on 25 April , and were immediately involved in heavy fighting after being diverted to reinforce the 12th Battalion . In the buildup to the assault on the hill known as Baby 700 , Swannell and his men were pinned down under heavy enemy fire , and while attempting to show his men the best method of aiming their rifles , he was shot in the head and killed . He is commemorated at Baby 700 Cemetery in Gallipoli , and also with a plaque on the walls at Weston @-@ Underwood church in Buckinghamshire . 
 In April 2015 for the centenary of the Gallipoli landings , fellow Northampton Saints and England rugby international Ben Foden , was featured narrating tributes to Swannell on both BBC TV regional news and Radio Northampton . Foden penned and read the following message at the grave of Blair Swannell in Turkey : 
 From the turf of Franklin 's Gardens where you stood , 
 To the shores of Gallipoli where you fell , 
 A truer <unk> I know not , 
 Forever bleeding green , black and gold . 
 Rest in peace 
 = The Piper at the Gates of Dawn = 
 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the debut studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd , and the only one made under founder member Syd Barrett 's leadership . The album , named after the title of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame 's The Wind in the Willows and featuring a kaleidoscopic cover photo of the band taken by Vic Singh , was recorded from February to May 1967 and released on 5 August 1967 . It was produced by Beatles engineer Norman Smith and released in 1967 by EMI Columbia in the United Kingdom and Tower in the United States , in August and October respectively . 
 The release of the album in the US was timed with the band 's tour of the US . In the UK , no singles were released from the album , but in the US " Flaming " was offered as a single . The US version of the album has a rearranged track list , and contains the UK non @-@ album single , " See Emily Play " . Two of the album 's songs , " Astronomy Domine " and " Interstellar Overdrive " , became long @-@ term mainstays of the band 's live setlist , while other songs were performed live only a handful of times . 
 Since its release , the album has been hailed as one of the best ever psychedelic rock albums . In 1973 , it was packaged with the band 's second album , A Saucerful of Secrets , and released as A Nice Pair to introduce new fans to the band 's early work after the success of The Dark Side of the Moon . Special limited editions of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn were issued to mark its thirtieth and fortieth anniversaries in 1997 and 2007 , respectively , with the latter release containing bonus tracks . In 2012 , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was voted 347th on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " .

 Architecture students Roger Waters , Nick Mason and Richard Wright and art student Syd Barrett had performed under various group names since 1962 , and began touring as " The Pink Floyd Sound " in 1965 . They turned professional on 1 February 1967 when they signed with EMI , with an advance fee of £ 5 @,@ 000 . Their first single , a song about a kleptomaniac transvestite titled " Arnold Layne " , was released on 11 March to mild controversy , as Radio London refused to air it . About three weeks later the band were introduced to the mainstream media . EMI 's press release claimed that the band were " musical spokesmen for a new movement which involves experimentation in all the arts " , but EMI attempted to put some distance between them and the underground scene from which the band originated by stating that " the Pink Floyd does not know what people mean by psychedelic pop and are not trying to create hallucinatory effects on their audiences . " The band returned to Sound Techniques studio to record their next single , " See Emily Play " , on 18 May . The single was released almost a month later , on 16 June , and reached number six in the charts . Pink Floyd picked up a tabloid reputation for making music for LSD users . The popular broadsheet News of the World printed a story nine days before the album 's recording sessions began , saying that " The Pink Floyd group specialise in ' psychedelic music ' , which is designed to illustrate LSD experiences . " Contrary to this image , only Barrett was known to be taking LSD ; authors Ray B. Browne and Pat Browne contend that he was the " only real drug user in the band " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The band 's record deal was relatively poor for the time : a £ 5 @,@ 000 advance over five years , low royalties and no free studio time . However , it did include album development and EMI , unsure of exactly what kind of band they had signed , gave them free rein to record whatever they wanted . They were obliged to record their first album at EMI 's Abbey Road Studios in London , overseen by producer Norman Smith , a central figure in Pink Floyd 's negotiations with EMI . Balance engineer Pete Bown , who had mentored Smith , helped ensure that the album had a unique sound , through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques . Bown , assisted by studio manager David Harris , set up microphones an hour before the sessions began . Bown 's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles ' EMI sessions . Because of Barrett 's quiet voice , he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts . Automatic double tracking ( ADT ) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments . The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and reverberation to give it its own unique sound . Much of the reverberation effect came from a set of Elektro @-@ Mess @-@ Technik plate <unk> – customised EMT <unk> containing thin metal plates under tension – and the studio 's tiled echo chamber built in 1931 . 
 The album is made up of two different classes of songs : lengthy improvisations from the band 's live performances and shorter songs that Barrett had written . Barrett 's LSD intake escalated part @-@ way through the album 's recording sessions . Although in his 2005 autobiography Mason recalled the sessions as relatively trouble @-@ free , Smith disagreed and claimed that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism . In an attempt to build a relationship with the band , Smith played jazz on the piano while the band joined in . These jam sessions worked well with Waters , who was apparently helpful , and Wright , who was " laid @-@ back " . Smith 's attempts to connect with Barrett were less productive : " With Syd , I eventually realised I was wasting my time . " Smith later admitted that his traditional ideas of music were somewhat at odds with the psychedelic background from which Pink Floyd had come . Nevertheless , he managed to " discourage the live ramble " , as band manager Peter Jenner called it , guiding the band toward producing songs with a more manageable length . Barrett would end up writing eight of the album 's songs and contributing to two instrumentals credited to the whole band , with Waters creating the sole remaining composition " Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk " . Mason recalled how the album " was recorded in what one might call the old @-@ fashioned way : rather quickly . As time went by we started spending longer and longer . " 
 Recording started on 21 February with six takes of " Matilda Mother " , then called " Matilda 's Mother " . The following week , on the 27th , the band recorded five takes of " Interstellar Overdrive " , and " Chapter 24 " . On 16 March , the band had another go at recording " Interstellar Overdrive " , in an attempt to create a shorter version , and " Flaming " ( originally titled " <unk> " ) , which was recorded in a single take with one vocal overdub . On 19 March , six takes of " The Gnome " were recorded . The following day , the band recorded Waters ' " Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk " . On 21 March , the band were invited to watch the Beatles record " Lovely Rita " . The following day , they recorded " The Scarecrow " in one take . The next three tracks - " Astronomy Domine " , " Interstellar Overdrive " and " Pow R. Toc H. " – were worked on extensively between 21 March and 12 April , having originally been lengthy instrumentals . Between 12 and 18 April , the band recorded " Percy the Rat Catcher " and a currently unreleased track called " She Was a Millionaire " . 
 " Percy the Rat Catcher " received overdubs across five studio sessions and then was mixed in late June , eventually being given the name " Lucifer Sam " . Songwriting for the majority of the album is credited solely to Barrett , with tracks such as " Bike " having been written in late 1966 before the album was started . " Bike " was recorded on 21 May 1967 and originally entitled " The Bike Song " . By June , Barrett 's increasing LSD use during the recording project left him looking visibly debilitated . 
 = = Release = = 
 In June 1967 before the album was released , the single " See Emily Play " was sold as a 7 @-@ inch 45 rpm record , with " The Scarecrow " on the B @-@ side , listed as " Scarecrow " . The full album was released on 5 August 1967 , including " The Scarecrow " . The album contains whimsical lyrics about space , scarecrows , gnomes , bicycles and fairy tales , along with psychedelic instrumental music . Pink Floyd continued to perform at the UFO Club , drawing huge crowds , but Barrett 's deterioration caused them serious concern . The band initially hoped that his erratic behaviour was a phase that would pass , but others , including manager Peter Jenner and his secretary June Child , were more realistic : 
 ... I found him in the dressing room and he was so ... gone . Roger Waters and I got him on his feet , we got him out to the stage ... and of course the audience went spare because they loved him . The band started to play and Syd just stood there . He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down . 
 To the band 's consternation , they were forced to cancel their appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival , informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion . Jenner and Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist – a meeting he did not attend . He was sent to relax in the sun on the Spanish island of Formentera with Waters and Sam Hutt ( a doctor well @-@ established in the underground music scene ) , but this led to no visible improvement . 
 The original UK LP ( with a monaural mix ) was released on 5 August 1967 , and one month later it was released in stereophonic mix . It reached number six on the UK charts . The Canadian LP had the same title and track listing as the UK version . The original US album appeared on the Tower division of Capitol on 26 October 1967 . This version was officially titled simply Pink Floyd , though the original album title did appear on the back cover as on the UK issue . The US album featured an abbreviated track listing , and reached number 131 on the Billboard charts . The UK single , " See Emily Play " , was substituted for " Astronomy Domine " , " Flaming " and " Bike " . Released in time for the band 's US tour , " Flaming " was released as a single , backed with " The Gnome " . The Tower issue of the album also faded out " Interstellar Overdrive " and broke up the segue into " The Gnome " to fit the re @-@ sequencing of the songs . Later US issues on compact disc had the same title and track list as the UK version . The album was certified Gold in the US on 11 March 1994 . 
 About being handled on Tower Records , Jenner commented that : " In terms of the U.K. and Europe it was always fine . America was always difficult . Capitol couldn 't see it . You know , ' What is this latest bit of rubbish from England ? Oh Christ , it 'll give us more grief , so we 'll put it out on Tower Records ' , which was a subsidiary of Capitol Records [ ... ] It was a very <unk> operation and it was the beginning of endless problems The Floyd had with Capitol . It started off bad and went on being bad . "

 Up @-@ and @-@ coming society photographer Vic Singh was hired to photograph the band for the album cover . Singh shared a studio with photographer David Bailey , and he was friends with Beatles guitarist George Harrison . Singh asked Jenner and King to dress the band in the brightest clothes they could find . Vic Singh then shot them with a prism lens that Harrison had given him . The cover was meant to resemble an LSD trip , a style that was favoured at the time . 
 Barrett came up with the album title The Piper at the Gates of Dawn ; the album was originally titled Projection up to as late as July 1967 . The title was taken from that of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame 's The Wind in the Willows which contains a visionary encounter with the god Pan , who plays his pan pipe at dawn . It was one of Barrett 's favourite books , and he often gave friends the impression that he was the embodiment of Pan . The moniker was later used in the song " Shine On You Crazy Diamond " , in which Barrett is called " you Piper " . The cover for the album was one of several Pink Floyd album covers used on a series of Royal Mail stamps issued in May 2016 to commemorate 50 years of Pink Floyd . 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 At the time of release , the album was received positively , and the record is now recognised as one of the seminal psychedelic rock albums of the 1960s . In 1967 , both Record Mirror and NME gave the album four stars out of five . Record Mirror commented that " the psychedelic image of the group really comes to life on this LP , which is a fine showcase for both their talent and the recording technique . Plenty of mindblowing sound . " Cash Box called it " a particularly striking collection of driving , up @-@ to @-@ date rock ventures " . Paul McCartney and Pink Floyd 's past producer Joe Boyd both rated the album highly . Some voiced the opinion of the underground fans , by suggesting that the album did not reflect the band 's live performances . 
 In recent years , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn has gained even more recognition . The album is hailed not only as a psychedelic masterpiece but LSD is named as a direct influence . In 1999 Rolling Stone magazine gave the album 4 @.@ 5 stars out of 5 , calling it " the golden achievement of Syd Barrett " . Q magazine described the album as " indispensable " and included it in their list of the best psychedelic albums ever . It was also ranked 40th in Mojo magazine 's " The 50 Most Out There Albums of All Time " list . In 2000 Q magazine placed The Piper at the Gates of Dawn at number 55 in its list of the 100 greatest British albums ever . In 2012 , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was voted 347th on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums ever . James E. Perone says that Piper became known as a concept album in later years , because listeners wanted to play it all the way through rather than pick out a favourite song . While Beatles biographer Philip Norman agrees that Piper is a concept album , other authors contend that Pink Floyd did not start making concept albums until 1973 's The Dark Side of the Moon . Author George Reisch called Pink Floyd the " undisputed " kings of the concept album , but only starting from Dark Side . In July 2006 , Billboard described The Piper at the Gates of Dawn as " one of the best psychedelic rock albums ever , driven by Barrett 's oddball narratives and the band 's skill with both long jams and perfect pop nuggets " .

 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was reissued in the UK in 1979 as a stereo vinyl album , and on CD in the UK and US in 1985 . A digitally remastered stereo CD , with new artwork , was released in the US in 1994 , and in 1997 limited edition 30th anniversary mono editions were released in the UK , on CD and vinyl . These limited editions were in a hefty digipak with 3 @-@ D box art for continental Europe and the world outside the United States . This mono CD included a slightly edited version of " Flaming " . A six @-@ track bonus CD , 1967 : The First Three Singles , was given away alongside the 1997 30th @-@ anniversary edition of the album . 
 In 1973 , the album , along with A Saucerful of Secrets , was released as a two @-@ disc set on Capitol / EMI 's Harvest Records label , titled A Nice Pair to introduce fans to the band 's early work after the success of The Dark Side of the Moon . ( On the American version of that compilation , the original four @-@ minute studio version of " Astronomy Domine " was replaced with the eight @-@ minute live version found on Ummagumma . ) The American edition of A Nice Pair also failed to properly restore the segue between " Interstellar Overdrive " and " The Gnome " . 
 For the 40th anniversary , a two @-@ disc edition was released on 4 September 2007 , and a three @-@ disc set was released on 11 September 2007 . The packaging – designed by Storm Thorgerson – resembles a cloth @-@ covered book , along with a twelve @-@ page reproduction of a Syd Barrett notebook . Discs one and two contain the full album in its original mono mix ( disc one ) , as well as the alternative stereo version ( disc two ) . Both have been newly remastered by James Guthrie . The third disc includes several Piper @-@ era outtakes from the Abbey Road vaults , along with the band 's first three mono singles . Unreleased material includes an alternative , shorter take of " Interstellar Overdrive " that was previously thought lost , the pre @-@ overdubbed abridged mix of " Interstellar Overdrive " previously only available on an EP in France , an alternative mix of " Matilda Mother " as it appeared early in the sessions and also the 1967 stereo mix of " Apples and Oranges " , which features extra untrimmed material at the beginning and end .

 Although there was never an official tour of the album , the band gigged in the UK to promote the album . They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia , and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States . It was unsuccessful , mainly because of the mental breakdown of Barrett . In his capacity as tour manager Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations , but he ran into serious problems . Visas had not arrived , prompting the cancellation of the first six dates . The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November , but work permits were not yet obtained , so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito , California , just north of San Francisco . After a number of cancellations , the first US performance was given 4 November at Winterland Ballroom , following Janis Joplin fronting Big Brother and the Holding Company . 
 For the American tour , many numbers such as " Flaming " and " The Gnome " were dropped , while others such as " Astronomy Domine " and " Interstellar Overdrive " remained , and were central to the band 's setlist during this period , often performed as encores until around 1971 . " Astronomy Domine " was later included on the live disc of Ummagumma , and adopted by the post @-@ Waters Pink Floyd during the 1994 Division Bell tour , with a version included on the 1995 live album Pulse . David Gilmour , though not a member of Pink Floyd at the time the song was originally recorded , resurrected " Astronomy Domine " for his On an Island and Rattle That Lock tours . 
 Communication between company and band was almost non @-@ existent , and Pink Floyd 's relationship with Tower and Capitol was therefore poor . Barrett 's mental condition mirrored the problems that King encountered ; when the band performed at Winterland , he detuned his guitar during " Interstellar Overdrive " until the strings fell off . His odd behaviour grew worse in subsequent performances , and during a television recording for The Pat Boone Show he confounded the director by lip @-@ syncing " Apples and Oranges " perfectly during the rehearsal , and then standing motionless during the take . King quickly curtailed the band 's US visit , sending them home on the next flight . 
 Shortly after their return from the US , beginning 14 November , the band supported Jimi Hendrix on a tour of England , but on one occasion Barrett failed to turn up and they were forced to replace him with singer / guitarist David O 'List borrowed from the opening band the Nice . Barrett 's depression worsened the longer the tour continued . Longtime Pink Floyd psychedelic lighting designer Peter Wynne @-@ Willson left at the end of the Hendrix tour , though he sympathised with Barrett , whose position as frontman was increasingly insecure . Wynne @-@ Willson , who had worked for a percentage , was replaced by his assistant John Marsh who collected a lesser wage . Pink Floyd released " Apples and Oranges " ( recorded prior to the US tour on 26 and 27 October ) , but for the rest of the band Barrett 's condition had reached a crisis point , and they responded by adding David Gilmour to their line @-@ up , initially to cover for Syd 's lapses during live performances . 
 Tracks 8 – 11 on the UK album edition were played the least during live performances . The success of " See Emily Play " and " Arnold Layne " meant that the band were forced to perform some of their singles for a limited period in 1967 , but they were eventually dropped after Barrett left the band . " Flaming " and " Pow R. Toc H. " were also played regularly by the post @-@ Barrett Pink Floyd in 1968 , even though these songs were in complete contrast to the band 's other works at this time . Some of the songs from Piper would be reworked and rearranged for The Man and The Journey live show in 1969 ( " The Pink Jungle " was taken from " Pow R. Toc H. " , and part of " Interstellar Overdrive " was used for " The Labyrinths of <unk> " ) . 
 Beginning in September 1967 , the band played several new compositions . These included " One in a Million " , " Scream Thy Last Scream " , " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " and " Reaction in G " , the last of which was a song created by the band in response to crowds asking for their hit singles " See Emily Play " and " Arnold Layne " . 
 Barrett resurrected the track Lucifer Sam with his short @-@ lived 1972 band Stars

 = 2001 – 02 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 2001 – 02 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season had the earliest named storm since 1992 . Many storms formed in the north @-@ east portion of the basin , and several more originated around Australia . The basin is defined as the waters of the Indian Ocean west of longitude 90 ° E to the coast of Africa and south of the equator . Eleven tropical storms formed , compared to an average of nine . Tropical systems were present during 73 days , which was significantly higher than the average of 58 . 
 Tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center ( RSMC ) in Réunion . The season started on November 1 , 2001 , and ended on April 30 , 2002 ; for Mauritius and the Seychelles , the season continued until May 15 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin ; however , storms formed both before and after the designated season . The first storm was Andre , which emerged from the Australian basin as Tropical Cyclone Alex in late October . The strongest storm , Cyclone Hary , was the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000 ; it hit Madagascar , where it caused lighter damage than expected but three deaths . In January , Cyclone Dina left heavy damage in the Mascarene Islands , particularly on Réunion , where it dropped 2 @,@ 102 mm ( 82 @.@ 8 in ) of rainfall . The final storm was Cyclone Kesiny , which killed 33 people when it struck Madagascar in the midst of a political crisis . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 Météo @-@ France 's meteorological office in Réunion ( MFR ) is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the South @-@ West Indian Ocean , tracking all tropical cyclones from the east coast of Africa to 90 ° E. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , which is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region , also issued advisories for storms during the season . Following the season , the start of the tropical cyclone year was changed to July 1 , which defines the boundary between tropical cyclone seasons . 
 Although the previous season was tame , the 2001 – 02 season was very active and featured several intense tropical cyclones . During the season , eleven systems were named , which was slightly above the average of nine . However , nine of the systems attained cyclone intensity , the second highest total in 30 years . In terms of both the number of systems and number of " cyclone days " , the season was considered comparable by MFR to the 1993 – 94 season . In this season , there were 73 days on which tropical cyclones were active , which was more than twice as much as the previous season and 19 days above the average . A system of cyclone intensity was active on 35 days , which was 15 days above the mean . Additionally , five of the systems attained " intense tropical cyclone " status , including one – Hary – that attained the " very intense tropical cyclone " stage . Activity was relatively distributed throughout the season and had the earliest start since 1992 . Like most seasons within the basin , activity reached a climax in late January . Several systems during the season developed in the eastern portion of the basin , similar to 1993 – 94 ; unlike that season , many storms in 2001 – 02 stayed at sea throughout their lifetime , thus reducing casualties and damage . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Alex – Andre = = = 
 The Bureau of Meteorology ( BoM ) classified a tropical low as Tropical Cyclone Alex on October 26 in the Australian region . It was initially located in an area of strong wind shear , which prevented significant strengthening . However , convection over the system increased on October 27 , and it crossed into the South @-@ West Indian Ocean at around the same time . It was renamed Andre , becoming the earliest date for the first named storm since 1992 . After reaching 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) , according to the MFR , Andre began slowly weakening , due to increasing shear . It moved generally to the west @-@ southwest before turning northwestward on October 29 , around which time the convection separated from the center . Moving slowly , Andre later turned to the southwest after weakening to a tropical depression . Late on October 31 , the system was no longer classifiable as a tropical system , and the remnants continued to the west @-@ southwest until being absorbed by a trough on November 8 . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Bessi – Bako = = = 
 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical low on November 24 in the Australian basin . It moved to the southwest , strengthening into Tropical Cyclone Bessi on November 27 . Two days later , it moved into the South @-@ West Indian Ocean , and was renamed Bako on December 1 . Located in a similar position to the previous storm , Bako strengthened into a severe tropical storm on December 1 , aided by warm waters and slack wind shear . The storm turned to the southeast on December 2 , despite predictions to the contrary , and later that day it intensified further into a tropical cyclone , the first of the season . However , on December 3 , Bako weakened back into a severe tropical storm due to much cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing northwesterly wind shear . It weakened into a tropical depression on December 5 , before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone the same day . RSMC La Reunion continued to track the remnants of Bako until December 9 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Cyprien = = = 
 On December 25 , a cold front dragged over the central Mozambique Channel . A weak circulation formed in the Channel and moderate convection appeared on December 27 . Then on December 30 , RSMC La Reunion designated this low pressure as a zone of disturbed weather and was classified as a tropical depression on January 1 , 2002 . The JTWC also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) early on December 31 and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 08S the next day . As it moved further eastwards it strengthened quickly from a tropical depression into a severe tropical storm , with the Meteorological Services of Madagascar giving it the name Cyprien on January 1 . Cyprien soon became a serious threat to western Madagascar . Convection began to dissipate as wind shear increased and that resulted in quick weakening to a tropical depression . As it made landfall on western Madagascar , it dropped heavy rainfall . In all , Cyprien destroyed 841 homes in the towns of Morombe and Morondava . Damage in the towns was estimated at $ 180 @,@ 000 , but there were no deaths . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Dina = = = 
 Cyclone Dina originated in a tropical disturbance first noted on January 15 near the Chagos Archipelago . By January 17 , the system had developed enough organized convection as it moved southwestward to be declared a tropical depression . Rapid intensification occurred shortly thereafter , with the system attaining winds in excess of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) on January 18 . Dina peaked in intensity on January 20 as an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) . Hours later , the storm bypassed Rodrigues Island about 150 km ( 93 mi ) to its north . On January 21 , the storm brushed Mauritius and Réunion as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward . Once on a southward course , steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January 25 . The remnants of the storm accelerated southeastward and were absorbed into a polar trough on January 28 . 
 Across Mauritius and Réunion , torrential rains and destructive winds from the cyclone resulted in extensive to " catastrophic " damage . The entire island of Mauritius lost power during the storm and widespread structural damage took place . Agricultural and property damage amounted to US $ 47 million and US $ 50 million respectively in the republic . Nine fatalities were attributed to the storm in Mauritius : five off the coast of Rodrigues Island and four on the main island . More extensive damage was seen on Réunion where up to 2 @,@ 102 mm ( 82 @.@ 8 in ) of rain fell over three days . Flooding destroyed many homes , washed out roads , and caused catastrophic agricultural damage . Destructive winds , measured at up to 280 km / h ( 170 mph ) , also crippled communications . In all , six people died on the island and losses were estimated at € 200 million ( US $ 190 million ) . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Eddy = = = 
 A system developed within a convergence zone on January 20 near the boundary between the South @-@ West Indian Ocean and the Australia region . Its circulation became better defined , and MFR initiated advisories on January 22 . With a ridge to the south , it drifted to the southeast , approaching 90 ° E , but turning to the southwest before crossing over . On January 23 , the system intensified into a tropical depression . Slowly intensifying , the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January 24 . That day , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S , and it turned toward the south . After having experienced moderate wind shear , Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions , and its convection gradually organized . Early on January 26 , MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone , later estimating peak winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . After that time , increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to a tropical storm , causing it to curve to the west . By January 28 , the circulation was exposed from the convection , and Eddy weakened to a tropical depression . It turned to the southwest the next day , and dissipated fully on January 30 . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Francesca = = = 
 The origins of Francesca were from a tropical low that formed in the Australia region on January 28 , east of the Cocos Islands . This was near the same place that Eddy had formed a week prior . The system that became Francesca moved west @-@ southwestward due to a ridge to the south . On January 30 it crossed into the South @-@ West Indian Ocean , where wind shear prevented significant development . On January 31 , the system intensified into a tropical depression , and late the next day the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S . Wind shear diminished on February 2 , which allowed the depression to strengthen into Tropical Storm Francesca after convection increased . It continued to intensify steadily , becoming a tropical cyclone on February 3 . The next day , the JTWC upgraded Francesca to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane . 
 An approaching trough turned the cyclone to the southeast , and Francesca quickly developed a well @-@ defined eye . It rapidly strengthened into an intense tropical cyclone , and reached peak winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) on February 4 , according to MFR . The JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) when the storm was located about 1065 km ( 660 mi ) southeast of Diego Garcia . Shortly after peaking , Francesca began weakening , losing its eye , until being a minimal tropical cyclone on February 7 . That day , it re @-@ intensified slightly and redeveloped an eye , although it was short @-@ lived . Increasing shear again weakened Francesca , and on February 9 the cyclone deteriorated to a tropical storm . Cooler waters caused further weakening , which diminished convection over the center . On February 11 , Francesca became extratropical , and the remnants turned to the southwest , dissipating on February 14 . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Guillaume = = = 
 On February 13 , several low pressure areas were located over east @-@ central Madagascar , with an area of convection that extended northwestward across the country toward Comoros . The system dropped heavy rainfall , reaching 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) in Tamatave in a 12 ‑ hour period . In <unk> , the capital of Mayotte , rainfall reached 195 mm ( 7 @.@ 7 in ) in 24 hours , which caused some damage on the island including a bridge collapse . A developing center gradually became better organized , and it took an unusual track offshore toward the northeast , steered by a ridge over Madagascar . On February 14 , MFR classified the system as a zone of disturbed weather , upgrading it to a tropical disturbance the next day . Late on February 15 , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 15S , and early the next day MFR upgraded it to Tropical Depression 10 . Shortly thereafter , the Meteorological Services of Madagascar upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Guillame . 
 Late on February 16 , Guillame began developing a small eye , turning to the east around the same time . With favorable conditions , including good outflow , the system quickly intensified into a compact tropical cyclone as it turned to the southeast . Strengthening briefly stopped on February 17 , possible due to an eyewall replacement cycle , although it resumed the following day . Guillame curved to the south and southwest , reaching peak winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) late on February 18 ; this made it an intense tropical cyclone . The next day , the cyclone passed about 150 km ( 93 mi ) east of Mauritius before an approaching trough turned it to the southeast . Despite the storm 's proximity to the island , effects there were modest , marked by winds of 78 km / h ( 48 mph ) and 71 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) of rain . The cyclone began weakening due to increased wind shear , and deteriorated below tropical cyclone status on February 21 . A strengthening ridge turned Guillame toward the northwest , and the storm dissipated on February 23 . 
 = = = Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hary = = = 
 Cyclone Hary was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season . Developing on March 5 from the monsoon trough , the storm initially moved generally to the west and gradually intensified . With favorable conditions , Hary quickly intensified on March 7 , developing an eye and well @-@ defined outflow . After reaching an initial peak , the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle , by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar . Hary re @-@ intensified and attained peak winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) on March 10 just offshore of eastern Madagascar , which made it the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000 . 
 After peaking , Hary weakened due to land interaction , and it struck Madagascar southeast of Antalaha . After turning south over land , Cyclone Hary quickly moved offshore . There were three deaths in the country , one of which was from electrocution . There was locally heavy crop damage , and four bridges were destroyed . However , the damage was considered minimal , given the intensity of the storm . After affecting Madagascar , Hary accelerated to the southeast , and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over Réunion . On the mountain peaks of the island , rainfall reached 1 @,@ 344 mm ( 52 @.@ 9 in ) , although it was much less near the coast . The rainfall caused flooding , killing one person , and 20 @,@ 000 people were left without power . Hary became extratropical on March 13 , although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid @-@ latitude storm . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Ikala = = = 
 On March 21 , a tropical disturbance quickly developed in the monsoon trough in the south @-@ central Indian Ocean , about 1250 km ( 775 mi ) east of Diego Garcia . A ridge to the south steered the system to the west @-@ southwest , and moderate wind shear in the region prevented significant strengthening . The convection slowly organized , and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ikala early on March 25 . By that time , the shear had decreased , although initially it was strong enough to prevent the convection from covering the center . An approaching cold front turned the storm to the southeast on March 25 , where upper @-@ level conditions became more favorable for strengthening . Thunderstorms increased over the center , and an eye began developing on March 26 . The next day , Ikala intensified into a tropical cyclone , reaching peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) according to MFR ; the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . Shortly after peaking , increased wind shear and drier air from the front quickly weakened Ikala , and it deteriorated below tropical cyclone status on March 28 . That day , the center became exposed from the convection , and on March 29 Ikala became extratropical . The remnants turned to the southwest before recurving to the southeast on March 31 , and Ikala was absorbed by a cold front on April 3 . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Dianne – Jery = = = 
 In early April , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression early on April 7 to the northeast of the Cocos Islands in the Australian basin . It moved to the southwest due to a ridge along the west coast of Australia , and quickly intensified into Tropical Cyclone Dianne . Favorable conditions allowed for continued strengthening , and the storm developed a small eye late on April 7 . The next day , the storm entered into South @-@ West Indian Ocean and was renamed Jery . Shortly thereafter it intensified into a tropical cyclone , although by that time , the conditions were no longer as favorable for rapid intensification . On April 9 , MFR estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) ; around the same time , the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . 
 While at peak intensity , Jery began turning to the south , due to reaching the western edge of a ridge . An approaching trough increased wind shear over the storm , causing the convection to diminish and expose the center . Late on April 10 it weakened below tropical cyclone status , and the next day Jery became extratropical . Shortly thereafter the remnants crossed into the Australian region , dissipating on April 13 . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Kesiny = = = 
 Cyclone Kesiny was the final named storm of the season , forming near the equator on May 2 , within a trough enhanced by a pulse of the Madden – Julian oscillation that sparked three other storms . Kesiny initially moved to the southeast , but later turned to the southwest due to a strengthening ridge . On May 6 , it intensified into a tropical cyclone , but later weakened and was not expected to re @-@ strengthen . However , Kesiny developed an eye and re @-@ intensified into a tropical cyclone on May 9 , reaching peak winds of 130 km / h ( 81 mph ) before striking Madagascar about 60 km ( 37 mi ) southeast of Antsiranana . This made it the first recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in the month of May in the basin . It weakened while crossing the country , and after turning to the south it struck the country again before dissipating on May 11 . 
 Across Madagascar , Cyclone Kesiny dropped heavy rainfall , reaching 891 mm ( 35 @.@ 1 in ) in three days at Toamasina ( the second largest city in the country ) . The rains caused mudslides and flooding in the eastern portion of the country , wrecking the rice and maize crops and leaving 5 @,@ 000 people homeless . At least 33 bridges were destroyed , and many roads were damaged . A total of 33 people were killed , and 1 @,@ 200 people were injured . The cyclone struck in the midst of a political crisis , in which the top two candidates of the Malagasy presidential election in 2001 declared themselves the winner ; the incumbent , who lost , attempted to declare Toamasina the new capital city , and the political instability disrupted relief efforts . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 The first storm of the season originated from an area of convection east of Diego Garcia in early October 2001 . Moving southwestward , it slowly organized , with convection developing around a weak circulation . Late on October 3 , MFR classified the system as a zone of disturbed weather . On October 5 , the agency re @-@ classified it as a tropical disturbance and later as Tropical Depression 1 . The circulation was partially exposed due to wind shear , although it had good outflow . The JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 01S at 0600 UTC on October 6 , estimating winds of about 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Due to the shear , the convection gradually diminished , prompting the MFR to downgrade it to a tropical disturbance on October 7 . The next day , the JTWC issued its last advisory , noting that the system was dissipating . 
 A zone of disturbed weather formed on November 15 in the eastern part of the basin . It remained a zone of disturbed weather for a few days before briefly strengthening into a tropical depression on November 21 . It dissipated two days later . This system was also designated as tropical cyclone by the JTWC . 
 On February 5 , a tropical low developed in the Mozambique Channel . Classified as Tropical Disturbance 9 by MFR , the system moved southeastward , dissipating on February 6 . The season ended with a tropical disturbance , which formed on June 13 to the east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia . It moved to the south , and was last monitored on June 15 . 
 = = Storm names = = 
 A tropical disturbance is named when it reaches moderate tropical storm strength . If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55 ° E , then the Sub @-@ regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm ; between 55 ° E and 90 ° E , the Sub @-@ regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius is responsible for the same task . A new annual list is used every year so no names are retired .

 = Quicksilver ( novel ) = 
 Quicksilver is a historical novel by Neal Stephenson , published in 2003 . It is the first volume of The Baroque Cycle , his late Baroque historical fiction series , succeeded by The Confusion and The System of the World ( both published in 2004 ) . Quicksilver won the Arthur C. Clarke Award and was nominated for the Locus Award in 2004 . Stephenson organized the structure of Quicksilver such that chapters have been incorporated into three internal books titled " Quicksilver " , " The King of the Vagabonds " , and " Odalisque " . In 2006 , each internal book was released in separate paperback editions , to make the 900 pages more approachable for readers . These internal books were originally independent novels within the greater cycle during composition . 
 The novel Quicksilver is written in various narrative styles , such as theatrical staging and epistolary , and follows a large group of characters . Though mostly set in late 17th century England , France , and the United Provinces , the first book includes a frame story set in early 18th century Massachusetts . In order to write the novel , Stephenson researched the period extensively and integrates events and historical themes important to historical scholarship throughout the novel . However , Stephenson alters details such as the members of the Cabal ministry , the historical cabinet of Charles II of England , to facilitate the incorporation of his fictional characters . Within the historical context , Stephenson also deals with many themes which pervade his other works , including the exploration of knowledge , communication and cryptography . 
 The plot of the first and third books focus on Daniel Waterhouse 's exploits as a natural philosopher and friend to the young Isaac Newton and his later observations of English politics and religion , respectively . The second book introduces the vagabond Jack Shaftoe ( " King of the Vagabonds " ) and Eliza ( a former member of a Turkish harem ) as they cross Europe , eventually landing in the Netherlands , where Eliza becomes entangled in commerce and politics . Quicksilver operates in the same fictional universe as Stephenson 's earlier novel Cryptonomicon , in which descendants of Quicksilver characters Shaftoe and Waterhouse appear prominently .
