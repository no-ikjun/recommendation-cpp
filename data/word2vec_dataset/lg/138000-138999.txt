 For more than six years , twenty @-@ three locomotives coexisted with horse @-@ drawn trams on the Rouen network . The speed and regularity of steam trams pleased passengers ( the speed limit was 16 km / h ( 9 @.@ 9 mph ) between Mont @-@ Riboudet and Maromme ) , but they were also expensive . The frequent stops let the boilers cool down , so coal consumption was high . Moreover , steam power angered both residents — who accused them of being dirty and rough @-@ riding — and coachmen — whose animals were scared by the driver 's horn and the " infernal " noise of the trains . Operation thus was totally horse @-@ drawn from 1884 . The CTR thus found itself in charge of a " cavalry " of around 350 horses , stabled at Trianon and Maromme , the depot at Mont @-@ Riboudet having been disposed of . 
 = = = Electrification = = = 
 In 1895 the mediocrity of horse @-@ drawn service and the prospect of the great Colonial Exposition ( due to open in Rouen on 1 April 1896 ) made the town officials think of extension and electrification of the network . Councillors were sent on study trips both in France and abroad . One councillor even spent a year in the United States . At last , after much debate , the town accepted the CTR 's proposals . Electrification was contracted to the company of Thomson Houston , who built the " first network " , ten lines of standard gauge , either over new or re @-@ laid tracks : 
 = = Longest electric tramway in France = = 
 = = = Second network = = = 
 Infrastructure works and construction of the power station on the Rue Lemire were swiftly completed . The first electric locomotive entered service on 2 January 1896 , the electrified network going live fifteen days ahead of schedule ; the last horse @-@ drawn tram saw service on 19 July on the Sotteville line . After teething troubles , the new mode of transport had considerable success : in 1896 it transported over fifteen million passengers . The tram sheds , holding 50 vehicles , were expanded to accommodate 25 more during the first year of service . These were classic tramcars with two axles , powered by two 25 hp ( 19 kW ) motors ( one on each axle ) , and had room for 40 passengers . With its popular success , the network could be completed : the Line 10 extension to Saint @-@ Étienne @-@ du @-@ Rouvray was opened on 16 April 1899 , an 11th line was constructed from Maromme to Notre @-@ Dame @-@ de @-@ <unk> ( opened 17 December 1899 ) , and a 12th from the Church of Saint @-@ Sever to the Saint @-@ Maur sea wall ( 6 February 1908 ) . The Rouen tramways had 37 km ( 23 mi ) of lines , the largest electric network in France . Trams were up to three cars long and ran at 20 km / h ( 12 mph ) at 20 @-@ minute intervals . 
 The dynamism of public transport in Rouen was an inspiration to Baron Empain who , through the intermediary of his colleague <unk> , proposed the creation of a second complementary network . He met numerous difficulties to which the CTR was no stranger , but on 17 July 1899 , a new company to be called Traction <unk> E. <unk> ( a sister company of the better @-@ known Companie Générale de Traction — CGT — ) was granted the concession over five routes : 
 The first services started on Line 1 on 18 January 1900 , the other services starting on 10 May that year , but , facing competition from the CTR , the tramway from Petit @-@ Quevilly was curtailed , its terminus becoming Rue Léon @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = Towards monopoly = = = 
 The second network was far less efficient than the first ; In 1901 the trams transported only 1 @.@ 46 million passengers over 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) of route , being 91 @,@ 000 per route kilometre ( 56 @,@ 500 per route mile ) . ( In 1908 , over 20 million people used public transport in Rouen , 19 million with the CTR , 1 @.@ 6 million with the CGT . ) In 1908 the CGT disposed of the second network to the Compagnie centrale de <unk> de fer et de tramways because of administrative problems , a serious accident at Monumental on 6 November 1908 and a considerable deficit . This became an opportunity for the rival CRT , who in 1910 took over the CGT 's running rights and so were finally rid of competition . 
 The CTR was now master of all of the public transport in Rouen and its suburbs ( having also absorbed the tramway and funicular railway of Bonsecours on 25 September 1909 ) . It reorganised its service to be more integrated . It also expanded the service with later @-@ running trams , and extended Line 12 first to Champ de Courses ( opened 1 January 1910 ) then to Bois @-@ Guillaume ( opened 4 June 1911 ) and Mont @-@ Saint @-@ Aignan ( opened 15 March 1913 ) . This last section , running over the local authority 's rails , connected Grand @-@ Quevilly ( Rue de l ’ Église ) and , on a branch , the district of Petit @-@ Quevilly ( opened 1 August 1915 ) . The network had grown to its largest , with 70 km ( 43 mi ) of routes ( including the tramway of Bonsecours ) . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 World War I did not affect tram service in Rouen as much as it did elsewhere . After a short period of disruption during the great August 1914 mobilisation , the CTR maintained normal service during the four years of war . It overcame its reduced staffing levels with overtime , abolition of leave , and redeployment of depot personnel ; nearly all conductors were promoted to motormen , to their great satisfaction . At the end of 1916 , women ( aged 24 or over in 1916 , reduced to 23 or over in 1918 ) joined men on the trams , but , sexism at that time being the norm , the " <unk> " ( female motormen ) were only allowed on the " easy " lines of Mont @-@ Saint @-@ Aignan , Bois @-@ Guillaume and Monumental , and were not allowed on steep gradients . 
 To satisfy military requirements , the network extended the Champ de Courses track to the Château du <unk> , headquarters of an important BEF base . It also built a connection to transport the injured arriving by train at the Gare Saint @-@ Sever to the main hospitals of Rouen . These installations , constructed in record time , disappeared when the war ended . 
 = = Operational difficulties and closure = = 
 = = = Recovery and competition = = = 
 During World War I the track and rolling stock received little maintenance , and by the end of the war they were in a piteous state , while expenses had increased dramatically . The problem became a crisis after the serious fire at the Trianon depot on 30 November 1921 , which destroyed 70 of the 155 trams of the CTR . Successive fare rises provided a stopgap , but with the new convention of 29 December 1923 the company announced a reorganisation of the network . A competitor had also arrived : the bus . Trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity , slowness and discomfort , and their encumbrance to motor cars in the city centre . Another accident on the Monumental line on 5 October 1925 hastened the inevitable : the trams lost their first route . 
 = = = <unk> through innovation = = = 
 Against these setbacks , the CTR still had a record year in 1928 , with over 30 million journeys . But from 1929 , the buses took to the narrow streets in the city centre , as well as routes with low tram traffic such as <unk> , Maromme and the circular . The tramways continued as going concerns , and started large programmes of renovation and modernisation in the dozen or so years before World War II . Between 1928 and 1932 , 75 first @-@ generation trams were rebuilt to allow one man operation . 
 The Rouen workshops presently devised two prototypes , of classical design , but with double folding doors at the front and safety devices ( compressed air on one of the prototypes , electrical on the other ) which became the basis for a series of 25 vehicles named " <unk> " . 25 new trailing cars completed the new rolling stock . In 1931 , a " revolutionary " pedal @-@ controlled locomotive was built equipped with disc brakes , but lack of funds meant no more came of it . 
 The 1930s also saw the arrival of the trolleybus , having the twin advantages of electrical traction and pneumatic tyres ; these newcomers supplanted the old trams on the Mont @-@ Saint @-@ Aignan line from Sotteville and Saint @-@ Étienne @-@ du @-@ Rouvray . In 1938 , the tram sheds were enlarged for the arrival of the " Parisiennes " , ten reversible trams bought from Paris . 
 = = = World War II and after = = = 
 World War II hit Rouen hard , including its transport network . In 1939 , before the war started , mobilisation and requisition had reduced the service frequency ; the German advance , in 1940 , blew up the city 's bridges ; on 9 June 1940 the Rouen Transporter Bridge was destroyed , which split the tram network in two until 1946 . With the German occupation , the lines were progressively reopened . But service was reduced . Difficulties became such during this period that the directors of the CTR had to improvise mobile workshops . The heavy bombing raids of Spring 1944 , in particular the destruction of the central part of the Rue Lemire , stopped the trams running . 
 Nazi occupation ended on 30 August 1944 and Liberation slowly healed the town 's wounds . It had been a catastrophe for the network : of the 76 trams in circulation in 1939 , 24 had been destroyed and 25 damaged ; track and overhead lines had been mutilated ; the Trianon depot had been bombed several times Still , service was slowly restored , thanks to the staff 's hard work and above all passengers ' help in shunting trailing cars . In 1945 , 38 locomotives and 14 trailing cars were operational , but , despite restoration of service across the Seine on 20 April 1946 , the war had struck a fatal blow . Rouen was full of out @-@ of @-@ date equipment and so trams were progressively replaced by buses and trolleybuses . 
 In March 1950 the municipality decided definitely to close the tramway , but its actual closure came somewhat later . It was not until Saturday , 28 February 1953 that the last tram ran on the Champ de Courses line , 76 years after the network 's first service . But the <unk> did not forget the tram 's services rendered , organising a first @-@ class funeral : Just before the last scheduled run , a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from the Hôtel de ville to the Trianon depot , cheered by the crowds . 
 = = Bonsecours funicular railway and tramway = = 
 Bonsecours is a commune on a plateau to the southwest of Rouen . Until 1890 only an infrequent bus service linked it to Rouen . However , it attracted many hikers , with its splendid panoramas over the meandering Seine , and pilgrims visiting the shrine to the Virgin Mary . 
 = = = Early projects = = = 
 A first railway project for the mountain , later known by the name tramways de <unk> , was presented in 1876 by Cordier ; it was one of the far @-@ flung ideas that the railway companies often had in the 19th century . Because classical rail has poor adherence , Cordier designed a raceway made of two granite rails embedded in concrete with a continuous guide rail between them . The 2 @,@ 200 m ( 110 @-@ chain ) line , with a terminus at the Quai de la Bourse , would be served by steam carriages with a capacity of only 30 places , but capable of running on public streets as well as its special track . Because of its technical complexity the line would have been hugely expensive , the 1 : 1 gradient to Bonsecours requiring no fewer than 30 viaducts spanning overall 250 m ( 270 yd ) . The project was soon abandoned . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 In 1892 Bonsecours was finally connected to the " world below " when two Swiss engineers , Ludwig and <unk> , built a funicular railway with water @-@ filled counterweights . On 8 June 1892 it was formally declared open to the public and first ran eleven days later on 19 June . This mountain railway , 400 m ( 20 chains ) long and rising 132 m ( 433 ft ) , ran from the banks of the River Seine to the esplanade of the basilica . Each car could hold 90 people ( 50 seated ) , and its water tank could be filled in five minutes . There were twelve journeys each way daily , more on busier days . But the ferry service from its terminus at <unk> to Rouen was irregular , and by the end of the century it had a dangerous rival : the tramway . 
 At first , in 1899 , the tramway was designed to be steam powered , but by 1895 this had changed to electromotive power . The line was built by the Compagnie du Tramway de Bonsecours ( CTB ) , and first ran on 21 May 1899 . It was 5 @,@ 600 m ( 280 chains ) between the two termini ( the Pont Corneille and the crossroads of the RN 14 and the <unk> roads ) , with timetabling of up to 7 trams . The trams had greater power than their Rouen counterparts , with 38 hp ( 28 kW ) motors . They could climb steep gradients ( up to 9 : 100 ) and could accommodate 48 passengers , with 42 more in a trailing car . 
 = = = New ownership and closure = = = 
 Seventy @-@ two daily journeys each way brought the tramway success , and it transported nearly 700 @,@ 000 passengers in 1901 , compared to 140 @,@ 000 for the funicular , which was clearly in a dire state financially ( 210 @,@ 000 passengers in 1898 ) . The figures were so catastrophic that on 25 November 1905 the CTB sacked the management of the mountain railway , and liquidated the defunct Chemin <unk> d ’ <unk> local de Rouen @-@ <unk> au plateau de Bonsecours . Operations continued , and the CTR took over both tracks on 25 December 1909 . Although the tramway was always well used ( 900 @,@ 000 tickets sold in 1913 ) , the clientele of the funicular continued to fall ( 30 @,@ 000 tickets collected the same year ) , and some daily receipts were less than 1 franc . Lacking passengers , the funicular closed on 25 May 1915 , and the tramway became the monopoly service for Bonsecours . This date should not be confused with that for the Rouen service , which continued until February 1953 . 
 = = Trianon tramway = = 
 = = = Left bank = = = 
 At the start of the 20th century the suburbs of the left bank were the quickest growing areas of Rouen , in particular the communes of Sotteville ( a large railway town ) and Grand @-@ Quevilly , but these towns did not have good enough public transport . Although the CTR had constructed some lines , they did not well serve residents wishing for rapid transit between the suburbs and the city centre . Line 4 of the CTR , with its central terminus at Place <unk> , ran only as far as the Trianon roundabout at the edge of the Jardin des Plantes . A southern extension was planned to the Bruyères roundabout , a meeting @-@ point of several roads to the new districts , and to the racecourse where major horse racing events took place each Thursday . But it was always delayed . 
 In 1903 a Sotteville man , M. Hulin , the owner and proprietor of the Château des Bruyères , grew tired of these delays and asked for the concession for a 600 mm ( 1 ft 11 5 ⁄ 8 in ) narrow gauge horse @-@ drawn tramway , which would connect the Trianon roundabout to the racecourse via the Elbeuf road , being 2 @,@ 000 m ( 99 chains ) long . Two years passed in discussing the project 's profitability ( profit for both Hulin and M. Dagan , the engineer from the Corps of Bridges and Roads ) and for tendering the construction of the line to a contractor other than the CTR . This time for reflection led to abandoning horse @-@ drawn trams in favour of mechanical traction , and moving the terminus from the racecourse entrance to the vast cemetery that the authorities intended to build , close to a shooting range . The CTR did not oppose the line , which would not compete with their own , so it was made a Public Local Railway on 10 March 1905 . 
 = = = Small train in town = = = 
 The line was put into service on 1 April 1906 , well before the official opening date of 28 April . This short 2 @,@ 200 m ( 110 @-@ chain ) route , opened solely for passenger traffic , traced a rectangle between the Trianon roundabout and the racecourse , the 600 mm ( 1 ft 11 5 ⁄ 8 in ) narrow gauge rails being established beside the Rue d ’ Elbeuf between the trees lining the road and the fences separating adjacent land ( much of which was owned by Hulin ) . Service was provided by two 24 hp ( 18 kW ) diesel @-@ electric locomotives , built by the <unk> workshops , each with room for 16 people , and the fuel depot was sited near to the racecourse . The service was particularly frequent : thirty journeys each way per day . The entire line took 10 minutes to traverse at a maximum speed of 25 km / h ( 16 mph ) . 
 The first months ' service did not meet Hulin 's expectations ; passenger numbers were much lower than expected , the coefficient of use was catastrophic : 0 @.@ 39 . In 1906 a law was passed instituting a weekly day of rest , so it was decided , from 12 January 1907 , to extend the line 800 m ( 40 chains ) to the <unk> roundabout at the edge of the Rouvray Forest , which was popular for Sunday walks . This 3 @,@ 000 m ( 150 @-@ chain ) double @-@ track extension was inaugurated on 27 August 1907 . The same year , diesel @-@ electric locomotives ( whose " terrible noise " frightened the horses , to the chagrin of their owners ) were replaced by electromotive traction . Two Orenstein & Koppel 0 @-@ 4 @-@ 0T steam locomotives headed two open carriages each taking 16 passengers . Their chimneys were fitted with spark arresters to prevent forest fires around Rouvray . 
 = = = Brief life = = = 
 The line was never profitable : the coefficient of use fell to 0 @.@ 32 in 1907 and passenger numbers fell to 34 @,@ 000 from the 60 @,@ 000 previously . Except on Thursdays , horse racing day , and Sundays where the tramway took amorous walkers to the forest paths , the trams went with few passengers , often with none . What is more , the high number of return journeys reduced the possibility of making connections in Rouen : passengers on the small line may have had to wait a long time at the Trianon roundabout for a connection to the city centre . The situation so preoccupied the Compagnie du Tramway de Rouen @-@ Trianon that in January 1908 it replaced Hulin , always the driving force , and asked the Conseil Général to authorise a reduction in service frequency . But it also proposed to use four @-@ car trams instead of two @-@ car trams on busy days . Although the departmental authorities accepted the extra cars , they would only allow the reduction of service with much red tape , as can be seen from this extract from the report of Soulier , the <unk> général of Rouen : 
 It is well understood that , at the moment it is only a minimum , the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves , that if it will satisfy this requirement , its proper interest is guaranteed , and , in giving greater public satisfaction , its infrastructure will be wisely used , instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business . Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays , except Thursdays ( racing ) , we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest , but , concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse , it is imperative that the Chief Engineer ( <unk> ) keeps the minimum to 30 , otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line , because for this small distance , it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures . 
 The service modifications lowered operating expenses , but the coefficient of use went down dramatically : 0 @.@ 33 for the first ten months of 1908 . The decision to axe the line was made on 1 November 1908 . Two strategic errors had been made : wanting a service independent of the CTR 's network , and putting its terminus out of town . The railway was officially disbanded by a decree of 14 September 1911 , the rails were lifted , the public highway restored ; no trace of the tramway remains . 
 = = Modern tramway = = 
 In 1953 one of the largest electric tramways in France disappeared . But in the 1980s Rouen — and other large cities such as Nantes and Grenoble — decided that increasing traffic jams and the desire to diversify public transport needed a new mode of public transport . Discussions started in 1982 under the guidance of <unk> ( Syndicat intercommunal à vocations multiples , " <unk> syndicate of several trades " ) , grouping together the communes of Greater Rouen ( representing nearly 400 @,@ 000 inhabitants ) . 
 In 1986 , <unk> ( Centre d ’ étude technique et de l ’ <unk> , " Technical and construction study centre " ) put forward a report supporting construction of a modern tramway . A pre @-@ project was launched in September 1987 and led to the Declaration of Public Utility on 22 April 1991 . Construction work was undertaken by GEC @-@ Alsthom and on 17 December 1994 the first line of the modern Rouen tramway was inaugurated .

 " Listen to the Rain on the Roof " was written by series creator Marc Cherry and series writer Jeff Greenstein and directed by Larry Shaw . Cherry 's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came as a response to the series ' problematic second season . Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season , as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season 's storylines . " One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that I had to keep going with the previous year 's stuff , " he explained . " I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again . " The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season ; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed : " I 've been at Marc 's door plenty of times [ with script complaints ] going , ' You 've got to be kidding . ' " Cherry stated that the six @-@ month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker , as the second season 's storylines lagged . He added : " And I 'm going to work much harder to criss @-@ cross all the women 's stories so that their lives bump up against each other . " 
 To help refresh the show , several new writers were hired , including Greenstein , Joe Keenan , who also served as an executive producer , and Bob Daily , who was also a producer . Daily commented , " When we came on in season three , the mandate was to bring the show back to its roots . That meant having plotlines spring from relatable experiences , no matter how operatic or convoluted . " For the season 's main mystery , Cherry and the writers wanted to incorporate more of the series ' regular characters rather than bringing in various new ones , like they had done in the second season with Betty Applewhite ( Alfre Woodard ) and her family . They developed the Orson plot line around the " idea that one of our women marries a guy who has dark secrets and possibly a violent streak . " Cherry opined : " I thought there was something exciting about that , but real and relatable . " Greenstein commented that the writers worked backwards from the second season 's cliffhangers to develop the Orson storyline , forsaking the original material that had been developed earlier . The cast responded positively to the new material for the season . 
 The episode is the first to feature Kyle MacLachlan as a series regular . He originally appeared as Orson Hodge in a string of episodes at the end of the second season . The Orson character was originally planned as a romantic interest for Susan , according to executive producer Tom Spezialy , until Cherry decided to pair Orson with Bree . Additionally , when Orson was introduced toward the end of the second season , he was originally to be a con artist . A character portrayed by Julie White appeared in the second season finale and would have been Orson 's accomplice , but the entire storyline was discarded in favor of the mysterious disappearance of Orson 's wife and White 's character was not seen or mentioned again . MacLachlan commented that his character is " desperate to make this relationship with Bree work . Anything that tries to knock that apart becomes a threat . " Cherry called Orson Bree 's perfect match , but added that their similarities " will ultimately prove to be the downfall of the relationship . " 
 Kiersten Warren also returned to the series as Nora Huntington after being introduced at the end of the second season . On her storyline , Warren commented , " There 's a lot of families who are going through this . Not quite the surprise ooh , boo , child , but children from other marriages and trying to meld these families . I think a lot of people have to deal with it . I think it 's fantastic that they ’ re doing this on the show . " Dougray Scott made his debut in this episode as Ian Hainsworth , Susan 's romantic interest . Cherry opined that the character " can legitimately rival Mike for [ Susan 's ] affections . " Daily commented on the storyline , saying : " Talk about dark comedy — we 're trying to find the humor in these two people bonding over the fact that they each have a partner in a coma . " Scott called his character " bumbling at times , " adding , " He kind of blossoms after he rediscovers his romantic juices with Susan . "

 David Kronke of the Los Angeles Daily News wrote that the show " returns to its wicked wit , dialing back but certainly not eradicating the melodrama . " He complimented the four main actresses for their comedic relief and concluded : " Rarely does a show <unk> the shark this well ; it 's back in fine form , calibrating its humor and its menace just right . " New York Daily News writer David Bianculli compared the premiere to the show 's second season , noting that the episode showed " an assurance and a knowing playfulness that was missing most of last year . " He complimented Cherry and Greenstein 's script and approved the storylines for each character . Bianculli opined that the episode returned the quality of the show 's first season and concluded : " Pass the word : If you 've given up on ' Desperate Housewives , ' it 's time to return to the neighborhood . " Entertainment Weekly 's Lindsay Soll identified Eva Longoria as the episode 's strongest performer , declaring that she " definitely looks like the one to watch this season . " Soll was glad to see that the Susan character was " a little more toned down and less accident @-@ prone than usual , " and called the scenes with Susan and Mike touching . Additionally , she opined that Laurie Metcalf " did a brilliant job of playing the classic TV nosy neighbor , " but expressed her confusion over the Orson storyline . 
 Dave Anderson of TV Guide called the episode first @-@ rate , while praising the comedic Bree storyline and declaring the set @-@ up for the Orson mystery storyline ingenious . He commended Marcia Cross ' performance but opined that Longoria provided the best comedic relief . He also complimented Teri Hatcher 's acting , commenting that she " was awesome in the poignant scene where she asks the comatose Mike permission to go on the ( almost ) date with Ian . " Anderson identified the Scavo storyline as " the weakest link " in the episode and hoped that the Nora and Kayla characters would not remain on the show for too long . TV Guide writer Matt Roush shared similar sentiments regarding the Scavo storyline , stating that while the premiere overall was good , " Lynette is trapped in a story line so desperately unamusing , one that makes her and everyone around her act so idiotic , that you have to pray that we 'll soon see the last of the obnoxious Nora , mother of Tom 's surprise daughter . " He described the storyline as " painfully unpleasant and unfunny . " However , Roush praised the performances of Metcalf and Valerie Mahaffey , while concluding that Desperate Housewives " shows encouraging signs of getting its act together . " In a separate review , Roush unfavorably compared the Orson character to Bree 's former love interest , George Williams ( Roger Bart ) , while also admitting to being " a bit weary " of the Gabrielle storyline . 
 USA Today 's Robert Bianco acknowledged that the episode managed to avoid repeating many of the second season 's mistakes noting that the four main characters spend more time together and the annual mystery " is hot @-@ wired into the housewives themselves . " Bianco remarked that Cross successfully maintained her position as the series ' most prominent lead and was pleased with Susan 's storyline , calling it " a conflict that gives Teri Hatcher a genuinely funny , rather than forced , sight gag . " He approved of the writers ' decision to distance the characters from their second season storylines , but opined : " The harder mistake to overcome is the damage the show did to its main characters — allowing them to behave in ways that made them seem weak , selfish , stupid and , at times , despicable . " Bianco concluded : " It will take more than one good episode to win us back after all that . But it 's certainly a good place to start . " Jen Creer of TV Squad was mixed in her review . She criticized the lack of originality in the storylines , writing that the episode was similar to Sex and the City . Nevertheless , Creer complimented the main actresses , concluding , " I 'll be tuning in next week – for all of its camp and unoriginality , the show does continue to have that certain something , those little twists of genius that make it worth watching . " Andy Dehnart of MSNBC was slightly more positive in his review , acknowledging that while " most of the housewives are stuck in their second @-@ season ruts , " the show 's overall quality has improved , citing the Orson storyline as a welcomed change from the slow @-@ moving Applewhite mystery arc . Overall , Dehnart approved of the episode and felt that the show " may be on track to finally pleasuring its audience in new , albeit familiar ways . "

 Kakashi Hatake ( <unk> <unk> , Hatake Kakashi ) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto . Kishimoto originally planned to introduce Kakashi in the manga to the series ' title character , Naruto Uzumaki , early on , but pushed back this meeting so that Naruto 's teammates could be better developed . 
 In the story , Kakashi is the and teacher of Team 7 , consisting of the series ' primary characters , Sasuke Uchiha , Sakura Haruno , and Naruto Uzumaki .

 Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi 's character . Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached shōnen manga characters , the duality of Kakashi 's apathetic and serious sides have been praised . Kakashi 's popularity has been noted by reviewers ; T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews commented that the series could simply be renamed " Kakashi " . Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base , placing high in several popularity polls . Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released , including key chains and plush dolls .

 Kakashi Hatake is introduced as the leader in charge of Team 7 , a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki , Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno . He first appears as a weak @-@ looking character as he tends to lose track of time when he is there , and is frequently late to his appointments as a result . However , when testing his students , Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point he fights while reading Make Out ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) series of erotic novels . Kakashi is revealed to be very famous in the Naruto world , earning him the moniker " Kakashi of the Sharingan " ( <unk> , Sharingan no Kakashi ) for possessing the Sharingan , gaining it from a member of the Uchiha clan he was friends with . It grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others . Although most of Kakashi 's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan , he also invented the Chidori and its Lightning Blade variation , a collection of lightning chakra in one 's hand that uses the Sharingan 's visual ability to lock onto a target . When first forming Team 7 , Kakashi does not turn them into his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them . Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter 's defection from Konoha . Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various kinds of challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival . 
 Kakashi 's background is explored in Kakashi Gaiden , a six chapter series that divides the gap between Part I and II of the manga . Following his father 's suicide , <unk> Hatake aka the White Fang , Kakashi adopted the philosophy that the success of a mission must always come first rather than comrades in contrast to his father . Kakashi is assigned by his teacher , Minato Namikaze , to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha 's favor . When his teammate , Rin Nohara , is captured by enemy ninja , his other teammate , Obito Uchiha , convinces him to rescue her despite the mission 's ending . After finding Rin , an enemy @-@ induced cave @-@ in crushed Obito 's right half . With his dying wish and the possibility of enemy reinforcements , Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi 's damaged eye socket as a parting gift . His new eye in place , Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapsed , eventually completing their mission . Shortly after this event , Kakashi has to rescue Rin again who is kidnapped by Kirigakure ; however , he learns that the Kiri , under the influence of Madara Uchiha , has made Rin as the host of the Three Tails , <unk> . Rin requests Kakashi to kill her so she may not be used by the Hidden Mist ninja as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha , but Kakashi is reluctant . She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi 's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja , killing her . An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato 's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well . Once relieved of duty in the ANBU , Kakashi becomes a <unk> instructor prior to the events of Part I. 
 Two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years later in Part II , Kakashi reforms Team 7 . During the gap in time , Kakashi <unk> the Mangekyo Sharingan that he gained from result of Rin 's death to master the Kamui ability that allows him to send any targeted object to another dimension . Because his students are now capable of taking care of themselves , Kakashi takes a more active role in the battles that go on during the series , particularly those with the criminal organization Akatsuki . When the Akatsuki leader , Pain , invades Konoha , Kakashi engages him in battle but he dies as a result of forcing all his energy . However , after his confrontation with Naruto , Pain decides to use all of his remaining power to revive all those killed in the battle at Konoha , including Kakashi . Following a brief encounter with Tobi , the Akatsuki 's true leader , Kakashi becomes one of the generals to participate in the war against Tobi 's army . As Naruto and Killer Bee continue to battle against Tobi and his forces , Kakashi and Guy arrive to join the fight against Tobi . During the encounter , Kakashi learns that Tobi is Obito , who in fact had survived his apparent death and had committed horrible deeds since Rin 's death to destroy the world order that allowed their friend 's demise to occur with Kakashi being left greatly stunned and also horrified at Obito 's actions . Despite the guilt for what Obito has become , Kakashi is encouraged by Naruto to continue fighting and the battle ends with Kakashi managing to impale Obito . When Naruto is nearly killed by Madara , Kakashi and a redeemed Obito joined forces to protect Naruto by spiriting him off into the latter 's dimension to be healed . After losing his Sharingan , Naruto using his new @-@ found abilities to restore his original eye , Kakashi finds himself temporarily infused by the chakra @-@ based spirit of Obito as he gains his friend 's full Sharingan abilities and a Susanoo to help his team defeat Kaguya . Following the conclusion of the war , Kakashi is named by Tsunade as her successor , the Sixth Hokage , with his first act being to pardon Sasuke for his crimes . He holds this title for many years before finally passing it to Naruto , as revealed in the epilogue .

 Kakashi has made appearances outside of the Naruto anime and manga . He is in ten of the feature films in the series : in the first movie he battles <unk> <unk> and later defeats him , in the third Kakashi battles the hired ninja <unk> , whom he fights to a standstill , and he later acts as a distraction for his team by battling the minister <unk> 's soldiers , in the fourth Kakashi fights against a large group of stone soldiers , in the fifth , Kakashi is sent alongside Shikamaru Nara , Sai , and Shino <unk> to investigate the base of the Sky Country , in the sixth , when the threat of war loom over Konoha from the other ninja villages , Kakashi is sent on a suicide mission to defeat a rogue ninja named Hiruko who wants his Sharingan , however , Naruto and Sakura ultimately prevent their teacher from throwing his life <unk> in the seventh movie , in which a younger Kakashi is a member of a team composed of himself , Minato , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to stop <unk> with the help of a time displaced Naruto . In the eighth , he serves as part of the plan to lock Naruto in prison before subsequently helping to break him out , and in the ninth , an alternate version of him with an identical appearance to Guy is shown , to Sakura 's dismay . <unk> , in the tenth , he appears as the Sixth Hokage , helping the village while Naruto is away , and in the eleventh he makes a cameo appearance waking up a drowsy Naruto ( who is now the Seventh Hokage ) shadow clone by tapping him on the head with a book . 
 Kakashi is also present in all four of the original video animations produced for the series , helping Naruto and Konohamaru Sarutobi to find a four leaf clover in the first original video animation , joining his team in escorting a ninja named Shibuki to his village in the second , participating in a tournament in the third , and working with Team 7 in the fourth one . A light novel titled Kakashi Hiden : Lightning in the Icy Sky , written by Akira Higashiyama and illustrated by Kishimoto , focuses on the early days of Kakashi 's appointment as the Sixth Hokage , in which he has to stop a terror plan conducted by a pair of Kirigakure ninja , who plan to take control of a newly unveiled airborne ship to stage a jailbreak of a notorious criminal , in the process learning about the pair 's tragic reason for doing so . 
 Kakashi is a playable character in all Naruto video games , including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series . In some games , he is able to use his Sharingan in combat , often as a different character with the ability activated , and in other games , he is available in his ANBU attire . An upcoming light novel titled Kakashi Hiden will focus on the character . 
 = = Creation and conception = = 
 Masashi Kishimoto originally intended for Kakashi to debut in the second chapter of the Naruto manga , appearing prior to the other members of Team 7 . This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite " de gozaru " in the Japanese versions of the series . After speaking with his editor , Kishimoto pushed this debut back , allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7 . Despite this , Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits , being easygoing , unfazed by the actions of others , and eyes appearing to be half @-@ asleep . Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified . Because he acts as a link between the other main characters of the series , Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork , instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene . In an interview in Shōnen Jump 's , Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character , such character would be Kakashi . In early 2014 , Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi 's face but was not sure whether it would be in the manga or an upcoming movie . 
 When deciding upon Kakashi 's name , Kishimoto considered a number of possibilities : Kuwa ( <unk> , " hoe " ) , Kama ( <unk> , " scythe " ) , <unk> ( <unk> , " peony " ) , <unk> ( <unk> , a nettle tree ) , and Kakashi ( <unk> , " scarecrow " ) . He eventually decided upon Kakashi , and remains glad that he did to this day . In keeping with the meaning of his name , scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi ; Naruto , for example , uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two . Likewise , scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears , as is the case with the cover of the Naruto manga volume three . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Kakashi has ranked within the top five characters in every official Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity poll , acquiring the first position as the most popular character several times . In the most recent poll , he ranked third , with Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha acquiring the top two positions . There has not been another official poll since the poll as of 2006 . In the Anime Awards 2006 from About.com , Kakashi won in the category " Best Supporting Male Character " . He was also a nominee during the first " Nickelodeon Magazine Comics Awards " in the category " Best Hair in Comics " , losing to Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes . In an Oricon poll of " manga master " , Kakashi was third with 8 @.@ 4 % of the votes . In an interview , Dave Wittenberg , who does the voice acting for Kakashi in the English dub , comments that he feels he is similar to the character since he tends to have one eye open at a time and he becomes angry if he is interrupted while reading . He also added that what he likes most about Kakashi is his relation with his students , noting him to be " a very nice person " . Merchandise based on Kakashi 's character has also been released , including plush dolls , key chains , and a limited edition figurine . 
 Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi 's character . IGN noted the duality of Kakashi 's serious persona in combat and his laid back , apathetic countenance when dealing with his students , but accepted that he is one of the most popular characters in the series . They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions . Active Anime celebrated Kakashi 's abilities , noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets . T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical " Man of Mystery " seen in other shōnen manga , but praised him as being " much more interesting " than the three main characters , and felt that for all intents and purposes , the show could be renamed simply " Kakashi " . Mania Entertainment 's Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 due to the fact he is a " hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn 't seem all that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft . " Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain , and that after its ending , the character gets " a very humanizing moment " , making the episode from the battle stand out . Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi 's first battle against his students as one of the first series ' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between such characters was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight . IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time , saying that " He 's a complex character , with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool . "

 Licence to Kill , released in 1989 , is the sixteenth entry in the James Bond film series by Eon Productions , and the first one not to use the title of an Ian Fleming story . It is the fifth and final consecutive Bond film to be directed by John Glen . It also marks Timothy Dalton 's second and final performance in the role of James Bond . The story has elements of two Ian Fleming short stories and a novel , interwoven with aspects from Japanese <unk> tales . The film sees Bond being suspended from MI6 as he pursues drugs lord Franz Sanchez , who has ordered an attack against his CIA friend Felix Leiter and a rape and murder on Felix 's wife during their honeymoon . Originally titled Licence Revoked in line with the plot , the name was changed during post @-@ production because too many people did not know what revoked meant . 
 Budgetary reasons caused Licence to Kill to be the first Bond film shot completely outside the United Kingdom , with locations in both Florida and Mexico . The film earned over $ 156 million worldwide , and enjoyed a generally positive critical reception , with ample praise for the stunts , but attracted some criticism of Dalton 's dark and violent interpretation of Bond and the fact that the film was significantly darker and more violent than its predecessors . 
 After the release of Licence to Kill , legal wrangling over control of the series and the James Bond character resulted in a six @-@ year @-@ long delay in production of the next Bond film which resulted in Dalton deciding not to return . It is also the final Bond film for actors Robert Brown ( as M ) and Caroline Bliss ( as Moneypenny ) , screenwriter Richard Maibaum , title designer Maurice Binder , editor John Grover , cinematographer Alec Mills , director and former Bond film editor John Glen , and producer Albert R. Broccoli , although he would later act as a consulting producer for GoldenEye before his death .

 DEA agents collect MI6 agent James Bond and Felix Leiter , on their way to Leiter 's wedding in Key West , to have them assist in capturing drugs lord Franz Sanchez . Bond and Leiter capture Sanchez by attaching a hook and cord to Sanchez 's plane and pulling it out of the air with a Coast Guard helicopter . Afterwards , Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church in time for the ceremony . 
 Sanchez bribes DEA agent Ed Killifer and escapes . Meanwhile , Sanchez 's henchman Dario and his crew ambush Leiter and his wife Della and take Leiter to an aquarium owned by one of Sanchez 's accomplices , Milton Krest .

He finds his way into Sanchez 's employment by posing as an assassin for hire . Two Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau officers foil Bond 's attempt to assassinate Sanchez and take him to an abandoned warehouse . They are joined by Fallon , an MI6 agent who was sent by M to apprehend Bond . Sanchez 's men rescue him and kill the officers , believing them to be the assassins . Later , with the aid of Bouvier , Q , and Sanchez 's girlfriend Lupe Lamora , Bond frames Krest by planting the $ 5 million in the Wavekrest . Sanchez kills Krest and admits Bond into his inner circle . 
 Sanchez takes Bond to his base , which is disguised as headquarters of a religious cult .

 = = Production = = 
 Shortly after The Living Daylights was released , producer Albert R. Broccoli and writers Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum started discussing its successor . The film would retain a realistic style , as well as showing the " darker edge " of the Bond character . For the primary location , the producers wanted a place where the series had not yet visited . While China was visited after an invitation by its government , the idea fell through partly because the 1987 film The Last Emperor had removed some of the novelty from filming in China . By this stage the writers had already talked about a chase sequence along the Great Wall , as well as a fight scene amongst the Terracotta Army . Wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drug lord in the Golden Triangle before the plans fell through . The writers eventually decided on a setting in a tropical country while Broccoli negotiated to film in Mexico , at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City . In 1985 , the Films Act was passed , removing the Eady Levy , resulting in foreign artists being taxed more heavily . The associated rising costs to Eon Productions meant no part of Licence to Kill was filmed in the UK , the first Bond film not to do so . Pinewood Studios , used in every previous Bond film , housed only the post @-@ production and sound re @-@ recording . 
 = = = Writing and themes = = = 
 The initial outline of what would become Licence to Kill was drawn up by Wilson and Maibaum . Before the pair could develop the script , the Writers Guild of America ( WGA ) went on strike and Maibaum was unable to continue writing , leaving Wilson to work on the script on his own . Although both the main plot and title of Licence to Kill owe nothing to any of the Fleming novels , there are elements from the books that are used in the storyline , including a number of aspects of the short story " The Hildebrand Rarity " , such as the character Milton Krest . The novel Live and Let Die provided the material surrounding Felix Leiter 's mauling by a shark , whilst the film version of the book provided the close similarity between the main villain , Kananga , and Licence to Kill 's main villain Sanchez . The screenplay was not ready by the time casting had begun , with Carey Lowell being auditioned with lines from A View to a Kill . 
 The script — initially called Licence Revoked — was written with Dalton 's characterisation of Bond in mind , and the obsession with which Bond pursues Sanchez on behalf of Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because " of his own brutally cut @-@ short marriage . " Dalton 's darker portrayal of Bond led to the violence being increased and more graphic . Wilson compared the script to Akira Kurosawa 's Yojimbo , where a samurai " without any attacking of the villain or its cohorts , only sowing the seeds of distrust , he manages to have the villain bring himself down " . Wilson freely admitted that the idea of the destruction @-@ from @-@ within aspect of the plot came more from the cinema versions of the Japanese <unk> tales by Kurosawa or Sergio Leone than from Fleming 's use of that plot device from The Man with the Golden Gun . For the location Wilson created the Republic of Isthmus , a banana republic based on Panama , with the pock @-@ marked Sanchez bearing similarities to General Manuel Noriega . The parallels between the two figures were based on Noriega 's political use of drug trafficking and money laundering to provide revenues for Panama . Robert Davi suggested the line " loyalty is more important than money " , which he felt was fitting to the character of Franz Sanchez , whose actions were noticed by Davi to be concerned with betrayal and retaliation . 
 The United Artists press kits referred to the film 's background as being " Torn straight from the headlines of today 's newspapers " and the backdrop of Panama was connected to " the Medellín Cartel in Colombia and corruption of government officials in Mexico thrown in for good measure . " This use of the cocaine @-@ smuggling backdrop put Licence to Kill alongside other cinema blockbusters , such as the 1987 films Lethal Weapon , Beverly Hills Cop II and RoboCop , and Bond was seen to be " poaching on their turf " with the drug @-@ related revenge story . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 After Carey Lowell was chosen to play Pam Bouvier , she watched many of the films in the series for inspiration . Lowell had described becoming a Bond girl as " huge shoes to fill " , as she did not see herself as a " glamour girl " , even coming to audition in jeans and a leather jacket . While Lowell wore a wig for the scenes set in the United States , a scene where Bouvier is given money and told by Bond to go and buy some new clothes ( and , going off and doing so , also has her hair cut ) was added so that Lowell 's own short hair style could be used . 
 Robert Davi was cast following a suggestion by Broccoli 's daughter Tina , and screenwriter Richard Maibaum , who had seen Davi in the television film Terrorist on Trial : The United States vs. Salim Ajami . To portray Sanchez , Davi researched on the Colombian drug cartels and how to do a Colombian accent , and since he was method acting , he would stay in character off @-@ set . After Davi read Casino Royale for preparation , he decided to turn Sanchez into a " mirror image " of James Bond , based on Ian Fleming 's descriptions of Le Chiffre . The actor also learned scuba diving for the scene where Sanchez is rescued from the sunken armoured car . 
 Davi later helped out on the casting of Sanchez 's mistress Lupe Lamora , by playing Bond in the audition , with Talisa Soto being picked from twelve candidates because Davi expressed he " would kill for her " . David Hedison returned to play Felix Leiter , sixteen years after being the agent in Live and Let Die . Hedison did not expect to return to the role , saying " I was sure that [ Live and Let Die ] would be my first – and last " and Glen was reluctant to cast the 61 @-@ year @-@ old actor , since the role even had a scene parachuting . Hedison was the only actor to play Leiter twice , until Jeffrey Wright appeared in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace . 
 Up @-@ and @-@ coming actor Benicio del Toro was chosen to play Sanchez 's henchman , Dario for being " laid back while menacing in a quirky sort of way " , according to Glen . Wayne Newton got the role of Professor Joe Butcher after sending a letter to the producers expressing interest in a cameo because he always wanted to be in a Bond film . The President of Isthmus was played by Pedro Armendáriz , Jr . , the son of Pedro Armendáriz , who played Ali Kerim Bey in From Russia with Love . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography ran from 18 July to 18 November 1988 . Shooting began in Mexico , which mostly doubled for the fictional Republic of Isthmus : locations in Mexico City included the Biblioteca del Banco de Mexico for the exterior of El Presidente Hotel and the Casino Español for the interior of Casino de Isthmus whilst the Teatro de la Ciudad was used for its exterior . Villa Arabesque in Acapulco was used for Sanchez 's lavish villa , and the La <unk> Mountain Pass in Tecate was used as the filming site for the tanker chase during the climax of the film . Sanchez 's <unk> Meditation Institute was shot at the Otomi Ceremonial Center in <unk> . Other underwater sequences were shot at the Isla Mujeres near Cancún . 
 In August 1988 , production moved to the Florida Keys , notably Key West . Seven Mile Bridge towards Pigeon Key was used for the sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez , following his arrest , is driven off the edge . Other locations there included Ernest Hemingway House , Key West International Airport , Mallory Square , St. Mary 's Star of the Sea Church for Leiter 's wedding and Stephano 's House 707 South Street for his house and patio . The US Coast Guard Pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour . As production moved back to Mexico , Broccoli became ill , leading to Michael G. Wilson becoming co @-@ producer , a position he subsequently retained . 
 The scene where Sanchez 's plane is hijacked was filmed on location in Florida , with stuntman Jake Lombard jumping from a helicopter to a plane and Dalton himself being filmed atop the aircraft . The plane towed by the helicopter was a life @-@ sized model created by special effects supervisor John Richardson . After filming wide shots of David Hedison and Dalton parachuting , closer shots were made near the church location . During one of the takes , a malfunction of the harness equipment caused Hedison to fall on the pavement . The injury made him limp for the remainder of filming . The aquatic battle between Bond and the henchmen required two separate units , a surface one led by Arthur Wooster which used Dalton himself , and an underwater one which involved experienced divers . The barefoot waterskiing was done by world champion Dave Reinhart , with some close @-@ ups using Dalton on a special rig . Milton Krest 's death used a prostethic head which was created by John Richardson 's team based on a mould of Anthony Zerbe 's face . The result was so gruesome that it was shortened and toned down to avoid censorship problems . 
 For the climactic tanker chase , the producers used an entire section of a highway near Mexicali , which had been closed for safety reasons . Sixteen eighteen @-@ wheeler tankers were used , some with modifications made by manufacturer <unk> at the request of driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne . Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster , while one model had an extra steering wheel on the back of the cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels . Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side , it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Initially Vic Flick , who had played lead guitar on Monty Norman 's original 007 theme , and Eric Clapton were asked to write and perform the theme song to Licence to Kill and they produced a theme to match Dalton 's gritty performance , but the producers turned it down and instead Gladys Knight 's song and performance was chosen . The song ( one of the longest to ever be used in a Bond film ) was based on the " horn line " from Goldfinger , seen as an homage to the film of the same name , which required royalty payments to the original writers . The song gave Knight her first British top @-@ ten hit since 1977 . The end credits feature the Top 10 R & B hit " If You Asked Me To " , sung by Patti LaBelle . 
 John Barry was not available at the time due to throat surgery , so the soundtrack 's score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen , who was known for scoring many action films at the time , such as Lethal Weapon and Die Hard . Glen said he picked Kamen , feeling he could give " the closest thing to John Barry . "

 Film ratings organisations had objections to the excessive and realistic violence , with both the Motion Picture Association of America and the British Board of Film Classification requesting content adaptations , with the BBFC in particular demanding the cut of 36 seconds of film . The 2006 Ultimate Edition DVD of Licence to Kill marked the first release of the film without cuts . 
 Licence to Kill premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 13 June 1989 , raising £ 200 @,@ 000 ( £ 448 @,@ 735 in 2016 pounds ) for The Prince 's Trust on the night . The film grossed a total of £ 7 @.@ 5 million ( £ 17 million in 2016 pounds ) in the United Kingdom , making it the seventh most successful film of the year , despite the 15 certificate which cut down audience numbers . Worldwide numbers were also positive , with $ 156 million , making it the twelfth biggest box @-@ office draw of the year . The US cinema returns were $ 34 @.@ 6 million , making Licence to Kill the least financially successful James Bond film in the US , when accounting for inflation . A factor suggested for the poor takings were fierce competition at the cinema , with Licence to Kill released alongside Lethal Weapon 2 ; Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ( starring former Bond , Sean Connery ) and Batman . 
 There were also issues with the promotion of the film : promotional material in the form of teaser posters created by Bob Peak , based on the Licence Revoked title and commissioned by Albert Broccoli , had been produced , but MGM decided against using them after American test screenings showed ' Licence Revoked ' to be a common American phrase for the withdrawal of a driving licence . The delayed , corrected advertising by Steven Chorney , in the traditional style , limited the film 's pre @-@ release screenings . MGM also discarded a campaign created by advertising executive Don <unk> – who had worked in the publicity campaign for eight Bond films before – emphasising the rougher content of the movie .

 Derek Malcolm in The Guardian was broadly approving of Licence to Kill , liking the " harder edge of the earlier Bonds " that the film emulated , but wishing that " it was written and directed with a bit more flair . " Malcolm praised the way the film attempted " to tell a story rather than use one for the decorative purposes of endless spectacular tropes . " Writing in The Guardian 's sister paper , The Observer , Philip French noted that " despite the playful sparkle in his eyes , Timothy Dalton 's Bond is ... serious here . " Overall French called Licence to Kill " an entertaining , <unk> film " . Ian Christie in the Daily Express excoriated the film , saying that the plot was " absurd but fundamentally dull " , a further problem being that as " there isn 't a coherent storyline to link [ the stunts ] , they eventually become tiresome . " 
 Hilary Mantel in The Spectator dismissed the film . " It is a very noisy film . There is a weary and repetitive note to the frenzy . The sex is low key and off @-@ screen but there is a smirking perverse undertow which makes the film more disagreeable than a slasher movie . " 
 David Robinson , writing in The Times observed that Licence to Kill " will probably neither disappoint nor surprise the great , faithful audience " , but bemoaned the fact that " over the years the plots have become less ambitious " . Robinson thought that Dalton 's Bond " has more class " than the previous Bonds and was " a warmer personality " . Iain Johnstone of The Sunday Times pointed out that " any vestiges of the gentleman spy ... by Ian Fleming " have now gone , and in its place is a Bond that is " remarkably close both in deed and action to the eponymous hero of the Batman film " that was released at the same time as Licence to Kill . 
 Adam Mars @-@ Jones of The Independent gave the film a mixed review , pointing out that it took out some of the more dated ideas from the Fleming novels , such as imperialism ; he wrote that the writers were " trying in effect to reproduce the recipe while leaving out ingredients that would now seem distasteful " . Overall Mars @-@ Jones thought that " James Bond is more like a low @-@ tar cigarette than anything else – less stimulating than the throat @-@ curdling <unk> of yesteryear , but still naggingly implicated in <unk> , a feeble bad habit without the kick of a vice . " 
 For the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail , Rick Groen wrote that in Licence to Kill " they 've excised Bond from the Bond flicks ; they 've turned James into Jimmy , strong and silent and ( roll over , Britannia ) downright American " , resulting in a Bond film that is " essentially Bond @-@ less " . Summing up , Groen thought " Actually , that dialogue ... ain 't bad . The silence looks good on Timothy Dalton " . 
 Gary Arnold of The Washington Times wrote that a number of factors " fail to prevent the finished product from jamming and misfiring with disillusioning frequency " . Arnold opined that " demanding that he [ Dalton ] play Bond 's <unk> in a transparently seething and hotheaded manner " means that Dalton " seems to waste away on this second outing as Bond . " Overall Arnold sees that there is a " failure to recognize that Bond productions are simply too extravagant to permit an uncompromised return to first principles . " The critic for The New York Times , Caryn James , thought Dalton was " the first James Bond with angst , a moody spy for the fin de <unk> " , and that Licence to Kill " retains its familiar , effective mix of <unk> powerful villains , suspiciously tantalizing women and ever @-@ wilder special effects " , but was impressed that " Dalton 's glowering presence adds a darker tone " . James concluded that " for all its clever <unk> , stylish action and witty escapism , Licence to Kill ... is still a little too much by the book . " 
 Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film 3 ½ stars out of 4 , saying " the stunts all look convincing , and the effect of the closing sequence is exhilarating ... Licence to Kill is one of the best of the recent Bonds . " Jack Kroll , writing in Newsweek described Licence to Kill as " a pure , rousingly entertaining action movie " . Kroll was mixed in his appraisal of Dalton , calling him " a fine actor who hasn 't yet stamped Bond with his own personality " , observing " Director John Glen is the Busby Berkeley of action flicks , and his chorus line is the legendary team of Bond stunt @-@ persons who are at their death @-@ defying best here " . For Time magazine , Richard Corliss bemoaned that although the truck stunts were good , it was " a pity nobody – not writers Michael G. Wilson , and Richard Maibaum nor director John Glen – thought to give the humans anything very clever to do . " Corliss found Dalton " misused " in the film , adding that " for every plausible reason , he looks as bored in his second Bond film as Sean Connery did in his sixth . "

 Opinion on Licence to Kill has not changed with the passing of time and the reviews are still mixed : though film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with a positive 77 % " fresh " rating from 52 reviews . Tom Hibbert of Empire gives the film only two of a possible five stars , observing that " Dalton ... is really quite hopeless " . Hibbert concluded that " he may look the part , but Timothy Dalton fails the boots , the scuba gear , or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery . " In 2006 , IGN ranked Licence to Kill fifteenth out of the then 21 Bond films , claiming it is " too grim and had strayed too far from the Bond formula . " That same year , Benjamin Svetkey and Joshua Rich of Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as second worst in the series , questioning Wayne Newton 's cameo , and considering that " not even Benicio Del Toro in an early role as a henchman is enough to pep up the action . " The magazine also listed Pam Bouvier seventh on their list of worst Bond girls , saying Carey Lowell " fumbled this attempt at giving 007 a modern , independent counterpart by turning her into a nagging pest . " 
 Norman Wilner of MSN considered Licence to Kill the second worst Bond film , above only A View to a Kill , but defended Dalton , saying he " got a raw deal . The actor who could have been the definitive 007 ... had the bad luck to inherit the role just as the series was at its weakest , struggling to cope with its general creative decline and the end of the Cold War " . In October 2008 Time Out re @-@ issued a review of Licence to Kill and also thought that Dalton was unfortunate , saying " one has to feel for Dalton , who was never given a fair shake by either of the films in which he appeared " . On a more positive note , Chuck O 'Leary of Fantastica Daily remarked that it was a rare entry in the Bond series where the danger seems real . 
 Some critics , such as James Berardinelli , saw a fundamental weakness in the film : the " overemphasis on story may be a mistake , because there are times when Licence to Kill 's narrative bogs down . " Berardinelli gave the film three out of a possible four stars , adding " Licence to Kill may be taut and gripping , but it 's not traditional Bond , and that , as much as any other reason , may explain the public 's rejection of this reasonably well @-@ constructed picture . " Raymond Benson , the author of nine Bond novels , said of the film : " It boggles my mind that Licence to Kill is so controversial . There 's really more of a true Ian Fleming story in that script than in most of the post @-@ 60s Bond movies . " John Glen has said Licence to Kill " is among my best Bond films , if not the best " .

 The Licence to Kill screenplay was written into a novel by the then @-@ novelist of the Bond series John Gardner . It was the first of those novels since Moonraker in 1979 . 
 Licence to Kill was also adapted as a forty @-@ four page , colour graphic novel , by writer and artist Mike Grell ( also author of original @-@ story Bond comic books ) , published by Eclipse Comics and ACME Press in hardcover and trade editions in 1989 . The adaptation closely follows the film story , although the ending is briefer , and James Bond is not drawn to resemble Timothy Dalton after Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be licensed . Domark also published a video game adaptation , 007 : Licence to Kill , to various personal computers .

 = Mediterranean cuisine = 
 Mediterranean cuisine is the food from the lands around the Mediterranean Sea and its preparation . This geographical area broadly follows the distribution of the olive tree , which provides one of the most distinctive features of the region 's cooking , olive oil . Although this region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines , the historical connections of the region , as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region 's climate and economy , mean that there are common elements in these cuisines , which include Italian , Levantine , Maghrebi , Ottoman , Provençal ( French ) , and Spanish cuisines . 
 The region 's food came to be seen as a more or less unified cuisine following the cookery writer Elizabeth David 's book , A Book of Mediterranean Food ( 1950 ) . Other writers , such as the Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid , have agreed with David , defining the three core elements of the cuisine as the olive , wheat , and the grape , yielding oil , bread and pasta , and wine , respectively . 
 The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the Mediterranean diet , made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil , wheat and other grains , fruits , vegetables , and a certain amount of seafood , but low in meat and dairy products . Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients , including meat , are dealt with in the kitchen , whether they are <unk> or not . 
 = = Geography = = 
 = = = By city and country = = = 
 The cookery writer Elizabeth David 's introduction to A Book of Mediterranean Food ( 1950 ) defines her scope as " the cooking of the Mediterranean shores " . She sketches out the geographical limits as 
 from Gibraltar to the Bosphorus , down the Rhone Valley , through the great seaports of Marseilles , Barcelona , and Genoa , across to Tunis and Alexandria , embracing all the Mediterranean islands , Corsica , Sicily , Sardinia , Crete , the Cyclades , Cyprus ( where the Byzantine influence begins to be felt ) , to the mainland of Greece and the much disputed territories of Syria , the Lebanon , Constantinople , and Smyrna . 
 = = = By a key culinary plant = = = 
 David defines the region as coextensive with the range of the olive tree : " those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees " . The olive 's natural distribution is limited by frost and by availability of water . It is therefore constrained to a more or less narrow zone around the Mediterranean Sea , except in the Maghreb and in Spain , where it is distributed more widely , and on the islands of the Mediterranean , where it is widespread . It does not grow in most of France , most of the north of Italy ( except Liguria ) , or the inland regions of the Balkans . 
 The Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid similarly defines the region by the olive 's presence , along with bread , wheat , and the grape as the " basic products of Mediterranean folk cuisine " : 
 Mediterranean cuisine is defined by the presence of fundamental elements which are said to play a more important role than others , reflecting a community of beliefs and practices which transcend religions , languages and even societies . The olive tree , the emblematic tree on more than one account , traces the bounds of a frontier of landscapes and lives on either side of which the Mediterranean begins or ends . Above <unk> , nicknamed " Gates of Provence " , is the limit of the olive . 
 = = Key ingredients = = 
 Essid , as already mentioned , identifies the " trinity " of basic ingredients of traditional Mediterranean cuisine as the olive , wheat , and the grape , yielding oil , bread , and wine respectively . The archaeologist Colin Renfrew calls this the " Mediterranean triad " . 
 = = = Olive = = = 
 The olive appears to come from the region of Persia and Mesopotamia , at least 6 @,@ 000 years ago . It spread from there to nearby areas , and has been cultivated since the early Bronze Age ( up to 3 @,@ 150 BC ) in southern Turkey , the Levant , and Crete . The ten countries with the largest harvests ( in 2011 ) are all near the Mediterranean ( Portugal being the tenth largest ) : together , they produce 95 % of the world 's olives . 
 The olive yields bitter fruits , made edible by curing and fermentation , and olive oil . Some 90 % of the fruit production ( 1996 ) goes into olive oil . The Mediterranean region accounts for the world 's highest consumption of olive oil : in 2014 , the highest @-@ consuming country , Greece , used 17 kg per head ; Italy , 12 kg , Spain 3 kg ; the United States for comparison used only 1 kg per head . 
 = = = Wheat = = = 
 Wheat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent , in and near the Levant some 10 @,@ 000 years ago . Its ancestors include wild emmer wheat ; this was hybridised , harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains , in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms . It had been spread across the Mediterranean region as far as Spain by 5 @,@ 000 BC . 
 Wheat is a staple food in the Mediterranean region . Wheat bread was already critically important in the empire of Ancient Rome , which included the entire region ; at that time , around 2 @,@ 000 years ago , North Africa was the " breadbasket " of the empire . Other staple wheat @-@ based Mediterranean foods include pasta and semolina ( wheat middlings ) products such as couscous and <unk> . In turn , these are made into dishes such as the Greek dessert <unk> ( milk <unk> ) , consisting of filo pastry parcels around a custard made with semolina . A widespread wheat dish from Turkey and the Levant to Iran and India is halva , a dessert of sweetened semolina with butter , milk , and pine kernels . 
 = = = Grape = = = 
 The grape was domesticated between 7 @,@ 000 and 4 @,@ 000 BC between the Black Sea and Persia ; archaeological evidence shows that wine was being made there by 6 @,@ 000 BC , reaching Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC . Winemaking started in Italy in the ninth century BC , and in France around 600 BC . 
 Grapes are grown for making wine , for drying as raisins , or for eating as table grapes . Wine grapes are often rich in tannins , while raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour . Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area , with a large part of the world 's harvest . Italy produced 8 million tonnes ( mt ) in 2013 ; Spain 7 @.@ 5 mt ; France 5 @.@ 5 mt ; Turkey 4 @.@ 0 mt ; Egypt 1 @.@ 4 mt ; Greece 0 @.@ 9 mt ; Algeria 0 @.@ 6 mt . Wine production is similarly large , with France 4 @.@ 3 mt ; Italy 4 @.@ 1 mt ; Spain 3 @.@ 2 mt , but with much lower figures from the Muslim countries . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Concept = = = 
 The concept of a Mediterranean cuisine is very recent , probably dating from the publication of David 's A Book of Mediterranean Food ( 1950 ) . David herself did not use the term , speaking instead of Mediterranean " food " , " cookery " , or " cooking " . The usefulness of the concept is disputed . Carol <unk> , author of the book Food Culture in the Mediterranean ( 2009 ) , is among the authors who use " Mediterranean cuisine " interchangeably with " Mediterranean food " . In the preface to her book she writes 
 Mediterranean food is incredibly popular : pasta , pizza , gyros , kebab , and falafel can be found just about everywhere . Food experts and cookbook authors adore Mediterranean cuisine ... 
 Essid acknowledges that " geographical differences and the vicissitudes of history " have affected the food of different Mediterranean lands , but nonetheless asserts that : 
 Rules for the preparation and consumption of food are common to the lands that border the Mediterranean . They offer both stability , continuity and reproduction of a specific pattern of eating which resists conquest , invasion , colonisation , social change , industrialisation and urbanisation . Consequently , wherever you go , in southern Europe or the lands bordering the southern Mediterranean , you will find a cuisine and gastronomic ritual which is always familiar . 
 On the other hand , Sami <unk> argues in his book Culinary Cultures of the Middle East ( 1994 ) that : 
 The idea of the " standard Mediterranean " ... is a modern construction of food writers and publicists in Europe and North America earnestly preaching what is now thought to be a healthy diet to their audiences by invoking a stereotype of the healthy other on the shores of the Mediterranean . Their colleagues in Mediterranean countries are only too willing to perpetuate this myth . The fact of the matter is that the Mediterranean contains varied cultures . 
 The cookery author Clifford A. Wright wrote in 1999 : " There really is no such thing as ' Mediterranean cuisine ' . At the same time , we seem to know what we mean when we use the expression .... " Wright argued that David 's book itself was largely about specifically French Mediterranean food , pointing out that " only 4 percent of her recipes come from North Africa or the Levant " . 
 Since David 's time , a variety of books on Mediterranean cuisine have been written , including <unk> 's 2009 book , already mentioned ; books by other cookery writers include S. Rowe 's Purple Citrus and Sweet Perfume : Cuisine of the Eastern Mediterranean ( 2011 ) ; Mari @-@ Pierre Moine 's Mediterranean Cookbook ( 2014 ) ; and J. R. Stevens ' Mediterranean Cuisine ( 2015 ) . There are many more cookbooks covering specific cuisines in the Mediterranean area , such as B. <unk> 's The Original Mediterranean Cuisine : Medieval Recipes for Today ( 1995 ) , on Catalan and Italian recipes ; H. F. Ullman 's on the cooking of Tunisia ( 2006 ) , Spain and Italy , each one subtitled " Mediterranean Cuisine " . 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine are to an extent different from those of the cuisine of Northern Europe , with olive oil instead of butter , wine instead of beer . The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries . One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal , Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages . Those foods included aubergines , spinach , sugar cane , rice , apricots and citrus fruits , creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al @-@ Andalus . 
 Another major change was the arrival of foods from the Americas in Early Modern times ( around the sixteenth century ) , notably the incorporation of the potato into Northern European cuisine , and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine . The tomato , so central now to that cuisine , was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544 . Similarly , many of the species of <unk> beans now used around the Mediterranean , including P. vulgaris ( the French or haricot bean ) , were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers . 
 = = Cooking = = 
 David 's introduction to her 1950 book characterises the cooking of the Mediterranean countries as " conditioned naturally by variations in climate and soil and the relative industry or indolence of the inhabitants . " 
 David identifies " the ever recurring elements " in the food of this extensive region as olive oil , saffron , garlic , " pungent " local wines , as well as the " aromatic perfume " of herbs , especially rosemary , wild marjoram , and basil , and the bright colours of fresh foods in the markets , " <unk> , aubergines , tomatoes , olives , melons , figs " and " shiny fish , silver , vermilion , or tiger @-@ striped " . She includes cheeses of " sheep 's or goat 's milk " , " figs from Smyrna on long strings " and " sheets of apricot paste which is dissolved in water to make a cooling drink . " 
 With common ingredients including the olive , wheat , and grape ; a shared climate ; and a long period for cultural exchange , it might be expected that a single , pan @-@ Mediterranean cuisine would have developed . Certain items , such as olive oil , bread , wine , roast lamb or mutton ( for example , Maghreb <unk> , Greek <unk> and <unk> , Turkish shish kebab ) , <unk> , and stews of meat with vegetables and tomato ( such as Spanish <unk> , French <unk> à la Provençale , Italian <unk> , Turkish <unk> <unk> ) , are indeed found all around the Mediterranean . Despite this , however , the lands bordering the Mediterranean sea have distinct regional cuisines , from the Maghreb , Levant and Ottoman to the Italian , French , and Spanish . Each of those , in turn , has national and provincial variations . 
 = = = Maghrebi = = = 
 Maghrebi cuisine includes the cuisines of Algeria , Libya , Morocco , and Tunisia . One of the most characteristic dishes of the region is couscous , a steamed , small @-@ grained wheat semolina , served with a stew . The dish is ancient , mentioned by the Medieval traveller Ibn Battuta , and found for example also in Italian cuisine , at Genoa , Livorno and Trapani . 
 One stew that may be served with couscous is the Moroccan <unk> , a hearty , somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables , cooked slowly in a pot ( called a <unk> ) with a tall conical lid . Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout ( containing such spices as cumin , coriander , saffron , cinnamon , cloves , chillies , and paprika ) . Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins . 
 = = = Levantine = = = 
 Levantine cuisine is the cooking of the Levant ( including the Middle Eastern Mediterranean coast , east of Egypt ) . Among the most distinctive foods of this cuisine are traditional small meze dishes such as tabbouleh , hummus , and baba ghanoush . Tabbouleh is a dish of bulgur cracked wheat with tomatoes , parsley , mint and onion , dressed with olive oil and lemon juice . Baba ghanoush , sometimes called " poor man 's caviar " , is a puree of aubergine with olive oil , often mixed with chopped onion , tomato , cumin , garlic , lemon juice , and parsley . The dish is popular across the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa . 
 <unk> <unk> , originally from Egypt and still a national dish there , consists of fava beans with oil and cumin ; it is popular throughout the Levant . The dish may be ancient : dried beans of Neolithic age have been found near Nazareth . 
 = = = Ottoman = = = 
 Ottoman cuisine has given rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey , parts of the Balkans , Cyprus , and Greece . A distinctive element is the family of small flaky pastries called <unk> . These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region , and date as far back as ancient Roman times . <unk> are made of thin sheets of filo pastry , filled with mixtures such as meat , caramelised onion and sweet peppers . 
 Another widespread and popular dish is moussaka , a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients : often minced meat and tomatoes , sometimes a layer of egg custard or béchamel sauce on top . In its Greek variant , well @-@ known outside the region , it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or béchamel sauce on top , but that version is a relatively recent innovation , introduced by the chef Nikolaos <unk> in the 1920s . 
 = = = Greek = = = 
 Much of Greek cuisine is part of the larger tradition of Ottoman cuisine , the names of the dishes revealing Arabic , Persian or Turkish roots : moussaka , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so on . Many dishes ' names probably entered the Greek vocabulary during Ottoman times , or earlier in contact with the Persians and the Arabs . However , some dishes may be pre @-@ Ottoman , only taking Turkish names later ; Ash and Dalby , for example , speculate that grape @-@ leaf <unk> were made by the early Byzantine period . Greek cookery makes wide use of vegetables , olive oil , grains , fish , wine and meat ( white and red , including lamb , poultry , rabbit and pork ) . Other important ingredients include olives , cheese , eggplant ( aubergine ) , zucchini ( courgette ) , lemon juice , vegetables , herbs , bread and yoghurt . Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece : lentil soup , <unk> , <unk> ( white or rosé wine flavored with pine resin ) and <unk> ( candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey ) ; some to the Hellenistic and Roman periods : <unk> ( dried pork sausage ) ; and Byzantium : feta cheese , <unk> ( <unk> , cured fish roe ) and <unk> ( traditional hard bread baked from corn , barley and rye ) . 
 = = = Italian = = = 
 Mediterranean Italian cuisine includes much of Italy outside the north and the mountainous inland regions . It is a diverse cuisine , but among its best @-@ known and most characteristic foods are risotto , pizza in Neapolitan and Sicilian styles , and pasta dishes such as spaghetti . 
 Risotto is a dish made using Italian short @-@ grain rice , which is both highly absorbent and resistant to turning into a pudding when cooked with stock and flavoured with onions and garlic , cooked in butter . Anna <unk> della <unk> 's book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes , 18 of them from the Veneto . Variations among Veneto <unk> include additions of fish and white wine ; chicken ; eel ; mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese ; quails ; small pieces of beef ; courgettes ( zucchini ) ; clams ; <unk> ; beans ; mussels ; prawns ; cuttlefish ; and asparagus . 
 Pizza , or as David notes " <unk> or <unk> " in Provence ( the cuisines of Mediterranean France and Italy having something in common ) , is a piece of bread dough rolled out thin , with a topping which varies from place to place , but is generally much simpler than those in the English @-@ speaking world . In Naples this is tomato , anchovies and buffalo mozzarella . In San Remo it is onions cooked in olive oil , with salted sardines . The Provençal variety uses onions , black olives , and anchovies . 
 Spaghetti dishes also vary . It may be eaten as David says " simply with olive oil and garlic " , without cheese , or with a sauce of " very red and ripe peeled tomatoes " , cooked briefly and flavoured with garlic and either basil or parsley . One Sicilian variant includes pieces of bacon , onions fried in fat , garlic , stoned olives , and anchovies , served with olive oil and grated Parmesan cheese . 
 = = = French = = = 
 Mediterranean French cuisine includes the cooking styles of Provence , Occitania , and the island of Corsica . Distinctive dishes that make use of local ingredients include bouillabaisse and <unk> niçoise . 
 <unk> is a substantial dish from the French port of Marseille , capital of Provence . It is a stew for at least eight people , because it should contain many kinds of fish such as crayfish , gurnard , <unk> , John Dory , monkfish , conger eel , whiting , sea bass , and crab . These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs , namely onions , garlic , tomatoes , thyme , fennel , parsley , bay , and orange peel . 
 <unk> niçoise is a colourful salad of tomatoes , tuna , hard @-@ boiled eggs , <unk> olives , and anchovies , dressed with a vinaigrette . 
 = = = Spanish = = = 
 Spain 's varied cuisine includes the cooking of Andalusia , Catalonia , Valencia , and the Balearic islands . <unk> is a characteristic Spanish dish , originally from Valencia and now popular across a much wider area , made in many versions . It may contain a mixture of chicken , pork , and shellfish , fried in oil in a large shallow pan , with vegetable flavourings , and long @-@ grain rice cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron . Other local ingredients may include artichoke hearts , peas , sweet peppers , sausages and so on . 
 = = Mediterranean diet and cuisine = = 
 The Mediterranean diet , popularised in the 1970s , is sometimes conflated with Mediterranean cuisine . Thus , the American Diabetes Association writes about " Mediterranean @-@ Style Eating " , mentioning " the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle ... of ... eating <unk> together among family and friends " , and asserting that " Mediterranean cuisine is plant @-@ based " , citing the ingredients " whole grains , fruits , vegetables , herbs and spices , beans , nuts , seeds , and olive oil " , and stating that most foods " in a Mediterranean diet come from plants " . 
 The 1984 travel guide Guida all 'Italia <unk> states that " around 1975 , under the impulse of one of those new nutritional directives by which good cooking is too often influenced , the Americans discovered the so @-@ called Mediterranean diet . The name even pleased Italian government officials , who made one modification : changing from diet — a word which has always seemed punitive and therefore unpleasant — to Mediterranean cuisine . " 
 " Mediterranean diet " as popularly understood may have little to do with either Mediterranean cuisine or indeed the traditional Mediterranean diet based on the trinity of wheat , olive , and grape . Thus , Judy Lance 's book Low <unk> Eating : How a Wheat Free Menu , or Mediterranean Diet Can Help with Weight Loss advocates a diet called Mediterranean , but lacking the wheat staple entirely . 
 = = A changing cuisine = = 
 Since David wrote about Mediterranean food in 1950 , and indeed since dietary researchers showed in the 1950s that people around the Mediterranean had less coronary heart disease than the peoples of northern Europe , the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed . Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables : their diet is becoming more northern European , with more convenience foods and with less of a preventative effect on cardiovascular disease . 
 = Thebe ( moon ) = 
 Thebe ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ bee ; Greek : <unk> ) also known as Jupiter XIV , is the fourth of Jupiter 's moons by distance from the planet . It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the Voyager 1 space probe taken on March 5 , 1979 , while making its flyby of Jupiter . In 1983 it was officially named after the mythological nymph Thebe . 
 The second largest of the inner satellites of Jupiter , Thebe orbits within the outer edge of the Thebe gossamer ring that is formed from dust ejected from its surface . It is irregularly shaped and reddish in colour , and is thought like Amalthea to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials . Its surface features include large craters and high mountains — some of them are comparable to the size of the moon itself . 
 Thebe was photographed in 1979 by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft , and later , in more detail , by the Galileo orbiter in the 1990s . 
 = = Discovery and observations = = 
 Thebe was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the Voyager 1 space probe taken on March 5 , 1979 , and was initially given the provisional designation S / 1979 J 2 . In 1983 it was officially named after the mythological nymph Thebe who was a lover of Zeus — the Greek equivalent of Jupiter . 
 After its discovery by Voyager 1 , Thebe was photographed by the Voyager 2 space probe in 1979 . However , before the Galileo spacecraft arrived at Jupiter , knowledge about it was extremely limited . Galileo imaged almost all of the surface of Thebe and helped clarify its composition . 
 = = Orbit = = 
 Thebe is the outermost of the inner Jovian moons , and orbits Jupiter at a distance of about 222 @,@ 000 km ( 3 @.@ 11 Jupiter radii ) . Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 @.@ 018 , and an inclination of 1 @.@ 08 ° relative to the equator of Jupiter . These values are unusually high for an inner satellite and can be explained by the past influence of the innermost Galilean satellite , Io ; in the past , several mean @-@ motion resonances with Io would have passed through Thebe 's orbit as Io gradually receded from Jupiter , and these excited Thebe 's orbit . 
 The orbit of Thebe lies near the outer edge of the Thebe gossamer ring , which is composed of the dust ejected from the satellite . After ejection the dust drifts in the direction of the planet under the action of Poynting – Robertson drag forming a ring inward of the moon . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Thebe is irregularly shaped , with the closest ellipsoidal approximation being 116 × 98 × 84 km . Its surface area is probably between 31 @,@ 000 and 59 @,@ 000 ( ~ 45 @,@ 000 ) km2 . Its bulk density and mass are not known , but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea ( around 0 @.@ 86 g / cm3 ) , its mass can be estimated at roughly 4 @.@ 3 × 1017 kg . 
 Similarly to all inner satellites of Jupiter , Thebe rotates synchronously with its orbital motion , thus keeping one face always looking toward the planet . Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter . At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter , the surface is thought to be near the edge of the Roche lobe , where Thebe 's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force . As a result , the escape velocity in these two points is very small , thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts , and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring . 
 Zethus Crater is the largest ( diameter about 40 km ) crater on and the only named surface feature of Jupiter 's moon Thebe . There are several bright spots at the rim of this crater . It is located on the far side of Thebe , facing away from Jupiter . It was discovered by the Galileo spacecraft . It is named for Zethus , the husband of the nymph Thebe in Greek mythology . 
 The surface of Thebe is dark and appears to be reddish in color . There is a substantial asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres : the leading hemisphere is 1 @.@ 3 times brighter than the trailing one . The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere , which excavate a bright material ( probably ice ) from the interior of the moon . The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that there are at least three or four impact craters that are very large , each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself .

 = New York State Route 36 = 
 New York State Route 36 ( NY 36 ) is a north – south state highway in the western part of New York in the United States . The highway extends for 95 miles ( 153 km ) from the Pennsylvania state line at Troupsburg , Steuben County northward to Ogden , Monroe County , where it ends at an intersection with NY 31 . Along the way , NY 36 passes through the villages of Dansville , Mount Morris , Caledonia , and Churchville and the city of Hornell . The section of the route between Dansville and Mount Morris closely parallels Interstate 390 ( I @-@ 390 ) ; however , from Dansville south and Mount Morris north , NY 36 serves as a regionally important highway , connecting to I @-@ 86 , U.S. Route 20A ( US 20A ) , US 20 , and I @-@ 490 as it heads north . At its south end , NY 36 connects to Pennsylvania Route 249 ( PA 249 ) . 
 The origins of NY 36 date back to 1908 when most of modern NY 36 between Jasper and Mumford was assigned a legislative route designation by the New York State Legislature . NY 36 was assigned in the mid @-@ 1920s to an alignment extending from Hornell north to Avon , utilizing its modern alignment south of Mount Morris and what is now NY 63 and NY 39 from Mount Morris to Avon . It was truncated in 1927 to end in Geneseo , but was subsequently realigned and extended as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue north from Mount Morris to Ogden . NY 36 was extended again , this time southwestward to Andover , in the early 1940s , but was realigned just a decade later to continue southeast from Hornell to the Pennsylvania state line . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Steuben County = = = 
 NY 36 begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Troupsburg , where it continues south into Pennsylvania as PA 249 . Heading north from the state line in Steuben County , the route follows <unk> Creek northward through rural Troupsburg on its way to the equally isolated town of Jasper , where it meets NY 417 at a junction 1 @.@ 25 miles ( 2 @.@ 01 km ) west of the small hamlet of Jasper . NY 36 joins NY 417 here , following the east – west route to the western fringe of the community . At a T @-@ intersection just outside the hamlet , the two routes split , with NY 417 turning to the right ( eastward ) toward Corning and NY 36 making a left @-@ hand turn to continue northward toward the town of Canisteo . Across the town line , NY 36 turns toward the northwest and serves the hamlet of South Canisteo , which marks the southern end of both Colonel Hills Creek and a valley formed by the waterway . 
 The route continues generally northerly through the creek valley to the outskirts of the village of Canisteo , where the creek valley gives way to a larger one surrounding the nearby Canisteo River . At this point , NY 36 curves sharply to the northwest , passing over Colonel Hills and Bennetts Creeks prior to entering the village as Main Street . In the center of Canisteo , it intersects the northern terminus of NY 248 . Past NY 248 , the route leaves the village and continues northwest along the lightly populated banks of the Canisteo River to the city of Hornell , which NY 36 traverses by way of a divided highway built c . 1979 to bypass Hornell along its western edge . NY 36 heads north through the residential southern half of the city to Hornell 's commercial central district , the site of a junction with Main Street and NY 21 . 
 For the next 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) , NY 21 overlaps with NY 36 , following it through Hornell 's residential northern half , across the Canisteo River , and past pockets of development in the surrounding town of Hornellsville to a junction roughly 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) south of NY 36 's interchange with Interstate 86 ( I @-@ 86 ) and NY 17 . NY 21 breaks from NY 36 and proceeds to the northeast along an unnamed road ; NY 36 , however , continues along the bypass to I @-@ 86 and NY 17 , where the two roads meet at I @-@ 86 and NY 17 exit 34 via a full cloverleaf interchange . Past the interchange , the divided highway narrows into a two @-@ lane , undivided highway that continues through lightly populated areas of the town to the village of Arkport . 
 In Arkport , NY 36 intersects the eastern terminus of NY <unk> , a reference route erroneously signed as a touring route , at West Avenue . Formerly , this intersection hosted the southern terminus of NY 70 , which originally followed what is now NY <unk> northwest to Canaseraga . North of Arkport , the Canisteo River makes a turn to the west while NY 36 continues to the northeast , running along the eastern edge of both a marshy area and an extension of the Canisteo River valley . In the town of Dansville , NY 36 intersects the current eastern terminus of NY 70 at an intersection located 5 miles ( 8 km ) north of Arkport and due east of Canaseraga . From here northward , the highway takes on a more northeasterly routing as it crosses the northwest corner of the county , where it runs along the west side of Stony Brook State Park and briefly enters the park before emerging from the area just south of the Livingston County line . 
 = = = Livingston County = = = 
 Across the county line , NY 36 enters the town of North Dansville and the village of Dansville located within . At the southern village line , NY 36 meets the southbound entrance and exit ramps for I @-@ 390 at exit 4 and gains the name Clara Barton Street . Due to the angle at which I @-@ 390 crosses NY 36 here , the northbound entrance and exit ramps are located another 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) to the north . The route follows Clara Barton Street north into the village center , where it gradually curves northeastward ahead of a junction with Main Street ( NY 63 ) in Dansville 's business district . NY 36 turns northwest here , following NY 63 along Main Street for two blocks before returning west on Ossian Street . The highway turns again just six blocks later to follow Dock and Franklin streets northwest toward Dansville Municipal Airport . Ossian Street , meanwhile , continues west as NY 436 , which passes under I @-@ 390 a short distance to the west . 
 Between NY 436 and I @-@ 390 exit 6 near Groveland , NY 36 closely parallels I @-@ 390 , remaining within 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) or less of it for the entire distance . Just outside Dansville in the shadow of Dansville Municipal Airport , NY 36 connects to I @-@ 390 a second time by way of McWhorter Road and exit 5 . Outside of Dansville , the highway heads northwestward across gradually less developed areas as it traverses the west side of a wide , flat valley known locally as the flats . After 8 miles ( 13 km ) , it intersects the western terminus of NY 258 ( named Flats Road ) at an intersection situated 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the hamlet of Groveland on the West Sparta – Groveland town line . Not far to the northwest is I @-@ 390 exit 6 , the third and final meeting between I @-@ 390 and NY 36 . 
 NY 36 continues on , passing through the hamlet of <unk> and serving the Groveland Correctional Facility on its way into the town of Mount Morris and the village of the same name , where it becomes Main Street in the latter . It continues through the mostly residential community to the business district in the heart of the village , which NY 408 enters from the southwest on Chapel Street and leaves to the northeast on State Street . In between Chapel and State streets , NY 36 and NY 408 overlap for one block along Main Street . Immediately north of Mount Morris , NY 36 passes through the northern tip of Letchworth State Park and crosses the Genesee River , which separates the towns of Mount Morris and Leicester . As the route heads north into Leicester , it begins to leave the flats in favor of a more northwesterly alignment that leads it into the village of Leicester . 
 Now named Mount Morris Road , NY 36 enters the east side of the small village , intersecting with U.S. Route 20A ( US 20A ) and NY 39 at Main Street . NY 36 turns west onto Main Street , joining US 20A and NY 39 for one block in order to reach York Road , which carries the route out of the village and across sparsely populated areas to the York hamlet of Greigsville , centered on the highway 's second junction with NY 63 . After another 6 miles ( 10 km ) of open , rural surroundings — save for the hamlet of York at the midpoint of the segment — NY 36 has a junction with US 20 in the hamlet of Fraser . The route continues on , eventually reaching the sprawling village of Caledonia , where the route joins with NY 5 for three blocks along Main Street . At the village 's center , NY 36 turns north onto North Street , which carries the highway through the northern fringe of the village and into Monroe County . 
 = = = Monroe County = = = 
 Across the county line from Caledonia is the Wheatland hamlet of Mumford , where NY 36 crosses over the Rochester and Southern Railroad — which the highway has loosely paralleled since Dansville — and Oatka Creek prior to meeting the southern terminus of NY 383 . While the railroad , the creek , and NY 383 all head east to Scottsville , NY 36 continues to the north on Riga – Mumford Road , passing through isolated areas of the towns of Wheatland and Riga . Along this stretch , it passes over the New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) a short distance south of the Wheatland – Riga town line . The route continues into the hamlet of Riga , where it intersects and briefly overlaps with NY 33A westward along Chili – Riga Center Road . At Churchville – Riga Road , NY 36 leaves NY 33A to resume its northward trek toward the village of Churchville . 
 About 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of the village center , NY 36 meets I @-@ 490 at exit 3 . North of this point , NY 36 becomes South Main Street as it enters the southern portion of Churchville . The highway proceeds into the village 's central business district , centered on the junction of Main and Buffalo streets , the latter designated as NY 33 . NY 36 turns east at Buffalo Street , joining with NY 33 for nine blocks on Buffalo Street as both routes cross over Black Creek and approach the eastern fringe of Churchville . Here , NY 36 turns north once more to follow Washington Street into the town of Ogden . The route continues through the mostly rural town toward the hamlet of Adams Basin , located west of Spencerport and east of Brockport . About 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) south of Adams Basin , it intersects the western terminus of NY 531 ( Spencerport Expressway ) and meets NY 31 at junctions 100 yards ( 91 m ) apart . NY 36 ends at the latter intersection ; however , Washington Street continues north as County Route 212 to serve Adams Basin and the nearby Erie Canal .

 In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created Route 15 , an unsigned legislative route that initially extended from Hornell in the south to Caledonia in the north via Dansville and Mount Morris . Also assigned at this time was Route 16 , which went from Cuba to Rochester via Le Roy and Caledonia . Much of Route 15 followed modern NY 36 ; however , from Dansville to Mount Morris , it used what is now NY 63 and NY 408 instead . Route 16 , meanwhile , followed current NY 36 from Caledonia to Mumford . From Jasper to Hornell , modern NY 36 was part of the cross @-@ state Route 4 . On March 1 , 1921 , Route 16 was truncated to end in Le Roy . Its former routing north of Caledonia became part of Route 15 . 
 NY 36 was assigned in the mid @-@ 1920s to an alignment extending from Hornell in the south to Avon in the north . The route utilized the routing of legislative Route 15 from Hornell to Dansville and from Mount Morris to Shakers Crossing , the modern junction of NY 63 and NY 408 northeast of Mount Morris . Between Dansville and Mount Morris , NY 36 followed its current alignment . Past Shakers Crossing , NY 36 continued northward through Geneseo to Avon on modern NY 63 and NY 39 . The Geneseo – Avon segment of NY 36 became part of US 20 when that route was assigned in 1927 . South of Hornell , what is now NY 36 from Hornell to Jasper became part of NY 17 when that route was assigned to most of legislative Route 4 in 1924 . The remaining sections of contemporary NY 36 — from Jasper to the Pennsylvania state line and north of Mount Morris — were state @-@ maintained but unnumbered . 
 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the segment of modern NY 36 from Hornell south to the Pennsylvania state line became the southernmost portion of NY 21 . At the same time , NY 36 was realigned north of Mount Morris to follow the path of former legislative Route 15 north through Caledonia to Mumford . Past Mumford , NY 36 continued north on its modern alignment to a new terminus at NY 3 ( now NY 31 ) south of Adams Basin . In the early 1940s , NY 36 was extended south through Hornell and Almond to Andover , replacing part of NY 17F . The routings of NY 36 and NY 21 south of Hornell were swapped in the early 1950s , placing both routes on their current alignments south of the city . 
 = = NY 36A = = 
 NY 36A was an alternate route of NY 36 between Dansville and Mount Morris . The route began at NY 36 in Dansville and passed through Groveland on its way to the vicinity of Mount Morris , where it ended at a junction with NY 63 northeast of the village . NY 36A was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and supplanted by a realigned NY 63 in the early 1940s .

The highway is entirely within Lenawee County and begins in Morenci at the Ohio state line with State Route 108 ( SR 108 ) and runs north to M @-@ 34 at Clayton . The highway runs through farm land along Lime Creek outside of the two communities , providing access to the Lake Hudson State Recreation Area . The trunkline dates back to the early 1930s , and has been unchanged since a realignment in 1980 .

 SR 108 crosses into Michigan on the southern edge of Morenci where it becomes M @-@ 156 . From there the road continues northward on East Street through residential neighborhoods for about two @-@ thirds mile ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) to Main Street near downtown where it turns west . The trunkline follows Main Street for three few blocks before turning north on North Street . The highway exits town near the Oak Grove Cemetery . M @-@ 156 follows Lime Creek Highway , which runs parallel to the stream of the same name , through farm land . Near the intersection with Morenci Highway , M @-@ 156 crosses a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway in the community of Seneca . North of the rail crossing , M @-@ 156 follows Morenci Highway northward and passes to the east of Lake Hudson and the Lake Hudson State Recreation Area before terminating at a junction with M @-@ 34 in Clayton . 
 Like other state highways in Michigan , M @-@ 156 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . In 2011 , the department 's traffic surveys showed that on average , <unk> vehicles used the highway daily along Main Street in Morenci and 1 @,@ 412 vehicles did so each day near the state line , the highest and lowest counts along the highway , respectively .

 = Hartebeest = 
 The hartebeest ( pronounced / \ <unk> @-@ tə @-@ <unk> \ / ) , also known as kongoni , is an African antelope , first described by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766 . Eight subspecies have been described , including two sometimes considered to be independent species . A large antelope , the hartebeest stands just over 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) at the shoulder , and has a typical head @-@ and @-@ body length of 200 to 250 cm ( 79 to 98 in ) . The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg ( 220 to 440 lb ) . It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns , short neck , and pointed ears . Its legs , which often have black markings , are unusually long . The coat is generally short and shiny . Coat colour varies by the subspecies , from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne 's hartebeest . Both sexes of all subspecies have horns , with those of females being more slender . Horns can reach lengths of 45 – 70 cm ( 18 – 28 in ) . Apart from its long face , the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes . 
 Gregarious animals , hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals . They are very alert and non @-@ aggressive . They are primarily grazers , with their diets consisting mainly of grasses . Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks , and depends upon the subspecies and local factors . Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age . Gestation is eight to nine months long , after which a single calf is born . Births usually peak in the dry season . The lifespan is 11 to 20 years in the wild and up to 19 years in captivity . 
 Inhabiting dry savannas and wooded grasslands , hartebeest often move to more arid places after rainfall . They have been reported from altitudes on Mount Kenya up to 4 @,@ 000 m ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) . The hartebeest was formerly widespread in Africa , but populations have undergone drastic decline due to habitat destruction , hunting , human settlement , and competition with livestock for food . Each of the eight subspecies of the hartebeest has a different conservation status . The Bubal hartebeest was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) in 1994 . While the populations of the red hartebeest are on the rise , those of the Tora hartebeest , already Critically Endangered , are falling . The hartebeest is extinct in Algeria , Egypt , Lesotho , Libya , Morocco , Somalia , and Tunisia ; but has been introduced into Swaziland and Zimbabwe . It is a popular game animal due to its highly regarded meat . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The vernacular name " hartebeest " ( pronounced / \ <unk> @-@ tə @-@ <unk> \ / ) could have originated from the obsolete Afrikaans word <unk> , literally deer beast . The name was given by the Boers , based on the resemblance of the antelope to deer . The first use of the word " hartebeest " in South African literature was in Dutch colonial administrator Jan van Riebeeck 's journal <unk> in 1660 . He wrote : " Meester Pieter ein hart @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Master Pieter [ van <unk> ] had shot one hartebeest ) " . Another name for the hartebeest is kongoni , a Swahili word . <unk> is often used to refer in particular to one of its subspecies — Coke 's hartebeest . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The scientific name of the hartebeest is Alcelaphus buselaphus . First described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766 , it is classified in the genus Alcelaphus and placed in the family Bovidae . In 1979 , palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba supported <unk> as a separate genus for Lichtenstein 's hartebeest , a kind of hartebeest , as she assumed it was related to Connochaetes ( wildebeest ) . She had analysed the skull characters of living and extinct species of antelope to make a cladogram , and argued that a wide skull linked Lichtenstein 's hartebeest with Connochaetes . However , this finding was not replicated by Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum , who classified it as an independent species of Alcelaphus . Zoologists such as Jonathan Kingdon and Theodor Haltenorth considered it to be a subspecies of A. buselaphus . Vrba dissolved the new genus in 1997 after reconsideration . An <unk> analysis could find no evidence to support a separate genus for Lichtenstein 's hartebeest . It also showed the tribe Alcelaphini to be monophyletic , and discovered close affinity between the Alcelaphus and the sassabies ( genus Damaliscus ) — both genetically and morphologically . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Eight subspecies are identified , of which two – A. b. caama and A. b. lichtensteinii – have been considered to be independent species . However , a 1999 genetic study by P. <unk> of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues , which sampled the control region of the mitochondrial DNA , found that these two formed a clade within A. buselaphus , and that recognising these as species would render A. buselaphus paraphyletic ( an unnatural grouping ) . The same study found A. b. major to be the most divergent , having branched off before the lineage split to give a combined caama / lichtensteinii lineage and another that gave rise to the remaining extant subspecies . Conversely a 2001 phylogenetic study , based on D – loop and cytochrome b analysis by Øystein Flagstad ( of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research , Trondheim ) and colleagues , found that the southern lineage of A. b. caama and A. lichtensteinii diverged earliest . Analysis of skull structure supports partition into three major divisions : A. b. buselaphus division ( nominate , also including A. b. major division ) , A. b. tora division ( also including A. b. cokii and A. b. swaynei ) and A. b. lelwel division . Another analysis of cytochrome b and D @-@ loop sequence data shows a notable affinity between the A. b. lelwel and A. b. tora divisions . 
 The eight subspecies , including the two controversial ones , are : 
 † A. b. buselaphus ( Pallas , 1766 ) : Known as the Bubal hartebeest or northern hartebeest . Formerly occurred across northern Africa , from Morocco to Egypt . It was exterminated by the 1920s . It was declared extinct in 1994 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) . 
 A. b. caama ( Saint @-@ Hilaire , 1803 ) : Known as the red hartebeest or Cape hartebeest . Formerly occurred in southern Angola ; northern and eastern savannahs of Namibia ; central , southern and southwestern Botswana ; Northern Cape , Eastern Cape , Western Cape , Free State , Northwest and Gauteng provinces and western KwaZulu @-@ Natal of South Africa . Presently has been eliminated from all these areas except Northern Cape , central and southwestern Botswana and Namibia . Major re @-@ introductions have taken place in these countries . The population of this hartebeest is on the rise . 
 A. b. cokii ( Günther , 1884 ) : Known as Coke 's hartebeest or kongoni . Native to and confined within Kenya and northern Tanzania . 
 A. b. lelwel ( Heuglin , 1877 ) : Known as the Lelwel hartebeest . Formerly found in northern and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo ; southeastern and southwestern Sudan ; and the northwestern extreme of Tanzania . Drastic population decrease since the 1980s has confined most individuals to protected areas inside and outside its range . 
 A. b. lichtensteinii ( Peters , 1849 ) : Known as Lichtenstein 's hartebeest . <unk> the miombo woodlands of eastern and southern Africa . It is native to Angola , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Malawi , Mozambique , South Africa , Tanzania , Zambia and Zimbabwe . 
 A. b. major ( Blyth , 1869 ) : Known as the western hartebeest . Formerly occurred widely in Mali , Niger , Senegal , Gambia , Guinea @-@ Bissau , Guinea , Ivory Coast , Ghana , Nigeria , southwestern Chad , Cameroon , western Central African Republic and Benin . Nowadays it occurs in much lower numbers mainly in protected areas of these countries . It is probably extinct in Gambia . 
 A. b. swaynei ( Sclater , 1892 ) : Known as Swayne 's hartebeest . Restricted to the southern Rift Valley in Ethiopia . It formerly occurred throughout the Rift Valley , and its range extended eastward into northwestern Somalia . It has disappeared from Somalia by 1930 . Its populations are very low and on the decline . 
 A. b. tora ( Gray , 1873 ) : Known as the Tora hartebeest . Formerly occurred in northwestern Ethiopia and western and southwestern Eritrea . Its present status is unclear , though locals have reported small numbers from these areas . 
 = = = Genetics and hybrids = = = 
 In 2000 , a study scrutinised two major populations of the Swayne 's hartebeest , from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park , for mitochondrial ( D @-@ loop ) and nuclear ( microsatellite ) variability in an attempt to estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies . The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations ; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park . Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park . Additionally , the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population , and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation . The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne 's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas . 
 The diploid number of chromosomes in the hartebeest is 40 . Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap . Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest have been reported in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia , in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9 ° N latitude . A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the <unk> ( Damaliscus <unk> ) to be sterile . Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis , indicated by <unk> and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules . 
 There are three common cross @-@ breeds between the subspecies : 
 Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii : Known as the Kenya Highland hartebeest or the Laikipia hartebeest . It is a cross between the Lelwel and Coke 's hartebeest . This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke 's hartebeest . It is a light buff with reddish @-@ tawny upper parts , and the head is longer than in Coke 's hartebeest . Both sexes have horns , which are heavier as well as longer than those of the parents . It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands , between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya , but is now believed to be restricted to the <unk> Valley ( south @-@ west Kenya ) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west @-@ central Kenya . 
 Alcelaphus lelwel x swaynei : Also known as the Neumann 's hartebeest , named after traveller and hunter Arthur Henry Neumann . This is considered to be a cross between the Lelwel hartebeest and Swayne 's hartebeest . The face is longer than that of the Swayne 's hartebeest . The colour of the coat is a golden brown , paler towards the underparts . The chin has a hint of black and the tail ends in a black tuft . Both sexes have longer horns than the Swayne 's hartebeest . The horns grow in a wide " V " shape , unlike the wide bracket shape of Swayne 's hartebeest and the narrow " V " of Lelwel hartebeest , curving backward and slightly inward . It occurs in Ethiopia , in a small area to the east of Omo River and north of Lake Turkana , stretching north @-@ east of Lake Chew <unk> to near Lake <unk> . 
 The Jackson 's hartebeest does not have a clear taxonomic status . It is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke 's hartebeest . The African Antelope Database ( 1998 ) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel hartebeest . From Lake <unk> to Mount Kenya , the Jackson 's hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest , whereas from Lake Victoria to the southern part of the Rift Valley it tends to be more like the Coke 's hartebeest . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 The genus Alcelaphus emerged about 4 @.@ 4 million years ago in a clade whose other members were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Connochaetes . An analysis using phylogeographic patterns within hartebeest populations suggested a possible origin of Alcelaphus in eastern Africa . Alcelaphus quickly radiated across the African savannas , replacing several previous forms ( such as a relative of the <unk> ) . Flagstad and colleagues showed an early split in the hartebeest populations into two distinct lineages around 0 @.@ 5 million years ago – one to the north and the other to the south of the equator . The northern lineage further diverged into eastern and western lineages , nearly 0 @.@ 4 million years ago , most probably as a result of the expanding central African rainforest belt and subsequent contraction of savannah habitats during a period of global warming . The eastern lineage gave rise to the Coke 's , Swayne 's , Tora and Lelwel hartebeest ; and from the western lineage evolved the Bubal and western hartebeest . The southern lineage gave rise to Lichtenstein 's and red hartebeest . These two taxa are phylogenetically close , having diverged only 0 @.@ 2 million years ago . The study concluded that these major events throughout the hartebeest 's evolution are strongly related to climatic factors , and that there had been successive bursts of radiation from a more permanent population — a refugium — in eastern Africa ; this could be vital to understanding the evolutionary history of not only the hartebeest but also other mammals of the African savanna . 
 The earliest fossil record dates back to nearly 0 @.@ 7 million years ago . Fossils of the red hartebeest have been found in <unk> , Cornelia ( Free State ) and Florisbad in South Africa , as well as in <unk> in Zambia . In Israel , hartebeest remains have been found in northern Negev , Shephelah , Sharon Plain and Tel Lachish . This population of the hartebeest was originally limited to the open country of the southernmost regions of the southern Levant . It was probably hunted in Egypt , which affected the numbers in the Levant , and disconnected it from its main population in Africa . 
 = = Description = = 
 A large antelope with a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns , the hartebeest stands just over 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) at the shoulder , and has a typical head @-@ and @-@ body length of 200 to 250 cm ( 79 to 98 in ) . The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg ( 220 to 440 lb ) . The tail , 40 to 60 cm ( 16 to 24 in ) long , ends in a black tuft . The other distinctive features of the hartebeest are its long legs ( often with black markings ) , short neck , and pointed ears . A study correlated the size of hartebeest species to habitat productivity and rainfall . The western hartebeest is the largest subspecies , and has a characteristic white line between the eyes . The red hartebeest is also large , with a black forehead and a contrasting light band between the eyes . The large Lelwel hartebeest has dark stripes on the front of its legs . Coke 's hartebeest is moderately large , with a shorter forehead and longer tail in comparison to the other subspecies . Lichtenstein 's hartebeest is smaller , with dark stripes on the front of the legs , as in the Lelwel hartebeest . The Swayne 's hartebeest is smaller than the Tora hartebeest , but both have a shorter forehead and similar appearance . 
 Generally short and shiny , the coat varies in colour according to subspecies . The western hartebeest is a pale sandy @-@ brown , but the front of the legs are darker . The red hartebeest is a reddish @-@ brown , with a dark face . Black markings can be observed on the chin , the back of the neck , shoulders , hips and legs ; these are in sharp contrast with the broad white patches that mark its flanks and lower rump . The Lelwel hartebeest is a reddish tan . Coke 's hartebeest is reddish to tawny in the upper parts , but has relatively lighter legs and rump . Lichtenstein 's hartebeest is reddish brown , though the flanks are a lighter tan and the rump whitish . The Tora hartebeest is a dark reddish brown in the upper part of the body , the face , the forelegs and the rump , but the hindlegs and the underbelly are a yellowish white . The Swayne 's hartebeest is a rich chocolate brown with fine spots of white that are actually the white tips of its hairs . Its face is black save for the chocolate band below the eyes . The shoulders and upper part of the legs are black . Fine textured , the body hair of the hartebeest is about 25 mm ( 1 in ) long . The hartebeest has preorbital glands ( glands near the eyes ) with a central duct , that secrete a dark sticky fluid in Coke 's and Lichtenstein 's hartebeest , and a colourless fluid in the Lelwel hartebeest . 
 Both sexes of all subspecies have horns , with those of females being more slender . Horns can reach lengths of 45 – 70 cm ( 18 – 28 in ) ; the maximum horn length is 74 @.@ 9 cm ( 29 @.@ 5 in ) , recorded from a Namibian red hartebeest . The horns of the western hartebeest are thick and appear U @-@ shaped from the front and Z @-@ shaped from the sides , growing backward at first and then forward , ending with a sharp backward turn . The horns of the red and the Lelwel hartebeest are similar to those of the western hartebeest , but appear V @-@ shaped when viewed from the front . The Lichtenstein 's hartebeest has thick parallel ringed horns , with a flat base . Its horns are shorter than those of other subspecies , curving upward then sharply forward , followed by an inward turn at an angle of about 45 ° and a final backward turn . The horns of Swayne 's hartebeest are thin and shaped like parentheses , curving upward and then backward . The horns of the Tora hartebeest are particularly thin and spread out sideways , diverging more than in any other subspecies . 
 Apart from its long face , the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes . The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies ( genus Damaliscus ) , such as an elongated and narrow face , the shape of the horns , the pelage texture and colour , and the terminal tuft of the tail . The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest . The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism , but only slightly , as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses . The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies . Males are 8 % heavier than females in Swayne 's and Lichtenstein 's hartebeest , and 23 % heavier in the red hartebeest . In one study , the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight . Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle ( the bony structures from which the horns grow ) height and skull weight , and the best predictor of the horn circumference . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 Active mainly during daytime , the hartebeest grazes in the early morning and late afternoon , and rests in shade around noon . Gregarious , the species forms herds of up to 300 individuals . Larger numbers gather in places with abundant grass . In 1963 , a congregation of 10 @,@ 000 animals was recorded on the plains near <unk> Pan in Botswana . However , moving herds are not so cohesive , and tend to disperse frequently . The members of a herd can be divided into four groups : territorial adult males , non @-@ territorial adult males , young males , and the females with their young . The females form groups of five to 12 animals , with four generations of young in the group . Females fight for dominance over the herd . Sparring between males and females is common . At three or four years of age , the males can attempt to take over a territory and its female members . A resident male defends his territory and will fight if provoked . The male marks the border of his territory through defecation . 
 Hartebeest are remarkably alert and cautious animals with highly developed brains . Generally calm in nature , hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked . While feeding , one individual stays on the lookout for danger , often standing on a termite mound to see farther . At times of danger , the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off . Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions , leopards , hyenas and wild dogs ; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles . Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest . 
 The thin long legs of the hartebeest provide for a quick escape in an open habitat ; if attacked , the formidable horns are used to ward off the predator . The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing . The muzzle is designed so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet . The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season ; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away . The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances , as well as depositing droppings on dung piles . The opponents drop onto their knees and , after giving a hammer @-@ like blow , begin wrestling , their horns interlocking . One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns . Fights are rarely serious , but can be fatal if they are . 
 Like the sassabies , hartebeest produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds . Juveniles tend to be more vocal than adults , and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued . The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display . Herds are generally sedentary , and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities . The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini ( which also includes wildebeest and sassabies ) , and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe . 
 = = = Parasites and diseases = = = 
 Several parasites have been isolated from the hartebeest . These parasites regularly alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest . Hartebeest can be infected with <unk> due to Rhipicephalus evertsi and Theileria species . South of the Sahara , common parasites include <unk> variolosus , <unk> cristata and G. <unk> . The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as encephalitis . However , parasites are not always harmful – 252 larvae were found in the head of one Zambian individual without any pathogenicity . Nematodes , cestodes , <unk> ; and the roundworm Setaria <unk> have also been isolated from the hartebeest . In 1931 , a red hartebeest in <unk> ( southwestern Africa ) was infected with long , thin worms . These were named Longistrongylus <unk> after their collector , T. Meyer . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Hartebeest are primarily grazers , and their diets consist mostly of grasses . A study in the Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest 's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods . The hartebeest has much lower food intake than the other members of Alcelaphini . The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems . In addition to this , it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses . These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season , which is usually a difficult period for grazers . For instance , in comparison with the roan antelope , the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available . These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago , leading to its successful radiation in Africa . 
 Grasses generally comprise at least 80 percent of the hartebeest 's diet , but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season , October to May . <unk> <unk> is part of the hartebeest 's diet at the start of the rainy season . Between seasons , they mainly feed on the culms of grasses . A study found that the hartebeest is able to digest a higher proportion of food than the topi and the wildebeest . In areas with scarce water , it can survive on melons , roots , and tubers . 
 In a study of grass selectivity among the wildebeest , zebra , and the Coke 's hartebeest , the hartebeest showed the highest selectivity . All animals preferred Themeda triandra over Pennisetum <unk> and Digitaria <unk> . More grass species were eaten in the dry season than in the wet season . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year , with one or two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food . Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age . Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors . Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male , mostly in open areas . The males may fight fiercely for dominance , following which the dominant male smells the female 's genitalia , and follows her if she is in oestrus . Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out her tail slightly to signal her receptivity , and the male tries to block the female 's way . She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her . Copulation is brief and is often repeated , sometimes twice or more in a minute . Any intruder at this time is chased away . In large herds , females often mate with several males . 
 Gestation is eight to nine months long , after which a single calf weighing about 9 kg ( 20 lb ) is born . Births usually peak in the dry season , and take place in thickets – unlike the wildebeest , which give birth in groups on the plains . Though calves can move about on their own shortly after birth , they usually lie in the open in close proximity of their mothers . The calf is weaned at four months , but young males stay with their mothers for two and a half years , longer than in other Alcelaphini . Often the mortality rate of male juveniles is high , as they have to face the aggression of territorial adult males and are also deprived of good forage by them . The lifespan is 11 to 20 years in the wild and up to 19 years in captivity . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 Hartebeest inhabit dry savannas , open plains and wooded grasslands , often moving into more arid places after rainfall . They are more tolerant of wooded areas than other Alcelaphini , and are often found on the edge of woodlands . They have been reported from altitudes on Mount Kenya up to 4 @,@ 000 m ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) . The red hartebeest is known to move across large areas , and females roam home ranges of over 1 @,@ 000 km2 ( 390 sq mi ) , with male territories 200 km2 ( 77 sq mi ) in size . Females in the Nairobi National Park ( Kenya ) have individual home ranges stretching over 3 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 km2 ( 1 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 1 sq mi ) , which are not particularly associated with any one female group . Average female home ranges are large enough to include 20 to 30 male territories . 
 = = Status and conservation = = 
 Each hartebeest subspecies is listed under a different conservation status by the IUCN . The species as a whole is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN . The hartebeest is extinct in Algeria , Egypt , Lesotho , Libya , Morocco , Somalia , and Tunisia . 
 The Bubal hartebeest has been declared extinct since 1994 . German explorer Heinrich Barth , in his works of 1857 , cites firearms and European intrusion among the reasons for the decrease in its numbers . It was extinct in Tunisia by the late 19th century . The last individual was shot in <unk> ( Algeria ) in 1925 . 
 Coke 's hartebeest is listed as Least Concern . This species has been greatly affected by habitat destruction , and about 42 @,@ 000 Coke 's hartebeest occur today in Mara , Serengeti National Park , and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania and Tsavo East National Park in Kenya . The population is decreasing , and 70 % of the population lives in protected areas . 
 The Lelwel hartebeest is listed as Endangered , and numbers have declined greatly since the 1980s , when its population was over 285 @,@ 000 . It was formerly distributed mainly in the Central African Republic , Ethiopia , northern and northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Sudan . Fewer than 70 @,@ 000 individuals are left . Most of the population nowadays is found in Chad in the <unk> region and the Zakouma National Park ( Chad ) , the National Park population benefiting from improved protection and seeing an increase in population since the 1980s ; Manovo @-@ Gounda St. Floris National Park and <unk> @-@ <unk> National Park and Biosphere Reserve in the Central African Republic , where the populations have been falling ; <unk> <unk> Game Reserve and <unk> Game Reserve in Tanzania ; and Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda . 
 Lichtenstein 's hartebeest is listed as Least Concern , and occurs in protected areas such as the Selous Game Reserve and in the wild in southern and western Tanzania and Zambia . 
 The red hartebeest is listed as Least Concern . It is the most widespread , with increasing numbers after its reintroduction into protected and private areas . However , it has been extinct in Lesotho since the twentieth century . Its population is estimated to be over 130 @,@ 000 ( as of 2008 ) , mostly in southern Africa . In Namibia , the largest population occurs in the Etosha National Park . A reintroduced population is flourishing in the <unk> Nature Reserve ( Swaziland ) , outside its range . However , numbers have seen a sharp fall in southwestern Botswana . 
 The Tora hartebeest is listed as Critically Endangered ; the IUCN has ascertained that fewer than 250 mature individuals survive as of 2008 . They are possibly extinct in Sudan due to excessive hunting and agricultural expansion , but may still exist in smaller numbers in Eritrea and Ethiopia . There have been unconfirmed reports of sightings by locals of the Tora hartebeest southeast of the <unk> National Park , from where it had disappeared before 1960 . 
 Swayne 's hartebeest is listed as Endangered , and is close to being Critically Endangered . The total population in 2008 was less than 600 , of which the mature specimens numbered within 250 . It is confined to four major protected areas : the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary , Nechisar National Park , Awash National Park and Mazie National Park . The hartebeest in Senkele have to compete with the livestock of the Oromo people . A study in the Nechisar National Park during 2009 and 2010 found a considerable increase in the livestock of the <unk> ( 49 @.@ 9 % and 56 @.@ 5 % increase during 2006 and 2010 , respectively ) , illegal resource exploitation , and habitat loss as major threats to the Swayne 's hartebeest populations there . 
 The western hartebeest is listed as Near Threatened . It has been eliminated from most of its range , including the southwestern savannas and <unk> du Baoulé National Park in Mali ; southwestern Niger ; southern Senegal ; Gambia ; Ivory Coast ; Burkina Faso . Small populations survive in <unk> National Park and the area bounded by Bamako , <unk> and <unk> in Mali ; <unk> Reserve in Niger ; Niokolo @-@ Koba National Park in Senegal ; Comoé National Park in Ivory Coast ; <unk> forest and Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso ; Pendjari National Park in Benin ; and Bouba Njida , Bénoué , and Faro National Parks in Cameroon . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 Hartebeest are popular game and trophy animals as they are prominently visible and hence easy to hunt . Pictorial as well as epigraphic evidence from Egypt suggests that in the Upper Palaeolithic age , Egyptians hunted hartebeest and domesticated them . The hartebeest was a prominent source of meat , but its economic significance was lower than that of gazelles and other desert species . However , from the beginning of the Neolithic age , hunting became less common and consequently the remains of the hartebeest from this period in Egypt , where it is now extinct , are rare . 
 In a study on the effect of place and sex on carcass characteristics , the average carcass weight of the male red hartebeest was 79 @.@ 3 kg ( 175 lb ) and that of females was 56 kg ( 123 lb ) . The meat of the animals from Qua @-@ Qua region had the highest lipid content — 1 @.@ 3 g ( 0 @.@ 046 oz ) per 100 g ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) of meat . <unk> differences were found in the concentrations of individual fatty acids , amino acids , and minerals . The study considered hartebeest meat to be healthy , as the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids was 0 @.@ 78 , slightly more than the recommended 0 @.@ 7 . 
 = Oh Father = 
 " Oh Father " is a song by American singer Madonna from her fourth studio album Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) . It was released as the fourth single from the album on October 24 , 1989 by Sire Records . The song was not released as a single in most European territories until December 24 , 1995 , when it appeared on the 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember . Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard , the nexus of " Oh Father " was the presence of male authoritative figures in Madonna 's life , most prominently her father , Tony Ciccone . Madonna 's relationship with her father had soured , after her mother 's death in 1963 and his remarriage two years later . While developing the Like a Prayer album , Madonna was in an emotional state of mind due to her personal problems , which also reflected in the songwriting for " Oh Father " . 
 Musically , " Oh Father " is a pop song and a ballad . It was recorded at a studio in the Garment District of New York City . Leonard put together different types of chord progression and created the basic outline of a melody , which Madonna shaped and then wrote lyrics to fit the melody . She used a contrast of timbre while singing the song , which also featured instrumentation from strings , piano , violin and drum machine . " Oh Father " received positive reviews from critics and authors , but commercially was less successful than Madonna 's previous singles . In most of the countries where it was released , the song failed to attain top @-@ ten positions , except in Finland and Italy , where it peaked at number six . It ended Madonna 's string of 16 consecutive top five singles in the United States . 
 The music video of the song was Madonna 's attempt to embrace and accept her mother 's death . Directed by David Fincher and shot in black @-@ and @-@ white , it shows a little girl playing in the snow , as her mother dies . A grown @-@ up Madonna follows the child and sings the song , as the child runs away from her abusive father . Described by reviewers as " autobiographical " , the video was listed by Rolling Stone as one of " The 100 Top Music Videos " . Scholars noted how Madonna 's persona was split into the child and adult in the video , and one writer described a scene involving the dead mother shown in her wake , with her lips sewn shut , as one of the most disturbing scenes in the history of mainstream music videos — the scene was inspired by Madonna 's memory of her mother from her funeral . " Oh Father " was performed only on the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990 , where Madonna portrayed a woman trying to find her religion and her battle for it . 
 = = Background = = 
 When Madonna was five years old , in 1963 , her mother , Madonna Ciccone , died of breast cancer at the age of 30 . Months before this , Madonna noticed changes in her mother 's behavior and personality from the attentive homemaker she was , but did not understand the reasons . Mrs. Ciccone , at a loss to explain her dire medical condition , would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna , at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly . " I remember feeling stronger than she was " , Madonna recalled , " I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child . " Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying . " There was so much left unsaid , so many untangled and unresolved emotions , of remorse , guilt , loss , anger , confusion . ... I saw my mother , looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket . Then I noticed that my mother 's mouth looked funny . It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up . In that awful moment , I began to understand what I had lost forever . The final image of my mother , at once peaceful yet grotesque , haunts me today also . " 
 Madonna eventually learned to take care of herself and her siblings , and she turned to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her . The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly to take the place of their beloved mother . In an interview with Vanity Fair , Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a " lonely girl who was searching for something . I wasn 't rebellious in a certain way . I cared about being good at something . I didn 't shave my underarms and I didn 't wear make @-@ up like normal girls do . But I studied and I got good grades .... I wanted to be somebody . " Terrified that her father , Tony Ciccone , could be taken from her as well , Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him . Two years after her mother 's death , her father married the family 's housekeeper , Joan Gustafson . At this point , Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father that lasted for decades , and developed a rebellious attitude . She explained in the May 1989 issue of Interview magazine : 
 That rebellious attitude really came , I think , when my father remarried . Because for the three years before he married , I clung to him . It was like , OK , now you 're mine , and you 're not going anywhere . Like all young girls , I was in love with my father and I didn 't want to lose him . I lost my mother , but then I was the mother , my father was mine . Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother . It was then that I said , OK I don ’ t need anybody .

 When Madonna started work on her fourth studio album , Like a Prayer , she was already in an emotional state of mind , following her divorce with then @-@ husband , Sean Penn , her thirtieth birthday , and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors . She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album . While writing the songs for Like a Prayer , Madonna also acted in a Broadway production called Speed @-@ the @-@ Plow . In the play , she portrayed Karen , a secretary to a movie producer who bedded her on a bet with his friends . Karen later gets revenge , but is depicted as just as seedy and conniving as the men who had partaken in this bet and exploited her . Madonna was frustrated with the role and the negative reception , which she vented into her lyrics . The result was a set of three songs — " Till Death Do Us Part " , " Promise to Try " and " Oh Father " — where she sought to purge herself from her personal paranoia and demons . Written with producer Patrick Leonard , in " Oh Father " the singer wanted to revisit the pain and confusion that had characterized her relationship with her father . Generally accepted by critics and academics as a love letter to Tony Ciccone or as an indictment , Madonna never divulged her inspiration behind " Oh Father " , except saying that the song was about her father and a tribute to Simon & Garfunkel , her favorite band at that time . She added , " [ The song ] is what the listener thinks it is , all open to interpretation . I just wrote the song , it 's up to others to interpret them to mean what they want them to mean . " 
 Although the singer has never mentioned physical abuse in her family , she had mentioned that her father was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was hard on her . Author Lucy O 'Brien wrote in her book Madonna : Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced , with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died . When he married again , his new wife was wrapped up with her own children , so the older kids were often left to their own devices . O 'Brien believed that for this reason , Madonna 's girlhood would have been without much joy , and that " Oh Father " was a potent example of the singer using her imagination to escape from her troubled childhood , while blaming it on her father . Tony later said , " Maybe I 'm not the greatest father in the world , but life wasn 't easy for us , and <unk> [ Madonna 's nickname ] knows all of this . " 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 When Madonna went to record " Oh Father " , her troubled role in Speed @-@ the @-@ Plow was on her mind , with the result being that she vented her emotions in the recording of the song . Bill Meyers , who did the string arrangement for most of the songs on Like a Prayer , including " Oh Father " , recalled that Madonna worked on the song with Leonard in " this really dingy , awful little studio in the Garment District in New York . It was grotesquely dirty and cramped , and that 's what came out of it . " 
 According to him , Madonna was moved while singing the song , since the theme suggested incest and the controversial topic of closet beatings . However , her insecurities about her childhood showed up in anxieties during her vocal performance . Meyers said that if Madonna bended a note or sang flat in a certain spot , she would go on doing that consistently as she did not like to vary her voice or change the tone . Madonna recalled that Leonard thought of the melody for the song . After the mixing was over , Meyers complimented Madonna by saying that it was her " strongest " vocal performance . In a 2014 interview with Billboard celebrating the 25th anniversary of Like a Prayer , Leonard explained the recording process of the song : 
 " My favorite thing that we ever recorded , ever — or wrote — is ' Oh Father ' ... because we knew when we did it , that there was something about this that was in a way kind of the most * real * thing . [ For ] that song , the ' record ' button was only pressed three times . That 's it . So it 's real . It 's something that I really wanted to do and she was kind enough to say ' let 's try this , ' and it was not easy . " 
 For the song , which is a baroque pop ballad , Madonna uses a contrast of timbre , her higher smoother voice with her lower one . The song begins with the sound of violins for about 20 seconds . After this , a drum machine , string arrangement and piano ushers on top of the violins , as Madonna sings the chorus line " You can 't hurt me now , I got away from you , I never thought I would . " The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus , but come back again during the next bridge . As Madonna sings the verse " Oh father I have sinned " , the violins change their pitch to a higher one . After the second chorus , there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away . The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna 's voice . In an interview with Paul Zollo , Madonna commented that the " Father " can refer to Tony , God or all the " authorities in her life " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Critical response for " Oh Father " was generally positive . J. Randy Taraborrelli , author of Madonna : An Intimate Biography , commented that with the track , Madonna exposed herself by transforming her personal experience into art , making it clear to anyone how she felt about her relationship with Tony . Rooksby believed that the " psychobabble " phrases of feeling good about oneself in the song , would have made it extremely popular in the early Eighties . He added that " Oh Father " was the most compassionate and generous moment in Madonna 's musical career and the track might have inspired the exploration of childhood in the music of contemporary artists like Kate Bush and Tori Amos , in particular Bush 's song " The Fog " from her 1989 studio album , The Sensual World , and Amos ' " Winter " from the 1992 effort , Little Earthquakes . Author Leslie C. Dunn wrote in her book Embodied Voices , that the autobiographical nature of the song brought forth a new side of Madonna . Sharing the same view , Freya Jarman @-@ Ivens , one of the authors of Madonna 's Drowned Worlds , declared " Oh Father " as a powerful statement regarding father @-@ daughter relationships . Allen Metz , author of The Madonna Companion , described the song as a " stark ballad with a serious string arrangement " . O 'Brien felt that the strings were dramatic and pretentious . She described Madonna 's singing as consisting of " Courtney Love @-@ style rasp " and adding that Madonna " attacks the song with personal passion " . 
 Lennox Samuels from The Dallas Morning News felt that the " great sense of being hurt that is present in ' Oh Father ' is far more relatable than any other Madonna song . " Kevin Phinney from the Austin American @-@ Statesman called it the strongest and the most shocking song on Like a Prayer . Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote that the orchestration of the song was " grandiloquent " , while describing Madonna 's delivery of the lines as an " angry triumph " . Stewart Mason from Allmusic shared Holden 's opinion , and described " Oh Father " as " [ Madonna 's ] finest ballad performance ever " . He added that the " upward modulation of the chorus , accompanied by some overdubbed self @-@ harmonies that feature a very controlled and effective use of Madonna 's highest register , is sheer brilliance , giving the song a steely resolve that removes any taint of self @-@ pity from the verses . " Music journalist J. D. Considine , while reviewing Like a Prayer for Rolling Stone , believed that despite the song 's " lush " string arrangement , some of the lyrics contain a disquieting degree of pain . Hadley Freeman from The Guardian commented that the confessional nature of the lyrics of " Oh Father " was what appealed to her the most in the song . Negative reception for the song was given by Mark Browning , author of David Fincher : Films That Scar , who called it one of Madonna 's weakest efforts , due to the verses sounding more like musical theater than a pop song . 
 = = Chart performance = = 
 In the United States , " Oh Father " was released on October 24 , 1989 , and debuted at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 , during the week of November 11 , 1989 . The song became Madonna 's first single since " Holiday " in 1984 not to enter the top ten in the United States , peaking at number 20 on the week of December 30 , 1989 . This ended her streak of 16 consecutive top five singles and 17 consecutive top ten singles . It was present on the Hot 100 for a total of 13 weeks . In Canada , " Oh Father " debuted at number 84 on the RPM Singles Chart on November 11 , 1989 . After nine weeks , the song reached a peak of number 14 on the chart , and was present for a total of 15 weeks . The single was Madonna 's lowest charting single in Australia at the time , where it peaked at number 59 , breaking a run of 20 consecutive top 40 singles . 
 " Oh Father " was not released as a single in most European territories until December 24 , 1995 , when it appeared on Madonna 's 1995 compilation album Something to Remember . The 1995 single was released with different track listing and artwork which included a photography still from the 1989 music video . The song debuted and peaked at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart on January 6 , 1996 .

 = = Music video = = 
 The music video was filmed during the last week of October 1989 at Culver Studios in Culver City , California , and was directed by David Fincher , who worked with Madonna in her video for " Express Yourself " . Described by Carol Clerk , author of Madonnastyle , as " harrowingly autobiographical " , the video was shot entirely in black @-@ and @-@ white and recreates the death scene of a young woman , exploring the tempestuous relationship that ensues between the husband and the daughter she has left behind . It begins with a young girl playing in the backyard as snow falls on the ground . The scene shifts to that of a bedside , where a young woman who has died , lies . Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays . Madonna , wearing a long , black coat , sings the song underneath a snow @-@ covered , dead tree , as the young girl plays with her dead mother 's jewelry . The husband comes and shouts at the girl , tearing away the woman 's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl 's feet . The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother 's grave . The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face , as the little girl cries in front of the grave . She is taken away from the graveyard by her father , as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother , her trying to reach the knob of a door , and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face . As the singer walks through a forest , the father is shown resorting to drinking in grief . A funeral scene follows , showing the girl walking up to her mother 's wake . When she sees her mother 's lips sealed with thread , she runs away from the wake . Madonna walks through a house , where shadows show the girl being scolded and shouted at by the father . Ultimately she walks to the graveyard and stands beside an old man , implying that she herself is the little girl portrayed . The video ends with the little girl dancing in front of her mother 's grave as snow falls around her . 
 Madonna later said that the end of the video was " my attempt to embrace and accept my mother 's death " . According to feminist writer E. Ann Kaplan , the video is said to have taken stylistic inspiration from the 1941 Orson Welles film , Citizen Kane . She described the video as a " typical adolescent story in Western cultural terms " . It foregrounds Madonna 's repressive Catholic upbringing and her conflicted relationship not only to her literal father in the video , but also a symbolic one — the Holy Father , the Law and the Patriarchy . Bruce David Forbes , author of Religion and Popular Culture in America , felt that the video drew on Madonna 's childhood experiences and dramatized her efforts to renegotiate these relationships , in her daily interactions with her lover and father , and in relation to Catholicism , which the singer referred to in the line " Oh father I have sinned " . Dunn noticed that like the Pepsi commercial shot for her earlier single " Like a Prayer " , Madonna 's persona is split into a child and adult , who repeatedly fuse and separate . Dunn commented that as the narrative developed , the child is shown singing , but the adult Madonna 's voice is heard , and when the adult Madonna appears in a hallway , her shadow is that of a child . Madonna responded to these observations by saying : " I think the biggest reason I was able to express myself and not be intimidated was not having a mother . " Dunn then moved onto the scene during the funeral , when the child trembled from seeing her mother 's lips sewn shut . Described by her as one of the most troubling shots in mainstream music videos , the scene was inspired by Madonna 's memory of her mother lying in her wake . The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair , that she remembered that her mother 's lips looked funny in the funeral . When she got closer , she saw that Madonna Sr 's lips had been sewn together . This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years , and led her to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex . The singer further explained : 
 I had to deal with the loss of my mother and then had to deal with the guilt of her being gone and then I had to deal with the loss of my father when he married my stepmother . So I was just one angry abandoned girl . I 'm still angry . The part of me that goes around saying " Fuck you ! Fuck you ! " is the part that 's covering up the part that 's saying " I 'm hurt ! " I guess all of this came through in the video . 
 In the 1991 MTV special hosted by Kurt Loder titled Breakfast with Madonna , Loder described the video as " amazing " , then asked Madonna if her father had seen it . Madonna responded , " To tell you the truth , I don 't know if he 's seen it . I 'm sort of afraid to ask . " After MTV world @-@ premiered the video on November 11 , 1989 , they wanted to pull it off broadcast until the scene with the lips shut was removed . Madonna disagreed and told them that she would cancel future deals with the channel , prompting MTV to air the video again . The music video has been honored by Rolling Stone as one of " The 100 Top Music Videos " , placed at number 66 . In 1991 , the video received a nomination at the 33rd Grammy Awards , in the category of Best Short Form Music Video . Madonna 's vision of reconciliation in the music videos of both " Oh Father " and her 1986 single " Papa Don 't Preach " was later included in the third level of Madonna Studies , a controversial development of a field in media studies during the 1990s . The music video for " Oh Father " is commercially available on Madonna 's The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) DVD / VHS compilation . 
 = = Live performance and covers = = 
 Madonna performed " Oh Father " on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour with " Live to Tell " , during the second segment of the show . As the performance of " Like a Prayer " ended , Madonna , who was dressed in a clergyman 's robe with a crucifix around her neck , and a veil around her head , knelt on a church nave , while incense fumes wafted around her . She started singing " Live to Tell " from a confession bench , with Roman columns and a platform full of votive candles in the background . In the middle of the song , she started singing " Oh Father " while a dancer in a black frock played the role of a priest . The dancer , Carlton Wilborn , recalled that this performance required a lot of rehearsal time , since the dance portrayed Madonna as a woman trying to find her religion . He explained : " One side knew she needed it , another side was resistant , and our dance represented that battle inside . " At the end of the performance , Wilborn pushed down Madonna 's head before pulling her back up again , thus portraying his role as the priest , trying to wake up Madonna to the importance of religion . Two different performances were taped and released on video , the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90 , taped in Yokohama , Japan , on April 27 , 1990 , and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live , taped in Nice , France , on August 5 , 1990 . 
 British alternative band My <unk> released a rock version of the song on their 2001 album , <unk> . A cover version by Giant Drag done in folk rock style was included on the 2007 Madonna tribute compilation Through the Wilderness . Sia covered the song on her 2010 album , We Are Born . K. Ross Hoffman from Allmusic praised this version , saying that Sia 's voice sounded throaty and it " recalled any number of tortured ' 90s alt @-@ rock songstresses " . Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said that Sia 's cover " finds the sweetness in [ the original song ] , brightening it into an airy , blippy closer . "

 = Adolf Hitler 's 50th birthday = 
 The 50th birthday of Adolf Hitler on 20 April 1939 was celebrated as a national holiday throughout Nazi Germany and other parts of the world . Gifts and telegrams of congratulations were received from all over Germany and allied countries , although the Western Allies ignored the event diplomatically . The birthday celebration saw , amongst other events , the largest military parade in the history of the Third Reich , with army , air force , navy and SS units , numbering almost 50 @,@ 000 in total , marching through the streets of Berlin in Hitler 's honor . 
 = = Celebrations = = 
 On 18 April 1939 , the government of Nazi Germany declared that their Führer Adolf Hitler 's birthday ( 20 April ) to be a national holiday . Festivities took place in all municipalities throughout the country , as well as in the Free City of Danzig . The British historian Ian Kershaw comments that the events organised in Berlin by the Nazi minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels were " an astonishing extravaganza of the Führer cult . The lavish outpourings of adulation and sycophancy surpassed those of any previous Führer Birthdays . " 
 Festivities began in the afternoon on the day before his birthday , when Hitler rode in the lead car of a motorcade of fifty white limousines along architect Albert Speer 's newly completed East @-@ West Axis , the planned central boulevard for Welthauptstadt Germania , which was to be the new capital after the planned victory in World War II . Hitler , anticipating that Speer would give a speech , was amused when he evaded this by briefly announcing that the work should speak for itself . The next event was a torchlit procession of appointments from all over Germany , which Hitler reviewed from a balcony in the Reich Chancellery . Then , at midnight , Hitler 's courtiers congratulated him and presented him with gifts , including , " Statues , bronze casts , Meissen porcelain , oil @-@ paintings , tapestries , rare coins , antique weapons , and a mass of other presents , many of them kitsch . Hitler admired some , made fun of others , and ignored most . " 
 Speer presented Hitler with a scale model of the gigantic triumphal arch planned for the rebuilding of Berlin , and Hitler 's pilot , Hans Baur , gave him a model of the " Führer Machine " , a four @-@ engined Focke @-@ Wulf 200 which was to go into service later that year as Hitler 's official airplane . 
 = = Military parade = = 
 A key part of the birthday celebrations was the large demonstration of Nazi Germany 's military capabilities . The display was intended in part as a warning to the Western powers . The parade , which lasted about five hours , included 12 companies of the Luftwaffe , 12 companies of the army , and 12 companies of the navy , as well as units of the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) . In total , 40 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 German troops took part . 162 warplanes flew over Berlin . The grandstand comprised 20 @,@ 000 official guests , and the parade was watched by several hundred thousand spectators . Features of the parade were large long range air defence artillery guns , emphasis on motorized artillery and development of air defense units . Joseph Goebbels , the event 's organizer , declared in a broadcast address to the German people : 
 The Reich stands in the shadow of the German sword . Trade and industry , and cultural and national life flourish under the guarantee of the military forces . The name of Herr Hitler is our political programme . Imagination and realism are harmoniously combined in the Führer . 
 Military leaders throughout the country gave addresses to their troops to celebrate the occasion . Some , such as Major General ( later Generalfeldmarschall ) Erich von Manstein , were especially effusive in their praise for their supreme commander . Official guests representing 23 countries took part in the celebrations . Papal envoy Cesare Orsenigo , the President of the Slovak Republic Jozef Tiso , the heads of the branches of Nazi Germany 's armed forces , and mayors of German cities offered birthday congratulations at the chancellery . Hitler and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini exchanged telegrams assuring each other that the friendship between Germany and the Kingdom of Italy ( both ruled by fascist regimes at the time ) could not be disturbed by their enemies . The ambassadors of the United Kingdom , France and the United States were not present at the parade , having been withdrawn after Hitler 's march into Czechoslovakia in 1938 . The U.S. was represented at the troop review by chargé d 'affaires Raymond H. Geist . U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not congratulate Hitler on his birthday , in accordance with his practice of not sending birthday greetings to anyone but ruling monarchs . King George VI of the United Kingdom dispatched a message of congratulation to Hitler ; but due to the strained relations between the two countries , his advisors had considered whether the King should ignore the birthday altogether . There was no Polish representation at the parade . 
 = = Commemoration = = 
 A luxury edition of Hitler 's political manifesto and autobiography Mein Kampf published in 1939 in honor of his 50th birthday was known as the <unk> ( " Anniversary Issue " ) . It came in both dark blue and sharp red boards with a gold sword on the cover . The German author and photographer Heinrich Hoffmann wrote a book about Hitler 's 50th birthday , entitled Ein Volk <unk> seinen Führer ( " A Nation Honors its Leader " ) . Composer Hans Rehberg wrote a hymn for the occasion . A film of the birthday celebration , Hitlers 50 . Geburtstag ( " Hitler 's 50th Birthday " ) , is regarded as an important example of Nazi propaganda ; it was subsequently shown to packed audiences at Youth Film Hours , which were held on Sundays . 
 = = Birthday gifts = = 
 The Free City of Danzig made Hitler an honorary citizen of the city as a birthday gift . Hitler received the citizenship papers from the hands of Albert Forster , the city 's Nazi leader . Political and military tension between Germany and Poland was heightened at the time , and Time Magazine reported the possibility of Danzig being returned to Germany . Martin Bormann , Hitler 's private secretary , had the Eagle 's Nest constructed as the Nazi Party 's birthday gift . Hitler , however , did not like the location , as he had a fear of heights . Because of his indigestion , Hitler did not drink alcohol , so a Munich brewery created a special batch of low alcohol beer for his birthday . The brew became a regular order . 
 On the occasion of his birthday , families with small incomes received a birthday gift of 15 German Reichsmarks , plus 5 Reichsmarks for every dependent , an expenditure totalling 13 million Reichsmarks .

 = Sheffield Rules = 
 The Sheffield Rules were a code of football devised and played in the English city of Sheffield between 1857 and 1877 . They were devised by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest for use by the newly founded Sheffield Football Club . The rules were subsequently adopted as the official rules of Sheffield Football Association upon its creation in 1867 . They spread beyond the city boundaries to other clubs and associations in the north and midlands of England making them one of the most popular forms of football during the 1860s and 70s . 
 Six years after the creation of the Sheffield Rules the Football Association rules were created . These were influenced by the Sheffield game but ongoing disputes meant that the Sheffield rules continued to be used . During this time many of the elements of the rules were incorporated into the association game . Regular games were played between Sheffield and London using both sets of rules . This led to an agreement on a single set of laws administered by the Football Association in 1877 . 
 The rules had a major influence on how the modern game of football developed . Among other things they introduced into the laws of the game the concepts of corners , throw @-@ ins , and free kicks for fouls . The abolition of the fair catch also led to their teams to be the first to head the ball . Games played under the rules are also credited with the development of heading and the origins of the goalkeeper and forward positions . The first inter @-@ club football match and competitive tournament were both played using Sheffield Rules . 
 = = Background = = 
 The oldest recorded football match in Sheffield occurred in 1794 when a game of mob football was played between Sheffield and Norton ( at the time a Derbyshire village ) that took place at Bents Green . The game lasted three days , which was not unusual for matches at the time . It was noted that although there were some injuries no @-@ one was killed during the match . The <unk> Road Fencing Club had been playing football since 1852 . The city was home to a number of sports clubs and the popularity of cricket had led to the chairman of Sheffield Cricket Club to suggest the construction of Bramall Lane . 
 By the 1850s there were several versions of football played in public schools and clubs throughout England . Each school played by their own code despite an attempt by Cambridge University to unify them in 1848 . Their rules were generally inaccessible outside of the schools . There the football tended to be unorganised and fairly lawless games known as mob football . Although there are matches between small , equal numbered teams it remained a minority sport until the 1860s . 
 During the winter months in 1855 the players of Sheffield Cricket Club organised informal football matches in order to retain fitness until the start of the new season . Two of the players were Nathaniel Creswick ( 1826 – 1917 ) and William Prest ( 1832 – 1885 ) , both of whom were born in Yorkshire . Creswick came from a Sheffield family of silver plate manufacturers that dated back several centuries . After being educated at the city 's Collegiate School he became a solicitor . Prest 's family had moved from York while he was a child . His father bought a wine merchants that William subsequently took over . Both men were keen sportsmen . Creswick enjoyed a number of sports including cricket and running . Prest played cricket for the All England XI and also captained Yorkshire on several occasions . The inaugural meeting of Sheffield F.C. took place on 24 October 1857 at Parkfield House in the suburb of Highfield . The original headquarters would become a greenhouse on East Bank Road . The adjacent field was used as their first playing ground . 
 = = Rules of 1858 = = 
 The first written set of laws were produced at the club 's first annual general meeting on 21 October 1858 . The original draft was amended at the same meeting to produce the following set of rules for the 1858 – 59 season . 
 The kick off from the middle must be a place kick . 
 Kick out must not be more than 25 yards [ 23 m ] out of goal . 
 A fair catch is a catch from any player provided the ball has not touched the ground or has not been thrown from touch and is entitled to a free @-@ kick . 
 Charging is fair in case of a place kick ( with the exception of a kick off as soon as a player offers to kick ) but he may always draw back unless he has actually touched the ball with his foot . 
 Pushing with the hands is allowed but no hacking or tripping up is fair under any circumstances whatever . 
 No player may be held or pulled over . 
 It is not lawful to take the ball off the ground ( except in touch ) for any purpose whatever . 
 The ball may be pushed or hit with the hand , but holding the ball except in the case of a free kick is altogether disallowed . 
 A goal must be kicked but not from touch nor by a free kick from a catch . 
 A ball in touch is dead , consequently the side that touches it down must bring it to the edge of the touch and throw it straight out from touch . 
 Each player must provide himself with a red and dark blue flannel cap , one colour to be worn by each side . 
 = = Overview = = 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 The rules had been in use since the establishment of the club . Although a selection of rules from public schools were seen there , the 1858 rules show little evidence of their influence . Many of the original members were from the local Collegiate School , which favoured the kicking style of the game , rather than handling the ball . The kicking game was also prevalent in the local villages of Penistone and <unk> . The rules were the first to penalise foul play with a free kick , introduce the throw @-@ in and eliminate the offside rule . They also had the unique feature of preventing a goal being scored directly from a free kick or throw @-@ in . 
 Significant changes were also noted in the minutes book . The original draft prevented all handling of the ball except in the case of a fair catch . It also prevented all hacking and tripping . Despite the relaxation of these rules the first rules clearly leaned towards the kicking version of the game and away from handling of the ball . The season would start on 1 November and run until Easter Saturday . The numbers on each side were not fixed . The club rules also dictated that any disputes on the field would be resolved by any committee members present — the first reference to a position now occupied by the referee .

 Initially the code was only played among Sheffield F.C. members . Games initially teamed players with surnames in the first half of the alphabet against players with surnames in the latter half of the alphabet . They , however , discovered that the most talented players all had surnames in the first half . Various other permutations were tried with professionals versus merchants and manufacturers becoming one of the favourites . In December 1858 they played their first outside opposition , a team from the local 58th Army Regiment . In 1859 the club produced the first printed rule book . Despite this the rules were not entirely fixed with changes experimented with throughout the season . 
 Two major events took place in 1860 . On 31 January a meeting was held where it was resolved that Law 8 should be expunged and replaced with Holding the ball ( except in the case of a free kick ) or knocking or pushing it on is altogether disallowed . On the pitch the world ’ s first inter @-@ club match between Sheffield and the newly formed Hallam F.C. took place on 26 December 1860 . The match took place at Hallam 's ground , <unk> Road . It was reported that " The <unk> turned in their usual Scarlet and White " which suggests that club colours were already in use . Despite playing with inferior numbers Sheffield F.C. beat Hallam 2 – 0 . 
 In 1861 rouges were introduced into the code . The idea was borrowed from Eton and involved a 4 yards ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) goal ( as opposed to 8 yards ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) used previously ) . There were also rouge flags placed an additional 4 yards ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) each side of the goal . If the ball was kicked between the rouge flags and subsequently touched down the team scored a rouge . If the score was tied at the end of the game then rouges could be used to decide the winner . A version of the arrangement remains in Australian Rules Football . 
 When the club published its second rule book in 1862 the number of laws had grown to 17 . The game of the time could still be a violent one . A match on 29 December between Sheffield and Hallam became known as the Battle of Bramall Lane . An incident occurred when Nathaniel Creswick was being held by Shaw and Waterfall . Accounts differ over subsequent events . The original report stated that Creswick was accidentally punched by Waterfall . This was contested in a letter from the Hallam players that claimed that it was in retaliation for a blow thrown by Nathaniel Creswick . Whatever the cause the result was a general riot , which also involved a number of spectators , after which Waterfall was sent to guard the goal as punishment .

 The Football Association ( FA ) was formed at a meeting in the Freemason 's Tavern in Great Queen Street , London on 26 October 1863 . Sheffield F.C. sent four representatives who acted as observers . The club joined the new organisation a month later in a letter sent by William Chesterman . In it he also enclosed a copy of the Sheffield Rules and expressed the club 's opposition to hacking and running with the ball , describing them as " directly opposed to football " . This letter was read out at an FA meeting on 1 December 1863 . The rules allowing hacking and running with the ball were reversed at the same meeting . The new code became known as Association Football . 
 The offside rule was introduced to Sheffield Rules in 1863 . Their version only required one member of the opposition between a player and the opposing goal to remain on side . Despite this the rule was only used sporadically in actual play . The FA version , which required a player to remain behind the ball at all times , was introduced during the 1865 – 66 season but was disliked due to the lack of goal scoring opportunities it caused . The one man offside was finally used a regular basis from 1867 until the adoption of FA rules in 1877 . 
 The FA had remained largely dormant after the creation of its rules but in 1866 Sheffield F.C. suggested a match between it and a FA club . This was misunderstood and they ended up playing a combined FA team on 31 March 1866 under FA rules . The game was the first ever to limit the match to 90 minutes and Sheffield F.C. adopted it as its preferred length of match . The rule would make it to the FA rule book in 1877 . A second match was suggested by the London FA in a letter sent in November or the same year but never took place , the reason being disputes of which rules should be used . The FA introduced an 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) cross bar used by Sheffield in the same year only for Sheffield to then decide to raise it to 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) . The fair catch was also dropped by Sheffield . This completed the transition to a purely kicking game . 
 By 1867 the Sheffield Rules was the dominant code in England . The FA had still not achieved the national dominance it enjoys today . Its membership had shrunk to just 10 clubs and at a meeting of the FA it was reported that only three clubs ( No Names Club , Barnes and Crystal Palace ) were playing by the FA code . At the same meeting the secretary of Sheffield Club suggested three rule changes at an FA meeting : the adoption of rouges , the one man offside and introduction of a free kick for handling the ball . None of the motions were successful . Later in the same year , they abolished handling and touchdowns . It was stated that this was to bring them closer to non @-@ handling games . 
 = = = Birth of competition = = = 
 In 1867 the world 's first football tournament , the <unk> Cup , was played under the rules . The tournament involved 12 local sides and was played during February and March . The tournament committee decided on the use of an off @-@ field referee to award free kicks for infringements . The final took place on 5 March and was only the second football match to take place at Bramall Lane . A crowd of 3 @,@ 000 , a world record attendance , watched Hallam F.C. claim the cup by scoring two rouges in the last five minutes to win two rouges to one . The Sheffield Football Association was founded following the tournament . The 12 teams involved in the tournament were joined by Sheffield F.C. to become the founding members . The association adopted the Sheffield Rules without any changes . They were the first of several regional Football Associations that sprung up over the following decade . 
 A second tournament , the Cromwell Cup was played a year later . This time it was only open to teams under two years old . Out of the four teams that competed The Wednesday emerged victorious . The final was a goalless draw after 90 minutes so the teams played on until a goal was scored . This was the first instance where a match involved extra time . This would be the last tournament to be played in Sheffield for nine years until the formation of the Sheffield Football Association Challenge Cup in 1876 . 
 Rouges were abandoned in 1868 to be replaced by the goal and corner kicks . Sheffield FA limited handling to within 3 yards ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) of the goal in 1871 . The FA , however , introduced a designated goalkeeper who was allowed to handle the ball anywhere on the pitch . In an effort to prevent the Sheffield game looking boring in comparison the Sheffield FA expanded the limit to the halfway line . 
 In 1870 , 16 teams of the Sheffield FA were admitted to the FA but were allowed to continue to play by Sheffield Rules against FA clubs . A year later the Sheffield FA itself became affiliated with the Football Association and matches between the two associations began . 
 Between 1871 and 1876 a total of 16 matches were played between the Sheffield and London associations . As well as playing under both Sheffield and London rules , additional matches were played at Bramall Lane using a mixture of both sets . Aspects of the Sheffield game were also incorporated into the FA rules . The matches being played between Sheffield and London led to the two sets of rules becoming ever more similar . The corner kick was proposed by the Sheffield Association and adopted by the FA on 17 February 1872 . They also followed Sheffield 's lead in restricting handling of the ball by the goalkeeper to his own half . The Sheffield game reverted to using an 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) crossbar in line with the FA . 
 = = = Demise = = = 
 The FA Cup was inaugurated in 1871 , but Sheffield clubs declined to enter the competition as it was being played under FA rules . The first team to enter was Sheffield F.C. in the 1873 – 74 season . This was after an attempt to enter a Sheffield FA team was refused by the organisers . They reached the quarter @-@ finals before being knocked out by Clapham Rovers . The Sheffield FA instituted their own Challenge Cup in 1876 . The cup was open to all the members of the SFA that now included many clubs outside the local area . The first final attracted a crowd of 8 @,@ 000 , twice as much as the FA Cup final in the same season . It was a record crowd for a cup match that would be held until the FA Cup of 1883 . The match was between Heeley and Wednesday and resulted in a 2 – 0 win for the latter . 
 By 1877 it was clear that the situation had become impractical . After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws . By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game . The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw @-@ ins to be thrown in any direction , as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby <unk> . In return the FA 's use of a three @-@ man offside was adopted . 
 By the 1880s the influence of the Sheffield FA started to wane . Internal troubles began to surface with disputes between the SFA and a new rival association , Hallamshire F.A. The former , led by Charles Clegg , also fought a losing battle against the onset of professionalism . By the middle of the decade several local clubs , including Sheffield and Hallam F.C. , were in financial trouble . 
 The four national associations of the UK met in 1882 with a view to creating a common set of laws . They created of the International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) , which first met in 1886 . The IFAB 's role was further affirmed when Fédération Internationale de Football Association adopted their laws upon its formation in 1904 . They have remained in sole charge of the rules ever since . 
 = = Innovations = = 
 Sheffield teams created the first goals with solid crossbars . Heading , throw @-@ ins , corner kicks and awarding free kicks for fouls were also conceived in Sheffield games . One of the most enduring rules of the Sheffield game prevented a goal from being scored directly from a free kick or throw in / kick in . This was present in every version of the Sheffield Rules and was later adopted within the FA rules . It was later refined by the International Football Association Board into the modern @-@ day indirect free kick . 
 The aerial game was also developed within the Sheffield game . While causing much amusement when the side visited London in 1866 , the header would become an important feature of the national game . This was linked to the abolition of the fair catch in the same year that prevented all use of the hands by outfield players . 
 The 1862 rules also introduced a half @-@ time at which the teams would swap ends . Initially this was only if the game was scoreless as the teams would also swap ends if a goal was scored . The rule was changed to a swap at half @-@ time only in 1876 . 
 Early games did not use any on @-@ field officials but disputes between the players would be referred to a committee member . Umpires were introduced by the end of 1862 . Two umpires were used ; one from each club . The off @-@ field referee was introduced for the <unk> Cup in 1867 and entered the rulebook by 1871 . The umpires would then appeal to the referee on behalf of their team . The concept was later introduced to the FA game and persisted until 1891 when the referee moved onto the pitch and the umpires became linesmen . The umpire 's flag was first suggested by Charles Clegg at a Sheffield FA meeting in 1874 . 
 The innovative streak within Sheffield remained after the demise of their own rules . On 15 October 1878 a crowd of 20 @,@ 000 watched the first floodlit match at Bramall Lane . The exhibition match was set up to test the use of the lights and was played between specially selected teams captained by the brothers William and Charles Clegg . William Clegg 's team won 2 – 0 . The experiment was repeated a month later at the Oval . 
 The concept of a penalty goal for fouls within 2 yards ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) of the goal was suggested at a Sheffield FA meeting in 1879 . The penalty would eventually make it into the rules by 1892 . Sheffield players developed the ' screw shot ' in the late 1870s . This gave players the ability to bend the shot into the net , a technique now common in the game . 
 The Sheffield rules instigated the throw in of the ball at right angles by the opposite side to the one that played it into touch 
 = = Influence = = 
 Many of the rules in the Sheffield game were adopted by and are still featured in today ’ s association game . Twelve changes were made to the FA code between 1863 and 1870 , of which eight were taken from Sheffield Rules . During this period the Sheffield FA had significant influence over the FA and encouraged it to continue when it was close to collapse in 1867 . The corner kick was adopted by the FA in 1872 and they restricted handling of the ball to the goalkeeper 's own half in 1873 . In the final negotiations between Sheffield and London the latter agreed to allow throw @-@ ins in any direction in exchange . 
 During the 1860s Sheffield and London were the dominant football cultures in England . However , while London was fragmented by the different codes used , by 1862 the rules of Sheffield F.C. had become the dominant code in Sheffield . Nottingham Forest adopted the Sheffield code in 1867 and the Birmingham and Derbyshire FAs became affiliated with Sheffield , adopting its code , in 1876 . Most clubs in the north and midlands were playing by the Sheffield Rules while FA Rules dominated south of Birmingham . 
 There is circumstantial evidence that the rules also influenced Australian rules football conceived a couple of years later . The two codes shared the unique feature of lacking the offside rule . There are also similarities in the laws for kicking off , kick outs , throw @-@ ins and the fair catch . Henry Creswick ( possibly a relative of Nathaniel Creswick ) was born in Sheffield but emigrated to Australia with his brother in 1840 ( the town of Creswick is named after them ) . He moved to Melbourne in 1854 and became involved in the local cricket scene . He played first class cricket for Victoria during the 57 – 58 season alongside three of the founders of Melbourne Football Club including Tom Wills , the man credited with creating the original rules . 
 Despite the loss of their own rules Sheffield remained the centre of the footballing world until the onset of professionalism . The association matches versus London were considered only equalled in importance to the England v Scotland international and FA Cup Final . Sheffield born Charles Clegg became chairman of the Football Association in 1890 leading it until his death in 1937 . In the process he became the longest serving FA chairman and earned the nickname The Napoleon of Football . 
 = = Formations , positioning and passing = = 
 Early games involved varying numbers of players . Games could also be played with uneven numbers on each side either because some failed to show or one side offered a handicap . The first match between Sheffield and Hallam involved 16 players versus 20 . Games predominantly involved larger numbers than used in the modern games . In October 1863 , Sheffield declared that it would only play 11 a side matches . Despite this it continued to do so on occasions . By 1867 the vast majority of matches in Sheffield involved teams of between 11 and 14 . 
 One of the first positions to develop within the code was referred to as the kick through . The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed because of the lack of an offside rule . The job of the man playing in the kick through position was to remain near to the opposition 's goal and wait for a through ball , a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging . By 1871 this position had become modern @-@ day forwards . Cover goals developed in opposition of kick throughs . Despite their name their job was to man mark the kick through . 
 According to CW Alcock , Sheffield provided the first evidence of the modern passing style In October 1863 , Sheffield declared that it would only play 11 a side <unk> known as the Combination Game . As early as January 1865 Sheffield FC was associated with scoring a goal through " scientific movements " against Nottingham A contemporary match report of November 1865 notes " We cannot help recording the really scientific play with which the Sheffield men backed each other up " Combination play by Sheffield players is also suggest in 1868 : " a remarkably neat and quick piece of play on the part of K Smith , Denton and J Knowles resulted in a goal for Sheffield , the final kick being given by J. Knowles " Contemporary proof of passing occurs from at least January 1872 . In January 1872 the following account is given against Derby : " W. Orton , by a specimen of careful play , running the ball up in close proximity to the goal , from which it was returned to J. Marsh , who by a fine straight shot kicked it through " This play taking place " in close proximity to the goal " suggests a short pass and the " return " of the ball to Marsh suggests that this was the second of two passes . This account also goes onto describe other interesting early tactics : " This goal was supplemented by one of T. Butler 's most successful expositions of the art of corkscrew play and deceptive tactics which had the effect of exciting the <unk> of the spectators " Similarly the following contemporary account of passing comes from January 1872 : " the only goal scored in the match was obtained by Sheffield , owing to a good run up the field by Steel , who passed it judiciously to Matthews , and the latter , by a good straight kick , landed it through the goal out of reach of the custodian " . This match ( against Notts ) also provided contemporary evidence of " good dribbling and kicking " particularly by W.E. Clegg . The condition of the ground , however , " militated against a really scientific exhibition " , suggesting that at other times their play was even more " scientific " . Their play in March 1872 was described as " speed , pluck and science of no mean order " 
 Before the introduction of the crossbar , teams could play without a goalkeeper . The first reference to a goalkeeper appears in the report of the Battle of Bramall Lane in 1862 . The position , however , was used as an alternative to sending off a player . Although a recognised position goalkeeper sometimes was also referred to in the rules as the player nearest their own goal ( allowing him the luxury of handling the ball ) . Unlike its FA counterpart Sheffield Rules never restricted handling to one designated player . Despite this by the 1870s teams usually featured a single player in the position . 
 The match between the Sheffield FA and the FA that took place in December 1871 is notable for evidence of the development of several new positions . As well as the first mention of forwards , sides ( now called wingers ) were also mentioned . The rest of the team made up the midfield . The Half backs ( referred to as centre backs in the modern game ) were mentioned a year later . By the mid @-@ 1870s it was common to use one goalkeeper assisted by two cover goals and two half backs . The attack was made up of five midfielders and one forward . This produced the 2 – 2 – 5 – 1 formation .

 Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest are considered both founders of Sheffield F.C. and creators of the code they adhered to . They continued to have a strong presence at the club , both being members of the committee . It was Creswick , however , who exerted more influence over the rules in his position of Honorary Secretary and Treasurer . 
 John Shaw was originally a member of Sheffield Club . However another member , Thomas Vickers , also founded their main rivals , Hallam F.C. He also became the vice @-@ president of the Sheffield FA upon its formation and president from 1869 to 1885 . In this role he organised many of its first inter @-@ association matches and was involved in the eventual merger of the Sheffield Rule into the national game . 
 John Charles Clegg ( better known as just Charles ) became a massive influence on the national as well as the local game . As a player he was involved in the first inter @-@ association match and became the first Sheffield @-@ based player to be capped ( gaining his only cap in the first international ) . He went on to become president of both the city 's professional sides ( playing a large part in the creation of Sheffield United ) and held the same position at Sheffield and Hallamshire FA having overseen the merger of the two rival local FAs . He then moved on to national prominence when he became chairman of the FA in 1890 and president in 1923 . He held both positions until his death in 1937 . 
 Although not directly involved with Sheffield football , Charles Alcock had a major role in relations between the local and London associations . He acted as a go between encouraging the FA to accept rules from the Sheffield Rules . When the FA declined an inter @-@ association match in Sheffield on the grounds that they could not play under Sheffield Rules it fell to Alcock to organise a team of London players to fulfil the fixture . The success of the match led to it becoming a regular event in the following years . 
 = Thin Man ( nuclear bomb ) = 
 " Thin Man " was the codename for a proposed plutonium gun @-@ type nuclear bomb using plutonium @-@ 239 which the United States was developing during the Manhattan Project . Its development was aborted when it was discovered that the spontaneous fission rate of their nuclear @-@ reactor @-@ bred plutonium was too high for use in a gun @-@ type design , due to the too high concentration of the isotope plutonium @-@ 240 . 
 = = Early decisions = = 
 In 1942 , prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic research , Robert Oppenheimer held conferences in Chicago in June and Berkeley , California , in July at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues . A gun @-@ type design was chosen , in which two sub @-@ critical masses would be brought together by firing a " bullet " into a " target " . The idea of an implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon was suggested by Richard Tolman but attracted scant consideration . 
 Oppenheimer , reviewing his options in early 1943 , gave priority to the gun @-@ type weapon , but as a hedge against the threat of pre @-@ detonation , he created the E @-@ 5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion . Implosion @-@ type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb , because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely . It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort , since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved . It was assumed that the uranium gun @-@ type bomb could be more easily adapted from it . 
 The gun @-@ type and implosion @-@ type designs were codenamed " Thin Man " and " Fat Man " projects respectively . These code names were created by Robert Serber , a former student of Oppenheimer 's who worked on the Manhattan Project . He chose them based on their design shapes ; the " Thin Man " would be a very long device , and the name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel The Thin Man and series of movies by the same name . The " Fat Man " bomb would be round and fat and was named after Sydney Greenstreet 's character in The Maltese Falcon . " Little Boy " would come last and be named only to contrast to the " Thin Man " bomb . 
 = = Development = = 
 Oppenheimer assembled a team at the Los Alamos Laboratory to work on plutonium gun design that included senior engineer Edwin McMillan and senior physicists Charles Critchfield and Joseph Hirschfelder . Critchfield had been working with <unk> , which Oppenheimer believed would be required by the Thin Man to achieve the high muzzle velocities that critical assembly would require . Hirschfelder had been working on internal ballistics . Oppenheimer led the design effort himself until June 1943 , when Navy Captain William Sterling Parsons arrived and took over the Ordnance and Engineering Division and direct management of the " Thin Man " project . 
 These four created and tested all the elements of the Thin Man design between April 1943 and August 1944 . Parsons , who had developed the proximity fuze for the Navy , ran the division , and handled liaison with other agencies . As the head of the E @-@ 6 Projectile , Target , and Source Group , Critchfield calculated critical masses , and instituted a system of live testing with scale models using 20 mm cannon and 3 @-@ inch guns . While full @-@ scale Thin Man tubes took months to produce , these were readily and easily obtained . It was not possible to conduct tests with plutonium , as it was not yet available . Indeed , the actual physical characteristics of the metal were little more than educated guesses at this time . 
 Hirschfelder headed the E @-@ 8 Interior Ballistics Group . His group performed mathematical calculations , but he also had to identify a suitable powder , igniter , and primer . His group conducted full @-@ scale tests with their selections . Fixing the physical size of the bomb proved important when it came to selecting a suitable aircraft to carry it . The E @-@ 8 group estimated the muzzle velocity of the gun at around 3 @,@ 000 feet per second ( 910 m / s ) , close to the maximum achievable in 1944 , and calculated that the pressure in the barrel would be up to 75 @,@ 000 pounds per square inch ( 520 @,@ 000 kPa ) . 
 Although the weapon 's designers thought that simply bringing a critical mass together would be sufficient , Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator . A polonium @-@ 210 @-@ beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140 @-@ day half life , which allowed it to be stockpiled , and it could be obtained from naturally @-@ occurring ores from Port Hope , Ontario . Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge , Tennessee or , when they became available , the reactors at the Hanford Site .

 The " Thin Man " design was an early nuclear weapon design proposed before plutonium had been successfully bred in a nuclear reactor from the irradiation of uranium @-@ 238 . It was assumed that plutonium , like uranium @-@ 235 , could be assembled into a critical mass by a gun @-@ type method , which simply involved shooting one sub @-@ critical piece into another . To avoid pre @-@ detonation or " fizzle " , the plutonium " bullet " would need to be accelerated to a speed of at least 3 @,@ 000 feet per second ( 910 m / s ) — or else the fission reaction would begin before the assembly was complete , blowing the device apart prematurely . 
 Thin Man was 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) long , with a 38 @-@ inch ( 97 cm ) wide tail and nose assemblies , and a 23 @-@ inch ( 58 cm ) midsection . The length was necessary for the plutonium " bullet " to pick up adequate speed before reaching the " target " . Weight was around 8 @,@ 000 pounds ( 3 @,@ 600 kg ) for the final weapon model . There was only one aircraft in the Allied inventory that could carry a Thin Man unmodified : the British Avro Lancaster . However , the American Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress could be modified to carry it by removing part of the main wing spar and some oxygen tanks located between its two bomb bays .

 The great length of the " Thin Man " bomb led to aerodynamic instabilities . <unk> models of the bomb were dropped from a Grumman TBF Avenger at the US Navy test range at Dahlgren , Virginia starting in August , 1943 . The bombs would spin sideways after being dropped , and broke up when they hit the ground . 
 Twenty @-@ four drops were carried out in March 1944 before tests were discontinued so that improvements could be made to Thin Man . The bombs failed to release immediately , frustrating calibration tests . In what turned out to be the last test flight of the series on 16 March , a Thin Man was prematurely released while the B @-@ 29 was still en route to the test range and fell onto the bomb bay doors , severely damaging the test aircraft . The modified glider mechanisms used to suspend the bomb in the bomb bay had caused all four malfunctions , due to the great weight of the bombs . They were replaced with British Type G single @-@ point attachments and Type F releases as used on the Lancaster to carry the 12 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 5 @,@ 400 kg ) Tallboy bomb .

 The feasibility of a plutonium bomb had been questioned in 1942 . James Conant heard on 14 November from Wallace Akers , the director of the British Tube Alloys project , that James Chadwick had " concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities . " Conant consulted Ernest Lawrence and Arthur Compton , who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the problem , but could offer no ready solution . Conant informed the director of the Manhattan Project , Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence , Compton , Oppenheimer , and McMillan to examine the issue . The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome by requiring higher purity . 
 In April 1944 , experiments by Emilio G. Segrè and his P @-@ 5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor @-@ produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site showed that it contained impurities in the form of the isotope plutonium @-@ 240 . This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium @-@ 239 . The cyclotron @-@ produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium @-@ 240 . Its inclusion in reactor @-@ bred plutonium appeared unavoidable . This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass . The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber . The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task . 
 The impracticability of a gun @-@ type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on July 17 , 1944 . All gun @-@ type work in the Manhattan Project was directed at the Little Boy enriched uranium gun design , and almost all of the research at the Los Alamos Laboratory was re @-@ oriented around the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb . 
 = Code of Vengeance = 
 Code of Vengeance is the umbrella title for a series of American television programs , produced by Universal Television , that aired on NBC in 1985 and 1986 . Charles Taylor stars as David Dalton , a Vietnam veteran who has become a drifter , travelling across the United States in a camper van with only his dog for company . Dalton gets involved in the personal lives of the people he meets and uses his fighting skills to help them win justice . 
 The Dalton character was created for All That Glitters , a planned spin @-@ off series from Knight Rider , and a backdoor pilot aired as a second @-@ season episode of that series in 1984 . The character , originally a suave government agent , was retooled as a lone drifter for a new pilot , which aired as the television movie Code of Vengeance , to surprise ratings success in June 1985 . A subsequent series , to be called Dalton , was ordered by NBC for midseason , then production was cancelled after just four episodes were completed . These aired in the summer of 1986 as a television movie titled Dalton : Code of Vengeance II and as a part of a fill @-@ in series called Dalton 's Code of Vengeance .

 The David Dalton character was originally created by writer Robert Foster and executive producer Glen A. Larson for a proposed series titled All That Glitters . The show 's two @-@ hour backdoor pilot aired on April 8 , 1984 , as a special double @-@ length episode of Knight Rider titled " Mouth of the Snake " . The production featured Charles Taylor as David Dalton , an action @-@ oriented government agent , and Joanna Pettet as Joanna St. John , the widow of a murdered lawyer , fighting crime and accepting secret missions from Archibald Hendley ( played by George Murdock ) on behalf of the United States Department of Justice . In this pilot episode , Dalton and St. John work with Knight Rider stars Michael Knight ( David Hasselhoff ) and KITT ( voice of William Daniels ) to locate Eduardo O 'Brien ( Pedro Armendáriz , Jr . ) , a master criminal who has stolen a prototype rocket launcher . 
 This backdoor pilot was written by Robert Gilmer and Robert Foster , directed by Winrich Kolbe , and produced by Robert Gilmer , Gian Grimaldi , and Tom Greene . Cinematography was handled by H. John Penner with art direction by Russell Smith and music by Don Peake . Both Glen A. Larson and Robert Foster were credited as executive producers on the project . 
 Noting the limited roles of Michael and KITT in the episode , the authors of Knight Rider Legacy state that " [ m ] any fans consider this to be one of the worst episodes of Knight Rider ever produced during its four @-@ year run " and that it posted a season @-@ low in the Nielsen ratings .

 NBC commissioned a second pilot starring Charles Taylor , Code of Vengeance , for the 1985 pilot season . The new pilot reimagined David Dalton as a flashback @-@ prone Vietnam veteran who drifts across the country , encountering people in trouble , and helping them to find justice with his unique fighting skills . The physical agility , acrobatic skill , and martial arts expertise that Dalton displayed in " Mouth of the Snake " was toned down to a simpler , more violent fighting style . The reviewer for the Associated Press described Dalton as " a modern version of Shane " that 's also " like Highway to Heaven " but with Dalton using " his fists rather than good deeds " to solve problems . Dalton travels from place to place in a camper van with only his German Shepherd named " Wichita " for company . 
 In this second pilot , Dalton is a " mysterious stranger " who arrives in a small town in Arizona where he meets Nadine Flowers , a young mother ( played by Erin Gray ) , her son A.J. ( Chad Allen ) , and her mother Ione ( Lenka Peterson ) . Nadine hires Dalton to complete an addition to her house left undone after her brother disappeared while hunting . When the brother turns up dead under suspicious circumstances , Dalton investigates then sets out to avenge the brother 's murder . This act of justice entangles him in a conflict between warring rival drug smugglers and gun runners along the border between Arizona and Mexico . Other prominent cast members included Charles Haid as " Jim Blanton " , Keenan Wynn as " Willis " , Randall " Tex " Cobb as " Willard Singleton " , and Joe Dorsey as " Chief Milford <unk> " . In a nod to the show 's origins , Keenan Wynn 's character is shown watching a Knight Rider episode , with KITT 's voice clearly audible , as armed thugs surround his home . The teleplay was written by Robert Foster with Duke Callaghan and Thomas Del Ruth splitting cinematography duties under director Rick Rosenthal . Robert Foster served as executive producer and the pilot was produced by Universal Television . 
 NBC also declined to pick up this pilot as a series and shelved the film to be burned off during the summer of 1985 . The pilot was eventually aired on June 30 , 1985 , as the NBC Sunday Night Movie , opposite a new two @-@ hour special episode of Call to Glory starring Craig T. Nelson .

 Promoted as being " in the tradition of Rambo " and airing just weeks after Rambo : First Blood Part II was released to theaters , the Code of Vengeance telemovie was a surprise ratings success . Code of Vengeance tied an episode of the popular sitcom Family Ties as the second @-@ highest rated show of the week . Swayed by these numbers , NBC ordered six one @-@ hour episodes as a midseason replacement series . The October 1985 announcement noted that the new series was to be titled Dalton . 
 The series , described by its lead actor as having " two stars — the landscape and Dalton " , began filming in several locations across the United States . While the plan was to film two episodes in each location , the production was troubled by weather as flash flooding delayed filming in Houston and a hurricane hit while filming in New Orleans . 
 = = = Shut down = = = 
 Originally slated for a January 1986 debut , Dalton struggled with script and production issues that delayed its debut indefinitely . Unhappy with what they had seen so far , NBC ordered a suspension of production in December 1985 after just four episodes had been filmed . Scheduled to resume filming in Los Angeles in January 1986 after a holiday break , the network instead ended production on Dalton entirely and in early February ordered Universal Television to re @-@ edit these four completed episodes into two feature @-@ length movies . These " movie of the week " presentations were to be called Code of Vengeance II and Code of Vengeance III . 
 = = = Movie of the week = = = 
 The first of these two @-@ hour presentations , now titled Dalton : Code of Vengeance II , aired as the NBC Sunday Night Movie on Sunday , May 11 , 1986 . Combining episodes written by Luther Murdock and Aiken Woodruff , Dalton : Code of Vengeance II found Dalton travelling first to Houston , Texas , to help friend Jeanne Bennett ( played by Karen Landry ) locate her husband — his former commanding officer , Major Monty Bennett ( Donnelly Rhodes ) . When he discovers that Major Bennett is now aiding the New Patriots , a conservative paramilitary group of Vietnam veterans bent on overthrowing the United States government , he sets off for the Florida Everglades to stop them . The New Patriots ' plan is to commit acts of domestic terrorism while framing an Arab group for the atrocities in the belief that this will allow them to seize control of the government they feel betrayed them in Vietnam . Ultimately , Dalton confronts his former commander in the swamp and , after a long and unexplained flashback sequence of combat in Vietnam , Dalton stops both his commander and the group 's plans . 
 This Universal Television movie was produced by Herman Miller , edited by Lawrence J. <unk> , scored by Don Peake , and Jack Priestley was the cinematographer . Gary A. Lee handled art direction and , with creator Robert Foster no longer involved , Lou Shaw was the only credited executive producer . Direction of the combined feature edit of these two episodes , filmed on location in Houston , Texas , and Jacksonville , Florida , is credited pseudonymously to Alan Smithee . Other prominent roles in the movie included Ed Bruce as " Sheriff Johnson " , Alex Harvey as " Sheriff Willoughby " , Mitch Pileggi as " <unk> " , Shannon Stein as " Tip Bennett " , Belinda J. Montgomery as " Libby Holland " , and William Sanderson as " Bobby Fuller " . 
 Critical reaction to this iteration of the Dalton saga was sharp . Drew <unk> , reviewing the movie for Newsday , called it " claptrap " and that " action [ ... ] is all that this NBC stinker has to offer " . Faye Zuckerman of the Gainesville Sun called Dalton : Code of Vengeance II a " <unk> " , complaining that " this film insults its predecessor " . Chicago Sun @-@ Times reviewer Daniel Ruth gave Dalton : Code of Vengeance II a half @-@ star review calling it " revisionist " , " distasteful " , and " terrible television " . <unk> the film as " poorly written , badly acted , sloppily directed and choppily edited " , he called it " another slap in the face of the men and women who went to Southeast Asia to do a dirty job and came home to even dirtier exploitation " . Ruth concluded , " The viewer 's best " Code of Vengeance " would be to reject these films . " 
 Dalton : Code of Vengeance II also failed to deliver the high ratings of its predecessor . Against stiff competition from the final installment of ABC 's top @-@ rated North and South , Book II miniseries , the movie failed to crack the top 20 in that week 's Nielsen ratings . Faced with critical and commercial failure , NBC scrapped plans to air Code of Vengeance III and the fate of the unseen episodes became uncertain . 
 = = = Replacement series = = = 
 In the summer of 1986 , NBC was doing quite well in the ratings with its Thursday night lineup but was still experimenting on other nights . One such experiment was the anthology series The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents featuring new stories introduced by colorized vintage footage of Alfred Hitchcock . After just one season on the network , the show was cancelled abruptly after the July 20 , 1986 , airing of two repeat episodes placed 55th for the week in the Nielsen ratings against 5th @-@ rated Murder , She Wrote on CBS . Needing an inexpensive replacement on short notice as a fill @-@ in until the 1986 @-@ 87 television season started in September , NBC began airing one @-@ hour episodes of Dalton , re @-@ titled Dalton 's Code of Vengeance , in a four @-@ episode limited run beginning on July 27 , 1986 . 
 The first one @-@ hour episode of Dalton 's Code of Vengeance to air was " Rustler 's Moon " , one of the two previously @-@ unaired hours . Dalton is on his way to Houston when he meets a " feisty rancher " named Rhonda Jo ( played by Susan Walden ) and is forced to deal out his unique brand of justice against cattle rustlers trying to steal her prize bull and do her harm . Other prominent roles included Larry Drake as " Jack Ferguson " , Paul Carr as " Elliot " , Chris Douridas as " Willy " , and a special appearance by country music star Mickey Gilley as himself . As with the previous presentation , this episode 's direction was credited to Alan Smithee . 
 With little notice or promotion , advance critical reaction was scant . One reviewer noted that star Charles Taylor " has the bod for " an adventure hero while another opined that he thought " Knight Rider or The A @-@ Team or Jonathan of Highway to Heaven took care of these baddies on their series " . The debut episode placed 51st for the week , just behind a rerun of <unk> , with 7 @.@ 3 ratings points in the Nielsen ratings . The following week , the timeslot was filled by the special Motown Returns to the Apollo hosted by Bill Cosby . 
 The original two @-@ hour Code of Vengeance television movie was split into two one @-@ hour segments and repeated in two parts as episodes of Dalton 's Code of Vengeance . Part one aired on August 10 , 1986 , and part two aired on August 17 , 1986 . The first part placed 48th for the week , rated just behind a rerun of The A @-@ Team . The second part also placed 48th for the week with 8 @.@ 1 ratings points and was seen in an estimated 7 million homes , just one @-@ fifth of the 35 million that tuned in for this film 's 1985 debut . 
 The final airing of Dalton 's Code of Vengeance was the final previously @-@ unaired hour , an episode titled " The Last Hold Out " , which aired on August 24 , 1986 . Dalton arrives in New Orleans and finds himself the only hope for produce wholesaler Ray Bechet ( played by <unk> Ward ) and his wife Rose Bechet ( Maureen <unk> ) being pressured to sell their property by powerful real estate developer Johnson Lee ( Jeff Jensen ) . Prominent guest roles included Barry <unk> as " Fante " . This final episode placed 43rd for the week with 10 @.@ 0 ratings points and a 19 ratings share . This rating was good enough to tie pre @-@ season National Football League games on both CBS and ABC but not enough to make NBC consider reviving the Dalton character yet again .

 The double @-@ length second @-@ season Knight Rider episode " Mouth of the Snake " , the All That Glitters backdoor pilot , was released on DVD in April 2005 by Universal Home Video as part of the Knight Rider : Season Two set .

 The novel Knight Rider : The 24 @-@ Carat Assassin , published in September 1984 by Target Books and credited to Glen A. Larson & Roger Hill , was an adaptation of the " Mouth of the Snake " episode . The back cover of the book names the adapted episode as " All That Glitters " , the working title for the episode and the name of the proposed series that would have featured the David Dalton character . As in the episode , Dalton and St. John are the principal characters with Michael Knight and KITT making only token appearances . Of the five official English language Knight Rider tie @-@ in novels , The 24 @-@ Carat Assassin was one of two released in the United Kingdom that was never released in the United States . The novel was translated into German by Carla <unk> and published by Bertelsmann in Germany in 1988 as Ein <unk> Killer . 
 = Betty Shabazz = 
 Betty Shabazz ( May 28 , 1934 – June 23 , 1997 ) , born Betty Dean Sanders and also known as Betty X , was an American educator and civil rights advocate . She was the wife of Malcolm X. 
 Shabazz grew up in Detroit , Michigan , where her foster parents largely sheltered her from racism . She attended the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama , where she had her first encounters with racism . Unhappy with the situation in Alabama , she moved to New York City , where she became a nurse . It was in New York that she met Malcolm X and , in 1956 , joined the Nation of Islam . The couple married in 1958 . 
 Along with her husband , Shabazz left the Nation of Islam in 1964 . She witnessed his assassination the following year . Left with the responsibility of raising six daughters as a single mother , Shabazz pursued a higher education , and went to work at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn , New York . 
 Following the arrest of her daughter Qubilah for allegedly conspiring to murder Louis Farrakhan , Shabazz took in her young grandson Malcolm . He set a fire in her apartment that caused severe burns to Shabazz . Shabazz died three weeks later as a result of her injuries . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Betty Dean Sanders was born on May 28 , 1934 , to Ollie Mae Sanders and <unk> Sandlin . Sandlin was 21 years old and Ollie Mae Sanders was a teenager ; the couple was unmarried . Throughout her life , Betty Sanders maintained that she had been born in Detroit , Michigan , but early records — such as her high @-@ school and college transcripts — show Pinehurst , Georgia , as her place of birth . Authorities in Georgia and Michigan have not been able to locate her birth certificate . 
 By most accounts , Ollie Mae Sanders abused Betty Sanders , whom she was raising in Detroit . When Betty was about 11 years old , she was taken in by Lorenzo and Helen Malloy , a prominent businessman and his wife . Helen Malloy was a founding member of the Housewives League of Detroit , a group of African @-@ American women who organized campaigns to support black @-@ owned businesses and boycott stores that refused to hire black employees . She was also a member of the National Council of Negro Women and the NAACP . The Malloys were both active members of their local Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church . 
 Despite their lessons on black self @-@ reliance , the Malloys never spoke with Sanders about racism . Looking back in 1995 , Shabazz wrote : " Race relations were not discussed and it was hoped that by denying the existence of race problems , the problems would go away . Anyone who openly discussed race relations was quickly viewed as a ' troublemaker . ' " Still , two race riots during her childhood — in 1942 when the Sojourner Truth housing project was desegregated , and one the following year on Belle Isle — made up what Shabazz later called the " psychological background for my formative years " . 
 = = Young adult years = = 
 After she graduated from high school , Sanders left her foster parents ' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute ( now Tuskegee University ) , a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy 's alma mater . She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher . When she left Detroit to go to Alabama , her foster mother stood at the train station crying . Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something , but the words would not come out . By the time she arrived in Alabama , she felt she knew what her stepmother was saying . " The minute I got off that train , I knew what she was trying to say . She was trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism . " 
 Nothing had prepared Sanders for Southern racism . So long as she stayed on campus , she could avoid interacting with white people , but weekend trips into Montgomery , the nearest city , would try her patience . Black students had to wait until every white person in a store had been helped before the staff would serve them — if they received any service at all . When she complained to the Malloys , they refused to discuss the issue ; in a 1989 interview , Shabazz summarized their attitude as " if you 're just quiet it will go away . " 
 Sanders ' studies suffered as a result of her growing frustration . She decided to change her field of study from education to nursing . The dean of nursing , Lillian Harvey , encouraged Sanders to consider studying in a Tuskegee @-@ affiliated program at the Brooklyn State College School of Nursing in New York City . Against her foster parents ' wishes , Sanders left Alabama for New York in 1953 . 
 In New York , Sanders encountered a different form of racism . At Montefiore Hospital , where she performed her clinical training , black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses . White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses . While the racial climate in New York was better than the situation in Alabama , Sanders frequently wondered whether she had merely exchanged Jim Crow racism for a more genteel prejudice . 
 = = = Nation of Islam = = = 
 During her second year of nursing school , Sanders was invited by an older nurse 's aide to a Friday @-@ night dinner party at the Nation of Islam temple in Harlem . " The food was delicious , " Shabazz recalled in 1992 , " I 'd never tasted food like that . " After dinner , the woman asked Sanders to come to the Muslims ' lecture . Sanders agreed . After the speech , the nurse 's aide invited Sanders to join the Nation of Islam ; Sanders politely declined . When the woman asked her why she chose not to join the Nation of Islam after visiting , Sanders replied that she did not know she had been brought there to join . " Besides , my mother would kill me , and additionally I don ’ t even understand the philosophy . " The Malloys were Methodists , and when she was 13 , Sanders had decided she would remain a Methodist for the rest of her life . 
 The nurse 's aide told Sanders about her minister , who was not at the temple that night : " Just wait until you hear my minister talk . He 's very disciplined , he 's good @-@ looking , and all the sisters want him . " Sanders enjoyed the food so much , she agreed to come back and meet the woman 's minister . At the second dinner , the nurse 's aide told her the minister was present and Sanders thought to herself , " Big deal . " In 1992 she recalled how her demeanor changed when she caught a glimpse of Malcolm X : 
 Then , I looked over and saw this man on the extreme right aisle sort of galloping to the podium . He was tall , he was thin , and the way he was galloping it looked as though he was going someplace much more important than the podium . ... He got to the podium — and I sat up straight . I was impressed with him . 
 Sanders met Malcolm X again at a dinner party . The two had a long conversation about Sanders 's life : her childhood in Detroit , the racial hostility she had encountered in Alabama , and her studies in New York . He spoke to her about the condition of African Americans and the causes of racism . Sanders began to see things from a different perspective . " I really had a lot of pent @-@ up anxiety about my experience in the South , " Shabazz recalled in a 1990 interview , " and Malcolm reassured me that it was understandable how I felt . " 
 Soon Sanders was attending all of Malcolm X 's lectures at Temple Number Seven in Harlem . He always sought her out afterwards , and he would ask her a lot of questions . Sanders was impressed with Malcolm X 's leadership and work ethic . She felt he was selfless when it came to helping others , but he had no one to lean on when he needed help . She thought maybe she could be that person . He also began to pressure her to join the Nation of Islam . In mid 1956 , Sanders converted . Like many members of the Nation of Islam , she changed her surname to " X " , which represented the family name of her African ancestors that she could never know . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 Betty X and Malcolm X did not have a conventional courtship . One @-@ on @-@ one dates were contrary to the teachings of the Nation of Islam . Instead , the couple shared their " dates " with dozens , or even hundreds of other members . Malcolm X frequently took groups to visit New York 's museums and libraries , and he always invited Betty X. 
 Although they had never discussed the subject , Betty X suspected that Malcolm X was interested in marriage . One day he called and asked her to marry him , and they were married on January 14 , 1958 , in Lansing , Michigan . By coincidence , Betty X became a licensed nurse on the same day . 
 At first , their relationship followed the Nation of Islam 's strictures concerning marriage ; Malcolm X set the rules and Betty X obediently followed them . In 1969 , Shabazz wrote that " his indoctrination was so thorough , even to me , that it has become a pattern for our [ family 's ] lives . " Over time , the family dynamic changed , as Malcolm X made small concessions to Betty X 's demands for more independence . In 1969 , Shabazz recalled : 
 We would have little family talks . They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he expected of a wife . But the first time I told him what I expected of him as a husband it came as a shock . After dinner one night he said , " Boy , Betty , something you said hit me like a ton of bricks . Here I 've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening . " He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange . 
 The couple had six daughters . Their names were Attallah , born in 1958 and named after Attila the Hun ; Qubilah , born in 1960 and named after Kublai Khan ; Ilyasah , born in 1962 and named after Elijah Muhammad ; <unk> Lumumba , born in 1964 and named after Patrice Lumumba ; and twins , <unk> and <unk> , born in 1965 after their father 's assassination and named for him .

 On March 8 , 1964 , Malcolm X announced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam . He and Betty X , now known as Betty Shabazz , became Sunni Muslims .

 On February 21 , 1965 , in Manhattan 's Audubon Ballroom , Malcolm X began to speak to a meeting of the Organization of Afro @-@ American Unity when a disturbance broke out in the crowd of 400 . As Malcolm X and his bodyguards moved to quiet the disturbance , a man rushed forward and shot Malcolm in the chest with a sawed @-@ off shotgun . Two other men charged the stage and fired handguns , hitting him 16 times . 
 Shabazz was in the audience near the stage with her daughters . When she heard the gunfire , she grabbed the children and pushed them to the floor beneath the bench , where she shielded them with her body . When the shooting stopped , Shabazz ran toward her husband and tried to perform CPR . Police officers and Malcolm X 's associates carried him to a stretcher , and brought him to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital , where he was pronounced dead . 
 Angry onlookers caught and beat one of the assassins , who was arrested on the scene . Eyewitnesses identified two more suspects . All three men , who were members of the Nation of Islam , were convicted and sentenced to life in prison .

 = = = Immediately afterward = = = 
 Shabazz had difficulty sleeping for weeks after Malcolm X 's assassination . She suffered from nightmares in which she relived the death of her husband . She also worried about how she would support herself and her family . The publication of The Autobiography of Malcolm X helped , because Shabazz received half of the royalties . ( Alex Haley , who assisted Malcolm X in writing the book , got the other half . After the publication of his best @-@ seller Roots , Haley signed over his portion of the royalties to Shabazz . ) 
 Actor and activist Ruby Dee and Juanita Poitier ( wife of Sidney Poitier ) established the Committee of Concerned Mothers , to raise funds to buy a house , and pay educational expenses for the Shabazz family . The Committee held a series of benefit concerts at which they raised $ 17 @,@ 000 . They bought a large two @-@ family home in Mount Vernon , New York , from <unk> Bella Abzug . 
 Looking back , Shabazz said she initially made an " unrealistic decision " to isolate herself because of the injustice of her husband 's assassination . She realized , however , that giving up because of her husband ’ s death would not help the world . " It is impossible to create an environment for children to grow in and develop in isolation . It is imperative that one mix in society on some level and at some time . " 
 = = = Pilgrimage to Mecca = = = 
 In late March 1965 , Shabazz made the pilgrimage to Mecca ( Hajj ) , as her husband had the year before . Recalling the experience in 1992 , Shabazz wrote : 
 I really don 't know where I 'd be today if I had not gone to Mecca to make Hajj shortly after Malcolm was assassinated . ... That is what helped put me back on track . ... Going to Mecca , making Hajj , was very good for me because it made me think of all the people in the world who loved me and were for me , who prayed that I would get my life back together . I stopped focusing on the people who were trying to tear me and my family apart . 
 Shabazz returned from Mecca with a new name that a fellow pilgrim had bestowed upon her , <unk> ( meaning " beautiful and radiant " ) . 
 = = = Raising her family = = = 
 Raising six children by herself exhausted Shabazz . Providing for them was difficult as well . Shabazz 's share of the royalties from The Autobiography of Malcolm X was equivalent to an annual salary . In 1966 , she sold the movie rights to the Autobiography to film @-@ maker Marvin Worth . She began to authorize the publication of Malcolm X 's speeches , which provided another source of income . 
 When her daughters were enrolled in day care , Shabazz became an active member of the day care center 's parents organization . In time , she became the parents ' representative on the school board . Several years later , she became president of the Westchester Day Care Council . 
 Shabazz began to accept speaking engagements at colleges and universities . She often spoke about the black nationalist philosophy of Malcolm X , but she also spoke about her role as a wife and mother . Shabazz felt that some of the images of her husband projected by the media were misrepresentations . " They attempted to promote him as a violent person , a hater of whites , " she explained . " He was a sensitive man , a very understanding person and yes , he disliked the behavior of some whites .... He had a reality @-@ based agenda . " 
 As her daughters grew older , Shabazz sent them to private schools and summer camps . They joined Jack and Jill , a social club for the children of well @-@ off African Americans . 
 = = = Advanced education = = = 
 In late 1969 , Shabazz enrolled at Jersey City State College ( now New Jersey City University ) to complete the degree in education she left behind when she became a nurse . She completed her undergraduate studies in one year , and decided to earn a master 's degree in health administration . In 1972 , Shabazz enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to pursue an <unk> in higher education administration and curriculum development . For the next three years , she drove from Mount Vernon to Amherst , Massachusetts , every Monday morning , and returned home Wednesday night . In July 1975 , she defended her dissertation and earned her doctorate . 
 Shabazz joined Delta Sigma Theta in April 1974 . 
 = = = Medgar Evers College = = = 
 In January 1976 , Shabazz became associate professor of health sciences with a concentration in nursing at New York 's Medgar Evers College . The student body at Medgar Evers was 90 percent black and predominantly working @-@ class , with an average age of 26 . Black women made up most of the faculty , and 75 percent of the students were female , two @-@ thirds of them mothers . These were all qualities that made Medgar Evers College attractive to Shabazz . 
 By 1980 , Shabazz was overseeing the health sciences department , and the college president decided she could be more effective in a purely administrative position than she was in the classroom . She was promoted to Director of Institutional Advancement . In her new position , she became a booster and fund @-@ raiser for the college . A year later , she was given tenure . In 1984 , Shabazz was given a new title , Director of Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs ; she held that position at the college until her death . 
 = = = Volunteerism = = = 
 During the 1970s and 1980s , Shabazz continued her volunteer activities . In 1975 , President Ford invited her to serve on the American Revolution Bicentennial Council . Shabazz served on an advisory committee on family planning for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . In 1984 , she hosted the New York convention of the National Council of Negro Women . Shabazz became active in the NAACP and the National Urban League . When Nelson and Winnie Mandela visited Harlem during 1990 , Shabazz was asked to introduce Winnie Mandela . 
 Shabazz befriended Myrlie Evers @-@ Williams , the widow of Medgar Evers , and Coretta Scott King , the widow of Martin Luther King , Jr . They had the common experience of losing their activist husbands at a young age and raising their children as single mothers . The press came to refer to the three , who made numerous joint public appearances , as the " Movement widows " . Evers @-@ Williams and King were frequent guests at Medgar Evers College , and Shabazz occasionally visited the King Center in Atlanta . Writing about Shabazz , Evers @-@ Williams described her as a " free spirit , in the best sense of the word . When she laughed , she had this beauty ; when she smiled , it lit up the whole room . " 
 = = Louis Farrakhan = = 
 For many years , Shabazz harbored resentment toward the Nation of Islam — and Louis Farrakhan in particular — for what she felt was their role in the assassination of her husband . Farrakhan seemed to boast of the assassination in a 1993 speech : 
 Was Malcolm your traitor or ours ? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor , what the hell business is it of yours ? A nation has to be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats . 
 In a 1994 interview , Gabe Pressman asked Shabazz whether Farrakhan " had anything to do " with Malcolm X 's death . She replied : " Of course , yes . Nobody kept it a secret . It was a badge of honor . Everybody talked about it , yes . " Farrakhan denied the allegations , stating " I never had anything to do with Malcolm 's death " , although he said he had " created an atmosphere that allowed Malcolm to be assassinated . " 
 In January 1995 , Qubilah Shabazz was charged with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in retaliation for the murder of her father . Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah , saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted . That May , Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah 's legal defense . Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two , but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter . Regardless , nearly $ 250 @,@ 000 was raised that evening . In the aftermath , Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan , although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October . 
 Qubilah accepted a plea agreement with respect to the charges , in which she maintained her innocence but accepted responsibility for her actions . Under the terms of the agreement , she was required to undergo psychological counseling and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse for a two @-@ year period in order to avoid a prison sentence . For the duration of her treatment , Qubilah 's ten @-@ year @-@ old son , Malcolm , was sent to live with Shabazz at her apartment in Yonkers , New York .
