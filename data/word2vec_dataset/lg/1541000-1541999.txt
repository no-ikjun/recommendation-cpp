 That same month , Miyamoto confirmed that Ura Zelda and Zelda : Gaiden were separate projects . It was unclear if Zelda : Gaiden was an offshoot of Ura Zelda or if the two were always separate . Ura Zelda might have become Ocarina of Time Master Quest outside Japan , and was released on a bonus disc for the GameCube given to those who pre @-@ ordered The Wind Waker in the US and bundled with the GameCube game in Europe . 
 In November , Nintendo announced a " Holiday 2000 " release date for Zelda : Gaiden . By March 2000 , what ultimately became the final titles were announced : Zelda no Densetsu <unk> no Kamen in Japan and The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask elsewhere . 
 = = = Technical differences from Ocarina of Time = = = 
 The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask runs on an upgraded version of the engine used in Ocarina of Time and requires the use of the 4 MB Expansion Pak . IGN theorizes this requirement is due to Majora 's Mask 's possible origin as a Nintendo 64DD game , which would necessitate an extra 4 MB of RAM . The use of the Expansion Pak allows for greater draw distances , more accurate dynamic lighting , more detailed texture mapping and animation , complex framebuffer effects such as motion blur , and more characters displayed on @-@ screen . This expanded draw distance allows the player to see much farther and eliminates the need for the fog effect and " cardboard panorama " seen in Ocarina of Time , which were used to obscure distant areas . IGN considered the texture design to be one of the best created for the Nintendo 64 , saying that although some textures have a low resolution , they are " colorful and diverse " , which gives each area " its own unique look " . Lastly , building interiors are rendered in real @-@ time , unlike the fixed 3D display featured in Ocarina of Time . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music was composed by Koji Kondo and Toru Minegishi , and largely consists of reworked music from Ocarina of Time , complemented with other traditional Zelda music such as the " Overworld Theme " and new material . Kondo describes the music as having " an exotic Chinese @-@ opera sound " . As the three @-@ day cycle progresses , the theme song of Clock Town changes between three variations , one for each day . IGN relates the shift in music to a shift in the game 's atmosphere , saying that the quickened tempo of the Clock Town music on the second day conveys a sense of time passing quickly . The soundtrack was released on June 23 , 2000 , featuring 112 tracks from the game over two compact discs . All music was composed by Kondo except three battles tracks , which were written by Minegishi .

 After the release of The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time 3D , a remake of Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 3DS , director Eiji Aonuma suggested that a Majora 's Mask remake was " not an impossibility " , depending on interest and demand . Following this news , a fan campaign called " Operation <unk> " was launched to promote the remake of Majora 's Mask on the 3DS . The campaign name is a reference to a similar fan @-@ based movement , Operation Rainfall , set up to persuade Nintendo of America to release a trio of role @-@ playing video games for the Wii . The petition reached 10 @,@ 000 signatures within five days . In response to the feedback , Nintendo of America released a statement : " At the risk of dampening the excitement you feel , I must be clear that no official announcements have been made regarding a remake of The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask for the Nintendo 3DS . However , we like hearing what our consumers find important . " In an interview with GamesRadar in November 2011 , Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma acknowledged Operation <unk> and told fans that he hopes to respond to their request sometime in the future . At E3 2012 , Miyamoto stated that a 3D remake was still under consideration . Once again , shortly after E3 2013 , Miyamoto commented that the fans supporting a Majora 's Mask 3D remake were " still in his memory " . 
 On November 5 , 2014 , Nintendo announced in its Nintendo Direct presentation that The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask 3D would be released for the Nintendo 3DS in the Northern Hemisphere in spring 2015 . Like Ocarina of Time 3D , the remake features improved character models and stereoscopic 3D graphics , along with altered boss battles and an additional fishing minigame . A special edition featuring a pin badge , double @-@ sided poster , and steelbook , will be released in Europe . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Approximately 314 @,@ 000 copies of The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask were sold during its first week on sale in Japan , ultimately with 3 @.@ 36 million copies sold worldwide . 
 Like its predecessor , the game garnered universal acclaim . Game Informer called the three @-@ day cycle " one of the most inventive premises in all of gaming , " and also stated that " [ w ] ithout question , Majora 's Mask is the finest adventure the Nintendo 64 has to offer . " It is often regarded as the darkest and most original game in The Legend of Zelda series . Edge magazine referred to Majora 's Mask as " the oddest , darkest and saddest of all Zelda games . " Opinions were favorable regarding how the game compares with predecessor Ocarina of Time , often cited as one of greatest video games of all time . N64 Magazine ended their review by saying , " it was told that Majora 's Mask should cower in the shadow of Ocarina of Time . Instead , it shines just as brightly , " awarding the game 96 % . GameSpot said the game was much more difficult than its predecessor . IGN described Majora 's Mask as " The Empire Strikes Back of Nintendo 64 ... it 's the same franchise , but it 's more intelligent , darker , and tells a much better storyline . " GamePro characterized the story as " surreal and spooky , deep , and intriguing " and the game as " living proof that the N64 still has its magic . " It has been ranked the seventh @-@ greatest game by Electronic Gaming Monthly , whereas Ocarina of Time was ranked eighth . Majora 's Mask placed 68th on Game Informer 's " Top 100 Games of All Time " in 2001 and 63rd on their " Top 200 Games of All Time " in 2009 . Nintendo Power rated it the fifteenth @-@ best game on a Nintendo console . The game placed 45th in Official Nintendo Magazine 's 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time . GameFAQs users ranked Majora 's Mask 47th in a list of 100 best games of all @-@ time in 2005 . 
 A common criticism of Majora 's Mask is that it is not as accessible as Ocarina of Time . GameSpot , which awarded Ocarina of Time a 10 / 10 , gave Majora 's Mask an 8 @.@ 3 / 10 , writing that some might " find the focus on minigames and side quests tedious and slightly out of place . " Game Revolution wrote that it " takes a little longer to get into this Zelda " , but also that " there are moments when the game really hits you with all its intricacies and mysteries , and that makes it all worthwhile . " 
 On December 24 , 2010 , Majora 's Mask was voted as the Game of the Decade ( 2000 – 2009 ) by GameFAQs , beating out Super Smash Bros. Brawl , which had beaten The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess two rounds prior . 
 On May 19 , 2011 , in a tournament style competition hosted by IGN , Majora 's Mask was voted the second best Zelda game of all time , behind only Ocarina of Time . It beat Four Swords Adventures in Round 1 , A Link to the Past in Round 2 , and Twilight Princess in Round 3 before losing to Ocarina of Time in the final round . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In 2003 , Nintendo rereleased Majora 's Mask on the GameCube as part of The Legend of Zelda : Collector 's Edition , a special promotional disc which also contained three other The Legend of Zelda games and a twenty @-@ minute demo of The Legend of Zelda : The Wind Waker . This disc came bundled with a GameCube console , as part of a subscription offer to Nintendo Power magazine , or through Nintendo 's official website . The offer expired in early 2004 . 
 Similar to other GameCube rereleases , the games are emulations of the originals by the GameCube hardware . The only differences are minor adjustments to button icons to conform to the GameCube 's controller . Majora 's Mask also boots with a disclaimer that some of the original sounds from the game may cause problems due to their emulation . Aside from these deliberate changes , GameSpot 's Ricardo Torres found that the frame rate " appears choppier " and notes inconstant audio . The GameCube version also features a slightly higher native resolution than its Nintendo 64 counterpart , as well as progressive scan . 
 Majora 's Mask was released on the Wii 's Virtual Console service in Europe and Australia on April 3 , 2009 , and Japan on April 7 , 2009 . It was later released in North America on May 18 , 2009 , and commemorated as the 300th Virtual Console game available for purchase in the region . During January 2012 , Club Nintendo members could download Majora 's Mask onto the Wii Console for 150 coins . A similar deal was offered at the end of Club Nintendo . 
 The 2001 GameCube game Super Smash Bros. Melee features a Majora 's Mask @-@ themed stage , titled " Termina : Great Bay " . 
 = Imperial War Museum Duxford = 
 Imperial War Museum Duxford is a branch of the Imperial War Museum near Duxford in Cambridgeshire , England . Britain 's largest aviation museum , Duxford houses the museum 's large exhibits , including nearly 200 aircraft , military vehicles , artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibition buildings . The site also provides storage space for the museum 's other collections of material such as film , photographs , documents , books and artifacts . The site accommodates several British Army regimental museums , including those of the Parachute Regiment ( named Airborne Assault ) and the Royal Anglian Regiment . 
 Based on the historic Duxford Aerodrome , the site was originally operated by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the First World War . During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany . Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961 . After the Ministry of Defence declared the site surplus to requirements in 1969 the Imperial War Museum received permission to use part of the site for storage . The entirety of the site was transferred to the museum in February 1976 . 
 In keeping with the site 's history many of Duxford 's original buildings , such as hangars used during the Battle of Britain , are still in use . Many of these buildings are of particular architectural or historic significance and over thirty have listed building status , Duxford " retain [ ing ] the best @-@ preserved technical fabric remaining from [ a historic airfield ] up to November 1918 " and being " remarkably well @-@ preserved " . The site also features several purpose @-@ built exhibition buildings , such as the Stirling Prize @-@ winning American Air Museum , designed by Sir Norman Foster . The site remains an active airfield and is used by civilian flying companies , and hosts regular air shows . The site is operated in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society , a charity formed in 1975 to preserve civil aircraft and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history . 
 = = Museum history = = 
 The Imperial War Museum originated during the First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee , formed by the British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire . The museum opened in 1920 , by which point it had been renamed the Imperial War Museum . With the outbreak of the Second World War , the museum 's terms of reference were enlarged to include the conflict . The museum 's terms of reference was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were engaged . The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum 's collections to expand enormously , to the point that many parts of the collection , especially those of aircraft , vehicles and artillery , could not be effectively stored or exhibited . Although the museum 's south London home ( a nineteenth @-@ century building in Southwark which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital ) had been extended in 1966 , by the end of the decade the museum was seeking additional space . 
 RAF Duxford , a Royal Air Force fighter station had been declared surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence in 1969 , and the museum duly requested permission to use part of one of the airfield 's hangars as temporary storage . Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage , which together provided over 9000 m2 of space . Within two years , ten of the museum 's aircraft had been brought to Duxford , and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society . While the museum 's own aircraft were not restored to flying condition , by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973 . Further air shows followed , with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45 @,@ 000 people . The runway was bought by Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977 . The success of these shows provided a valuable source of revenue , and complemented the efforts of volunteers , so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use . Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum . Initially open from March – October , Duxford received 167 @,@ 000 visitors in the 1977 season , and 340 @,@ 000 in 1978 . Two million visitors had been received by 1982 and Duxford welcomed its ten millionth visitor in August 2005 . 
 = = = Duxford aerodrome = = = 
 Duxford has been associated with British military aviation since 1917 , when a site near the village of Duxford , in southern Cambridgeshire , was selected for a new Royal Flying Corps training aerodrome . From 1925 Duxford became a fighter airfield , a role it was to retain until the end of its operational life , and in August 1938 the Duxford @-@ based <unk> Squadron RAF became the first to operate the Supermarine Spitfire . 
 With the outbreak of war in September 1939 Duxford was home to three RAF squadrons engaged on coastal patrol duties . From July 1940 , Duxford saw considerable action during the Battle of Britain as a sector station of RAF Fighter Command 's No. 12 Group . In the middle years of the war Duxford was home to specialist units , such as the tacticians and engineers of the Air Fighting Development Unit . In April 1942 the first Typhoon Wing was formed at Duxford . Notable among the pilots of the Wing was Group Captain John Grandy who would later rise to be Chief of the Air Staff and also served as Chairman of the Trustees of the Imperial War Museum from 1978 to 1989 . 
 In March 1943 the United States Army Air Forces ' 78th Fighter Group started to arrive at Duxford with their Republic P @-@ 47 Thunderbolts . The Group reequipped with North American P @-@ 51 Mustangs in December 1944 and until the end of the war in Europe the Group remained at Duxford carrying out bomber escort and fighter sweeps , ground strafing and ground attack missions . 
 Duxford was officially returned to the RAF on 1 December 1945 . It remained a fighter station but by 1958 changing defence priorities saw the RAF 's fighter force move to more northerly bases . Duxford 's last operational flight was made in July 1961 . No longer operational , the site gradually became increasingly derelict and overgrown . In 1968 the American film studio United Artists obtained permission to use the site for the filming of Battle of Britain . During the shoot a single bay hangar , which had been built during the First World War , was demolished to simulate an air raid . After the Ministry of Defence announced its intention to dispose of Duxford plans were drawn up for various developments including two Young Offenders Institutes but were not implemented . 
 = = Duxford Aviation Society = = 
 Duxford is operated in partnership between the Imperial War Museum , Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society . The Society is a registered charity ( No. <unk> ) and states two objectives ; to educate the public by collecting and exhibiting historic aircraft , military vehicles and boats , and to support the Imperial War Museum . 
 The Society was formed in 1975 from a divergence of members of the East Anglian Aviation Society , which now operates the <unk> Tower Museum at the former RAF <unk> . 
 Duxford Aviation Society preserves and maintains the Civil Aviation Collection . Especially notable aircraft in the collection include a de Havilland Comet which made the first eastbound jet @-@ powered trans @-@ Atlantic passenger flight on 4 October 1958 , and Concorde G @-@ <unk> 101 , a pre @-@ production aircraft which achieved the highest speed of any Concorde , making a westwards trans @-@ Atlantic flight in two hours , 56 minutes . 
 In support of the Museum 's goals , the DAS Military Vehicle Wing provides one of the world 's leading teams of military vehicle restoration engineers The Wing ( or its volunteers ) own some of the vehicles located at Duxford , and provide restoration services for vehicles within the museum 's collection . The team also operate vehicles for demonstrations during the year . The wing 's works have been featured in the Discovery Channel 's Tank Overhaul programme , James May 's 20th Century , and wide variety of magazines and other media . 
 Other elements of the society provide or support a range of functions at the Duxford site , including canteen , aircraft conservation , learning and interpretative activities and administrative tasks . An affiliated group , the Duxford Radio Society , collects , preserves , exhibits , and demonstrates historic military electronic equipment . This is housed in Buildings 177 and 178 , close to the Gibraltar Gun . 
 Since January 1999 , the Society have operated the Friends of Duxford membership scheme with the Museum . 
 As of 2008 , the Duxford Aviation Society had almost 700 volunteer members . 
 = = Air shows and flying = = 
 Duxford remains an active airfield ( IATA : <unk> , ICAO : <unk> ) and maintains two parallel runways ; an unpaved 880 m grass strip , and a concrete runway with a usable length of 1199 m , both oriented at 060 / 240 @-@ degrees . The runway was originally purchased from the Ministry of Defence by the Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977 . In October 2008 , an agreement was reached between the council and the Imperial War Museum , under which the runways and 146 acres ( 0 @.@ 59 km2 ; 0 @.@ 228 sq mi ) of surrounding grassland would be sold to the museum for approximately £ 1 @.@ 6 million . 
 Since 1973 , Duxford has held regular air shows . Duxford is the home of several private aviation companies , such as Classic Wings , The Fighter Collection , the Old Flying Machine Company and The Aircraft Restoration Company . Between them these companies provide pleasure flights , historic aircraft for film or television work , and aircraft restoration services . Perhaps the most notable privately owned and operated aircraft based at Duxford is B @-@ 17 Preservation Ltd 's Sally B , the only airworthy B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress in Europe . 
 Major air shows held regularly include the Duxford Air Show , the Flying Legends show ( organised by The Fighter Collection ) , and American Air Day , which is held in conjunction with units of the Third Air Force ( part of the United States Air Forces in Europe ) , based at nearby RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall . The Duxford Air Show usually exhibits a wide range of aircraft , from vintage warbirds to contemporary jet aircraft , along with aerobatic flying by groups such as the Red <unk> while the Flying Legends show focuses on historic aircraft , especially those of the Second World War . In 2008 it was reported that these displays generate up to £ 1 @.@ 8 million , while the loss of up to £ 100 @,@ 000 due to adverse weather is also budgeted for . The policing bill , necessary to manage the resulting road traffic , was reported as some £ 8 @,@ 000 . Recent major events have included the Battle of Britain 70th Anniversary airshow , held on 4 – 5 September 2010 . The show was attended by more than 40 @,@ 000 people , and featured formation displays by four Hawker Hurricanes and sixteen Spitfires . 
 As an active civil airfield , operations at Duxford are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) . In 2002 a privately operated Aero L @-@ 39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing , overran the runway and came to rest on the M11 motorway , a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level . An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11 . As a result , the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway 's 1500 m declared length , from 1350 m to 1200 m , in order to provide a greater margin of error . 
 As a licensed airfield Duxford has its own Fire Service ( currently five vehicles , and 16 fire fighters / officers ) which operates as part of the Airfield & Security department , the fire service was originally operated by voluntary crews who were part of Duxford Aviation Society , with the training officers coming from Stansted and other local airports , for the last few years it has been a mixed voluntary / full @-@ time operation . 
 = = Site layout = = 
 When originally planned in 1917 , Duxford aerodrome was to occupy a 238 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 96 km2 ; 0 @.@ 372 sq mi ) site divided by what is now the A505 road which runs north @-@ east from Royston to Newmarket . The area north of the road would be occupied by accommodation and administrative buildings with the airfield , hangars and technical buildings on the south side . Still divided by the A505 , the museum 's site is now bounded to the east by the M11 motorway , which meets the A505 adjacent to the museum site at Junction 10 . The construction of the M11 in 1977 forced the shortening of the runway by 300 m . In its role as a museum , the north side of the site is occupied by the Imperial War Museum 's stored collections and is not generally open to the public , while the south side is occupied by various hangars and other historic buildings , purpose @-@ built structures , and by two runways . 
 The south side visitor entrance , which now houses a shop and visitor facilities , was previously the airfield 's armoury . The various buildings are arranged roughly parallel to the A505 ; AirSpace is furthest east , with Hangars 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 running westwards , followed by the American Air Museum and the Land Warfare Hall . The museum site is approximately 1800 m from one end to the other , and a visitor bus operates during opening hours . 
 Some aircraft and other exhibits are displayed externally , such as a Comet tank and replica Hawker Hurricane as gate guardians at the main entrance . Several commercial airliners belonging to the Duxford Aviation Society stand on the runway apron opposite the hangars . A Bloodhound surface @-@ to @-@ air missile stands on the site of the demolished hangar . A United States Air Force F @-@ 15 Eagle stands near the American Air Museum . A Royal Engineers ' Centurion AVRE stands outside the Land Warfare Hall and the Gibraltar Gun , a 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch artillery piece previously emplaced on the Rock of Gibraltar is nearby . 
 As a historic site , many of Duxford 's buildings are of particular architectural or historic significance . In 2005 , following a review of sites relating to British aviation history by English Heritage , some 255 buildings at 31 sites received listed building status . Duxford contains over thirty of these buildings , the largest number at any one site . Listed buildings include three hangars dating back to the First World War and the operations block , which received Grade II * status . This block , open to the public , houses the wartime operations room from which Duxford 's aircraft were directed . Another historic building , the 1918 Watch Office , will be converted to accommodate a new exhibition entitled Historic Duxford . The exhibition , to open in late 2012 , will depict the history of the site and the experiences of Duxford 's personnel . 
 = = AirSpace = = 
 In 2000 , Duxford announced plans for the redevelopment of Hangar 1 , previously known as the ' <unk> ' , which was built in the 1980s . The plans would expand the building by 40 % , providing more display and conservation space , improve internal conditions , and enable the museum 's British and Commonwealth aircraft collection to be brought under cover . Planning permission was received later that year . The project cost £ 25 million and was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund , the East of England Development Agency and BAE Systems , which contributed £ 6 million . The building , which provides 12 @,@ 000 m2 of floor space , consists of an aircraft conservation area , a large exhibition hall , and a mezzanine providing views of the aircraft and interactive educational installations exploring aeronautical engineering and the principles of flight . 
 AirSpace officially opened to the public on 12 July 2008 . Over 30 aircraft are on display , dating back to the First World War ; early aircraft include rare examples of an Airco DH.9 and a Royal Aircraft Factory <unk> The former is one of only six surviving <unk> and the only example on display in the UK , and the latter is the only complete and original R.E.8 in existence . More recent notable aircraft include a Hawker Siddeley Harrier which served during the Falklands War with No. 1 Squadron RAF , and a Panavia Tornado , which flew the highest number of bomber sorties of any Tornado in the 1991 Gulf War . Also on display is a British Aircraft Corporation TSR @-@ 2 strike aircraft , one of only two survivors from the cancellation of the project in 1965 . Recent additions include Eurofighter Typhoon <unk> , one of seven Typhoon development aircraft , which was donated to the museum by the Ministry of Defence in 2008 and went on display in June 2009 . Civil aircraft include the Duxford Aviation Society 's Concorde and Comet described above .

She saw action during the Baltic campaign of 1918 – 19 , and her commander Lieutenant Augustus Agar won the Victoria Cross for sinking the Russian cruiser Oleg on 17 June 1919 . Other vessels include the Vosper motor torpedo boat MTB @-@ 71 , acquired from the British Military Powerboat Trust in 2005 , an example of an X @-@ Craft midget submarine , and a wartime Royal National Lifeboat Institution boat , the Jesse Lumb which was stationed at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight . A variety of naval aircraft are on display , including a de Havilland Sea Vixen , Sea Venom , and Sea Vampire , and a Westland Wasp helicopter which was embarked on the frigate HMS Apollo during the Falklands War . 
 = = Hangar 4 : Battle of Britain Exhibition = = 
 Hangar 4 is one of Duxford 's historic hangars , and now houses an exhibition exploring Duxford 's history as an operational RAF airfield from the First World War to the Cold War . The early period is represented by a Bristol Fighter , a type operated by Duxford 's No.2 Flying Training School from 1920 . The latter period is represented by a Hawker Hunter which flew at Duxford with No. 65 Squadron RAF , a Gloster Javelin , the type which made the last operational flight at Duxford in 1961 , and by a Hungarian Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 21 , a common Warsaw Pact jet fighter . Britain 's air defence during the Second World War is particularly emphasised , with exhibits representing the Battle of Britain , the Blitz and the V @-@ 1 flying bomb offensive from 1944 . Notable aircraft include a Messerschmitt Bf @-@ 109E which was flown during the Battle of Britain until forced down in Sussex due to engine failure . It is displayed as part of a tableau showing the crashed aircraft under guard . One unusual aircraft on display is the Cierva <unk> autogyro , which was used by 74 ( Signals ) Wing , based at Duxford , to test the calibration of coastal radar units . 
 = = Hangar 5 : Conservation in Action = = 
 Hangar 5 , the westernmost original hangar , houses Duxford 's aircraft conservation workshops . Open to the public , the hangar allows visitors to see museum staff and volunteers at work on a variety of conservation tasks . Notable projects include a Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter acquired from an American owner in ' jungle recovery ' condition , and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 now on display in AirSpace . Duxford is a partner with the British Aviation Preservation Council in the National Aviation Heritage Skills Initiative , which has been funded since 2005 by the Heritage Lottery Fund and aims to provide training to volunteers supporting aviation heritage projects . 
 = = American Air Museum = = 
 From the late 1970s the museum acquired several important American aircraft ; a B @-@ <unk> Flying Fortress in 1978 , a B @-@ 29 Superfortress in 1980 , and a B @-@ 52 Stratofortress in 1983 . With Duxford 's association with the US Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) , in the mid @-@ 1980s plans developed for a commemoration of the role of American air power in the Second World War . A group of American supporters was formed , and the architect Sir Norman Foster was commissioned to design a new building . Fundraising for the project began in 1987 , support and funds being sought in the United States ; the Founding Member was General Jimmy Doolittle in 1989 . Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston ( 1989 ) , Washington , D.C. , ( 1991 ) and Los Angeles ( 1992 ) . The project was widely supported in the United States by some 50 @,@ 000 individual subscribers . A further $ 1million of funding was secured from Saudi Arabia , and £ <unk> from the Heritage Lottery Fund . On 8 September 1995 the groundbreaking for the new building was performed by wartime 78th Fighter Group veteran , Major James E Stokes . 
 = = = Architecture and construction = = = 
 The American Air Museum was designed by Sir Norman Foster and Chris Wise at Arup . The museum 's specification called for a landmark building that would provide a neutral backdrop for the aircraft collection and provide appropriate climatic controls while being cost efficient to operate . The building is shaped as a section of a torus , formed from a curved concrete roof 90 m ( 300 ft ) wide , 18 @.@ 5 m ( 61 ft ) high and 100 m ( 330 ft ) deep . The dimensions of the building were dictated by the need to accommodate the museum 's B @-@ 52 Stratofortress bomber with its 61 m ( 200 ft ) wingspan and a tail 16 m ( 52 ft ) high . The roof was constructed as a double @-@ layered concrete shell , built in 924 precast reinforced concrete sections . Inverted T @-@ shaped sections provided the inner layer with further flat panels forming the outer layer . 
 The roof weighs 6000 tonnes and is able to support suspended aircraft weighing up to 10 tonnes . A glass wall , demountable to permit aircraft to be rearranged , allows in daylight , thereby reducing lighting costs and enabling the aircraft to be seen from the outside of the building . It also allows visitors inside the museum to watch aircraft landing or taking off . From a visitor 's perspective , the pedestrian entrance leads to a mezzanine floor level with the cockpit of the museum 's B @-@ 52 , while the lack of supporting columns allows aircraft to hang from the ceiling . Heavier aircraft stand on the floor of the building , which covers 6 @,@ 500 m2 ( 70 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . Construction began with the building of abutments in October 1995 and the roof was completed in September 1996 . The building won the 1998 Stirling Prize for Foster and Partners and was described by the judges as " a great big , clear span hangar of a building ... dramatic , awe @-@ inspiring , an object of beauty ... simple yet replete with imagery .

The SR @-@ 71 , serial number 61 @-@ <unk> , is the only example of its type on display outside the United States , and set a flight altitude record of 85 @,@ 069 feet ( <unk> ) in July 1976 . Besides the Blackbird , nineteen other American aircraft are on display . Notable examples include a C @-@ 47 Skytrain which flew with the 316th Troop Carrier Group and participated in three major Second World War airborne operations ; the June 1944 Normandy landings , Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity , the airborne crossing of the River Rhine in March 1945 . The museum 's B @-@ 29 flew during the Korean War as part of the 7th Bomb Wing ; it is the only example in Europe and one of only two preserved in museums outside the United States . The B @-@ 52 flew 200 sorties during the Vietnam War as part of the 28th Bomb Wing . The General Dynamics F @-@ 111 on display flew 19 missions during the 1991 Gulf War as part of the 77th Fighter Squadron . 
 On 17 January 2014 the museum announced an award of £ 980 @,@ 000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund . The museum planned to use the money to build a website based on the photographic collection of aviation historian Roger Freeman , to update the museum 's interpretation , and to conserve aircraft and other exhibits . The museum launched <unk> in October 2014 . The website seeks to crowdsource photographs and information from the public about the men and women of the US Army Air Forces who served from the UK in the Second World War , and the British people who befriended them . 
 = = Land Warfare Hall = = 
 The Land Warfare Hall was opened on 28 September 1992 by Field Marshal Lord Bramall . The building provides accommodation for the Imperial War Museum 's collection of armoured vehicles , artillery and military vehicles . Also included are vehicles belonging to the Duxford Aviation Society Military Vehicle Section . The hall comprises a viewing balcony that runs for most of the length of the hall , providing views over a range of tableaux of vehicles , tanks and artillery that run chronologically from the First World War to the present day . Notable among the First World War exhibits is a battle @-@ damaged artillery limber used by L Battery Royal Horse Artillery during an action at Néry in September 1914 where three Victoria Crosses were won . The Second World War in particular is illustrated with tableaux of the North African Campaign , the Eastern Front and the invasion of Normandy . Outside the building is a Whale floating roadway bridge span from Mulberry B harbour at Arromanches . 
 Significant vehicles in the collection include three command vehicles used by Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery , commander of 21st Army Group during the north @-@ west Europe campaign . Also on display are extracts from Montgomery 's personal papers , which are held by the Imperial War Museum 's Department of Documents . Other tableaux depict scenes from post @-@ 1945 conflicts such as the Korean War , the Northern Ireland Troubles , the Falklands War , British peacekeeping contributions in Bosnia and the Gulf War . As many of the vehicles in the Land Warfare Hall are maintained in running condition , the site features garages and a running area behind the building .

 The Land Warfare Hall also houses the Forgotten War exhibition , which opened on 25 March 1999 and was a joint project between the Imperial War Museum and the Burma Star Association . The Association represents veterans of the Burma campaign who often consider themselves to have fought in a " Forgotten Army " compared to those who fought in Europe . The exhibition explores aspects of the Second World War in the Far East and features artefacts , archival film and photographs , and tableaux depicting scenes such as troops moving through jungle and a Burmese village . The exhibition was supported financially by the Burma Star Association and by £ 126 @,@ 000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund . 
 = = = Royal Anglian Regiment Museum and Memorial = = = 
 The Land Warfare Hall also accommodates the Royal Anglian Regiment Museum . The Royal Anglian Regiment was formed in 1964 by the amalgamation of the three regiments of the East Anglian Brigade and the Royal Leicestershire Regiment . The museum was opened in June 1996 by noted war correspondent Martin Bell , who had previously served as a sergeant in the Suffolk Regiment while a national serviceman . The museum covers the history of the Regiment and its predecessors , which date back to the seventeenth century , up to recent operations in Iraq , Afghanistan and Sierra Leone . Alongside the museum is the Cambridgeshire Regiment Exhibition , which displays items from the Cambridgeshire Regiment collection . Exhibits include the Singapore Drums , lost at the fall of Singapore in 1942 and recovered after the war . 
 On 12 September 2010 a Royal Anglian Regiment memorial was dedicated at Duxford . A fundraising campaign , which raised more than £ 340 @,@ 000 , was launched following the deaths in action of nine soldiers of 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment during the unit 's 2007 operational tour in Helmand Province , Afghanistan . The memorial is inscribed with the names of 78 soldiers killed since 1958 ( when the first of the three East Anglian regiments was formed ) in conflicts including Afghanistan , Iraq , Northern Ireland and Aden . The dedication was attended by more than 5000 people .

 In addition to the exhibition buildings , Duxford 's ' North Side ' , the area of the site north of the A505 road , provides storage for the Imperial War Museum 's collecting departments . The stored collections include the film collection , with potentially hazardous nitrate film kept in purpose @-@ built vaults at nearby <unk> . Other collections stored at Duxford 's north side include books , maps , ephemera , photographs , documents and collections of uniforms and equipment . 
 = No. 4 Service Flying Training School RAAF = 
 No. 4 Service Flying Training School ( No. 4 SFTS ) was a flying training school of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) during World War II . It was formed in February 1941 , and commenced flying the following month . Responsible for intermediate and advanced instruction of pilots under the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) , the school was based at Geraldton , Western Australia , and operated Avro Anson aircraft . Two reserve squadrons were formed in response to the outbreak of war in the Pacific , though they never saw action . Flying activity was reduced towards the end of 1943 , and the school was disbanded in May 1945 , having graduated over 1 @,@ 000 pilots . It re @-@ formed as No. 87 Operational Base Unit , which was renamed Care and Maintenance Unit ( CMU ) Geraldton in May 1946 . CMU Geraldton was disbanded in September 1947 . 
 = = History = = 
 Flying instruction in the RAAF underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II , in response to a dramatic increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . The Air Force 's pre @-@ war pilot training facility , No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , was supplanted in 1940 – 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . The EFTS provided basic flying training to prospective pilots who , if successful , would go on to SFTS for further instruction that focussed on operational ( or " service " ) flying . The course at SFTS typically consisted of two streams , intermediate and advanced , and included such techniques as instrument flying , night flying , advanced aerobatics , formation flying , dive bombing , and aerial gunnery . The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew rose and fell . Initially running for sixteen weeks , the course was cut to ten weeks ( which included seventy @-@ five hours flying time ) in October 1940 . A year later it was raised to twelve weeks ( including 100 hours flying time ) , and again to sixteen weeks two months later . It continued to increase after this , peaking at twenty @-@ eight weeks in June 1944 . 
 No. 4 Service Flying Training School ( No. 4 SFTS ) was formed at Geraldton , Western Australia , on 10 February 1941 , and came under the control of Western Area Command . Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander P.G. Heffernan . Geraldton 's civil airport already had extensive runways , taxiways , hangars and barracks , but more buildings were required to house the RAAF trainees and unit personnel . Facilities were still under construction when the first course of flying training commenced on 10 March . A further challenge the school faced related to equipment . All its Avro Anson aircraft were transferred from other units that , according to the RAAF Historical Section , " happily disposed of their oldest air frames " . Coupled with a shortage of the spare parts needed to keep such aircraft operational , the result was that flying hours remained low for some time . 
 No. 4 SFTS received students who had graduated from No. 9 Elementary Flying Training School at Cunderdin , Western Australia . Approximately sixty new entrants , of whom around fifty were expected to graduate , arrived at No. 4 SFTS every twenty @-@ eight days . Discipline was strict , the aim being to cut down on the accidents that were typical of service flying training establishments . In the event , the school did not suffer a fatal flying accident for over a year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half after it commenced operations . In November 1941 , eight of its Ansons took part in the search for survivors from HMAS Sydney . By this time , No. 4 SFTS was operating just over a hundred aircraft , including two Fairey Battles and two de Havilland Fox Moths , the remainder being Ansons . Personnel totalled 1 @,@ 475 , including 197 students . Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in December , the school 's aircraft were classified as Second Line ( Reserve ) aircraft in the defence of Australia . Nos. 68 and 69 Reserve Squadrons were formed at Geraldton , but they were only used for maritime search @-@ and @-@ rescue , and saw no action before their disbandment in February 1943 . On 30 September 1942 , a No. 4 SFTS Anson operated by No. 68 Squadron crash @-@ landed in a marsh 140 miles ( 230 km ) north of Carnarvon ; one crewman was killed and two injured . From October 1942 to March 1944 , the school was commanded by World War I veteran and pioneer civil aviator Norman Brearley . 
 Two men were killed and three injured when one of No. 4 SFTS 's Ansons crashed after colliding with trees after takeoff at a satellite airfield on 21 July 1943 ; one of the injured died later without regaining consciousness . Four occupants of an Anson were killed on 1 November , when a wing disintegrated after the pilot apparently became disorientated in cloud and the plane went into a high @-@ speed dive . By the end of the year , flying at No. 4 SFTS had begun to taper off , and it was reduced still further in 1944 . Training at the school concluded in December that year , under a reorganisation of EATS establishments in Australia . No. 4 SFTS began disbanding in January 1945 , as part of a general reduction in RAAF flight instruction owing to a surplus of trained aircrew , and the task was complete by May . It had graduated over 1 @,@ 000 pilots — among them Dave Shannon , awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his part in the Dambuster raid by No. 617 Squadron RAF in May 1943 — and established , according to the RAAF Historical Section , " an enviable safety record " . 
 No. 87 Operational Base Unit ( No. 87 <unk> ) was formed with No. 4 SFTS staff on 1 June 1945 to administer Geraldton 's facilities and maintain its aircraft following the flying school 's disbandment . On 20 May 1946 , No. 87 <unk> was disbanded and re @-@ formed as Care and Maintenance Unit ( CMU ) Geraldton . CMU Geraldton was one of many such units that the RAAF raised for the storage and maintenance of surplus aircraft prior to their disposal after the war . It was disbanded on 5 September 1947 . Most of the buildings constructed for the RAAF during the war were auctioned and removed around the same time . 
 A commemorative sundial in the form of an Anson wing is located at Geraldton Airport .

 Teemu Ilmari Selänne ( Finnish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ) , nicknamed " The Finnish Flash " ( born July 3 , 1970 ) , is a Finnish former professional ice hockey winger . He began his professional career in 1989 – 90 with Jokerit of the SM @-@ liiga and played 21 seasons in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the Winnipeg Jets , Anaheim Ducks , San Jose Sharks and Colorado Avalanche . Selänne is the highest scoring Finn in NHL history , and one of the highest overall ; he retired in 2014 11th all @-@ time with 684 goals and 15th with 1 @,@ 457 points . He holds numerous team scoring records for both the Winnipeg / Arizona franchise and the Anaheim Ducks . His jersey number 8 was retired by the Ducks in 2015 . 
 Selänne was a first round selection of the Jets , tenth overall , at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft , but initially remained in Finland . He led the SM @-@ liiga in scoring as part of Jokerit 's Kanada @-@ malja winning team in 1991 – 92 before moving to North America . He broke into the NHL by scoring 76 goals in 1992 – 93 . It remains the league record for most goals by a rookie and earned him the Calder Memorial Trophy as the top first @-@ year player in the NHL . He has scored 50 goals in a season three times and topped 100 points on four occasions . He played in 10 NHL All @-@ Star Games , was named to four post @-@ season All @-@ Star Teams and won the inaugural Maurice " Rocket " Richard Trophy in 1998 – 99 as the league 's leading goal scorer . He was named recipient of the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in 2005 – 06 for perseverance and dedication to the game and was a member of the Ducks ' 2007 Stanley Cup championship team . 
 Internationally , Selänne was a long @-@ time member of the Finnish National Team . He played in five World Championships , winning a silver and bronze medal , and in three Canada Cup / World Cup of Hockey tournaments . A six @-@ time Olympian , Selänne helped Finland win three bronze medals and , in 2006 , a silver medal . He is the all @-@ time leader in scoring at the Olympic ice hockey tournament with 43 points . A national star in his native country , Selänne is the subject of a top grossing biographical documentary in Finland . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Selänne was born on July 3 , 1970 , in Helsinki , Finland . He has a twin brother , Paavo and another brother , <unk> . He was raised by his mother Liisa <unk> and father Ilmari Selänne until they divorced in the late 1980s . The family lived for a time in Rauma before settling in Espoo around the time Teemu was 10 years old . 
 Selänne played three sports as a youth : hockey , bandy and association football . He played hockey and football with and against Paavo , though his brother ultimately gave up on both sports in favour of field hockey , where he was a member of numerous Finnish and European championship teams . Teemu was small as a youth , creating in him a competitive spirit and drive to improve his skills . Focusing on hockey , he eventually joined the junior squad of Jokerit in Helsinki . 
 As a young adult , Selänne attended business school for two years and served a mandatory one @-@ year stint with the Finnish Defence Forces . During his tenure with Jokerit , he also spent three years as a kindergarten teacher . His experiences visiting kids at Helsinki 's children 's hospital led to him co @-@ founding the Godfathers ' Foundation , an organization that raises money for ill children . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = Jokerit = = = 
 Selänne played three years of junior hockey in Jokerit 's development program , culminating in 1987 – 88 with a 43 @-@ goal , 66 point season in 33 games and a Finnish Junior A championship . His performance prompted the National Hockey League ( NHL ) ' s Winnipeg Jets to select him with their first round pick , tenth overall , at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft . Selänne attended training camp with the Jets , but returned to Finland owing to his military service . 
 After graduating from junior hockey , Selänne joined Jokerit 's senior team in the 1 . <unk> in 1988 – 89 and scored 69 points in 35 games . Jokerit moved up to the SM @-@ liiga in 1989 – 90 , and while Selänne missed the majority of the season due to a leg injury , he scored 12 points in 11 games played . Playing a full season in 1990 – 91 , Selänne scored 33 goals and 58 points in 42 games . He was named the recipient of the Raimo <unk> trophy as the league 's most gentlemanly player . Selänne 's best season in the SM @-@ liiga came in 1991 – 92 when he recorded 62 points in 44 games . With 39 goals , he won the Aarne <unk> trophy as top goal scorer . He added 17 points in ten playoff games , and scored the winning goal as Jokerit won the Kanada @-@ malja as SM @-@ liiga playoff champion . 
 = = = Winnipeg Jets = = = 
 The Jets ' organizational philosophy at the time was to allow their European draft picks to develop in their native countries , but by 1991 , the franchise was working to bring him to Winnipeg . As Selänne had not yet signed a contract when he chose to play in North America for the 1992 – 93 season , he was considered a restricted free agent . The Calgary Flames signed him to an offer sheet on a three @-@ year contract worth $ 2 @.@ 7 million , $ 1 @.@ 5 million higher than what the Jets had been offering . Though concerned about paying such a high salary , Winnipeg exercised its right to match the offer . Selänne made his NHL debut on October 6 , 1992 , and recorded two assists in a 4 – 1 Jets victory over the Detroit Red Wings . He scored his first career NHL goal two nights later against goaltender Jeff Hackett of the San Jose Sharks . 
 Selänne scored his first career hat @-@ trick in his fifth contest and had 11 goals in his first 12 NHL games . He finished the season with 16 multi @-@ goal games , including four hat @-@ tricks and a four @-@ goal game , en route to breaking the NHL record for goals by a rookie . He surpassed Mike Bossy 's record of 53 goals on March 2 , 1993 , against the Quebec Nordiques and on March 23 , scored his 110th point , against the Toronto Maple Leafs , to break Peter Šťastný 's rookie points record . Selänne finished the season tied for fifth in scoring with 132 points , and his 76 goals tied with Alexander Mogilny for the League lead . His offensive exploits helped pull the Jets into the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs , where they lost a first @-@ round matchup to the Vancouver Canucks . In recognition of his season , Selänne was voted the recipient of the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year , was named to the First All @-@ Star Team and played in his first of ten career NHL All @-@ Star Games . 
 Unable to maintain a similar pace in 1993 – 94 — indeed , his rookie totals in goals and points would both prove his career high by more than 20 — Selänne 's offensive production declined by 30 percent midway through the season . He scored his 100th career goal on January 12 , 1994 , against the Buffalo Sabres , reaching the milestone in his 130th game , the second @-@ fastest in NHL history and only one game later than Bossy . Selänne finished the season with 54 points in 51 games , but missed the final 33 games of the season after suffering a severed Achilles tendon in a January 26 game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim . The 1994 – 95 NHL lockout resulted in Selänne splitting the season between Jokerit and the Jets . While playing in Finland , Selänne was named to the tournament all @-@ star team as Jokerit won the 1995 European Cup . 
 Selänne 's career in Winnipeg came to an end midway through the 1995 – 96 season . He was leading the Jets with 72 points when , on February 6 , 1996 , he was traded to Anaheim . The Mighty Ducks sent first @-@ round draft picks Chad <unk> and Oleg <unk> , along with a third @-@ round selection at the 1996 NHL Entry Draft , in exchange for Selänne , Marc Chouinard and a fourth @-@ round draft pick . Selänne was upset when notified of the deal during practice and left the Winnipeg Arena without speaking to anyone . 
 = = = Anaheim , San Jose , and Colorado = = = 
 Following a period of adjustment , Selänne gained an appreciation for his new team ; he quickly came to call the deal the best thing that ever happened to him . He was paired with Paul Kariya , whom he met at the 1996 NHL All @-@ Star Game , and the duo were counted on to lead the young franchise to a post @-@ season berth for the first time . Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks , and combined with his Jets totals , finished the 1995 – 96 season with 108 points . He followed it up with a third 100 @-@ point season in 1996 – 97 , finishing with 109 , including 51 goals . He was named to the First All @-@ Star Team for a second time , while he and Kariya led the Mighty Ducks into the franchise 's first playoff appearance in 1997 . Despite being criticized as being a " one @-@ line team , " Anaheim defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round before being eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings . 
 The 1998 All @-@ Star Game was Selänne 's fifth , and after scoring a hat @-@ trick , he became the first European player to be named the MVP in the All @-@ Star Game 's 46 @-@ year history . He finished the 1997 – 98 season with his third career 50 @-@ goal season ; his total of 52 tied Peter Bondra for the NHL lead , and he scored his 500th career point on January 12 , 1998 , with an assist against the Los Angeles Kings . He was a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League 's MVP ( finishing third ) and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for gentlemanly conduct ( as the runner @-@ up ) , and was named to the Second All @-@ Star Team . The NHL created the Maurice " Rocket " Richard Trophy in 1998 – 99 to be presented to the League 's leading goal scorer ; Selänne became its inaugural winner following a 47 @-@ goal season . 
 An 85 @-@ point season followed in 1999 – 2000 , and he was the Mighty Ducks ' leading scorer with 59 points through 61 games in 2000 – 01 . Anaheim , however , sat in last place in the Western Conference , and on March 5 , 2001 , chose to make a trade . Selänne was sent to San Jose in exchange for Jeff Friesen , Steve Shields and a second @-@ round selection in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft . Selänne 's debut with the Sharks was delayed by two weeks as he underwent minor surgery to remove loose cartilage in his knee the following day . After finishing the season with 13 points in 12 games with San Jose , Selänne led the Sharks with 29 goals in 2001 – 02 . He also led the team in both goals ( 28 ; tied ) and points ( 64 ) in 2002 – 03 . As the Sharks fell out of the playoff race , they looked to make changes ; the New Jersey Devils sought to acquire Selänne , but he exercised a no trade clause in his contract and blocked the deal . 
 Selänne then declined an option in his contract that would have paid $ 6 @.@ 5 million in 2003 – 04 and instead opted to sign a one @-@ year , $ 5 @.@ 8 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche , where he was joined by former Anaheim teammate Paul Kariya . The pair chose to sign with the Avalanche together in the belief it was their best chance at winning the Stanley Cup . Their hope failed to materialize , however , as Selänne endured a disastrous season in which he scored only 16 goals and 32 points — the lowest totals of his career to that date — and was ultimately relegated to Colorado 's fourth line , but was also held out of the lineup as a healthy scratch during a playoff game . He struggled throughout the year with knee problems that ultimately required surgery , his third such procedure , and with the 2004 – 05 season canceled by a labour dispute , took the time off to recover . 
 = = = Return to Anaheim = = = 
 A free agent when the NHL resumed play in 2005 – 06 , Selänne returned to Anaheim by signing a one @-@ year , $ 1 million contract with the Mighty Ducks . During a resurgent season , he scored his 1,000th career point on January 30 , 2006 , with a goal in a 4 – 3 victory over Los Angeles . Selänne completed the season with 40 goals and 90 points , both of which led the Mighty Ducks , and he was named the recipient of the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and perseverance . 
 After reaching the Western Conference Final in the 2006 playoffs , the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks entered the 2006 – 07 season with high expectations ; the team brought Selänne back with a one @-@ year , $ 3 @.@ 75 million contract . He reached several milestones during the season : Selänne became the 36th player in NHL history , and second Finn after Jari Kurri , to score 500 goals , on November 22 , 2006 , against Colorado . On December 31 , he played his 1,000th NHL game . As part of a season in which he again led Anaheim in goals ( 48 ) and points ( 94 ) , Selänne played in his tenth All @-@ Star Game in 2007 , and scored his first hat @-@ trick in six years ( the 19th of his career ) on January 12 , 2007 . It was the same day he spoke with a friend in Finland with terminal cancer and whom asked to be sent the game puck if Selänne had a three @-@ goal game . Finally , he scored his 301st goal as a Duck on February 18 , 2007 , to break Paul Kariya 's franchise record . 
 Early in the 2007 playoffs , Selänne became Anaheim 's all @-@ time leading playoff scorer when he recorded his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild . The Ducks defeated the Wild , Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings to reach the Final ; it was the first time in Selänne 's career that he played in the NHL 's championship series . As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup , his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit ; Ducks goaltender Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère noted , " We don 't have any better teammate . He 's a guy who always has fun . He deserves this and if we can help him along the way , that would be great . I 'd just love to see Teemu win this thing . " Selänne finished the playoffs with 15 points in 21 games , and after 14 NHL seasons , the 36 @-@ year @-@ old Selänne raised the Stanley Cup with his teammates after defeating the Ottawa Senators in five games . 
 Following the Cup win , Selänne contemplated retirement . He remained undecided on a return — and as a free agent , out of the Ducks lineup to begin the 2007 – 08 season — until he finally chose to return and signed a one @-@ year contract with Anaheim on January 28 , 2008 . He made his return on February 5 against the New York Islanders , and the Ducks posted the League 's best record from that point to the end of the regular season by winning 20 of 26 games . In his third game back , Selänne scored his <unk> point as a member of the Ducks with an assist in a 4 – 2 victory over the Calgary Flames . With it , he broke Kariya 's franchise record of 669 . 
 Selänne returned to the Ducks in 2008 – 09 and signed a two @-@ year contract . He missed several weeks of the season due to a quad muscle injury suffered when he was cut by his own skate following a hit by Denis <unk> of the Edmonton Oilers , but appeared in 65 games and scored 54 points . He played his <unk> game during the season , became the sixth European player to score 1 @,@ 200 career points and appeared in his 100th career playoff game . Selänne reached additional milestones in 2009 – 10 , as he became the 18th player in NHL history to score 600 goals , accomplishing the feat on March 21 , 2010 , against the Colorado Avalanche and upon scoring his 602nd goal on April 2 against the Vancouver Canucks , surpassing his childhood idol , Jari Kurri . 
 Selänne finished eighth in NHL scoring in 2010 – 11 with 31 goals and 49 assists in 73 games . His 80 points was the third @-@ highest in NHL history by a player over the age of 40 ( Gordie Howe , 103 and Johnny Bucyk , 83 ) . He also scored his 1,300th point , achieving the mark with a two @-@ goal performance on January 16 , 2011 , against Edmonton . Questions about whether Selänne would return for another NHL season had become an annual topic of discussion , and his decision to return for 2011 – 12 was delayed by a knee operation that left him uncertain if he would be capable of playing . Nonetheless , Selänne appeared in every game for the Ducks and became the oldest player in NHL history to play an entire 82 @-@ game season while leading the team with 66 points . Sixteen years after the original Jets relocated , a new Winnipeg Jets franchise joined the NHL , and fans in the Manitoba capital continued to view Selänne as a local hero . In his first return to Winnipeg , he was cheered by exuberant fans who booed every other Ducks player . Selänne was named to the Western Conference roster for the 2012 NHL All @-@ Star Game , but declined his invitation and asked the League to instead send his teammate Corey Perry . 
 Following a 24 @-@ point effort in the lockout @-@ shortened 2012 – 13 season , Selänne announced that 2013 – 14 would be the 21st and final season of his NHL career . He missed several games early in the season after he was struck in the face by an errant stick that knocked out several teeth and required 40 stitches to close cuts . Selänne recorded 27 points in 64 games for the Ducks ; his final regular season game , a 3 – 2 victory over Colorado , was a celebration of his career . He wore the captain 's " C " in place of Ryan Getzlaf for the game and as it neared conclusion , received standing ovations from the Anaheim crowd each time he took a shift . Selänne was named the game 's first , second and third star following the game and took a celebratory lap with Colorado goaltender and former Anaheim teammate Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère , who was also contemplating retirement . 
 Selänne 's made his final post @-@ season appearance during the 2014 playoffs . He had six points in 12 games , but was also held out of the lineup for one game against the Dallas Stars , a decision that angered Ducks fans . He played his final game on May 16 , 2014 , as the Ducks were eliminated by Los Angeles . Following the contest , Selänne was saluted by fans , teammates and opponents alike , and took a final lap around the rink . 
 = = = International = = = 
 Selänne 's international debut came with the Finnish national junior team . He recorded 16 points in six games at the 1988 European Junior Championship and was named to the tournament all @-@ star team . After participating in the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships for the sixth place Finns , Selänne made his debut with the senior team at the 1991 World Championship where he finished third in tournament scoring with 11 points for the fifth @-@ place finishers . After playing in the 1991 Canada Cup , he made his Olympic debut at the 1992 Albertville Games . Selänne tied for the tournament scoring lead with seven goals , and was tied for fourth in overall scoring at 11 points . 
 It was four years before Selänne returned to international play ; he appeared in the 1996 World Championship and the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and averaged over one point per game in both tournaments as Finland finished fifth each time . At the 1998 Winter Olympics , Selänne finished with ten points in five games . He was the tournament 's leading scorer on a Finnish team that he described in 2003 as the best he ever played on and the best in the tournament , but lost the semifinal , 7 – 4 to Russia . He suffered an abdominal muscle injury that prevented him from playing in the third place game , which Finland won 3 – 2 over Canada ; Selänne and his teammates ended the tournament as the bronze medal winners . 
 The Finns finished one position higher at the 1999 World Championship ; The tournament 's medal round was conducted in a two @-@ game series format followed by a ten @-@ minute sudden victory overtime if the each team wins one game . Finland and Sweden split their semifinal , but the Finns advanced to the final in the overtime period after Selänne set up Marko <unk> 's winning goal . The Czech Republic defeated Finland to capture the gold medal , also in a sudden victory period . Selänne finished the tournament with 11 points , was named to the all @-@ star team and was voted the most valuable player of the World Championship . 
 Selänne served as the Finnish captain at the 2002 Winter Olympics and led his nation to an important preliminary round victory over Russia , however he had only three goals and no assists in four games as the Finns finished in sixth place . The World Championship was held in Finland , and the hosts were hailed as the favourite to win the title . Though Selänne led the tournament with eight goals , Finland lost their quarterfinal match against Sweden and finished fifth overall . 
 The 2004 World Cup of Hockey was played after Selänne 's difficult NHL season with Colorado . For Selänne , the tournament was about recovering his joy at playing hockey . The Finns went undefeated to reach the final , but Selänne and his teammates had to settle for second place after losing the championship game to Canada , 3 – 2 . Returning to the national team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin , Selänne joined Jere Lehtinen and Saku Koivu on what The Hockey News called the best team Finland has ever produced . The Finns outscored their opposition 19 – 2 in the group stage , then defeated the United States and shut @-@ out Russia in the semi @-@ final . The Finns , however , were overcome in the final by Sweden , 3 – 2 , and were relegated to the silver medal . Selänne scored six goals and 11 points in the tournament , was named to the all @-@ star team and received the Directorate Award as top forward . 
 Selänne stated he would retire from international competition after a bronze medal @-@ winning performance followed at the 2008 IIHF World Championship . However , he returned to play in his fifth Olympic tournament at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics . Selänne became the all @-@ time leading scorer in Olympic hockey history on February 19 , 2010 , as he recorded his 37th point in competition in a game against Germany . The Finns won the bronze medal with a 5 – 3 victory over Slovakia in the third @-@ place game . 
 Selänne was named to the Finnish team for the 2014 Sochi Olympics , which marked his sixth appearance at the tournament . In the quarterfinals , Selänne scored a goal and an assist as the Finns ousted the host Russians from the tournament , then added two goals in the bronze medal match in a 5 – 0 victory over the United States . The 43 @-@ year @-@ old Selänne became the oldest player to win a medal in Olympic hockey . He was named most valuable player of the Olympic tournament as selected by the media , and added six points to his Olympic record career total of 43 .

 Selänne 's primary attribute is his skating speed . Nicknamed the " Finnish Flash " , he uses his speed to evade opposition defenders . According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström , " He 's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where to be on the ice . Former teammate Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère added , " He 's just a very elegant player . He 's got a very nice stride to his skating , he plays with a lot of energy , a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill he has , it just makes for a heck of a great player . " 
 An elite offensive player , Selänne is the highest scoring Finnish @-@ born player in NHL history . He ended his career with 684 goals , 11th all @-@ time in NHL history , and 1 @,@ 457 points , 15th best . His 110 game @-@ winning goals tied him with Brett Hull for fourth all @-@ time . Selänne is one of eight players to score 70 or more goals in one season . He holds numerous records , including most goals , 76 , and points , 132 , by a rookie .

 = Dermide Leclerc = 
 Dermide Louis Napoléon Leclerc ( 20 April 1798 – 14 August 1804 ) was the only child of Pauline Bonaparte ( later suo jure Duchess of Guastalla ) and her husband , French Army general Charles Leclerc . Through his mother , Dermide was a nephew of the future Emperor Napoleon I. 
 In 1802 , during the Haitian Revolution , Dermide arrived on the island @-@ colony of Saint @-@ Domingue with his parents , as part of the Saint @-@ Domingue expedition . After his father 's death of yellow fever later during the year , Dermide and Pauline were brought back to France . In 1803 , Pauline remarried , this time to Italian nobleman Camillo Borghese , and she took up residence , along with her husband and son , in Rome . Always a frail child , Dermide died of a fever at the age of six , three months after his uncle became Emperor and two years before his mother 's proclamation as Duchess of Guastalla . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Dermide was born on 20 April 1798 , in Milan , which was then part of the Cisalpine Republic , a puppet state of the First French Republic . He was the first and only child of his parents , Maria Paola di Buonaparte ( known as Pauline ) and Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc , a general in the French Army . Dermide 's birth was a difficult one , and its effects would be visible in Pauline 's health for many years . He was christened Dermide Louis Napoléon , after a character in the epic Gaelic poems of Ossian , at the request of his uncle , general Napoleon Bonaparte , who greatly admired Ossian 's works . 
 He was the eldest surviving son born to one of the Bonaparte siblings ( Joseph , Napoleon , Lucien , Elisa , Louis , Pauline , Caroline and Jérôme , most of which would later receive ruling positions in their brother 's client states ) . Six weeks after his birth , on 29 May 1798 , Dermide was baptised " with imperial ceremony " at a Capuchin church in Milan . Charles Louis Huguet , marquis de Sémonville stood as witness and Napoleon served as godfather . The baptism was welcomed by the Milanese people with gun salutes , ringing of church bells , music and shouting , just as had been done at the births of Austrian <unk> during the Austrian Rule . Following a quarrel with officials of the Cisalpine Republic , Leclerc took his wife and son to Paris , where they established themselves at No. 1 , Rue de la Victoire . Napoleon resided on the same street , albeit at No. 6 . Meanwhile , after a coup d 'état in 1799 , the French Consulate was established and Napoleon installed himself as First Consul . 
 In 1791 , the Haitian Revolution had begun in Saint @-@ Domingue ( present @-@ day Haiti ) , which had been a French colony since 1697 . Wanting to restore French authority on the island , Napoleon organised the Saint @-@ Domingue expedition , placing Leclerc in charge and bestowing upon him the title of Governor @-@ General of Saint @-@ Domingue . Consequently , on 14 December 1801 , Leclerc embarked on the flagship L <unk> at Brest with his wife and son , and sailed for Saint @-@ Domingue , which they eventually reached on 28 January 1802 . While Leclerc quickly left the ship , Pauline and Dermide remained on board . Although Dermide was initially healthy and Leclerc had assured Napoleon that his son had " survived the crossing from France better than anyone " , both mother and son suffered episodes of yellow fever while they were at Le Cap , nonetheless recovering quickly . Dermide was apportioned to a grenadier at Port @-@ au @-@ Prince and spent much of his time playing . On 2 November , Leclerc , who had been ill with yellow fever , died at Tortuga . Preparations for Pauline and Dermide 's departure from Saint @-@ Domingue were completed quickly , and they left the colony aboard the HMS Swiftsure , arriving at Toulon on New Year 's Day 1803 . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 Pauline found a temporary place to live for her and Dermide at her brother Joseph 's hotel in the Rue du Faubourg Saint @-@ Honoré . Eventually , they settled in the Château de Montgobert , her husband 's former estate , which was Dermide 's inheritance from his father . Napoleon did not wish for Pauline to remain without a husband and , as such , Roman nobleman Camillo Borghese , 6th Prince of Sulmona was selected with the help of Pope Pius VII . Thus , on 14 November 1803 , Pauline , Camillo and Dermide set out on a journey towards Rome . Dermide had his own carriage , drawn by six horses , which he shared with his governess , Madame <unk> , and with his mother 's <unk> ( reader ) , Jenny Saint @-@ Maur . In one of the cities through which they passed , a gendarme asked the family who they were , upon which Dermide replied , " <unk> , it is the son of General Leclerc traveling with his suite . " Saint @-@ Maur swiftly corrected him , albeit " admiring his spirit " . The family took up residence at the Palazzo Borghese in Rome . 
 Pauline , being " family minded " , welcomed her brother Lucien , who had been living in exile at the Villa Rufinella in Frascati , during his visits in Rome and valued his children , Charlotte ( b . 1795 ) , Christine ( b . 1798 ) and Charles Lucien ( b . 1803 ) , as Dermide 's playmates . Dermide captivated Lucien and his wife , Alexandrine de <unk> , and the couple observed that Borghese was not very affectionate towards Pauline 's son . Lucien even considered Dermide as a possible future husband for his daughter Christine . In hopes of restoring her health , Pauline and Borghese agreed that they should travel to Florence in the summer of 1804 , and from there to the thermal baths of Pisa , which were hoped to have better effect than the ones at Frascati . Pauline wanted to take Dermide with them , but Borghese advised against it , instead proposing to leave Dermide with his brother Francesco in Frascati , near Lucien 's Villa Rufinella . Thus , Dermide , Madame <unk> and his tutor , Monsieur de la Ronde , were moved to Francesco 's Villa <unk> . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 By August , Lucien , his children and Dermide had all suffered from bouts of fever . Doctors saw no cause for alarm and Lucien quickly recovered , as did his children . Despite the doctors ' best efforts , Dermide died on 14 August , at the age of six . Pauline later came to believe her son 's blood had been thinned by the recurrent spells of yellow fever they had suffered in Saint @-@ Domingue . Borghese decided to conceal Dermide 's death from his wife until her health improved . Thus , Francesco returned to Frascati and wrote three letters addressed to Pauline : one which announced the onset of Dermide 's illness , the second announcing that the illness worsened and the third announcing Dermide 's demise . Immediately after receiving the first letter , Pauline began making preparations for her departure from Pisa , in order to reach her son at Frascati . Before this was possible , she became aware of the truth and her suspicions were confirmed by de la Ronde . 
 Pauline was grief @-@ stricken and later said " My poor little boy . If only I had been with him ... I would have nursed him as I nursed his father " . She came to blame Borghese for his decision to send Dermide to Frascati and called him " the butcher of my son " , believing that , had it not been for her husband , her son " would still be alive " . Leclerc 's parents accused Pauline of having neglected Dermide , leaving him to die under the care of servants , when she could have left him in France , to live with them . Nonetheless , Pauline had her son buried at the Château de Montgobert , next to General Leclerc . Dermide 's inheritance reverted to his father 's family and , in spite of her wishes to be buried beside her son and first husband at Montgobert , Pauline was buried at the Saint Mary Major Basilica in Rome upon her death in 1825 .

 = Hassium = 
 Hassium is a chemical element with symbol Hs and atomic number 108 , named after the German state of Hesse . It is a synthetic element ( an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature ) and radioactive ; the most stable known isotope , 269Hs , has a half @-@ life of approximately 9 @.@ 7 seconds , although an unconfirmed metastable state , <unk> , may have a longer half @-@ life of about 130 seconds . More than 100 atoms of hassium have been synthesized to date . 
 In the periodic table of the elements , it is a d @-@ block transactinide element . It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 8 elements . Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier homologue to osmium in group 8 . The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly , but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements . In bulk quantities , hassium is expected to be a silvery metal that reacts readily with oxygen in the air , forming a volatile tetroxide . 
 = = History = = 
 The synthesis of element 108 was first attempted in 1978 by a Russian research team led by Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir <unk> at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research ( JINR ) in Dubna , using reactions that would generate the isotopes hassium @-@ 270 and hassium @-@ 264 . The data was uncertain and they carried out new experiments on hassium five years later , where these two isotopes as well as hassium @-@ 263 were produced ; the hassium @-@ 264 experiment was repeated again and confirmed in 1984 . 
 Hassium was officially discovered in 1984 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research ( Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung ) in Darmstadt . The team bombarded a target of lead @-@ 208 with accelerated nuclei of iron @-@ 58 to produce 3 atoms of the isotope hassium @-@ 265 . 
 Due to this issue , a controversy arose over who should be recognized as the official discoverer of the element . The IUPAC / IUPAP Transfermium Working Group ( TWG ) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report . They stated that the GSI collaboration was " more detailed and , of itself , carries conviction " , and that while the combined data from Dubna and Darmstadt confirmed that hassium had been synthesized , the major credit was awarded to the GSI . This statement came in spite of the combined data also supporting the Russian 1983 discovery claim and the TWG also acknowledging that " very probably element 108 played a role in the Dubna experiment . " 
 The name hassium was proposed by Peter Armbruster and his colleagues , the officially recognised German discoverers , in 1992 , derived from the Latin name ( <unk> ) for the German state of Hesse where the institute is located . Using Mendeleev 's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements , hassium should be known as eka @-@ osmium . In 1979 , during the Transfermium Wars ( but before the synthesis of hassium ) , IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called <unk> ( with the corresponding symbol of Uno ) , a systematic element name as a placeholder , until the element was discovered ( and the discovery then confirmed ) and a permanent name was decided on . Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels , from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks , the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field , who either called it " element 108 " , with the symbol of ( 108 ) or even simply 108 , or used the proposed name " hassium " . 
 In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named <unk> ( Hn ) after the German physicist Otto Hahn , after an older suggestion of <unk> ( Oh ) in spite of the long @-@ standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name , so that elements named after Hahn and Lise Meitner ( meitnerium ) would be next to each other , honoring their joint discovery of nuclear fission . This was because they felt that Hesse did not merit an element being named after it . After protests from the German discoverers and the American Chemical Society , IUPAC relented and the name hassium ( Hs ) was adopted internationally in 1997 . 
 = = Natural occurrence = = 
 Hassium is not known to occur naturally on Earth ; the half @-@ lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day . This does not rule out the possibility of unknown longer @-@ lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing , some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long @-@ lived enough . In the early 1960s , it was predicted that long @-@ lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities . This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes , but could have been caused by superheavy elements . 
 In 1963 , Soviet scientist Victor <unk> , who had previously claimed the existence of primordial curium @-@ 247 , claimed to have discovered element 108 ( specifically , the <unk> isotope , which supposedly had a half life of 400 to 500 million years ) in natural molybdenite and suggested the name sergenium ( symbol <unk> ; at the time , this symbol had not yet been taken by seaborgium ) for it , after the ancient city of <unk> along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his molybdenite samples came from . His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid , similarly to osmium . His findings were criticized by V. M. Kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties <unk> claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then @-@ current nuclear physics . 
 The chief questions raised by Kulakov were that the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half @-@ life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy , but at the same time a corrected half @-@ life in the region of 1016 years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100 milligrams of sergenium . In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4 @.@ 5 MeV could be due to a low @-@ energy and strongly enhanced transition between different <unk> states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs , thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible , although unlikely . 
 In 2004 , the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research conducted a search for natural hassium . This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays , but no results have been released , strongly implying that no natural hassium was found . The possible extent of primordial hassium on Earth is uncertain ; it might now only exist in traces , or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago . 
 In 2006 , it was hypothesized that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half @-@ life of around ( 2 @.@ 5 ± 0 @.@ 5 ) × 108 y , which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4 @.@ 4 MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium . This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of <unk> and <unk> , which , being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively , should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature . Since hassium is homologous to osmium , it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature . The decay chains of <unk> and <unk> are very hypothetical and the predicted half @-@ life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth . It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way , which would also explain excesses of plutonium @-@ 239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland , but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium @-@ 235 and lead @-@ 207 , and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission , such as krypton , zirconium , and xenon . Thus , the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and <unk> is theoretically possible , but highly unlikely . 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 Hassium has no stable or naturally @-@ occurring isotopes . Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory , either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements . Twelve different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 263 to 277 ( with the exceptions of 272 , 274 , and 276 ) , four of which , hassium @-@ 265 , hassium @-@ 267 , hassium @-@ 269 , and hassium @-@ 277 , have known metastable states ( although that of hassium @-@ 277 is unconfirmed ) . Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay , but some also undergo spontaneous fission . 
 The lightest isotopes , which usually have shorter half @-@ lives were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products . The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 271Hs ; heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers . In 1999 , American scientists at the University of California , Berkeley , announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of <unk> . These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted three alpha particles to form hassium @-@ 273 nuclei , which were claimed to have undergone an alpha decay , emitting alpha particles with decay energies of 9 @.@ 78 and 9 @.@ 47 MeV and half @-@ life 1 @.@ 2 s , but their claim was retracted in 2001 . The isotope was successfully produced in 2010 by the same team . The new data matched the previous ( fabricated ) data . 
 = = = 270Hs : prospects for a deformed doubly magic nucleus = = = 
 According to calculations , 108 is a proton magic number for deformed nuclei ( nuclei that are far from spherical ) , and 162 is a neutron magic number for deformed nuclei . This means that such nuclei are permanently deformed in their ground state but have high , narrow fission barriers to further deformation and hence relatively long life @-@ times to spontaneous fission . The spontaneous fission half @-@ lives in this region are typically reduced by a factor of 109 in comparison with those in the vicinity of the spherical doubly magic nucleus 298Fl , caused by the narrower fission barrier for such deformed nuclei . Hence , the nucleus 270Hs has promise as a deformed doubly magic nucleus . Experimental data from the decay of the darmstadtium ( Z = 110 ) isotopes 271Ds and <unk> provides strong evidence for the magic nature of the N = 162 sub @-@ shell . The recent synthesis of 269Hs , 270Hs , and 271Hs also fully support the assignment of N = 162 as a magic number . In particular , the low decay energy for 270Hs is in complete agreement with calculations . 
 Evidence for the <unk> of the Z = 108 proton shell can be obtained from two sources : the variation in the partial spontaneous fission half @-@ lives for <unk> and the large gap in the alpha Q value for isotonic nuclei of hassium and darmstadtium . For spontaneous fission , it is necessary to measure the half @-@ lives for the isotonic nuclei <unk> , 270Hs and 272Ds . Since the isotopes <unk> and 272Ds are not currently known , and fission of 270Hs has not been measured , this method cannot yet be used to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z = 108 shell . Good evidence for the <unk> of the Z = 108 shell can nevertheless be found from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for 270Hs , 271Ds and <unk> . More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the decay energy for the unknown nucleus 272Ds .

 Various calculations show that hassium should be the heaviest known group 8 element , consistent with the periodic law . Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of osmium , with a few deviations arising from relativistic effects . 
 = = = Physical and atomic = = = 
 The previous members of group 8 have relatively high melting points ( Fe , 1538 ° C ; Ru , <unk> ° C ; Os , 3033 ° C ) . Much like them , hassium is predicted to be a solid at room temperature , although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated . Hassium should crystallize in the hexagonal close @-@ packed structure ( c / a = 1 @.@ 59 ) , similarly to its lighter congener osmium . Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus ( resistance to uniform compression ) comparable to that of diamond ( 442 GPa ) . Hassium is expected to have a bulk density of 40 @.@ 7 g / cm3 , the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of osmium , the most dense measured element , at 22 @.@ 61 g / cm3 . This results from hassium 's high atomic weight , the lanthanide and actinide contractions , and relativistic effects , although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical , and the sample would quickly decay . Osmium is the densest element of the first 6 periods , and its heavier congener hassium is expected to be the densest element of the first 7 periods . 
 The atomic radius of hassium is expected to be around 126 pm . Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital , the Hs + ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of [ Rn ] 5f14 6d5 7s2 , giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron , which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues . On the other hand , the <unk> + ion is expected to have an electron configuration of [ Rn ] 5f14 6d5 <unk> , analogous to that calculated for the <unk> + ion . 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 Hassium is the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals and is expected to be much like the platinum group metals . Calculations on its ionization potentials , atomic radius , as well as radii , orbital energies , and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of osmium , implying that hassium 's properties would resemble those of the other group 8 elements , iron , ruthenium , and osmium . Some of these properties were confirmed by gas @-@ phase chemistry experiments . The group 8 elements portray a wide variety of oxidation states , but ruthenium and osmium readily portray their group oxidation state of + 8 ( the second @-@ highest known oxidation state for any element , which is very rare for other elements ) and this state becomes more stable as the group is descended . Thus hassium is expected to form a stable + 8 state . Analogously to its lighter congeners , hassium is expected to also show other stable lower oxidation states , such as + 6 , + 5 , + 4 , + 3 , and + 2 . Indeed , hassium ( IV ) is expected to be more stable than hassium ( VIII ) in aqueous solution . 
 The group 8 elements show a very distinctive oxide chemistry which allows extrapolations to be made easily for hassium . All the lighter members have known or hypothetical tetroxides , <unk> . Their oxidising power decreases as one descends the group . <unk> is not known due to its extraordinarily large electron affinity ( the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule to form a negative ion ) which results in the formation of the well @-@ known <unk> <unk> ( VI ) , <unk> − 
 4 . Ruthenium tetroxide , RuO4 , formed by oxidation of ruthenium ( VI ) in acid , readily undergoes reduction to ruthenate ( VI ) , RuO2 − 
 4 . Oxidation of ruthenium metal in air forms the dioxide , RuO2 . In contrast , osmium burns to form the stable tetroxide , OsO4 , which complexes with the hydroxide ion to form an osmium ( VIII ) <unk> complex , [ OsO4 ( OH ) 2 ] 2 − . Therefore , eka @-@ osmium properties for hassium should be demonstrated by the formation of a stable , very volatile tetroxide HsO4 , which undergoes complexation with hydroxide to form a hassate ( VIII ) , [ HsO4 ( OH ) 2 ] 2 − . Ruthenium tetroxide and osmium tetroxide are both volatile , due to their symmetrical tetrahedral molecular geometry and their being charge @-@ neutral ; hassium tetroxide should similarly be a very volatile solid . The trend of the <unk> of the group 8 tetroxides is known to be RuO4 < OsO4 > HsO4 , which completely confirms the calculated results . In particular , the calculated enthalpies of adsorption ( the energy required for the adhesion of atoms , molecules , or ions from a gas , liquid , or dissolved solid to a surface ) of HsO4 , − ( 45 @.@ 4 ± 1 ) kJ · mol − 1 on quartz , agrees very well with the experimental value of − ( 46 ± 2 ) kJ · mol − 1 .

 Despite the fact that the selection of a volatile hassium compound ( hassium tetroxide ) for gas @-@ phase chemical studies was clear from the beginning , the chemical characterization of hassium was considered a difficult task for a long time . Although hassium isotopes were first synthesized in 1984 , it was not until 1996 that a hassium isotope long @-@ lived enough to allow chemical studies to be performed was synthesized . Unfortunately , this hassium isotope , 269Hs , was then synthesized indirectly from the decay of 277Cn ; not only are indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies , but also the reaction that produced the isotope 277Cn had a low yield ( its cross @-@ section was only 1 pb ) , and thus did not provide enough hassium atoms for a chemical investigation . The direct synthesis of 269Hs and 270Hs in the reaction 248Cm ( 26Mg , xn ) 274 − <unk> ( x = 4 or 5 ) appeared more promising , as the cross @-@ section for this reaction was somewhat larger , at 7 pb . This yield was still around ten times lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of bohrium . New techniques for irradiation , separation , and detection had to be introduced before hassium could be successfully characterized chemically as a typical member of group 8 in early 2001 . 
 Ruthenium and osmium have very similar chemistry due to the lanthanide contraction , but iron shows some differences from them : for example , although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the + 8 oxidation state , iron does not . Consequently , in preparation for the chemical characterization of hassium , researches focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron , as hassium was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and osmium due to the actinide contraction . Nevertheless , in the planned experiment to study hassocene ( Hs ( C5H5 ) 2 ) , ferrocene may also be used for comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene . 
 The first chemistry experiments were performed using gas thermochromatography in 2001 , using <unk> and <unk> as a reference . During the experiment , 5 hassium atoms were synthesized using the reaction 248Cm ( 26Mg , 5n ) 269Hs . They were then <unk> and oxidized in a mixture of helium and oxygen gas to form the tetroxide . 
 269Hs + 2 O2 → <unk> 
 The measured deposition temperature indicated that hassium ( VIII ) oxide is less volatile than osmium tetroxide , OsO4 , and places hassium firmly in group 8 . However , the enthalpy of adsorption for HsO4 measured , ( − 46 ± 2 ) kJ / mol , was significantly lower than what was predicted , ( − 36 @.@ 7 ± 1 @.@ 5 ) kJ / mol , indicating that OsO4 was more volatile than HsO4 , contradicting earlier calculations , which implied that they should have very similar <unk> . For comparison , the value for OsO4 is ( − 39 ± 1 ) kJ / mol . It is possible that hassium tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals ( silicon nitride and silicon dioxide ) used for the detector ; further research is required , including more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of 269Hs and comparisons with RuO4 in addition to OsO4 . 
 In 2004 scientists reacted hassium tetroxide and sodium hydroxide to form sodium hassate ( VIII ) , a reaction well @-@ known with osmium . This was the first acid @-@ base reaction with a hassium compound , forming sodium hassate ( VIII ) : 
 <unk> 
 4 + 2 NaOH → Na 
 2 [ <unk> 
 4 ( OH ) 
 2 ] 
 The team from the University of Mainz are planning to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new <unk> facility at the GSI . The current aim is to use the reaction 226Ra ( 48Ca , 4n ) 270Hs . In addition , scientists at the GSI are hoping to utilize <unk> to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium ( II ) compound hassocene , Hs ( C5H5 ) 2 , using the reaction 226Ra ( 48Ca , xn ) . This compound is analogous to the lighter ferrocene , ruthenocene , and osmocene , and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene . <unk> was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of + 2 ( although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes ) rather than the high + 8 state which had previously been investigated , and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state . Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes , so that trends could be more easily determined , and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier . <unk> should be a stable and highly volatile compound .

 Isiah " Ike " Leggett ( born July 25 , 1944 ) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland , currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County , Maryland . He is a member of the Democratic Party . 
 Born in Deweyville , Texas , Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge , Louisiana and , after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army , earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington , D.C. In 1986 , he became the first African @-@ American elected to the county council in Montgomery County , Maryland and served on the council through 2002 . He remains the only African @-@ American ever elected to that body at @-@ large . 
 For two years , Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again . Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006 , the first African @-@ American to hold that office . Since taking office , Leggett has worked to put the County ’ s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety , and helping the most vulnerable . In the four years before Leggett took office , County spending grew by over 40 percent . 
 In his first five years in office , Montgomery County 's spending was held to zero percent . Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008 , Leggett closed budget gaps of over $ 2 @.@ 6 billion , eliminating 10 percent of County government positions , while imposing furloughs ( including himself ) , wage freezes , and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money . At the same time , Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County , establishing a <unk> office to ensure “ real time ” performance of County services , and set up a multi @-@ agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at @-@ risk youth . 
 Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County 's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the " 311 " Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services . During Leggett 's first eight years , serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service 's response times to Montgomery County 's fires improved dramatically . Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four @-@ year term in 2014 . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Leggett was born on July 25 , 1944 in Deweyville , Texas and grew up with twelve siblings in Alexandria , Louisiana . In Alexandria , he played football for Peabody Magnet High School . He attended Southern University in Baton Rouge , working through school as a groundskeeper in a work @-@ study program and graduating in 1967 . In his time as an undergraduate , he was a student leader in the civil rights movement and twice met Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr . He led the on @-@ campus civil rights movement while at the same time commanding the Southern University Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) unit . He was elected president of his class during his senior year and is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity , the first intercollegiate fraternity established for African @-@ Americans . In 1968 , Leggett served as a captain in the United States Army during the Vietnam War , first in combat with a Military Advisory Unit attached to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and then as a public affairs officer with the 7th Support Battalion / 199th Light Infantry Brigade . He was awarded the Bronze Star for Service . In 1974 , he received Master of Arts and Juris Doctor degrees from Howard University in Washington , D.C. , graduating first in his law school class , followed soon after by a Master of Laws degree from George Washington University . He returned to Howard as a professor in their law school in 1976 , and continued teaching at the law school through his election as County Executive in 2006 , with the exception of a stint as a White House Fellow under President Jimmy Carter in 1977 . Leggett is currently married to his second wife , Catherine . 
 = = Career = = 
 Leggett 's first participation in county government was as an appointed member of the Montgomery County Human Relations Committee , on which he served from 1979 to 1986 . He was later named Chair of the Committee . In 1986 , he was elected as an at @-@ large member of the Montgomery County Council , becoming the first African @-@ American ever to serve on the council . To this day , he is the only African @-@ American ever elected to county office at large . He was re @-@ elected to the seat three more times , and served three one @-@ year terms as council president . During his time on the council , he chaired the council 's transportation and environment committee and played a role in passage of a county living wage law and a public smoking ban . In 1992 , a former county council aide of Leggett 's accused him of sexual harassment in a widely publicized case , but the accusation was dismissed by a jury . In 2002 , Leggett declined to run for re @-@ election to the county council . He was widely viewed as a potential running mate for Democratic nominee Kathleen Kennedy Townsend in that year 's gubernatorial race . However , Townsend chose Admiral Charles R. Larson instead . Townsend and Larson lost in November when Maryland elected Robert Ehrlich to be its first Republican governor in 40 years and Lieutenant Governor Michael S. Steele as its first African @-@ American statewide elected official . When his term on the council was completed in December of that year , Leggett was elected as chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party . Leggett 's chairmanship was seen by some Democratic activists as important to maintaining the African @-@ American base of the Maryland Democratic Party and rebuilding the party 's strength following the 2002 gubernatorial loss .

 Following the election of 2004 , Maryland politicians started announcing their intentions for the 2006 elections . Among them was three @-@ term County Executive Doug Duncan , who was in the early stages of a run for governor . In December 2004 , Leggett left his position as Chair of the Maryland Democratic Party to begin a campaign to replace Duncan as Montgomery County Executive . In the Democratic primary election Leggett squared off against a former colleague from the council , Steve Silverman . Leggett and Silverman engaged in a long series of debates beginning almost a year before the election . But despite being outspent by Silverman by more than five to one , Leggett won the Democratic nomination for executive by 61 @.@ 3 percent to 35 @.@ 5 percent in the primary election on September 12 , 2006 . He then faced Republican nominee Chuck Floyd and independent anti @-@ tax advocate Robin <unk> in the general election . Leggett easily won the November election with 68 percent of the vote to Floyd 's 22 percent and 10 percent for <unk> . He carried 239 of the County 's 241 voting precincts . 
 = = = First term as county executive = = = 
 In the early days of his administration , Leggett took the lead on a number of controversial issues . To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward , he proposed a statewide gas tax increase , a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive . This proposal , which happened in the midst of a state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county , was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O 'Malley . Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term . 
 Leggett also solved a vexing problem involving a hiring site for day laborers from the city of Gaithersburg and the surrounding <unk> area . During the term of Leggett 's predecessor Doug Duncan , Gaithersburg had struggled to find space within the city limits that the county could lease for use as a location where the day laborers could wait for employers . The owners of virtually all of the more than 30 sites considered by the city government had refused to grant a lease for this purpose , and in the one case where the property owner was willing to consider the use , the county 's efforts to lease the property fell through after the property owner backed out . The debate became caught up in a larger national debate about the role of illegal immigrants in American society . Leggett located a site for day laborer center on county @-@ owned land with his first several months in office .. Despite opposition from anti @-@ immigrant voices , the Center has served hundreds of workers and employers without incident . 
 During his first term Leggett reduced County spending increases to 14 percent in the year before he took office to , first , 7 percent and then 1 @.@ 6 percent in his first two years . He increased the County investment in preserving and creating affordable housing while also creating one of the nation 's most aggressive campaigns to combat and track home foreclosures . He won approval of the right of the County to have " first refusal " on properties to preserve affordable housing and established a first @-@ ever Tenants Work Group to identify and advocate for the County 's 100 @,@ 000 renters . His <unk> project tracked County departments ' performance in real @-@ time , saving $ 7 million in overtime pay in its first year . He also opened a 311 call center to improve access to County services by providing a single number to call . 
 Responding the growing national economic recession , Leggett closed budget gaps of more than $ 1 @.@ 2 billion in his first term , eliminating hundreds of jobs and , in 2008 , increasing property taxes beyond the County Charter limit . His 11 @-@ point economic package sought to help County businesses hit by the recession by easing regulatory burdens . He launched his Smart Growth Initiative , a bold program to leverage and swap County @-@ owned properties to update County facilities while opening up economic development and transit @-@ oriented housing around the Shady Grove Metro and in the heart of the County 's biotech industry . Leggett also put down blueprints for the future with biotechnology and green business task forces . Other business expansion was pursued in County missions to Israel , India , Korea , and China . 
 Leggett also held the County 's first " Senior Summit " to focus attention on the County 's growing older population , expanded County recycling programs to the broadest in the region , and won approval of a new Fillmore music and entertainment center in Silver Spring . A broad program of code enforcement reforms sought to limit commercial incursions into the County 's residential neighborhoods and a first @-@ ever " road inventory " evaluated tens of thousands of miles of County roads . He established a County Veterans Commission to reach out to the estimated 50 @,@ 000 veterans and their families and worked closely with the State , the federal government , and surrounding neighborhoods to deal with the impact of the consolidation of Walter Reed Medical Center into the Bethesda Naval Hospital as called for under the Base Realignment & Closure Commission . Under Leggett 's leadership the County responded aggressively to the outbreak of the H1N1 virus in 2009 . 
 When the County 's traffic management computer went down for 36 hours in November 2009 , snarling traffic throughout the County , Leggett advanced needed funding for a new system . During his first term , he sought and won Council approval for an Emergency Medical Services transport fee that would allow the County Fire & Rescue Service to bill insurance companies for the cost of ambulance transports at no cost to County residents . Leggett argued it would earn the County up to $ 15 million more annually to devote to Fire & Rescue . County volunteer fire departments took the measure to voter referendum in November 2010 and overturned the law with 53 percent in favor of repeal in a bitter campaign that pitted Leggett and career County firefighters versus volunteers . 
 = = = Second term as county executive = = = 
 Leggett was unopposed in the 2010 Democratic Party primary for County Executive . In the general election , he was opposed by Republican Party candidate Douglas Rosenfeld . In the November balloting , Leggett won reelection with 66 percent of the vote to 34 percent for Rosenfeld , carrying 227 of the County 's 252 precincts . 
 Leggett began his second term with the County still deeply in the shadow of the Great Recession . He continued to hold down County spending and County government employment while his fiscal stewardship helped the County maintain its AAA bond rating , despite federal cutbacks and sequestration . He continued to give priority to education , public safety and help for the County 's most vulnerable . 
 Among his initiatives was the formation of a blue @-@ ribbon Pepco Work Group to critique the utility 's performance shortfalls during summer and winter storms and suggest improvements . The 400 @-@ page report supported efforts by the Maryland Public Service Commission to require greater infrastructure , emergency response , and communication capabilities . Leggett and the County also fought a series of Pepco rate requests , helping to limit increases for consumers . Responding to the upsurge in need with the recession , Leggett 's Health & Human Services department established three new Neighborhood Opportunity Centers to reach out to at @-@ risk families in County neighborhoods . Leggett boosted the number of police assigned to County schools , but failed in his 2011 effort to protect children and youth with an overnight youth curfew , with the County Council not allowing the proposal to come to a vote . 
 Following an increase in the State gas tax , for which Leggett was a longtime advocate , Leggett win more than $ 1 billion in State funding for County transportation projects . He also led an effort , working with Prince George 's and Baltimore counties to establish a new County / State matching fund program to boost school construction to meet rising demand . He opened five new fire stations in his first eight years , compared with only three opened in the 12 years before he took office . He won Council approval once more for an Emergency Medical Services transport fee and , after securing support from volunteer fire companies who defeated it in the 2010 referendum , the program went into effect . Leggett supported an increase in Montgomery County 's minimum wage to $ 11 @.@ 50 an hour in 2013 . Between 2010 and 2014 Montgomery County outperformed neighboring Fairfax County and the District of Columbia in job growth . 
 In 2011 , Montgomery County leased farmland owned by the public school system in Potomac in order to build soccer fields to meet a critical shortfall in such fields in the Down County area . This public / private partnership was challenged by residents of the Brickyard Road neighborhood , who earlier had opposed affordable housing on the site and now opposed the public / private partnership Leggett advanced to build and maintain the fields . In 2013 the County abandoned the effort and returned the land to the school system . 
 In 2013 Leggett was elected president of the County Executives of America . In spring of that year , he unveiled a joint County / State / Federal effort to build the Cybersecurity Center for Excellence in <unk> which he said would establish Montgomery County as a national center for civilian cybersecurity work . In 2013 , Leggett visited China to advance economic development cooperation and established a " Sister City " relationship with the city of Xi 'an . A similar business development trip in 2014 to India included visits to high @-@ tech firms , embracing Hyderabad as a Sister City , and included a visit on the way back to Taiwan . 
 Over Leggett 's first eight years , County taxes as a percentage of County residents ' income went down by 10 percent . 
 = = = Third term as county executive = = = 
 Leggett easily won the Democratic nomination for a third term , gaining 45 percent of the vote to 33 percent for former county executive Doug Duncan and 22 percent for councilmember Phil Andrews , and winning 80 percent of county precincts . In the fall general election Leggett defeated the Republican candidate James <unk> by 65 @-@ 35 percent , winning 212 of 245 voting precincts . 
 In his inaugural address , Leggett outlined a Six @-@ Point Economic Plan designed to encourage investment and job growth in the county , touching on filling vacant office space , boosting start @-@ up tech ventures , guaranteeing a 30 @-@ day turn @-@ around time for permitting of ready new projects and development , improving work @-@ force development , and introducing a new , high @-@ speed fiber network . The proposal also included the development of an Independent Transit Authority to expand transportation options , enhance job growth from planned projects and grow the County 's tax base . 
 Leggett was elected as president of the Maryland Association of Counties in January 2015 . 
 = Jim Raynor = 
 General James Eugene " Jim " Raynor is a fictional character and a major protagonist in Blizzard Entertainment 's science fiction StarCraft series . Raynor is a predominant character in the science fiction real @-@ time strategy video games StarCraft and Brood War , and is a player character in StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty . Outside video games , Raynor appears in the novels Liberty 's Crusade and Queen of Blades , while his backstory is explored in the novels Heaven 's Devils and Devil 's Due . Robert Clotworthy voices the character in all video game appearances . 
 Created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney , Raynor is loosely based on a character of the same name in the 1991 film Rush . Metzen conceived Raynor to represent the ordinary man in a series populated with politically motivated characters . Raynor 's physical appearance was designed by Metzen himself . A Terran in his thirties , Raynor is a former soldier and outlaw who eventually becomes a marshal on a backwater colony world . Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk 's revolution against the oppressive Terran Confederacy but becomes disillusioned with Mengsk 's genocidal tactics , forming his own paramilitary group to challenge Mengsk 's tyranny . 
 The character has received a positive critical response ; Raynor 's depiction in StarCraft and Brood War was praised for its character depth and the quality of Clotworthy 's voice acting . One survey by GameSpot put Raynor as one of the top ten heroes in video gaming . 
 = = Character design = = 
 The character of Raynor was originally devised by Chris Metzen and James Phinney , with his depiction as a rough @-@ living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen . In an interview , Raynor 's voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited one piece of this concept art in how he decided to voice the character . The art , showing Raynor on a <unk> and outfitted with futuristic weaponry , gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people " wouldn 't mess with " , he would not have to raise his voice as " other characters [ would ] shut up and listen " or face the consequences . Clotworthy also stated that in the event that a StarCraft film was produced , he believed Clive Owen would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to him " being dangerous " . 
 Raynor 's character is based on a character of the same name in the film Rush , whom Chris Metzen describes as a " gritty , undercover cop " . Metzen also states that Raynor is a personal favorite character of his , as although he is only an ordinary man , he has personally met and worked with the most influential characters in the series . In StarCraft II , Raynor was again voiced by Robert Clotworthy . 
 The tactical shooter StarCraft : Ghost was to feature Raynor as Clotworthy stated he was brought in to voice the character ; however , the game has been postponed indefinitely and Raynor 's role has not been revealed . Bill Roper , Blizzard North 's former vice president , stated that the game would not center on Kerrigan or Raynor . 
 = = Attributes = = 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Despite an often laid back and sarcastic demeanor , Raynor is described in the novel Liberty 's Crusade as a decent and honorable man that is well liked by those under his command . Robert Clotworthy noted that as such , Raynor is always willing to do the right thing , no matter how difficult it may be . His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan — the series ' main antagonist — despite his former love for her early in the story arc is one of the sacrifices that in Clotworthy 's eyes makes Raynor a " true hero in the purest sense of the word " . He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause , willing to put it all at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves . It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted . Although often displaying an overzealous attitude , Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day , even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into a bad situation . Raynor himself acknowledges that he is not the most intelligent man there is , but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds . 
 = = = Depiction = = = 
 Raynor is only ever depicted by his unit portrait through the course of StarCraft and Brood War . He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character , wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes , which are further described in the novels as well @-@ worn and rough in appearance . Raynor has a neatly trimmed moustache and beard , which by the time of StarCraft II are beginning to grey . His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms . In addition , a number of pieces of concept art depict Raynor smoking . Unlike other characters , Raynor isn 't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series , with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour . Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture <unk> , which he uses for transport and in open land combat .

 Raynor 's first appearance is in the 1998 title StarCraft . Raynor is a marshall on the Confederate fringe colony of Mar Sara , where he is attempting to defend the population from an expanding Zerg infestation . As the Confederacy abandons Mar Sara to its fate , Arcturus Mengsk and his rebel Sons of Korhal arrive to evacuate the colony . Thoroughly disillusioned with the Confederacy , Raynor and his colonial militia join the Sons of Korhal . During his time with the rebels , Raynor falls in love with Mengsk 's second @-@ in @-@ command , psychic assassin Sarah Kerrigan . However , when Mengsk uses Zerg @-@ attracting Confederate technology to destroy the Confederate capital Tarsonis and abandons Kerrigan on Tarsonis to the Zerg , Raynor and his militia desert , hijacking Mengsk 's flagship Hyperion in the process . Raynor 's men , labelling themselves " Raynor 's Raiders " , take it upon themselves to strike at Mengsk , who has crowned himself emperor of the new Terran Dominion . Soon after , Raynor is lured to the planet Char by psychic dreams . He discovers the source is Kerrigan , who has been captured and infested by the Zerg . Raynor tries to save her , but to no avail ; he and his men end up stranded on Char for months . Raynor discovers a Protoss force led by high templar Tassadar and the dark templar Zeratul is also on Char , likewise attracted by Kerrigan 's psychic emanations and subsequently stranded . The two groups ally and hold out against Kerrigan and the Zerg until rescue arrives with forces from the Protoss homeworld of Aiur . Raynor and his remaining Raiders accompany Tassadar back to Aiur , which has fallen prey to Zerg invasion , and help the Protoss destroy the gargantuan Zerg Overmind .

 Raynor returns in Brood War , having earned the trust of the Protoss and befriended the templar warrior Fenix . The Raiders and Fenix 's forces remain on Aiur as a rearguard while the surviving Protoss evacuate their homeworld , now devastated and overrun by the Zerg , for the dark templar world of Shakuras . Raynor is later contacted by Kerrigan , who convinces them to join with her against the United Earth Directorate ( UED ) , which has arrived to pacify the sector by any means necessary . Raynor and Fenix reluctantly prevent Mengsk 's capture by the UED , and with Kerrigan 's Zerg rout the UED from the Dominion throne world of Korhal . However , Kerrigan turns on her allies , launching a surprise attack against both the Dominion and the Raiders . Although the Hyperion escapes the planet , Fenix is killed in the attack ; an outraged Raynor vows that Kerrigan will die by his hands . 
 = = = = StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty = = = = 
 The 2010 sequel Wings of Liberty takes place four years later , where the Raiders are still resisting the renewed Dominion , but are low on morale and resources , while their efforts are marginalised by Dominion media . Raynor , blaming himself for Kerrigan 's transformation and Fenix 's death , has started drinking . He returns to Mar Sara , where he is approached by a former associate , Tychus Findlay , with a business proposition to acquire Xel 'Naga artifacts for a research group , the Moebius Foundation . The artifacts , guarded by an extremist faction of Protoss , are also sought by Kerrigan , who launches a vast invasion of the Dominion to find them . Between Missions Zeratul appears and tells Raynor that Kerrigan must survive the coming battles " or all is lost " , as she will be pivotal to every species surviving a coming enemy worse than even the Zerg . To prove his point he leaves a protoss memory device , through which Raynor sees <unk> journey following an ancient prophecy and the vision of an alternate timelines future . In this Vision Kerrigan had died and the swarm ( under control of an unknown entity ) is wiping out the last remaining Protoss - with the Humans having already fallen and the Zerg being wiped out after their victory . 
 Eventually accumulating all the artifacts , the Raiders discover that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion , Valerian Mengsk ; though the Hyperion crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy , Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan 's infestation . Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg , the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated ; upon detonating , it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again . However , Findlay , acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk , attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan , forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan .

 Following the battle of Char , in Heart of the Swarm , Raynor and Kerrigan are taken to a secret lab by Valerian to evaluate the extension of Kerrigan 's current power to control the <unk> , until it is attacked by Dominion forces . Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed , much to Kerrigan 's grief . However , Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody , using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm , now reunited under her command , away from Dominion Territory . Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders ' help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first for choosing to abandon her humanity in order to save him , he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk , saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact , ultimately leading to Mengsk 's death at her hands . Reconciled with Kerrigan , Raynor bids farewell to her as she leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon , the fallen Xel 'Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races .

 Several StarCraft novels also feature Raynor ; he is a prominent character in Liberty 's Crusade , which reveals that Raynor had a wife and son . His son exhibited psychic potential and consequently is conscripted for the Confederate ghost program , where the intense training ultimately kills him . Afterward , Raynor 's wife Liddy dies after a period of depression and illness . As a result , Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops a penchant for operating alone . He is also the primary protagonist in Queen of Blades , a novelization of the events of StarCraft 's Episode II in which Raynor attempts to rescue Sarah Kerrigan from the Zerg on Char and eventually allies with the high templar Tassadar and renegade dark templar Zeratul , facilitating the reconciliation between the two estranged Protoss . More recently , his early military and criminal history , including his association with Tychus Findlay , were explored in the novels Heaven 's Devils and Devil 's Due . Also in Devil 's Due , Raynor 's father died by machine error . Raynor 's mother died at day when Raynor visited her .

 The character of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike . Gaming 's Edge described Raynor as an " almost prototypical action movie figure " with a " healthy dose of arrogance " who despite always attempting to do the morally right thing invariably ends up with " the worst end of the deal " due to circumstances beyond his control . The article also puts forward the case that " it would be difficult not to admire Raynor , if for no other reason than his persistence " in the face of abandonment , isolation and betrayal . In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro , the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they " were actually talking to me " and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor , commenting " When was the last time you could say that about a character in a strategy game ?

 = International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights = 
 The International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966 , and in force from 3 January 1976 . It commits its parties to work toward the granting of economic , social , and cultural rights ( <unk> ) to the Non @-@ Self @-@ Governing and Trust Territories and individuals , including labour rights and the right to health , the right to education , and the right to an adequate standard of living . As of 2015 , the Covenant has 164 parties . A further six countries , including the United States , have signed but not ratified the Covenant . 
 The ICESCR is part of the International Bill of Human Rights , along with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) , including the latter 's first and second Optional Protocols . 
 The Covenant is monitored by the UN Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
 = = Genesis = = 
 The ICESCR has its roots in the same process that led to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . A " Declaration on the Essential Rights of Man " had been proposed at the 1945 San Francisco Conference which led to the founding of the United Nations , and the Economic and Social Council was given the task of drafting it . Early on in the process , the document was split into a declaration setting forth general principles of human rights , and a convention or covenant containing binding commitments . The former evolved into the UDHR and was adopted on 10 December 1948 . 
 Drafting continued on the convention , but there remained significant differences between UN members on the relative importance of negative civil and political versus positive economic , social and cultural rights . These eventually caused the convention to be split into two separate covenants , " one to contain civil and political rights and the other to contain economic , social and cultural rights . " The two covenants were to contain as many similar provisions as possible , and be opened for signature simultaneously . Each would also contain an article on the right of all peoples to self @-@ determination . 
 The States Parties to the present Covenant , including those having responsibility for the administration of Non @-@ Self @-@ Governing and Trust Territories , shall promote the realization of the right of self @-@ determination , and shall respect that right , in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations . 
 The first document became the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and the second the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . The drafts were presented to the UN General Assembly for discussion in 1954 , and adopted in 1966 . 
 = = Summary = = 
 The Covenant follows the structure of the UDHR and the ICCPR , with a preamble and thirty @-@ one articles , divided into five parts . 
 Part 1 ( Article 1 ) recognises the right of all peoples to self @-@ determination , including the right to " freely determine their political status " , pursue their economic , social and cultural goals , and manage and dispose of their own resources . It recognises a negative right of a people not to be deprived of its means of subsistence , and imposes an obligation on those parties still responsible for non @-@ self governing and trust territories ( colonies ) to encourage and respect their self @-@ determination . 
 Part 2 ( Articles 2 – 5 ) establishes the principle of " progressive realisation " – see below . It also requires the rights be recognised " without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status " . The rights can only be limited by law , in a manner compatible with the nature of the rights , and only for the purpose of " promoting the general welfare in a democratic society " . 
 Part 3 ( Articles 6 – 15 ) lists the rights themselves . These include rights to 
 work , under " just and favourable conditions " , with the right to form and join trade unions ( Articles 6 , 7 , and 8 ) ; 
 social security , including social insurance ( Article 9 ) ; 
 family life , including paid parental leave and the protection of children ( Article 10 ) ; 
 an adequate standard of living , including adequate food , clothing and housing , and the " continuous improvement of living conditions " ( Article 11 ) ; 
 health , specifically " the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health " ( Article 12 ) ; 
 education , including free universal primary education , generally available secondary education and equally accessible higher education . This should be directed to " the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity " , and enable all persons to participate effectively in society ( Articles 13 and 14 ) ; 
 participation in cultural life ( Article 15 ) . 
 Many of these rights include specific actions which must be undertaken to realise them . 
 Part 4 ( Articles 16 – 25 ) governs reporting and monitoring of the Covenant and the steps taken by the parties to implement it . It also allows the monitoring body – originally the United Nations Economic and Social Council – now the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights – see below – to make general recommendations to the UN General Assembly on appropriate measures to realise the rights ( Article 21 ) 
 Part 5 ( Articles 26 – 31 ) governs ratification , entry into force , and amendment of the Covenant . 
 = = Core provisions = = 
 = = = Principle of progressive realisation = = = 
 Article 2 of the Covenant imposes a duty on all parties to 
 take steps ... to the maximum of its available resources , with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means , including particularly the adoption of legislative measures . 
 This is known as the principle of " progressive realisation " . It acknowledges that some of the rights ( for example , the right to health ) may be difficult in practice to achieve in a short period of time , and that states may be subject to resource constraints , but requires them to act as best they can within their means . 
 The principle differs from that of the ICCPR , which obliges parties to " respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction " the rights in that Convention . However , it does not render the Covenant meaningless . The requirement to " take steps " imposes a continuing obligation to work towards the realisation of the rights . It also rules out deliberately regressive measures which impede that goal . The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights also interprets the principle as imposing minimum core obligations to provide , at the least , minimum essential levels of each of the rights . If resources are highly constrained , this should include the use of targeted programmes aimed at the vulnerable . 
 The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights regards legislation as an indispensable means for realising the rights which is unlikely to be limited by resource constraints . The enacting of anti @-@ discrimination provisions and the establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means . Some provisions , such as anti @-@ discrimination laws , are already required under other human rights instruments , such as the ICCPR . 
 = = = Labor rights = = = 
 Article 6 of the Covenant recognises the right to work , defined as the opportunity of everyone to gain their living by freely chosen or accepted work . Parties are required to take " appropriate steps " to safeguard this right , including technical and vocational training and economic policies aimed at steady economic development and ultimately full employment . The right implies parties must guarantee equal access to employment and protect workers from being unfairly deprived of employment . They must prevent discrimination in the workplace and ensure access for the disadvantaged . The fact that work must be freely chosen or accepted means parties must prohibit forced or child labor . 
 The work referred to in Article 6 must be decent work . This is effectively defined by Article 7 of the Covenant , which recognises the right of everyone to " just and favourable " working conditions . These are in turn defined as fair wages with equal pay for equal work , sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their dependants ; safe working conditions ; equal opportunity in the workplace ; and sufficient rest and leisure , including limited working hours and regular , paid holidays . 
 Article 8 recognises the right of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike . It allows these rights to be restricted for members of the armed forces , police , or government administrators . Several parties have placed reservations on this clause , allowing it to be interpreted in a manner consistent with their constitutions ( e.g. , China , Mexico ) , or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters ( e.g. , Japan ) . 
 = = = Right to social security = = = 
 Article 9 of the Covenant recognizes " the right of everyone to social security , including social insurance " . It requires parties to provide some form of social insurance scheme to protect people against the risks of sickness , disability , maternity , employment injury , unemployment or old age ; to provide for survivors , orphans , and those who cannot afford health care ; and to ensure that families are adequately supported . Benefits from such a scheme must be adequate , accessible to all , and provided without discrimination . The Covenant does not restrict the form of the scheme , and both contributory and non @-@ contributory schemes are permissible ( as are community @-@ based and mutual schemes ) . 
 The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has noted persistent problems with the implementation of this right , with very low levels of access . 
 Several parties , including France and Monaco , have reservations allowing them to set residence requirements in order to qualify for social benefits . The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights permits such restrictions , provided they are proportionate and reasonable . 
 = = = Right to family life = = = 
 Article 10 of the Covenant recognises the family as " the natural and fundamental group unit of society " , and requires parties to accord it " the widest possible protection and assistance " . Parties must ensure that their citizens are free to establish families and that marriages are freely contracted and not forced . Parties must also provide paid leave or adequate social security to mothers before and after childbirth , an obligation which overlaps with that of Article 9 . Finally , parties must take " special measures " to protect children from economic or social exploitation , including setting a minimum age of employment and barring children from dangerous and harmful occupations . 
 = = = Right to an adequate standard of living = = = 
 Article 11 recognises the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living . This includes , but is not limited to , the right to adequate food , clothing , housing , and " the continuous improvement of living conditions " . It also creates an obligation on parties to work together to eliminate world hunger . 
 The right to adequate food , also referred to as the right to food , is interpreted as requiring " the availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals , free from adverse substances , and acceptable within a given culture " . This must be accessible to all , implying an obligation to provide special programmes for the vulnerable . This must also ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need , taking into account the problems of food @-@ importing and food @-@ exporting countries . The right to adequate food also implies a right to water . 
 The right to adequate housing , also referred to as the right to housing , is " the right to live somewhere in security , peace and dignity " . It requires " adequate privacy , adequate space , adequate security , adequate lighting and ventilation , adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities – all at a reasonable cost " . Parties must ensure security of tenure and that access is free of discrimination , and progressively work to eliminate homelessness . Forced evictions , defined as " the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals , families and / or communities from the homes and / or land which they occupy , without the provision of , and access to , appropriate forms of legal or other protection " , are a prima facie violation of the Covenant . 
 The right to adequate clothing , also referred to as the right to clothing , has not been authoritatively defined and has received little in the way of academic commentary or international discussion . What is considered " adequate " has only been discussed in specific contexts , such as refugees , the disabled , the elderly , or workers . 
 = = = Right to health = = = 
 Article 12 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to " the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health " . " Health " is understood not just as a right to be healthy , but as a right to control ones own health and body ( including reproduction ) , and be free from interference such as torture or medical experimentation . States must protect this right by ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction has access to the underlying determinants of health , such as clean water , sanitation , food , nutrition and housing , and through a comprehensive system of healthcare , which is available to everyone without discrimination , and economically accessible to all . 
 Article 12 @.@ 2 requires parties to take specific steps to improve the health of their citizens , including reducing infant mortality and improving child health , improving environmental and workplace health , preventing , controlling and treating epidemic diseases , and creating conditions to ensure equal and timely access to medical services for all . These are considered to be " illustrative , non @-@ exhaustive examples " , rather than a complete statement of parties ' obligations . 
 The right to health is interpreted as requiring parties to respect women 's ' reproductive rights , by not limiting access to contraception or " censoring , withholding or intentionally misrepresenting " information about sexual health . They must also ensure that women are protected from harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation . 
 Right to health is inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health , such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation , an adequate supply of safe food , nutrition and housing , healthy occupational and environmental conditions . 
 = = = Right to free education = = = 
 Article 13 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to free education ( free for the primary level and " the progressive introduction of free education " for the secondary and higher levels ) . This is to be directed towards " the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity " , and enable all persons to participate effectively in society . Education is seen both as a human right and as " an indispensable means of realizing other human rights " , and so this is one of the longest and most important articles of the Covenant . 
 Article 13 @.@ 2 lists a number of specific steps parties are required to pursue to realise the right of education . These include the provision of free , universal and compulsory primary education , " generally available and accessible " secondary education in various forms ( including technical and vocational training ) , and equally accessible higher education . All of these must be available to all without discrimination . Parties must also develop a school system ( though it may be public , private , or mixed ) , encourage or provide scholarships for disadvantaged groups . Parties are required to make education free at all levels , either immediately or progressively ; " [ p ] <unk> education shall be compulsory and available free to all " ; secondary education " shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means , and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education " ; and " [ h ] <unk> education shall be made equally accessible to all , on the basis of capacity , by every appropriate means , and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education " . 
 Articles 13 @.@ 3 and 13 @.@ 4 require parties to respect the educational freedom of parents by allowing them to choose and establish private educational institutions for their children , also referred to as freedom of education . It also recognises the right of parents to " ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions " . This is interpreted as requiring public schools to respect the freedom of religion and conscience of their students , and as forbidding instruction in a particular religion or belief system unless non @-@ discriminatory exemptions and alternatives are available . 
 The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights interpret the Covenant as also requiring states to respect the academic freedom of staff and students , as this is vital for the educational process . It also considers corporal punishment in schools to be inconsistent with the Covenant 's underlying principle of the dignity of the individual . 
 Article 14 of the Covenant requires those parties which have not yet established a system of free compulsory primary education , to rapidly adopt a detailed plan of action for its introduction " within a reasonable number of years " . 
 = = = Right to participation in cultural life = = = 
 Article 15 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to participate in cultural life , enjoy the benefits of scientific progress , and to benefit from the protection of the moral and material rights to any scientific discovery or artistic work they have created . The latter clause is sometimes seen as requiring the protection of intellectual property , but the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights interprets it as primarily protecting the moral rights of authors and " proclaim [ ing ] the intrinsically personal character of every creation of the human mind and the ensuing durable link between creators and their creations " . It thus requires parties to respect the right of authors to be recognised as the creator of a work . The material rights are interpreted as being part of the right to an adequate standard of living , and " need not extend over the entire lifespan of an author . " 
 Parties must also work to promote the conservation , development and diffusion of science and culture , " respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity " , and encourage international contacts and cooperation in these fields . 
 = = Reservations = = 
 A number of parties have made reservations and interpretative declarations to their application of the Covenant . 
 Algeria interprets parts of Article 13 , protecting the liberty of parents to freely choose or establish suitable educational institutions , so as not to " impair its right freely to organize its educational system . " 
 Bangladesh interprets the self @-@ determination clause in Article 1 as applying in the historical context of colonialism . It also reserves the right to interpret the labour rights in Articles 7 and 8 and the non @-@ discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within the context of its constitution and domestic law . 
 Belgium interprets non @-@ discrimination as to national origin as " not necessarily implying an obligation on States automatically to guarantee to foreigners the same rights as to their nationals . The term should be understood to refer to the elimination of any arbitrary behaviour but not of differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in conformity with the principles prevailing in democratic societies . " 
 China restricts labour rights in Article 8 in a manner consistent with its constitution and domestic law . 
 Egypt accepts the Covenant only to the extent it does not conflict with Islamic Sharia law . Sharia is " a primary source of legislation " under Article 2 of both the suspended 1973 Constitution and the 2011 Provisional Constitutional Declaration . 
 France views the Covenant as subservient to the UN Charter . It also reserves the right to govern the access of aliens to employment , social security , and other benefits . 
 India interprets the right of self @-@ determination as applying " only to the peoples under foreign domination " and not to apply to peoples within sovereign nation @-@ states . It also interprets the limitation of rights clause and the rights of equal opportunity in the workplace within the context of its constitution . 
 Indonesia interprets the self @-@ determination clause ( Article 1 ) within the context of other international law and as not applying to peoples within a sovereign nation @-@ state . 
 Ireland reserves the right to promote the Irish language . 
 Japan reserved the right not to be bound to progressively introduce free secondary and higher education , the right to strike for public servant and the remuneration on public holidays . 
 Kuwait interprets the non @-@ discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within its constitution and laws , and reserves the right to social security to apply only to Kuwaitis . It also reserves the right to forbid strikes . 
 Mexico restricts the labour rights in Article 8 within the context of its constitution and laws . 
 Monaco interprets the principle of non @-@ discrimination on the grounds of national origin as " not necessarily implying an automatic obligation on the part of States to guarantee foreigners the same rights as their nationals " , and reserves the right to set residence requirements on the rights to work , health , education , and social security . 
 New Zealand reserved the right not to apply Article 8 ( the right to form and join trade unions ) insofar as existing measures ( which at the time included compulsory unionism and encouraged arbitration of disputes ) were incompatible with it . 
 Norway reserves the right to strike so as to allow for compulsory arbitration of some labour disputes . 
 Pakistan has a general reservation to interpret the Covenant within the framework of its constitution . 
 Thailand interprets the right to self @-@ determination within the framework of other international law . 
 Trinidad and Tobago reserves the right to restrict the right to strike of those engaged in essential occupations . 
 Turkey will implement the Covenant subject to the UN Charter . It also reserves the right to interpret and implement the right of parents to choose and establish educational institutions in a manner compatible with its constitution . 
 United Kingdom views the Covenant as subservient to the UN Charter . It made several reservations regarding its overseas territories . 
 United States – Amnesty International writes that " The United States signed the Covenant in 1979 under the Carter administration but is not fully bound by it until it is ratified . For political reasons , the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate , which must give its ' advice and consent ' before the US can ratify a treaty . The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic , social , and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore should not be the object of binding treaties . The Clinton Administration did not deny the nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant . The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration . " The Obama Administration stated " The Administration does not seek action at this time " on the Covenant . The Heritage Foundation , a critical conservative think tank , argues that signing it would obligate the introduction of policies that it opposes such as universal health care . 
 = = Optional Protocol = = 
 The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights is a side @-@ agreement to the Covenant which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights to consider complaints from individuals . 
 The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 2008 . It was opened for signature on 24 September 2009 , and as of February 2013 has been signed by 40 parties and ratified by 10 . Having passed the threshold of required ratifications it has entered into force on 5 May 2013 .

 The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Covenant . It consists of 18 independent human rights experts , elected for four @-@ year terms , with half the members elected every two years . 
 Unlike other human rights monitoring bodies , the Committee was not established by the treaty it oversees . Rather , it was established by the Economic and Social Council following the failure of two previous monitoring bodies . 
 All states parties are required to submit regular reports to the Committee outlining the legislative , judicial , policy and other measures they have taken to implement the rights affirmed in the Covenant . The first report is due within two years of ratifying the Covenant ; thereafter reports are due every five years . The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of “ concluding observations ” . 
 The Committee typically meets every May and November in Geneva .

 = <unk> ( C + + ) = 
 In C + + computer programming , allocators are an important component of the C + + Standard Library . The standard library provides several data structures , such as list and set , commonly referred to as containers . A common trait among these containers is their ability to change size during the execution of the program . To achieve this , some form of dynamic memory allocation is usually required . Allocators handle all the requests for allocation and deallocation of memory for a given container . The C + + Standard Library provides general @-@ purpose allocators that are used by default , however , custom allocators may also be supplied by the programmer . 
 Allocators were invented by Alexander Stepanov as part of the Standard Template Library ( STL ) . They were originally intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model , allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library . However , in the process of adopting STL into the C + + standard , the C + + standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties . To remedy this , the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive . As a result , the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov . 
 Nevertheless , there are many scenarios where customized allocators are desirable . Some of the most common reasons for writing custom allocators include improving performance of allocations by using memory pools , and encapsulating access to different types of memory , like shared memory or garbage @-@ collected memory . In particular , programs with many frequent allocations of small amounts of memory may benefit greatly from specialized allocators , both in terms of running time and memory footprint . 
 = = Background = = 
 Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee presented the Standard Template Library to the C + + standards committee in March 1994 . The library received preliminary approval , although a few issues were raised . In particular , Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent of the underlying memory model , which led to the creation of allocators . Consequently , all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators . 
 In adapting STL to be included in the C + + Standard Library , Stepanov worked closely with several members of the standards committee , including Andrew Koenig and Bjarne Stroustrup , who observed that custom allocators could potentially be used to implement persistent storage STL containers , which Stepanov at the time considered an " important and interesting insight " . 
 The original allocator proposal incorporated some language features that had not yet been accepted by the committee , namely the ability to use template arguments that are themselves templates . Since these features could not be compiled by any existing compiler , there was , according to Stepanov , " an enormous demand on Bjarne [ Stroustrup ] ' s and Andy [ Koenig ] ' s time trying to verify that we were using these non @-@ implemented features correctly . " Where the library had previously used pointer and reference types directly , it would now only refer to the types defined by the allocator . Stepanov later described allocators as follows : " A nice feature of STL is that the only place that mentions the machine @-@ related types ( ... ) is encapsulated within roughly 16 lines of code . " 
 While Stepanov had originally intended allocators to completely encapsulate the memory model , the standards committee realized that this approach would lead to unacceptable efficiency degradations . To remedy this , additional wording was added to the allocator requirements . In particular , container implementations may assume that the allocator 's type definitions for pointers and related integral types are equivalent to those provided by the default allocator , and that all instances of a given allocator type always compare equal , effectively contradicting the original design goals for allocators and limiting the usefulness of allocators that carry state . 
 Stepanov later commented that , while allocators " are not such a bad [ idea ] in theory ( ... ) [ u ] <unk> they cannot work in practice " . He observed that to make allocators really useful , a change to the core language with regards to references was necessary . 
 The 2011 revision of the C + + Standard removed the weasel words requiring that allocators of a given type always compare equal and use normal pointers . These changes make stateful allocators much more useful and allow allocators to manage out @-@ of @-@ process shared memory . The current purpose of allocators is to give the programmer control over memory allocation within containers , rather than to adapt the address model of the underlying hardware . In fact , the revised standard eliminated the ability of allocators to represent extensions to the C + + address model , formally ( and deliberately ) eliminating their original purpose . 
 = = Requirements = = 
 Any class that fulfills the allocator requirements can be used as an allocator . In particular , a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A : : pointer , A : : const _ pointer , A : : reference , A : : const _ reference , and A : : value _ type for generically declaring objects and references ( or pointers ) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A : : size _ type , an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A , and similarly , a signed integral A : : difference _ type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model . 
 Although a conforming standard library implementation is allowed to assume that the allocator 's A : : pointer and A : : const _ pointer are simply typedefs for T * and T const * , library implementors are encouraged to support more general allocators . 
 An allocator , A , for objects of type T must have a member function with the signature A : : pointer A : : allocate ( size _ type n , A < void > : : const _ pointer hint = 0 ) . This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T ; only the memory is allocated , and the objects are not constructed . Moreover , an optional pointer argument ( that points to an object already allocated by A ) can be used as a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality . However , the implementation is free to ignore the argument . 
 The corresponding void A : : deallocate ( A : : pointer p , A : : size _ type n ) member function accepts any pointer that was returned from a previous invocation of the A : : allocate member function and the number of elements to deallocate ( but not destruct ) . 
 The A : : max _ size ( ) member function returns the largest number of objects of type T that could be expected to be successfully allocated by an invocation of A : : allocate ; the value returned is typically A : : size _ type ( -1 ) / sizeof ( T ) . Also , the A : : address member function returns an A : : pointer denoting the address of an object , given an A : : reference . 
 Object construction and destruction is performed separately from allocation and deallocation . The allocator is required to have two member functions , A : : construct and A : : destroy , which handles object construction and destruction , respectively . The semantics of the functions should be equivalent to the following : 
 The above code uses the placement new syntax , and calls the destructor directly . 
 Allocators should be copy @-@ constructible . An allocator for objects of type T can be constructed from an allocator for objects of type U. If an allocator , A , allocates a region of memory , R , then R can only be <unk> by an allocator that compares equal to A. 
 Allocators are required to supply a template class member template < <unk> U > <unk> A : : rebind { <unk> A < U > other ; } ; , which enables the possibility of obtaining a related allocator , parameterized in terms of a different type . For example , given an allocator type <unk> for objects of type int , a related allocator type for objects of type long could be obtained using <unk> : : rebind < long > : : other . 
 = = Custom allocators = = 
 One of the main reasons for writing a custom allocator is performance . Utilizing a specialized custom allocator may substantially improve the performance or memory usage , or both , of the program . The default allocator uses operator new to allocate memory . This is often implemented as a thin layer around the C heap allocation functions , which are usually optimized for infrequent allocation of large memory blocks . This approach may work well with containers that mostly allocate large chunks of memory , like vector and <unk> . However , for containers that require frequent allocations of small objects , such as map and list , using the default allocator is generally slow . Other common problems with a <unk> @-@ based allocator include poor locality of reference , and excessive memory fragmentation . 
 A popular approach to improve performance is to create a memory pool @-@ based allocator . Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container , a large block of memory ( the memory pool ) is allocated beforehand , possibly at the startup of the program . The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool . Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends . An example of memory pool @-@ based allocators can be found in the Boost C + + Libraries . 
 Another viable use of custom allocators is for debugging memory @-@ related errors . This could be achieved by writing an allocator that allocates extra memory in which it places debugging information . Such an allocator could be used to ensure that memory is allocated and <unk> by the same type of allocator , and also provide limited protection against overruns . 
 The subject of custom allocators has been treated by many C + + experts and authors , including Scott Meyers in Effective STL and Andrei Alexandrescu in Modern C + + Design . Meyers emphasises that C + + 98 requires all instances of an allocator to be equivalent , and notes that this in effect forces portable allocators to not have state . Although the C + + 98 Standard did encourage library implementors to support stateful allocators , Meyers calls the relevant paragraph " a lovely sentiment " that " offers you next to nothing " , characterizing the restriction as " draconian " . 
 In The C + + Programming Language , Bjarne Stroustrup , on the other hand , argues that the " apparently [ d ] <unk> restriction against per @-@ object information in allocators is not particularly serious " , pointing out that most allocators do not need state , and have better performance without it . He mentions three use cases for custom allocators , namely , memory pool allocators , shared memory allocators , and garbage collected memory allocators . He presents an allocator implementation that uses an internal memory pool for fast allocation and deallocation of small chunks of memory , but notes that such an optimization may already be performed by the allocator provided by the implementation .

 When <unk> one of the standard containers , the allocator is specified through a template argument , which defaults to <unk> : : allocator < T > :

 The C + + 11 standard has enhanced the allocator interface to allow " scoped " allocators , so that containers with " nested " memory allocations , such as vector of strings or a map of lists of sets of user @-@ defined types , can ensure that all memory is sourced from the container 's allocator .

 = Cottage garden = 
 The cottage garden is a distinct style that uses informal design , traditional materials , dense plantings , and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants . English in origin , it depends on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure . <unk> and functional gardens connected to working @-@ class cottages go back centuries , but their stylized reinvention occurred in 1870s England , as a reaction to the more structured , rigorously maintained estate gardens with their formal designs and mass plantings of greenhouse annuals . 
 The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than today 's , with emphasis on vegetables and herbs , fruit trees , perhaps a beehive , and even livestock . Flowers , used to fill spaces , gradually became more dominant . The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed , perhaps with a rose @-@ <unk> gateway . Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists ' flowers such as primroses and violets , along with flowers with household use such as calendula and various herbs . Others were the richly scented old @-@ fashioned roses that bloomed once a year , and simple flowers like daisies . In time , cottage @-@ garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well . 
 Modern cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations and embrace plant materials , such as ornamental grasses or native plants not seen in the rural gardens of cottagers . Traditional roses , with their full fragrance and lush foliage , continue to be a cottage @-@ garden mainstay — along with modern disease @-@ resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes . Informal climbing plants , whether traditional or modern hybrids , are also common , as are the self @-@ sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers ' gardens . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Cottage gardens , which emerged in Elizabethan times , appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits . One theory is that they arose out of the Black Death of the 1340s , when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens . According to the late 19th @-@ century legend of origin , these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages , to provide them with food and herbs , with flowers planted in for decoration . Helen Leach analysed the historical origins of the romanticised cottage garden , subjecting the garden style to rigorous historical analysis , along with the ornamental <unk> and the herb garden . She concluded that their origins were less in workingmen 's gardens in the 19th century and more in the leisured classes ' discovery of simple hardy plants , in part through the writings of John Claudius Loudon . Loudon helped to design the estate at Great Tew , Oxfordshire , where farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden — about an acre — where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens . 
 Authentic gardens of the yeoman cottager would have included a beehive and livestock , and frequently a pig and sty , along with a well . The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers , with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking , rather than for their beauty . By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity , and thus more room to grow flowers . Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use — violets were spread on the floor ( for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin ) ; <unk> and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking . Others , such as sweet <unk> and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The " naturalness " of informal design began to be noticed and developed by the British leisured class . Alexander Pope was an early proponent of less formal gardens , calling in a 1713 article for gardens with the " amiable simplicity of unadorned nature " . Other writers in the 18th century who encouraged less formal , and more natural , gardens included Joseph Addison and Lord Shaftesbury . The evolution of cottage gardens can be followed in the issues of The Cottage Gardener ( 1848 – 61 ) , edited by George William Johnson , where the emphasis is squarely on the " florist 's flowers " , carnations and <unk> in fancy varieties that were originally cultivated as a highly competitive blue @-@ collar hobby . 
 William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll helped to popularise less formal gardens in their many books and magazine articles . Robinson 's The Wild Garden , published in 1870 , contained in the first edition an essay on " The Garden of British Wild Flowers " , which was eliminated from later editions . In his The English Flower Garden , illustrated with cottage gardens from Somerset , Kent and Surrey , he remarked , " One lesson of these little gardens , that are so pretty , is that one can get good effects from simple materials . " From the 1890s his lifelong friend Jekyll applied cottage garden principles to more structured designs in even quite large country houses . Her Colour in the Flower Garden ( 1908 ) is still in print today . 
 Robinson and Jekyll were part of the Arts and Crafts Movement , a broader movement in art , architecture , and crafts during the late 19th century which advocated a return to the informal planting style derived as much from the Romantic tradition as from the actual English cottage garden . The Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1888 began a movement toward an idealised natural country garden style . The garden designs of Robinson and Jekyll were often associated with Arts and Crafts style houses . Both were influenced by William Morris , one of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts Movement — Robinson quoted Morris 's views condemning carpet bedding ; Jekyll shared Morris 's mystical view of nature and drew on the floral designs in his textiles for her gardening style . When Morris built his Red House in Kent , it influenced new ideas in architecture and gardening — the " old @-@ fashioned " garden suddenly became a fashion accessory among the British artistic middle class , and the cottage garden esthetic began to emigrate to America . 
 In the early 20th century the term " cottage garden " might be applied even to as large and sophisticated a garden as Hidcote Manor , which Vita Sackville @-@ West described as " a cottage garden on the most glorified scale " but where the colour harmonies were carefully contrived and controlled , as in the famous " Red Borders " . Sackville @-@ West had taken similar models for her own " cottage garden " , one of many " garden rooms " at <unk> Castle — her idea of a cottage garden was a place where " the plants grow in a jumble , flowering shrubs mingled with Roses , herbaceous plants with bulbous subjects , climbers scrambling over hedges , seedlings coming up wherever they have chosen to sow themselves " . The cottage garden ideal was also spread by artists such as water @-@ colourist Helen Allingham ( 1848 – 1926 ) . Another influence was Margery Fish ( 1892 – 1969 ) , whose garden survives at East Lambrook Manor . 
 The cottage garden in France is a development of the early 20th century . Monet 's garden at <unk> is a prominent example , a sprawling garden full of varied plantings , rich colors , and water gardens . In modern times , the term ' cottage garden ' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles , using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins . Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme ( in the American midwest ) and California chaparral cottage gardens . 
 = = Design = = 
 While the classic cottage garden is built around a cottage , many cottage @-@ style gardens are created around houses and even estates such as Hidcote Manor , with its more intimate " garden rooms " . The cottage garden design is based more on principles than formulae : it has an informal look , with a seemingly casual mixture of flowers , herbs , and vegetables often packed into a small area . In spite of their appearances , cottage gardens have a design and formality that help give them their grace and charm . Due to space limitations , they are often in small rectangular plots , with practical functioning paths and hedges or fences . The plants , layout , and materials are chosen to give the impression of casualness and a country feel . Modern cottage gardens frequently use local flowers and materials , rather than those of the traditional cottage garden . What they share with the tradition is the unstudied look , the use of every square inch , and a rich variety of flowers , herbs , and vegetables . 
 The cottage garden is designed to appear artless , rather than contrived or pretentious . Instead of artistic curves , or grand geometry , there is an artfully designed irregularity . Borders can go right up to the house , lawns are replaced with tufts of grass or flowers , and beds can be as wide as needed . Instead of the discipline of large scale color schemes , there is the simplicity of harmonious color combinations between neighbouring plants . The overall appearance can be of " a vegetable garden that has been taken over by flowers . " The method of planting closely packed plants was supposed to reduce the amount of weeding and watering required , but planted stone pathways or turf paths , and clipped hedges overgrown with wayward vines , are cottage garden features requiring well @-@ timed maintenance . 
 = = = Materials = = = 
 Paths , arbors , and fences use traditional or antique looking materials . Wooden fences and gates , paths covered with locally made bricks or stone , and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual — and less formal — look and feel to a cottage garden . Pots , ornaments , and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes — everything is chosen to give the impression of an old @-@ fashioned country garden . 
 = = Plants = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 Until the late 19th century , cottage gardens mainly grew vegetables for household consumption . Typically half the garden would be used for cultivating potatoes and half for a mix of other vegetables . John Claudius Loudon wrote extensively on cottage gardens in his book An Encyclopædia of Gardening ( 1822 ) and in Gardener 's Magazine from 1826 . In 1838 he wrote " I seldom observe any thing in a cottage garden but potatoes , cabbages , beans , and French beans ; in a few instances onions and <unk> , and very seldom a few peas " . An 1865 issue of The Farmer 's Magazine noted that in " Ireland and much of the Highlands of Scotland , potatoes are the only thing grown in the cottage @-@ garden " . 
 Modern cottage garden plants are typically flowers chosen for their old @-@ fashioned and informal appeal . Many modern day gardeners use heirloom or ' old @-@ fashioned ' plants and varieties — even though these may not have been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants . In addition , there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look . For example , modern roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old @-@ fashioned look ( multi @-@ petaled form and rosette @-@ shaped flowers ) and fragrance — combined with modern virtues of hardiness , repeat blooming , and disease @-@ resistance . Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate , rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment — though many of the old favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world . 
 = = = Roses = = = 
 Cottage gardens are always associated with roses : shrub roses , climbing roses , and old garden roses with lush foliage , in contrast to the gangly modern hybrid tea roses . Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica , which form dense mounded shrubs 3 – 4 ft high and wide , with pale pink to purple flowers — with single form to full double form blooms . They are also very fragrant , and include the ancient Apothecary 's rose ( R. gallica ' <unk> ' ) , whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance . Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose , which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes . Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6 ft or higher , with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden . Even taller generally are the Alba roses , which are not always white , and which bloom well even in partial shade . 
 The Provence rose or Rosa <unk> is the full and fat " cabbage rose " made famous by Dutch masters in their 17th @-@ century paintings . These very fragrant shrub roses grow 5 ft tall and wide , with a floppy habit that is aided by training on an arch or pillar . The <unk> roses have produced many descendants that are also cottage garden favorites , including varieties of moss rose ( roses with attractive ' mossy ' growth on their flower stalks and flower buds ) . Unlike most modern hybrids , the older roses bloom on the previous year 's wood , so they aren 't pruned back severely each year . Also as they don 't bloom continuously , they can share their branches with later @-@ flowering climbers such as Clematis vines , which use the rose branches for support . A rose in the cottage garden is not segregated with other roses , with bare earth or mulch underneath ' , but is casually blended with other flowers , vines , and groundcover . 
 With the introduction of China roses ( derived from Rosa chinensis ) late in the 18th century , many hybrids were introduced that had the <unk> ( repeat @-@ blooming ) nature of the China roses , but maintained the informal old rose shape and flower . These included the Bourbon rose and the <unk> rose , which were added to the rose repertoire of the cottage garden , and , more recently , hybrid " English " roses introduced by David Austin . 
 = = = Climbing plants = = = 
 Many of the old roses had cultivars that grew very long canes , which could be tied to trellises or against walls . These older varieties are called " ramblers " , rather than " climbers " . Climbing plants in the traditional cottage garden included European honeysuckle ( Lonicera <unk> ) and Traveller 's Joy ( Clematis <unk> ) . The modern cottage garden includes many Clematis hybrids that have the old appeal , with sparse foliage that allows them to grow through roses and trees , and along fences and arbors . There are also many Clematis species used in the modern cottage garden , including Clematis <unk> , Clematis <unk> , and Clematis <unk> . Popular <unk> for cottage gardens include Japanese honeysuckle and Lonicera <unk> . 
 = = = <unk> plants = = = 
 In the traditional cottage garden , hedges served as fences on the perimeter to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy , along with other practical uses . Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea , while the flowers were used for making wine . The fast @-@ growing <unk> , in addition to creating a hedge , provided berries for food and wine , with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments . The wood had many uses , including toys , pegs , skewers , and fishing poles . Holly was another hedge plant , useful because it quickly spread and self @-@ seeded . Privet was also a convenient and fast @-@ growing hedge . Over time , more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges , including laurel , lilac , snowberry , japonica , and others . 
 = = = Flowers and herbs = = = 
 Popular flowers in the traditional cottage garden included florist 's flowers which were grown by enthusiasts — such as violets , pinks , and primroses — and those grown with a more practical purpose . For example , the calendula , grown today almost entirely for its bright orange flowers , was primarily valued for eating , for adding color to butter and cheese , for adding smoothness to soups and stews , and for all kinds of healing salves and preparations . Like many old cottage garden annuals and herbs , it freely self @-@ sowed , making it easier to grow and share . Other popular cottage garden annuals included violets , pansies , stocks , and <unk> . 
 <unk> were the largest group of traditional cottage garden flowers — those with a long cottage garden history include hollyhocks , carnations , sweet <unk> , <unk> , marigolds , lilies , peonies , tulips , crocus , daisies , foxglove , monkshood , lavender , <unk> , Solomon 's seal , evening primrose , lily @-@ of @-@ the @-@ valley , primrose , cowslips , and many varieties of roses . 
 Today herbs are typically thought of as culinary plants , but in the traditional cottage garden they were considered to be any plant with household uses . Herbs were used for medicine , toiletries , and cleaning products . Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors . Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics . Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage , thyme , southernwood , wormwood , catmint , <unk> , lungwort , <unk> , hyssop , sweet <unk> , and lavender . 
 = = = Fruits = = = 
 Fruit in the traditional cottage garden would have included an apple and a pear , for cider and <unk> , gooseberries and raspberries . The modern cottage garden includes many varieties of ornamental fruit and nut trees , such as crabapple and hazel , along with non @-@ traditional trees like dogwood . 
 = Stembridge Mill , High Ham = 
 Stembridge Tower Mill in High Ham , Somerset , England , is the last remaining thatched windmill in England . The mill is a grade II * listed building . 
 The stone tower mill was built in 1822 with four floors and a thatched " cap " . A steam engine was installed in 1894 , and became the mill 's sole source of power after a storm damaged it in 1897 or 1898 . Commercial use ended in 1908 . The mill is now owned by The National Trust . In 2009 , it underwent a £ 100 @,@ 000 restoration by local craftsmen funded by the <unk> Community Heritage Fund , and was re @-@ opened later that year . 
 = = History = = 
 Stembridge Mill was constructed for Robert Tatchell in 1822 . It incorporated parts from the earlier Ham Mill , a few hundred yards to the north east . The mill has a 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) tower situated on an old mill mound , surrounded by a low wall intended to keep people and livestock away from the sails . 
 Tatchell leased the mill to his son @-@ in @-@ law John Sherrin , who inherited the mill in 1824 following Tatchell 's death . When Sherrin died , the mill passed to his three sons , although only one , Robert , worked the mill . Simon Spearing became the miller in 1869 . He was later assisted by his son William , who lost an arm when he was thirteen due to an accident at a watermill in Low Ham . The mill was acquired by Adam Sherrin in 1881 and owned by his family until 1902 . By the late 1880s , the mill was being rented by George Parker . He added a portable steam engine as auxiliary power . It drove one pair of stones . The mill was damaged by storms in 1897 or 1898 and after that was only powered by the steam engine , which had been installed in 1894 , rather than the wind . The bakehouse ceased to be used around this time . 
 Robert Hook then acquired the mill . Unable to compete against grain imports and the building of dockside mills at Avonmouth , Stembridge Mill was last used commercially in 1908 . Hook sold the mill and 5 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) of land to Dr. Hugh Hale Leigh Bellot for £ 500 . Upon his death in 1928 , it was inherited by his son , Professor Hugh Hale Bellot . In 1969 Professor Bellot left the windmill , miller 's cottage and garden to the National Trust in his will . New sails were added in 1971 , along with other repairs . Further repairs were carried out in 1974 , including the removal of floors . It was designated as a grade II * listed building in 1986 . 
 It is the last survivor of five windmills that once existed in the area . 
 In 2009 the sails were replaced and the mill re @-@ thatched and restored by local craftsmen at a cost of a £ 100 @,@ 000 ; the mill was re @-@ opened later that year . The work was funded by the <unk> Community Heritage Fund . Although the sails do not rotate with the wind , they are moved 90 degrees four times per year for maintenance . Before the restoration work was undertaken surveys revealed that the mill was used as a roost for long @-@ eared and lesser horseshoe bats . It was ensured that the bats would still have access after the restoration .

 Note : Italicized terms are defined in the mill machinery article . 
 Stembridge Mill is a tower mill , a type of windmill which consists of a brick or stone tower , on top of which sits a roof or cap which can be turned to bring the sails into the wind . The advantage of the tower mill over the earlier post mill is that it is not necessary to turn the whole mill ( " body " , " buck " ) with all its machinery into the wind ; this allows more space for the machinery and storage . In the earliest tower mills the cap was turned into the wind with a long tail @-@ pole which stretched to the ground at the back of the mill . Later , a looping chain was used which turned the cap with gears , as is used at Stembridge . It is winded by a wheel and chain . The <unk> is of wood , with a cast iron cross , which carries four common sails . The brake wheel is of clasp arm construction . No other machinery remains , since the <unk> , upright shaft and great spur wheel were removed after the mill ceased to operate by wind 
 The mill has four floors , a thatched cap and is constructed of local limestone known in the area as Blue Lias . It has two pairs of 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 22 m ) diameter millstones . One pair is French Burr stones , which date from 1859 . The other pair has a French Burr runner stone on a conglomerate <unk> . Both pairs of millstones were originally driven <unk> by the windmill , with the mixed pair later being driven <unk> by the steam engine , which also drove a wire machine . The remains of the old bakehouse can be seen at the rear of the mill .

 = New York State Route 427 = 
 New York State Route 427 ( NY 427 ) is an east – west state highway in Chemung County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 11 @.@ 5 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) from its western terminus at an intersection with NY 14 in the town of Southport , south of the city of Elmira , to its eastern terminus at an interchange with NY 17 in the town of Chemung . Between those two towns , the highway passes through the town of Ashland and serves the village of Wellsburg . Much of NY 427 follows the Chemung River . 
 The route was assigned in the early 1940s , replacing New York State Route 17D , a route established as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . It originally began in downtown Elmira and ended at the Pennsylvania state line in Chemung . NY 427 was realigned on its east end in 1967 to meet the newly constructed exit 59 on NY 17 and on its west end in 1978 to follow what had been New York State Route 379 through the town of Southport . Other minor realignments have occurred over the years as well . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 427 begins at an intersection with NY 14 ( the Clemens Center Parkway ) in Southport , a town located south of the city of Elmira . It heads east , following Cedar Street and paralleling Seeley Creek through the southern suburbs of Elmira to an intersection with Maple Avenue near Notre Dame High School . Here , NY 427 turns south to follow Maple Avenue into the adjacent town of Ashland and across Seeley Creek . 
 As the route heads through Ashland , it generally turns to the southeast to match the curvature of the Chemung River valley , which contains the river , NY 427 , and the Southern Tier Expressway ( NY 17 ) . NY 427 parallels both the river and the expressway into Wellsburg , a small village sandwiched between the Chemung River and the Pennsylvania state line . In the center of the village , NY 427 , named Front Street , intersects with the northern end of NY 367 , a short highway linking NY 427 to the Pennsylvania border . Just east of NY 367 , NY 427 intersects County Route 8 ( CR 8 ) , a highway that crosses the Chemung River and links Wellsburg to NY 17 at exit 58 . 
 Outside of Wellsburg , NY 427 becomes Wilawana Road and heads eastward , paralleling both the Chemung River and the Norfolk Southern Railway @-@ owned Southern Tier Line through the town of Chemung toward the Pennsylvania state line . Less than 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the Pennsylvania border , NY 427 departs Wilawana Road and turns northeast onto Wyncoop Creek Road . NY 427 crosses the Chemung River before coming to an end at an interchange with NY 17 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) later . Although NY 427 comes to an end at this interchange , the road continues onward through the interchange as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route .

 Most of what is now NY 427 was originally designated as NY 17D in the 1930 renumbering . NY 17D began at the intersection of East Water Street ( NY 17 ) and Madison Avenue ( NY 14 and NY 17 ) in downtown Elmira . NY 17D headed west , overlapping NY 14 along Water Street to Lake Street , where NY 17D turned south and followed Lake Street and Pennsylvania Avenue over the Chemung River to Maple Avenue . Here , NY 17D turned to the southeast to follow Maple Avenue through southern Elmira . At Cedar Street , NY 17D joined the modern alignment of NY 427 . From this point east , NY 17D followed what is now NY 427 to Wyncoop Creek Road in Chemung , where it continued on Wilawana Road to the Pennsylvania border . 
 In the months immediately following the 1930 renumbering , NY 14 was routed on Pennsylvania Avenue and South Main Street through southern Elmira . By 1935 , NY 14 was rerouted to follow Pennsylvania Avenue into downtown . As a result , all of NY 17D north of the junction of Pennsylvania and Maple avenues became concurrent with NY 14 . The overlap was eliminated in the early 1940s when NY 17D was pulled back to the intersection of Pennsylvania and Maple avenues and renumbered as NY 427 . 
 = = = Realignments = = = 
 The 1930s @-@ era realignment of NY 14 was reverted c . 1961 as the route was reconfigured to follow South Main Street into downtown Elmira . NY 427 was extended northward along Pennsylvania Avenue to a new terminus at Water Street ( NY 14 and NY 17E ; later NY 352 ) as part of the change . At the other end of the route , the easternmost part of NY 427 was realigned c . 1967 to follow Wyncoop Creek Road to a new interchange ( exit 59 ) with the Southern Tier Expressway ( NY 17 ) in Chemung . The former routing of NY 427 along Wilawana Road between Wyncoop Creek Road and the Pennsylvania state line was designated as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . 
 On October 23 , 1978 , NY 427 was rerouted to bypass Elmira entirely . Instead of continuing north into downtown , NY 427 turned west at Cedar Street and followed it through Southport to a new terminus at Pennsylvania Avenue ( NY 14 ) . The realignment of NY 427 through Southport supplanted NY 379 , which had been assigned to the portion of Cedar Street between Pennsylvania and Maple avenues since c . 1931 . NY 427 's former alignment along Maple Avenue from Cedar Street north to the Elmira city line was redesignated as NY <unk> . Although this part of Maple Avenue is still listed as a state highway in the New York State Highway Law , NY <unk> ceased to exist at some point between 2004 and 2006 and the road is now maintained by Chemung County and designated as CR 85 . 
 The Clemens Center Parkway was completed c . 2002 , creating a continuous four @-@ lane arterial between Southport and the northernmost part of Elmira . South of downtown Elmira , the highway loosely paralleled Pennsylvania Avenue and South Main Street . NY 14 was realigned c . 2004 to follow all but the northernmost part of the parkway , and the west end of NY 427 was shifted 0 @.@ 25 miles ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) east to Cedar Street 's junction with the parkway as part of the change . The portion of Cedar Street between Pennsylvania Avenue and NY 14 is now CR 84 .

 = Cyclone Joni = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni was a damaging tropical cyclone that impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji . It was first noted within the South Pacific Convergence Zone at the start of December 1992 , as a shallow tropical depression in the vicinity of the island nation Tuvalu . Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu , before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service ( FMS ) during December 7 . Over the next couple of days the system intensified further as it was steered south @-@ westwards and posed a threat towards the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna . The system subsequently peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it approached the Fijian Islands during December 10 . Over the next couple of days the system moved through the Fijian Islands , before it became an extratropical cyclone during December 13 . The system was last noted during the next day as it was absorbed by a mid @-@ latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand . 
 Joni caused gale to storm force winds on the <unk> island of Niulakita and minor damage to most of the <unk> islands . Total damages to crops in the island nation were estimated at AU $ 6 @.@ 9 thousand ( US $ 5 thousand ) . There were no damages reported on the islands of Wallis and Futuna or Rotuma , while 1 person was killed , 10 people went missing and total damages were estimated at FJ $ 2 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 6 million ) in Fiji . The main impacts of Joni in Fiji were confined to the Western Division , with the islands of Yasawa , Mamanuca , Viti Levu , Kadavu and Vatulele being the worst affected areas . Damages in both Tuvalu and Fiji were exacerbated a month later by Severe Tropical Cyclones Nina and Kina interacting with each other . Due to the impact of this system , the name Joni was subsequently retired from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 At the start of December 1992 , a shallow tropical depression developed along the South Pacific Convergence Zone in the vicinity of Tuvalu . Over the next few days the system persisted near Tuvalu , before it started to move south @-@ eastwards and develop further during December 5 . During December 6 , the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03P and initiated advisories , while the system was located on the 180th meridian about 180 km ( 110 mi ) southeast of Funafuti , Tuvalu . Over the next couple of days , the system slowly deepened as it organised further and caused gale to storm force winds on the island of Niulakita and strong squally winds over the rest of Tuvalu . During December 7 , the Fiji Meteorological Service ( FMS ) reported that the depression had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Joni . After it had been named the system passed near Niulakita as it was steered towards the southwest by a low to mid level flow and intensified further . 
 The FMS classified Joni as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone during December 9 , after an eye had become apparent in satellite imagery . The system subsequently slowed down and started to recurve and move southwards towards Fiji , due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge of high pressure . Early on December 10 , the FMS reported that Joni had peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone , with 10 @-@ minute sustained wind speeds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . The JTWC also reported at around this time that the system had peaked with 1 @-@ minute sustained wind speeds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) , which made it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . During that day Joni passed near or over the Fijian island groups of Yasawa and Mamanuca , before it passed about 55 km ( 35 mi ) to the west of the main Fijian island : Viti Levu . At around 10 : 30 UTC ( 22 : 30 <unk> ) on December 10 , the system was successfully located on the Nadi weather radar , while it was located about 65 km ( 40 mi ) to the west @-@ southwest of Nadi . Over the next few hours the system was located by radar , until it passed near or over the island of Vatulele . After passing near the island , the system moved south @-@ eastwards towards Kadavu and Ono @-@ i @-@ Lau , with the eye of the system passing directly over Kadavu during December 11 . The system subsequently started to weaken and transition into an extratropical cyclone , as it entered a region of strong vertical wind shear and cooler sea waters . The system was declared to be an extratropical cyclone early on December 13 , before it was absorbed by a mid @-@ latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand during December 14 .

 Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji , while it also threatened the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna . The majority of the Tuvaluan islands suffered minor damage from Joni , while in Fiji the system caused a moderate to severe amount of damage . Due to the impact of this system , the name Joni was subsequently retired , from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization . This would normally mean that the name would not be used again in the region , however , the name remained on the list and was used during the 2008 – 09 season . 
 During its developing stages , Joni was the first of two tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1992 – 93 season . As the system started to affect the islands during December 5 , the FMS issued a gale warning for Niulakita , while strong wind warnings were issued for the rest of the island nation . Joni subsequently passed near Niulakita during December 7 , where it caused gale to storm force winds and minor damage to the islands . The system also caused some damage to crops which were valued at AU $ 6 @.@ 9 thousand ( US $ 5 thousand ) . A tropical cyclone alert was issued for Wallis and Futuna during January 6 , while a gale warning was issued for Rotuma during January 7 . There was subsequently no damage reported in either the French Territory or the Fijian dependency . 
 Between December 9 – 11 , 1992 , Joni became the first named tropical cyclone to directly impact the Fiji Islands since Severe Tropical Cyclone Sina of 1990 . Joni caused a moderate to severe amount of damage to Viti Levu , with an overall damage total of about FJ $ 2 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 6 million ) . At various times between December 7 – 11 , the whole of the main Fijian islands were placed under either a gale , storm or hurricane @-@ force wind warning by the FMS . Ahead of the system affecting Fiji , international and domestic flights to and from the Nadi International Airport were cancelled during December 9 and 10 , while ships and small boats in Lautoka were moved to a nearby river . Hundreds of tourists on Fiji 's offshore islands were evacuated to the mainland before the cyclone hit , while around 350 elected to ride out the system at island resorts . Other preparations included the erection of hurricane shutters , while people rushed to stock up on supplies with shelves cleared of emergency supplies . On some islands , villagers were evacuated to community centres , schools and churches at the height of the storm . 
 Joni 's impact on Fiji was generally confined to the Western Division , with the islands of Yasawa , Mamanuca , Viti Levu , Kadavu and Vatulele being the worst affected areas . The system caused high seas and widespread flooding including in several rivers on Viti Levu , which led to a substantial loss of livestock . In the immediate aftermath of the system a total of ten people were left missing , including a group of three fishermen in the Yasawa Islands . A group of three females on a fishing trip also went missing and were later found on an offshore island . A search party of four men went missing off Vanua Levu , while looking for the women , however , one swam ashore , while the other three were picked up by a cargo ship . Parts of Fiji 's main cities of Suva , Nadi , and Lautoka were left without power , as falling trees brought down power lines . The Fijian Government reported that coconut plantations had been extensively damaged and that there was limited communications with the Western Division . Despite Joni 's eye passing directly over Kadavu during December 11 , the damage on the island was limited to wave induced coastal erosion , root crop damage and the loss of a few trees . The system passed near the wave rider station on the island , which recorded a peak wave height of about 7 @.@ 2 metres ( 24 ft ) as Joni made its closest point of approach . During December 12 , an army helicopter was deployed to conduct a damage survey of offshore islands . A total of six people were subsequently arrested in Suva and Nadi on December 14 , in relation to a series of burglaries , committed during power blackouts caused by the cyclone . Joni 's damage in both Tuvalu and Fiji was exacerbated a month later , by Severe Tropical Cyclones Nina and Kina interacting with each other . 
 = Richard Gavin Reid = 
 Richard Gavin " Dick " Reid ( 17 January 1879 – 17 October 1980 ) was a Canadian politician who served as the sixth Premier of Alberta from 1934 to 1935 . He was the last member of the United Farmers of Alberta ( UFA ) to hold the office , and that party 's defeat at the hands of the upstart Social Credit League in the 1935 election made him the shortest serving premier to that point in Alberta 's history . 
 Born near Glasgow , Reid worked a number of jobs as a young adult — including wholesaler , army medic ( during the Second Boer War ) , farmhand , lumberjack , and dentist — and immigrated to Canada in 1903 . He involved himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA , which nominated him to run in the 1921 provincial election as its candidate in Vermilion . The UFA won the election , and Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of Premiers Herbert Greenfield and John Edward Brownlee , where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal conservatism . When a sex scandal forced Brownlee from office in 1934 , Reid was the caucus ' unanimous choice to succeed him as Premier . 
 When Reid took office , Alberta was experiencing the Great Depression . Reid took measures to ease Albertans ' suffering , but believed that inducing a full economic recovery was beyond the capacity of the provincial government . In this climate , Alberta voters were attracted to the economic theories of evangelical preacher William Aberhart , who advocated a version of social credit . Despite Reid 's claims that Aberhart 's proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible , Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election ; Reid 's party did not retain a single seat . Reid lived forty @-@ five years after his defeat , but these years were spent in obscurity ; he never returned to political life . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Reid was born 17 January 1879 near Glasgow , Scotland , to George ( 1843 – 1913 ) and Margaret ( <unk> ) Reid ( 1850 – 1928 ) . He attended school in Glasgow and worked for several years in the wholesale provisions business before enlisting in the Royal Army Medical Corps . He served in South Africa as a Lance @-@ Sergeant from 1900 to 1902 during the Second Boer War , doing hospital duty , before returning to Scotland . There he began to plan his future , considering returning to South Africa to live before deciding on Canada . 
 He arrived in Killarney , Manitoba , in 1903 , where he worked as a farmhand during the harvest . When winter came , he found work as a lumberjack in Fort William , Ontario . A voyage west followed , and he set up a homestead in east @-@ central Alberta . Once there , he began to practice dentistry , drawing on his army experience . On 9 September 1919 , he married Marion Stuart . They had three sons and two daughters . 
 = = Early political career = = 
 = = = Entry into politics = = = 
 Reid 's political career began with four years on the municipal council of Buffalo Coulee , around present @-@ day Vermilion . He spent two of these as Reeve . He was instrumental in founding the Vermilion municipal hospital district , on whose board he served for many years . Federally , he was active with the United Farmers of Alberta Battle River Political Association , of which he became president . 
 Reid was nominated as the UFA candidate in Vermilion during the 1921 provincial election , the first in which the UFA ran candidates . The Legislative Assembly of Alberta was dominated by the Liberals , who had governed Alberta since its creation in 1905 . To Reid 's great surprise , he defeated his Liberal opponent and was elected to the legislature , along with 37 of his fellow UFA candidates — enough to form a majority government . He chaired the first meeting of the new UFA caucus , at which it selected Herbert Greenfield as Premier . Reid was re @-@ elected in the 1926 and 1930 elections . 
 = = = Cabinet career = = = 
 Reid occupied high @-@ ranking cabinet positions in Greenfield 's government and that of his successor , John Edward Brownlee . Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921 . In the former capacity , he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards . He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped , which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta . As an advocate of government @-@ wide economy , he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses . This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs , in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province . In 1929 , he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10 % of the old age pensions paid to their residents . 
 In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid out of both of his portfolios and made him Provincial Treasurer , where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government . Early in his tenure , he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets and that the government create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies . In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee , Greenfield 's Attorney @-@ General , and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re @-@ appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs . Brownlee and Reid had a history of working closely not only on fiscal issues , but also on agricultural ones : in July 1923 , they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a wheat pool in Alberta . This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer Aaron Sapiro in San Francisco and a visit to Chicago 's commodity market . Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously , if at all , though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government had little choice but to go along with the creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool . 
 With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer , government deficits ceased : the budget showed a surplus in every year from 1925 until 1930 , except for 1927 . In 1929 , Reid predicted that Alberta was on the cusp of a period of economic expansion ; instead , he was soon confronted with the Great Depression . He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes , in part by creating a new income tax . He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending . His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised . Conversely , he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure . 
 Though Brownlee was no more enthusiastic than Reid about deficits , his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio . In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta 's long @-@ sought control over its natural resources from the federal government , and he appointed Reid Alberta 's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930 . In this capacity , Reid favoured private over public ownership . He opposed calls from his own party to promote government @-@ developed hydroelectricity projects , and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government , though they finally turned a profit in 1927 . He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests , a course that was eventually followed in 1929 . 
 = = Premier = = 
 In 1934 , Brownlee was implicated in a sex scandal , as a young family friend and her father sued him for seduction . By Reid 's account , he had to convince his premier not to quit " hundreds of times " . When the jury found in favour of the plaintiffs , however , Brownlee had no choice , and resigned effective 10 July 1934 . Reid was the most prominent minister in the cabinet and among the most popular , and was the UFA caucus ' unanimous choice to take over . He also replaced Brownlee as Provincial Secretary and installed himself in the newly created position of Treasury Board President . 
 The UFA was in an uncertain position when Reid became Premier ; besides Brownlee 's resignation , longtime Minister of Public Works Oran McPherson was in the midst of a scandalous divorce and had also left cabinet , and UFA MLAs Peter Miskew and Omer St. Germain had crossed the floor to the Liberals . Additionally , the province 's economic condition remained poor . Liberal leader William R. Howson tried to take advantage of this to undermine the government and position himself as the province 's next Premier ; he attacked Reid relentlessly for what he alleged were spendthrift habits , and suggested the province 's tax rates were causing the confiscation of family homes . Reid asserted in response that Alberta 's taxes had decreased since 1921 , and criticised Howson for simultaneously attacking government spending and demanding new infrastructure projects . 
 In the meantime , Reid 's government took a number of policy initiatives . It passed legislation authorizing the government purchase of cattle from farmers who could no longer afford feed , and worked out a cost @-@ sharing agreement with the federal government and the railways to relocate farmers fleeing the province 's dust belt . Reid also called for the creation of a federal wheat marketing board , and proposed legislation — the Agricultural Industry Stabilisation Act — that protected from creditors any portion of a farmer 's revenue that was used on operating costs for his farm or living expenses for his family . Despite these measures , Reid found himself at odds with his party 's membership , which was reacting to the Great Depression by following an increasingly socialist path . He found UFA President Robert Gardiner to be of the " far left " , and considered the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation , in whose founding many UFA members had participated , to be an " unholy amalgamation " . Even so , his government experimented with a form of universal health insurance , to be jointly funded by government , employers , and employees , that would provide Albertans with free medical , dental , and hospital care ; the project was to be launched as a pilot project in Camrose , but was never begun because of the intervention of the 1935 election . More controversially , Reid 's government reacted to McPherson 's divorce and its attendant coverage by proposing to ban newspapers from covering divorce proceedings , a proposal that prompted Liberal MLA Joseph <unk> <unk> to compare Reid to Hitler , Mussolini , and Stalin . 
 = = = Social credit = = = 
 A more dangerous opponent than Howson was William Aberhart , the Calgary preacher who was proposing a form of social credit to cure the province 's ills . Social credit , the brainchild of British engineer C. H. Douglas , purported to bridge the gap between a society 's production and its purchasing power ; Aberhart maintained that this gap was the source of Alberta 's economic hardships . Reid was leery of Aberhart though he , like most politicians of the era , pronounced himself in favour of Douglas 's philosophy . T. C. Byrne suggests that this expressed support was dishonest , that Reid considered social credit in all of its forms to be " complete nonsense " , and paid it lip service only because of its popularity among voters . 
 Though he was gaining adherents , Aberhart insisted that his aim was not to enter politics , but to persuade existing parties to adopt social credit in their platforms . To this end , he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935 . The night before , he organised a reception for delegates . Besides Aberhart , it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart had been making considerable use in presentations around the province : the Man from Mars , who expressed bewilderment that poverty could exist in the midst of plenty and that governments were doing nothing about it , and Kant B. Dunn , who brought up straw man arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle . Another of Aberhart 's characters , the bumbling socialist C. C. Heifer , did not make an appearance ; Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller suggest that this was to avoid alienating the many UFA members who supported socialism . 
 The next day , the UFA began debate on a resolution that read 
 Resolved that a system of social credit as outlined by William Aberhart , Calgary , be put in as a plank in the UFA provincial platform to be brought before the electorate at the next provincial election . 
 Debate was vigorous . One delegate said that UFA members wanted social credit , and if they could not get it through the UFA they would find other means . After three hours , UFA Vice President Norman Priestly noted in frustration that delegates were debating the merits of " a system of social credit as outlined by " Aberhart without ever having heard Aberhart outline his proposed system . It was agreed to invite Aberhart to appear . Using the analogy of blood flowing through the human body , he argued that the 4 imperial quarts ( 4 @.@ 5 l ) of blood contained in the human body were sufficient for the heart to pump much more than that per day ; so it was , he argued , with currency , whose circulation needed to be accelerated to enhance Albertans ' purchasing power . He closed by expressing pessimism that the delegates would choose to support social credit , and this pessimism proved well @-@ founded : though sources are inconsistent on the precise outcome — journalist John Barr reports that the exact vote was not recorded , while historian Bradford Rennie states there were 30 affirmative votes out of 400 delegates present — there is agreement that the resolution was handily defeated . While the vote appeared to be a decisive victory for Reid and his fellow traditionalists , Byrne suggests that many members abstained . 
 The threat from within apparently defeated , Reid and his government turned their attention to the threat from without : the convention 's repudiation had convinced Aberhart that his Social Credit League must run candidates in the next election . Reid 's defence took two forms . The first was an overt attack on Aberhart and his policies . He insisted that Aberhart 's proposed " monthly credit dividends " of C $ 25 could not be issued unless taxes increased tenfold . He argued that Aberhart 's proposed means of raising revenue — " unearned increments " and " production levies " — were actually disguised taxes , which would be paid primarily by farmers , and that his claims that the necessary credit could be created " at the stroke of a fountain pen " on an accounting ledger were absurd . He further pointed out that elements of Aberhart 's plan , including the provincial government 's entry into banking and the creation of a provincial tariff , were ultra vires the province under the Canadian constitution . These themes were expounded on by Priestly and Brownlee , both of whom undertook speaking tours and radio addresses , and by legal and economic experts commissioned by the government . 
 The second element of Reid 's approach was to call into question Aberhart 's understanding of social credit by exposing inconsistencies between his statements and the theories advanced by Douglas . Douglas and Aberhart did not like each other , and Douglas did not believe that Aberhart fully understood his theories ; though he declined to comment publicly , one of his deputies once called one of Aberhart 's pamphlets " fallacious from start to finish " . Hoping to capitalize on this rift , Reid invited Douglas to come to Alberta and serve as " Economic Reconstruction Advisor " at an annual fee of $ 2 @,@ 500 plus a $ 2 @,@ 000 expense allowance for each of his annual three @-@ week trips to the province . Douglas accepted . Angered that the government had incurred this sizable expense without consulting the legislature , Conservative leader David Duggan introduced a motion calling on Aberhart to be hired in a similar capacity . This suited Reid , who hoped that by inducing both men to submit detailed plans he would at last have something concrete from Aberhart to attack , and something equally concrete from Douglas with which to contrast it . Aberhart confounded Reid 's plan by declining his offer . Douglas , for his part , provided mixed results : on his way to Edmonton he publicly repudiated Aberhart 's impugned pamphlet and also pronounced himself against the creation of a provincial social credit political vehicle . On the other hand , shortly after his arrival he sent Aberhart a letter , gleefully released by Aberhart , asserting that there was no conflict between the " Douglas " and " Aberhart " versions of social credit . Moreover , his interim report to the government concerned itself primarily with political and legal , rather than economic , realities : he recommended setting up a provincially controlled media outlet to counter the anti @-@ social credit propaganda he anticipated from the privately owned press , organizing a provincial government credit institution , and accumulating a stockpile of currency , stocks , and bonds . He also suggested that the UFA might need to form a coalition government to implement social credit . The report was of little use to Reid 's government , so he had his Attorney @-@ General , John Lymburn , ask Douglas to critique one of Aberhart 's radio broadcasts . Douglas demurred , and made only vague comments about minor technical errors in the transcript . 
 Reid 's approach to combating Aberhart 's influence had failed . The first element , attacking the validity of Aberhart 's ideas directly , had failed because much of the Alberta public , in abject poverty , was not interested in hearing economic and legal arguments against social credit . This state of mind was illustrated by a voter 's comments to Brownlee on Aberhart 's proposals : 
 Mr. Brownlee , we have listened to you with a great deal of attention and the answers you have given seem pretty hard to meet . But I have one more question ... I 'm selling my wheat at 25 cents a bushel . If I tried to sell a steer tomorrow I 'd probably hardly get enough to pay the freight . I get three cents a dozen for eggs . I 'm lucky to get a dollar for a can of cream . Will you tell me what I 've got to lose ? 
 The second part of the strategy , contrasting Aberhart 's proposals with Douglas 's , failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views . Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation : when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas , they preferred the former , irrespective of credentials or economic expertise . 
 = = = Electoral defeat = = = 
 When the election came in August 1935 , Aberhart offered economic recovery while Reid offered criticisms of Aberhart . Highlighting the UFA 's record of clean government , low taxes , and fiscal responsibility , Reid committed himself and his government to bringing a sense of security . More tangibly , he promised to build a government oil refinery ( predicting that " the near future will witness the greatest explorations for oil which this province has ever known " ) . Most of the campaign was conducted around Social Credit 's promise to pull the province out of depression with its monetary theories . Reid alleged that Aberhart 's policies would destroy the province 's credit and leave it unable to borrow the money it needed to carry on , but voters — even those sceptical of Social Credit 's promises — saw no alternative hopes offered by the UFA . On 11 August , election day , every UFA MLA was defeated ; Reid himself finished third in his riding , barely ahead of the Communist candidate , and resigned as Premier effective 22 August . 
 Time would prove Reid correct in most of his criticisms of Aberhart : he did lack a specific economic agenda , much of his legislation was struck down by the courts , and the depression did continue for several more years in Alberta . This was of cold comfort to Reid , whose defeat was total : at 408 days , his time as Premier was the shortest in the province 's history to that point . 
 = = Life after politics = = 
 After the election , Reid orchestrated a quick transfer of power . The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run , and he wanted to re @-@ establish stability as quickly as possible . Moreover , the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short @-@ term obligations , and the UFA , as a lame duck government , was unable to make promises to would @-@ be creditors . Once in office , confronted with a dire financial situation , Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement . Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement , that the province 's financial problems were due to Social Credit 's policies , both real and promised , and that had the UFA won re @-@ election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty . He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers : as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible . 
 Apart from these occasional forays defending his record , Reid withdrew from politics . He became a commission agent , and later the librarian for Canadian Utilities Limited . For this latter role , he was made an honorary member of the Edmonton Library Association . During World War II , he served on the Canadian government 's mobilisation board . Richard Reid died in Edmonton 17 October 1980 at the age of 101 . He was cremated , and his ashes buried in Edmonton . 
 Historians generally view Reid as a victim of circumstance : like many governments across Canada , his was defeated by the Great Depression . Rennie argues that Reid 's approach to government , frugal and non @-@ interventionist , was well @-@ suited to the prosperous 1920s but less so to the 1930s , and highlights his lack of charisma . But he also writes that virtually nobody could have won the 1935 election for the UFA . Foster agrees , assessing Reid as " a quietly competent , gentle man " who " merited the confidence of his colleagues " , but who was in 1935 " distinctly out of his element " . As Rennie closes , " In 1935 Albertans wanted a saviour . Richard Gavin Reid was a mere mortal . "

 = Flekkefjord Line = 
 The Flekkefjord Line ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is a 17 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 10 @.@ 6 mi ) abandoned branch line to the Sørland Line . It ran between Sira and Flekkefjord in Vest @-@ Agder , Norway . The only current activity on the line is tourist draisines . The station buildings along the line were designed by the architect Paul Armin Due — these have all been demolished . 
 The line opened in 1904 as a 64 @-@ kilometre ( 40 mi ) extension of the narrow gauge Jæren Line . It was planned as the first step of a main line along the South Coast . At Flekkefjord , there was steam ship connection , onwards to Oslo . In 1941 , the line was converted to standard gauge , and in 1944 the Sørland Line was completed . The western part of the Flekkefjord Line was integrated into it , while the remaining section became the branch line that kept the name Flekkefjord Line . During the 1940s , steam locomotive @-@ hauled trains were replaced by railcars . Following the declining traffic , in part due to the slow speeds caused by the line 's narrow profile , the line was closed , with the last trains running in 1990 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The first committee that looked into the possibility of a railway to Flekkefjord was created in 1875 . After the completion of Jæren Line from Stavanger to Egersund , in 1878 , proposals were made to build an extension westwards along the coast , that eventually would reach Oslo . The first part of what was named the <unk> Line was passed by Parliament in 1894 , and would run from Egersund , via Sira , to Flekkefjord . The initial proposal proposed that the line would eventually continue onwards via Mandal to Kristiansand . The decision to build the line was taken by the Parliament of Norway in 1894 . Construction started in 1896 , and was originally planned to be completed by 1902 . However , delays prevented the line from being be brought into use before 1 November 1904 . The line was built by the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) and was 64 km ( 40 mi ) long . 
 The coast between Egersund and Flekkefjord would give a very difficult route to build , so it was decided to build a more inland line . Like the Jæren Line , and most railways being built at the time , the Flekkefjord Line was built in 1 @,@ 067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) narrow gauge . Both telephone and telegraph cables were laid along the line . Along the section from Sirnes to Flekkefjord , there were many vertical cliffs straight into the fjord , forcing 5 @.@ 4 km ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) , or 38 percent , of the line to be built in tunnels . Of the whole length from Egersund to Flekkefjord , there are 46 tunnels , totaling 8 @.@ 8 km ( 5 @.@ 5 mi ) . The most prominent was <unk> Tunnel which is 1 @,@ 174 m ( 3 @,@ 852 ft ) long . Just before Flekkefjord , a 71 @-@ metre ( 233 ft ) bridge was built that crosses <unk> ; it was a reused bridge from the Voss Line . In total , about 12 % of the line consisted of tunnels . Francis Hagerup , when delivering the line 's opening speech , remarked that no other railway had until then been more difficult to construct . 
 All the stations along the line were designed by Paul Armin Due , with all but the terminal station built in wood . Flekkefjord Station was built as a three @-@ story brick building in Art Nouveau . In addition , there was construction a depot and a wharf at Flekkefjord . Passengers could transfer to steam ship services that operated eastwards along the south coast towards Oslo . 
 = = = Pre @-@ war operations = = = 
 The first part of the line to open for temporary operation was between Flekkefjord and Moi on 1 October 1904 . For the official opening , the town of Flekkefjord was adorned with Norwegian flags . A train departed to Egersund on 31 October 1904 with several notable passengers : Prime Minister Francis Hagerup , State Railways director Elias Sunde and board member Sven <unk> , director of traffic Jens Christian <unk> , Flekkefjord 's mayor and city council as well as other mayors of the district . Festivities continued on the next day , when the train returned from Egersund to Flekkefjord . 
 Initially there were four services in each direction each day , with three services on holy days . The train that connected with the steam ship would wait up to 45 minutes in case of delays , to allow connection . Until 1927 , the routes remained the same . That year , the Kragerø Line opened , and it became possible to take a night train from Oslo to Kragerø , continue by bus to Flekkefjord , and be in Stavanger the following afternoon . Travel time was further reduced when the Sørland Line was extended to Arendal in 1935 . The initial rolling stock was from the Voss Line , and some of the bridges and track was from that line too . The Voss Line was being upgraded to 25 @-@ kilogram ( 55 lb ) rail tracks , and 25 km ( 16 mi ) of 17 kg ( 37 lb ) track was used on the Flekkefjord Line . 
 Until 1927 , all trains were operated with steam locomotives . NSB introduced the first diesel multiple unit with the introduction of " lightning trains " that corresponded with coach services that connected with the Kragerø Line . The first were Class 14 railcars . These reduced travel time from Flekkefjord to Stavanger by 50 minutes to 3 hours 15 minutes . In addition to passengers , major cargo were herring and lumber . 
 = = = Connecting the coast = = = 
 In 1923 , it was decided by parliament that the Sørland Line , that would connect Oslo , Kristiansand and Stavanger , would follow an inner route . The section of the Flekkefjord Line from Egersund to Sira would become part of that line , while the eastern 17 @.@ 1 km ( 10 @.@ 6 mi ) from Sira to Flekkefjord would become a branch line , retaining the Flekkefjord Line name . Since the Sørland Line needed to be built from the east , construction along the Flekkefjord Line did not start until 1940 . After the German occupation of Norway during World War II , the German occupation forces were rebuilding the narrow gauge railways to standard gauge . In 1940 – 41 , the Flekkefjord and Jæren Lines were rebuilt to dual gauge . Not until 1944 was the Flekkefjord Line only standard gauge . 
 Due to limited funds , and unlike the rest of the Jæren Line , the profile of the Flekkefjord Line was not changed during the conversion of gauge . This gave a speed limit of 40 kilometres per hour ( 25 mph ) , and creative solutions such as lowering height of the ballast by 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) . The route from Egersund to Sira received a better upgrade , since it was to become part of the main line through Southern Norway . The route between Sira and Sirnes was completely rebuilt .

 After the line had been relegated to a branch line , traffic fell considerably . Another factor was car traffic , which did not exist in Flekkefjord until 1918 , but thereafter became widespread . After the war , Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line . During the 1940 , several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use , and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units . From 1956 to 1966 , also Class 86 units were used on the line , but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic . Class 87 remained in service until 1981 , when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden . At first , two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February . After they proved to work well , NSB bought them for 95 @,@ 000 Swedish kronor plus freight . Two more units were bought in 1986 .

 The line had major limitations on speed , and also served the " wrong direction " , heading westwards into less populated areas instead of the populated parts of Agder in the east . Major investments would be needed to upgrade the line to a suitable speed , and through the 1970s this became an important issue of debate . On the other hand , the line had among the highest ridership of the branch lines , with 120 @,@ 000 passengers per year , which was for instance 50 % higher than the Arendal Line , which was not closed . However , parliament decided to close the line , along with several other branch lines , in 1988 , with effect from 1990 . The last scheduled train ran on 31 December 1990 . 
 There were plans to establish private operations along the line . Continental Railway Systems was established by Rasmus <unk> . The company would be allowed to use the rolling stock and infrastructure , and two of the trains were painted white . However , it was not possible for the company to get the necessary bank surety demanded by NSB , and nothing came of the plans . 
 The line has been suggested preserved as a cultural heritage , since it represents one of very few railways with the original narrow gauge profile intact . However , all stations have been demolished ; Flekkefjord in 1970 , Sirnes in 1977 and <unk> in 1988 . The organization Friends of the Flekkefjord Line offer rental of draisines for tourists since the closure of the line , and a round trip from Flekkefjord to <unk> just outside Sira takes about three hours . However , the Norwegian National Rail Administration have since banned the operation of draisines until the line is fully fenced in .

 " Distant Lights " is a song recorded by American indie rock band Ivy . It was released as the lead single from their sixth studio album , All Hours ( 2011 ) . It was issued in the United States on June 7 , 2011 as a digital download by Nettwerk . The single was written and produced by Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase . 
 After its release , " Distant Lights " received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who complemented the track for being " completely different " when compared to Ivy 's previous material . However , one reviewer found the track to be " boring " and " outdated " . The track was made available as a free download for a short amount of time in support of the release of All Hours .

 After the release of In the Clear ( 2005 ) , Ivy embarked on an extended hiatus to focus their time on their children and solo careers . Member Adam Schlesinger was busy with his side project Fountains of Wayne , while Andy Chase was working on a new band named Brookville . In 2008 , they worked on a new record , even completing most of the project . However , after listening to the completed material , they found it to be " awful " ; Chase stated that " it was the first time [ they ] doubted whether [ they ] even had another Ivy album left in [ them ] . " 
 Afraid that Ivy would become " unrecognizable " and " boring " , Durand stated that " [ she ] really can 't stand when [ she sees ] musicians , great songwriters , and after having kids they become so boring , [ she talks ] about that all day . [ She doesn 't ] need to talk about that in [ her ] songs , " concluding that she needed " escape " . Durand was determined to create " the best album yet " and set up dates and recording sessions with Chase and Schlesinger to work on what would become All Hours .

 Requiem for a Species : Why We Resist the Truth about Climate Change is a 2010 non @-@ fiction book by Australian academic Clive Hamilton which explores climate change denial and its implications . It argues that climate change will bring about large @-@ scale , harmful consequences for habitability for life on Earth including humans , which it is too late to prevent . Hamilton explores why politicians , corporations and the public deny or refuse to act on this reality . He invokes a variety of explanations , including wishful thinking , ideology , consumer culture and active lobbying by the fossil fuel industry . The book builds on the author 's fifteen @-@ year prior history of writing about these subjects , with previous books including Growth Fetish and Scorcher : The Dirty Politics of Climate Change . 
 Requiem for a Species has been reviewed in Resurgence magazine , Socialist Review , Sydney Morning Herald , The Age , The Common Review , and Times Higher Education , which named it " Book of the Week " . Extracts of the book have appeared in The Guardian and Geographical magazine . The book won a 2010 Queensland Premier 's Literary Award . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Hamilton points out that there have been many reports and books over the years explaining the climate change problem and just how ominous the future looks for humanity . He says Requiem for a Species is primarily about why those warnings have been ignored . 
 Hamilton considers that sometimes an inconvenient truth may be too difficult to bear : 
 Sometimes facing up to the truth is just too hard . When the facts are distressing it is easier to reframe or ignore them . Around the world only a few have truly faced up to the facts about global warming ... It 's the same with our own deaths ; we all " accept " that we will die , but it is only when our death is imminent that we confront the true meaning of our mortality . 
 The most immediate reason for the failure to act on global warming is seen to be the " sustained and often ruthless exercise of political power by the corporations who stand to lose from a shift to low- and zero @-@ carbon energy systems " . Hamilton cites numerous journalists and authors who have documented the influence of large companies such as ExxonMobil , Rio Tinto Group and General Motors . Hamilton makes his argument in three stages : 
 Firstly , he reviews the evidence about how serious the situation is already and how much worse it will get . Secondly , he examines the roots of denial , both in terms of resistance to the evidence and in relation to the actors and agencies motivated to deny climate change . Lastly , he looks at some future scenarios and explains what people should do . 
 Hamilton suggests that the foundations of climate change denial lie in the reaction of American conservatism to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . He argues that as the " red menace " receded , conservatives who had put energy into opposing communism sought other outlets . Hamilton contends that the conservative backlash against climate science was led by three prominent physicists -- Frederick Seitz , Robert Jastrow , and William Nierenberg . In 1984 Seitz , Jastrow and Nierenberg founded the George C. Marshall Institute , and in the 1990s the Marshall Institute 's main activity was attacking climate science . 
 When describing climate science , Hamilton says that official numbers published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) are highly cautious , and so the real effects of climate change will likely be even more severe . His conclusion is that it will not be possible to stabilise emissions : 
 ... even with the most optimistic set of assumptions -- the ending of deforestation , a halving of emissions associated with food production , global emissions peaking in 2020 and then falling by 3 per cent a year for a few decades -- we have no chance of preventing emissions rising well above a number of critical tipping points that will spark uncontrollable climate change . The Earth 's climate would enter a chaotic era lasting thousands of years before natural processes eventually establish some sort of equilibrium . Whether human beings would still be a force on the planet , or even survive , is a moot point . One thing seems certain : there will be far fewer of us . 
 In terms of Australia , Hamilton says that " Australians in 2050 will be living in a nation transformed by a changing climate , with widespread doubt over whether we will make it to the end of the century in a land that is recognisably Australian " .

 Michael Lynn in The Common Review says that Requiem for a Species explores the gulf between acknowledgment and acceptance of climate change . Lynn explains that the gulf has two main origins and no easy solution : 
 Hamilton ... argues that the gulf has two primary origins : the enormity of its consequences and the way it challenges how we as individuals and as societies have constructed our identities over the past three centuries . In doing so , he suggests that meeting the challenge of climate change requires far more than implementing the right policies and making minor adjustments in our lifestyles . Instead , it implies remaking our psyches and societies on a scale unseen since the dawn of the modern age . 
 The Times Higher Education listed Requiem for a Species as " Book of the week " for 3 June 2010 . Steven Yearley 's review calls it a " provocative and sobering book " . He says the heart of the book are the many explanations that Hamilton puts forward for the everyday , regular denial of the danger of changing climate . Yearley says this is also the most frustrating aspect of Requiem for a Species , because Hamilton proposes so many different explanations but does not make their relative significance clear . 
 David Shearman , in a review for Doctors for the Environment Australia , says that " Clive Hamilton is one of Australia 's most notable public intellectuals , his work is careful and balanced , he presents the facts as they are and has written a book which is uncomfortable for all " . According to Shearman , Hamilton 's treatment of the topic of denial is one of the best available . 
 Mike Hulme , in Resurgence magazine , agrees with the " consumption fetish " and " spiritual malaise " of humanity that Hamilton describes . But , according to Hulme , Hamilton has underestimated the " innovative and creative potential of collective humanity " and he has put too much faith in the infallibility of science 's predictions about future climate risks . Hulme believes that Hamilton " is placing too much weight on the foresight of science to provide his desired revolution , rather than calling for it more honestly and directly through political , psychological or spiritual engagement " . 
 Kelsey Munro reviewed the book in the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age , suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope . But he says pessimism is not the same thing as fatalism , and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst @-@ case scenarios by reducing emissions . Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists , like Princeton University 's Michael Oppenheimer , remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late . 
 Camilla Royle reviewed Requiem for a Species in Socialist Review and recommends it for those who want to get a clearer idea of climate change science . She says that Hamilton is understandably angry at the corporate lobbyists who have encouraged climate change denial . Royle suggests that Hamilton accepts that " we should at least try to do something about climate change " , but he " doesn 't give much idea of what that something is " . 
 There was a book launch for Requiem for a Species on 24 March 2010 at The University of Queensland and another on 29 March 2010 at the Australian National University ( ANU ) . An extract of the book appeared in The Guardian on 16 April 2010 . Geographical magazine published another extract in August 2010 . The book won the 2010 " Queensland Premier 's Literary Award for a work Advancing Public Debate " .

 = Rotating locomotion in living systems = 
 There exist two distinct modes of locomotion using rotation : first , simple rolling ; and second , the use of wheels , which spin relative to a fixed axle or body . Several organisms are capable of rolling . However , despite their utility in human vehicles , true wheels do not appear to play a significant role in the movement of living things ( with the notable exception of certain flagella , which function like corkscrews ) . Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels , and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction . 
 Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology , and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies ( such as wings and lenses ) , the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation – and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors . First , there are several developmental and evolutionary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by natural selection – addressing the question " Why can 't life evolve wheels ? " . Secondly , wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion ( such as walking , running , or slithering ) in natural environments – addressing the question " If wheels could evolve , why would they be rare nonetheless ? " . Incidentally , this environment @-@ specific disadvantage also explains why some historical civilizations have abandoned wheels . 
 = = Known instances of rotation in biology = = 
 = = = Rolling = = = 
 Some organisms use rolling as a means of locomotion . These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel , as the entire organism rotates rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently . 
 Several species of elongate organisms will form their bodies into a loop in order to roll , including caterpillars , tiger beetle larvae , myriapods , mantis shrimp , and salamanders , while other species adopt more spherical postures , as observed in pangolins , hedgehogs , armadillos , Armadillo girdled lizards , isopods , wheel spiders , and fossilized trilobites . These species may roll passively ( under the influence of gravity or wind ) or actively , typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force . <unk> are the above @-@ ground portions of certain plants , which separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to distribute their seeds . 
 Dung beetles form spherical balls of animal excrement , which they roll with their bodies . Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself , the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with . 
 <unk> , a type of skin cell , migrate with a rolling motion during the process of wound healing . 
 <unk> , although their Latin name means " wheel @-@ bearer " , do not have any rotating structures , but rather a ring of rhythmically beating cilia used for feeding and propulsion . 
 = = = Wheel @-@ like rotation = = = 
 = = = = Macroscopic = = = = 
 Among animals , there exists a single known example of an apparently freely @-@ rotating structure , though it is not propulsive — the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods . The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia @-@ lined sac and extends into the stomach . The cilia rotate the rod , so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus . As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach , it releases digestive enzymes . Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly , and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently . 
 = = = = Molecular = = = = 
 There are two known examples of molecular rotating structures used by living cells . ATP synthase is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer , notably in photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation . It bears some similarity to the flagellar motors discussed below . The evolution of ATP synthase is thought to be an example of modular evolution , in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality . 
 The only known example of a biological " wheel " — a system capable of providing continuous propulsive torque about a fixed body — is the flagellum , a corkscrew @-@ like tail used by single @-@ celled prokaryotes for propulsion . The bacterial flagellum is the best known example . About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum , indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems , though it is restricted to the microscopic environment . 
 At the base of the bacterial flagellum , where it enters the cell membrane , a motor protein acts as a rotary engine . The engine is powered by proton motive force , i.e. , by the flow of protons ( hydrogen ions ) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell 's metabolism . ( In species of the genus Vibrio , there are two kinds of flagella , lateral and polar , and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump . ) Flagella are quite efficient , allowing bacteria to move at speeds up to 60 cell lengths per second . The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase . <unk> bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end , and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water . 
 Archaea , a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria , also feature flagella driven by rotary motor proteins , which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella . Whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial Type III secretion system , archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from Type IV pili . 
 Some eukaryotic cells , such as the protist Euglena , also have flagella , but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base ; rather , they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle . The eukaryotic flagellum , also called a cilium or <unk> , is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella .
