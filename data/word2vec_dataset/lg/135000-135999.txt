 Many critics have stated that the film 's story is inspired by the German tragicomedy Good Bye , Lenin ! ( 2003 ) . Regarding the same , Vaitla said " I saw Good Bye , Lenin ! when the scripting of Dookudu was 50 per cent complete . It was a coincidence . I had the idea of showing Mahesh in a new way as a young MLA . I also had the idea of the father . Then , Gopimohan came in , and we worked on the script for seven months . It 's a multi @-@ layered film and writing the screenplay for it was tough . " He added that the idea of how lies are told and you get people to believe them was already shown in his earlier film Ready ( 2008 ) . 
 He chose father @-@ son relationship in the film as he wanted to show the emotions between them . Apart from that , Vaitla was inspired by other small things from Good Bye , Lenin ! . One such inspired sequence is where the protagonist and his team create fake news broadcasts and newspapers for showing them to his father to make the drama believable which includes making N. T. Rama Rao the president of India in 2011 . And , the scene where the protagonist lies to his father about few things without knowing that the latter is aware of the drama is inspired from the climax of Good Bye , Lenin ! . 
 A reviewer from Sify felt that some of the scenes and characters are inspired by Mahesh 's previous films Athadu ( 2005 ) and Pokiri ( 2006 ) apart from the Hindi Patiala House ( 2011 ) . In one of the comedy scenes , M. S. Narayana is seen performing spoofs of Yamadonga ( 2007 ) , Magadheera ( 2009 ) , Simha ( 2010 ) and Enthiran ( 2010 ) . According to K.

The event was aired live on MAA TV and on the film 's official website from 7 : 30 PM . The album cover depicts a promotional still of Mahesh Babu from the film 's title song . 
 The soundtrack was successful in its collections . However , it received mixed response from critics . Suresh Kavirayani of The Times of India called the film 's music impressive . A reviewer from IANS felt that " Nee Dookudu " and " <unk> " were well shot and composed while the overall music could have been better . Sify wrote " <unk> music sounded average in the theatres , though a couple of numbers – <unk> and <unk> – could enliven the mood of the spectators . The background score and the music during some romantic moments are dull . " IndiaGlitz termed it the first passable album of Thaman and called it a forgettable one .

 Suresh Kavirayani of The Times of India rated it 4 out of 5 and wrote " Dookudu is a typical Srinu <unk> film with a generous sprinkling of comedy . His narrative manages to keep the audience engaged until the end of the movie . This movie comes as a blessing for not just Mahesh Babu , but also for Tollywood , which is badly in need of a hit , after the recent spate of box office debacles . Srinu <unk> and Mahesh Babu have come out with a winner in Dookudu " . Bollywood Life stated " Dookudu has all the elements of a potboiler – the unholy nexus between underworld and politicos , passionate romance , shrill revenge and the glory of father @-@ son relationship . The movie is almost certain to make a box office splash , but if fans are expecting the lofty fizz of Pokkiri , perhaps there is some disappointment in store " . Sify called the film " entertaining " and wrote " Despite the drawbacks , Dookudu holds the power to lure the crowds , with its commercial values . It is a bonanza to Mahesh <unk> fans and it will not disappoint the family crowds either . " IANS rated it 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 and stated " Dookudu is a treat for Mahesh 's fans . But others can also enjoy this film for its comedy elements and Mahesh 's powerful presence . " <unk> <unk> of Upperstall.com wrote " The best thing about the movie is that it comes across as a mass entertainer and makes no attempts to come across as a intellectual movie or a movie that tries to pretend it is ' <unk> ' . " 
 In contrast , B. V. S. Prakash of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote " Although , it is a tale of a honest cop who is on the trail of a dreaded don , director <unk> Vaitla relies on a band of comedians like Brahmanandam and M.S. Narayana to sustain audience interests , before his protagonist accomplishes his mission . Audiences have to leave behind their thinking caps at home to enjoy this comic @-@ caper since the screenplay has few gaping holes and is repetitive as well . " Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff gave it 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 and criticised the film 's screenplay and logic @-@ defying sequences , but praised Mahesh Babu 's performance , calling his role a " cakewalk " and recommending the film for his fans in particular .

 Dookudu became one of the biggest hits in the history of Telugu cinema and was the biggest hit in Mahesh Babu 's career by the end of its lifetime run . The film ended the five @-@ year career slump of Mahesh Babu and marked his image makeover . The Times of India called it one of the top ten must watch Telugu films of 2011 . The Los Angeles Times wrote a special article about Mahesh and the film 's massive collections in United States and called the film " The biggest hit you 've never heard of " . After the film 's gross crossed ₹ 1 billion , Income Tax Department officials conducted a raid on the Jubilee Hills residence of Mahesh as he was rumoured to get a remuneration of more than ₹ 1 @.@ 2 million for his next projects . 
 The film 's success made Samantha Ruth Prabhu one of the most sought heroines in Telugu cinema . Parvati Melton received more offers for performing item numbers post the film 's release . Dasari Narayana Rao said the film arrived at the right time and had provided a good amount of relief to the Telugu film industry , which was under a huge loss at that point of time . Samantha auctioned the costumes used by Mahesh in the film for raising funds for the charity organisation " <unk> " . Vaitla 's next film with Mahesh namely Aagadu ( 2014 ) , which too was produced by 14 Reels Entertainment and had the same technical crew of this film , was a failure at the box office . The Hindu cited similarities with Dookudu as one of the reasons of the film 's failure .

 The game is a turn @-@ based strategy focuses on the invasion and land battles of Iwo Jima . The player commands the United States Marine Corps against the Imperial Japanese Army , who are occupying the islands as part of the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II . The game is menu @-@ based and only allows the player to use four command functions ; move , attack , land and pass . Depending on the difficulty set , the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends . During the game , the enemy may fortify their positions , launch air strikes against the United States Navy fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to be wiped out . The player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy , if weather permits . 
 At the beginning of the game , the player has to allocate a number of American troops in order to establish a beachhead on one of the six beaches of the island . However , many of the beaches are scattered with land mines and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault . Throughout the game , the player may call in air strikes and other assaults , however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location . At any time in the game , the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet . Furthermore , Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game , although the player will be given the opportunity to shoot them down . In addition , a Japanese submarine will sink American gunboats at random intervals , and cannot be destroyed in any way . There is no save function in the game .

 Personal Software Services was founded in Coventry , England , by Gary Mays and Richard Cockayne in 1981 . The company were known for creating games that revolved around historic war battles and conflicts , such as Theatre Europe , Bismark and Falklands ' 82 . The company had a partnership with French video game developer ERE Informatique , and published localised versions of their products to the United Kingdom . In 1986 , Cockayne took a decision to alter their products for release on 16 @-@ bit consoles , as he found that smaller 8 @-@ bit consoles such as the ZX Spectrum lacked the processing power for larger strategy games . The decision was falsely interpreted as " pulling out " from the Spectrum market by video game journalist Phillipa Irving . Following years of successful sales throughout the mid 1980s , Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties , in what Cockayne admitted in a retrospective interview that " he took his eye off the ball " . The company was acquired by Mirrorsoft in February 1987 , and was later dispossessed by the company due to strains of debt .

 The game received mixed reviews form critics upon release . Both Gwyn Hughes of Your Sinclair and a reviewer of ZX Computing praised the game 's value for money and heralded it as a " good introduction " to the wargaming genre , although Hughes believed that Iwo Jima was unlikely to provide established tacticians with a " major challenge " and the reviewer of ZX Computing was concerned that the game was " too easy " . Sean Masterson of Crash criticised the graphics , stating that it was " let down by poor unit markers and terrain features " . Gary Rook of Sinclair User asserted that the game was overall " competent " , however he summarised it as " failing to excite " . Rook also added that the game was well implemented and " inspiring " . 
 A reviewer of Computer and Video Games criticised the game for having an " awkward mechanism " due to the lack of a save feature and neglecting historic realism . However , he compared the historical accuracy of the Battle of Iwo Jima for being more accurate than Falklands ' 82 's interpretation of the Falklands War . Mark Reed of Computer Gamer stated that the game is " ideal " for novice players and also praised the simplicity of the controls , despite suggesting that experienced gamers of the genre would prefer " something more complex " . Masterson similarly criticised the game 's suitability for experienced gamers , suggesting that any appeal for a more experienced player is likely to be " very limited " . 
 = 1998 – 99 Manchester United F.C. season = 
 The 1998 – 99 season was the most successful season in the history of Manchester United Football Club . After finishing the previous season without winning any titles , United won a treble of trophies ( the Premier League , FA Cup and UEFA Champions League ) , the first side in English football to achieve such a feat . During the campaign United lost only five times , including a one @-@ off Charity Shield fixture , in the League Cup against eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur and their only home defeat , a league match against Middlesbrough in December 1998 . A run of 33 games unbeaten in all competitions began on 26 December at home to Nottingham Forest . 
 Veteran players Brian McClair and Gary Pallister , along with a host of younger and less experienced players such as goalkeeper Kevin Pilkington and striker Graeme Tomlinson , had left the club before the season began . The big news of the pre @-@ season was the arrival of Dutch defender Jaap Stam for a club record fee of £ 10 @.@ 75 million . Other additions included striker Dwight Yorke and Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist . Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel announced his intention to leave the club after eight years at Old Trafford , joining Sporting Clube de Portugal at the end of the season . 
 The team 's never @-@ say @-@ die attitude , instilled in previous seasons , was key to their success as the players often thrived in difficult situations . The highlight was United 's dramatic comeback in the Champions League final , when Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær each scored in injury time to overturn Bayern Munich 's first @-@ half lead . David Beckham was runner up to Rivaldo for 1999 's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards . 
 Fans and writers regard the treble haul as manager Alex Ferguson 's finest hour , although he dismissed that assertion in later years . Tens of thousands of fans lined the streets of Manchester to welcome the team as the season drew to a close . In recognition of his achievements Ferguson was awarded a knighthood , and handed the Freedom of the City of Glasgow in November 1999 . 
 By the end of the season Manchester United had become the world ’ s richest football club , and the most valuable sporting brand worldwide . The club was also at the centre of a takeover bid by BSkyB , which was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in March 1999 .

Teddy Sheringham ’ s intervention and a last gasp free kick by David Beckham helped the home side salvage a point , setting a precedent for things to come . The team 's first away game at West Ham followed , but despite the debut of striker Dwight Yorke , United were held to a goalless draw . Beckham , who had become a national hate figure after his dismissal in the World Cup , received a torrid reception by the home supporters , with every touch of the ball made by him jeered at .

The match was marred with demonstrations in and around Old Trafford against the proposed takeover of the club by BSkyB . Obscene chants were directed at chairman Martin Edwards , who had given his support to the merger . A 2 – 0 victory against Coventry City the following week put United in perfect stead for the clash at home to Barcelona , but a comprehensive defeat to champions Arsenal left the team in 10th position . This was Arsène Wenger 's third straight victory over Ferguson ( four in all competitions ) ; goals from Tony Adams , Nicolas Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg condemned Manchester United to their heaviest away defeat in more than two years . To compound the misery midfielder Nicky Butt , who had been sent off in the Champions League match earlier in the week , was handed a second red card in the space of four days after a lunge on French international Patrick Vieira . United ended the month with a win , beating rivals Liverpool 2 – 0 to move into fifth spot .

 A trip to The Dell on 3 October was taken with caution given United 's return from Munich in the Champions League and winless record at the ground . The team lost to Southampton in each of their last three visits , including a 6 – 3 mauling in 1996 . Despite dominating possession and clear @-@ cut chances in the previous season ’ s fixture , United lost by a single goal leaving Ferguson to question when , not if he would eventually break the jinx . Andy Cole was paired with Yorke for only the second time this season , a tactic that paid off as both got on the score sheet . Substitute Jordi Cruyff added a third in the 75th minute to move United into second place in the table , four points behind leaders Aston Villa going into the international break . Raimond van der Gouw who deputised for injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel at Southampton featured again at home to Wimbledon , a match that Manchester United won 5 – 1 , the biggest win of the season at Old Trafford . Ryan Giggs , Beckham , Yorke and Cole ( twice ) all scored ; Ferguson in particular hailed the contribution of 19 @-@ year @-@ old defender Wes Brown . United earned a point away at Derby County on 24 October , and deservedly beat Everton 4 – 1 at Goodison Park on Halloween to cut the gap at the top to just a point .

 Manchester United drew their first and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United , but made amends with a 3 – 2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers .

A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk consigned Ferguson to his second defeat in the league and extended a barren run at Hillsborough ; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits . On 29 November , Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw , after going two goals down in the first half . A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and kept up the pressure on the challengers .

 Three straight draws followed in December , the first away to league leaders Aston Villa . United were fortunate to pick up a point given their opponents dominance in the second half , and were careless at Tottenham Hotspur , throwing away a 2 – 0 lead . Solskjær put United two goals ahead , but in the 39th minute Gary Neville received a red card for a second bookable offence , tugging on David Ginola 's shirt . Spurs captain Sol Campbell brought his team back into the match with 20 minutes remaining and on the cusp of stoppage time powered a header in the top left @-@ hand corner , sparking jubilant scenes at White Hart Lane . Chelsea grabbed a creditable draw at Old Trafford to stake their championship credentials four days later and United , who were without their manager Ferguson for the Middlesbrough game were beaten 3 – 2 ; their last defeat of the season . On Boxing Day the team collected three points against Nottingham Forest and merited a point at Stamford Bridge in the last match of 1998 to solidify their position in the top four .

 A power cut at Old Trafford delayed proceedings against West Ham on 10 January , a match that ended 4 – 1 to Manchester United .

Five goals were scored in the second half including a hat @-@ trick for the former , cutting Chelsea 's lead at the top to two points . On 31 January , Manchester United moved a point clear at the Premiership summit for the first time in the season . Yorke 's late header in the 89th minute made the 1 – 0 victory at Charlton Athletic their third consecutive league win ( fifth in the month ) . Ferguson praised the team 's resolve , adding , " It 's a good result for us , because there are games where you have to dig in and find a result . "

 Manchester United beat Derby County 1 – 0 at home on 3 February to move four points ahead of Chelsea . Three days later the team set a new record at the City Ground , racking up the biggest away Premier League win ( 8 – 1 ) . Substitute Ole Gunnar <unk> scored four times in the space of ten minutes , adding to an already commanding scoreline . Ron Atkinson , the manager of Nottingham Forest , declared Manchester United to be the best team in the league by " a country mile " , and Ferguson was now handed a selection dilemma ahead of the clash against Arsenal on 17 February . The Gunners were without Dennis Bergkamp , Emmanuel Petit and Martin Keown , and conceded an early penalty when Ray Parlour brought down Johnsen . Yorke missed , chipping the ball wide of the right @-@ hand post , and was made to pay early in the second half as Nwankwo Kanu 's through ball found striker Anelka , who put his team into the lead . Given Arsenal ’ s defensive record , another clean sheet looked to be on the cards until a header by Cole in the 60th minute drew the game level . United from then on had several chances to win the game , but a point each left the title race finely balanced . Back to back wins starting with a 1 – 0 win at Coventry on 20 February , and a 2 – 1 win at home to Southampton a week later , maintained United 's grip on first position . 
 = = = March and April = = = 
 Cup duties were the main priority in March as United played only two league fixtures : away to Newcastle and at home to Everton . Two wins out of two , including two goals by Cole against his former club , Newcastle , helped the team to become the first to reach 60 points in the season . 
 Manchester United could only manage a 1 – 1 draw at Wimbledon on 3 April as Beckham ’ s well @-@ drilled shot cancelled out Jason Euell 's opener in the fifth minute . Despite several of the first @-@ team members being rested for the Juventus tie , United won 3 – 0 at Old Trafford against Sheffield Wednesday and battled well to earn a point against Leeds at Elland Road after the midweek tie at Juventus . But the result allowed Arsenal to move to the top of the Premiership for the first time this season , albeit having played one game more , after scoring six against Middlesbrough at the Riverside .

 Another versatile performance by Beckham dragged United back to the summit , but Arsenal ’ s win at Derby the following Sunday restored the champion 's slender advantage . Against Liverpool at Anfield , Ferguson restored the Cole – Yorke partnership , and within 23 minutes the latter scored the opener from a Beckham cross . In the second half United were awarded a penalty for a challenge on Jesper Blomqvist by Jamie Carragher , which Irwin successfully converted . But Irwin was sent off in the 75th minute for a second bookable offence just after Jamie Redknapp scored through a penalty to give Liverpool hope . Paul Ince , scrambled the equaliser two minutes from time . The United manager did not hide his discomfort , adding he thought " the referee handed it to them . " On the same night , Arsenal convincingly beat rivals Tottenham to move three points clear , having still played a game more . Wenger was adamant that United were marginal favourites , but it was clear the title race would be decided on the final day , akin to 1995 . 
 With two games remaining , Yorke scored his 29th goal of the season at Middlesbrough to help his team return to the top of the table . Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink 's late winner against Arsenal two days later all but ended Wenger ’ s chances of retaining the league championship . United now needed only four points , one of them gained at Ewood Park , relegating Blackburn Rovers in the process . Manchester United eventually secured the championship on the final day , coming back from a goal down against Tottenham to win 2 – 1 . The achievement was all the more special for Ferguson , who lifted his fifth domestic championship in seven seasons .

 Despite receiving a home draw in each of their first four rounds ( Third to Sixth ) , United were paired against difficult opponents throughout the competition . On their route to the final they defeated five Premier League teams : Middlesbrough , Liverpool , Chelsea , Arsenal and Newcastle United . The only non @-@ Premier League team that United played in the competition was Fulham , who at the time played in the Second Division , the third tier of English football , but even they were not considered <unk> , having claimed shock wins over Southampton and Aston Villa in the previous rounds . 
 In the third round , United were drawn against Middlesbrough , who had recently beaten them in the league . Andy Townsend gave Middlesbrough the lead at half time , but goals from Cole , Irwin and Giggs gave United a 3 – 1 victory . 
 United faced Liverpool at home in the following round , where the visitors took the lead from a Michael Owen header inside three minutes . In spite of creating plenty of goalscoring chances , the team failed to equalise until the 86th minute , when Yorke scored off a Beckham free kick . In the second minute of stoppage time , Ole Gunnar Solskjær hit a shot that sent Liverpool goalkeeper David James the wrong way to give United the win . 
 Cole scored the winner against Fulham on Valentine 's Day to set up a quarter @-@ final clash at home to Chelsea . Although there were no goals , Paul Scholes and Roberto Di Matteo were both sent off and missed the replay , three days later at Stamford Bridge . Yorke kept up his ever @-@ improving goalscoring record , scoring two goals against the Blues on 10 March . 
 United played cup holders Arsenal in the semi @-@ final at Villa Park on 11 April . Neither team was able to score even after extra time had been played , therefore the match was decided in a replay four days later . Beckham opened the scoring for United with a long range effort , but Dennis Bergkamp drew Arsenal level with a shot that deflected off United 's centre back Jaap Stam . Arsenal then thought they had taken the lead when Nicolas Anelka put the ball in the back of United 's net , but the goal was ruled out for offside . United 's captain Roy Keane was red @-@ carded for two bookable offences and United played the last thirty minutes of normal time with ten men . In injury time at the end of the second half , Phil Neville fouled Ray Parlour in the penalty area . Peter Schmeichel parried away Bergkamp 's resultant spot kick and the game went into extra time . 
 Giggs scored partway through the second half of extra time . Picking up possession on the halfway line after a loose pass from Patrick Vieira , he dribbled past the entire Arsenal back line before shooting just under goalkeeper David Seaman 's bar . Giggs ran celebrating towards the United fans , and United held on to beat the Gunners 2 – 1 . The goal was the last ever scored in a FA Cup semi @-@ final replay , as they were abolished the following season . 
 United met Newcastle United in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium , the penultimate FA Cup final to be held there before it was closed for rebuilding . Less than 10 minutes into the match , Keane was injured and replaced by Sheringham . He and Scholes both finished with a goal apiece in the 2 – 0 win that sealed the double .

 As in the previous four seasons United rested many of their first @-@ team players in the League Cup , instead using the competition to provide first team experience to their younger players and reserves . In the third round of the competition United required extra @-@ time to defeat Bury , eventually winning 2 – 0 with goals from Erik Nevland and Ole Gunnar Solskjær . In the fourth round , two more goals from Solskjær gave United a 2 – 1 victory over Nottingham Forest , earning them a place in the quarter @-@ finals for the first time since they reached the final in 1994 . United were beaten in the quarter @-@ finals by eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur ; two goals from Chris Armstrong and one from David Ginola gave Spurs a 3 – 1 victory , with ex @-@ Spurs striker Teddy Sheringham scoring the consolation for United on his return to White Hart Lane .

 Manchester United began their UEFA Champions League campaign against Polish champions ŁKS Łódź in the qualifying round . Goals from Giggs and Cole in the home leg gave them a 2 – 0 win , and a goalless second leg ensured their qualification for the group stage .

 United were drawn in Group D , quickly labelled the competition 's " group of death " , along with Spanish club Barcelona , German champions Bayern Munich and Danish side Brøndby . 
 Both games against Barcelona ended in draws . Despite Giggs , Scholes and Beckham putting the team into a 3 — 2 lead at Old Trafford , the visitors were awarded a late penalty after Butt was sent off for handling the ball . Luis Enrique converted the ball into the net to leave both teams with a point on Matchday One . In the return game on 25 November at the Camp Nou , a fixture that Barça needed to win to avoid elimination , Dwight Yorke 's goals put United ahead 3 – 2 , but Barça star Rivaldo equalized and nearly scored again but his effort hit the crossbar . 
 United were denied victory by Bayern Munich twice , home and away . In Munich , the home side equalised with two minutes to go with United leading 2 – 1 , after Schmeichel uncharacteristically went for and missed Bixente Lizarazu 's throw @-@ in , allowing Giovane Élber to tap in from a few yards out and score his second of the match . The return leg ended in a stalemate ; Roy Keane scored just before half @-@ time via a low header before Hasan Salihamidžić equalised for the visitors . 
 United inflicted two heavy defeats on Brøndby , beating them 6 – 2 in Copenhagen and 5 – 0 at Old Trafford . 
 Results in the other groups meant that a second @-@ place finish was enough for United to progress into the quarter @-@ finals , joining group leaders Bayern Munich .

 In the knockout stage United played two Italian sides in the quarter and semi @-@ finals , Internazionale and Juventus respectively ; United had never won on an Italian pitch . 
 In the quarter @-@ finals , Beckham faced Diego Simeone for the first time since the 1998 World Cup . In the first leg at Old Trafford , United beat Inter 2 – 0 with two almost identical goals from Yorke , both from crosses by Beckham ; Simeone 's second @-@ half goal was disallowed for pushing . In the San Siro , Scholes scored a late away goal to level the game at 1 – 1 as United advanced 3 – 1 on aggregate . 
 In the semi @-@ finals , Juve 's captain Antonio Conte met Edgar Davids ' pass to give Juventus an away goal . United equalised in injury @-@ time through Giggs , who converted a Beckham cross : a Teddy Sheringham goal a few minutes earlier had been disallowed . A draw meant that United either needed to win in Italy , or get a score @-@ draw of 2 – 2 or greater . 
 At the Stadio delle Alpi , Filippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes to give Juve a 3 – 1 aggregate lead . However , team captain Roy Keane , who was shown a yellow card preventing him from playing the final , headed in a Beckham cross . Dwight Yorke added a second to level the match just before the break . In the second half , Cole put United ahead for the first time in the match and the tie . Yorke was brought down by the Juve keeper in the area as he went round him , but the referee played the advantage and Cole tapped in from an acute angle . United held on for their first victory in Italy and booked their place in the Camp Nou for the final , against group opponents Bayern Munich .

 United were without first @-@ choice central midfielders Keane and Scholes , as both were suspended after receiving a second yellow card in the competition . Ferguson reorganised the team , with Blomqvist and Butt replacing Keane and Scholes , Beckham moving from right @-@ wing to centre @-@ midfield and Giggs moving from the left to the right wing . United lined up in their normal 4 – 4 – 2 formation . This was the final match for Peter Schmeichel , who captained the team . 
 Mario Basler 's free kick after six minutes opened the scoring for Bayern Munich . Bayern then had the chance to extend their lead with Mehmet Scholl hitting the post and Carsten Jancker the crossbar , forcing Peter Schmeichel to make numerous saves . In reaction to going a goal down , Ferguson substituted in Solskjær and Sheringham . As the game went to injury time , referee Pierluigi Collina indicated that three minutes would be played . In almost the last attack of the game , United won a corner , which Beckham took and goalkeeper Schmeichel went up front for . The ball was partially cleared by the Bayern defence before being played back to Giggs , who sent a low volley into the path of Sheringham , whose scuffed shot squeezed low inside the post . 
 Almost immediately after the equaliser United won another corner , again taken by Beckham . He landed the ball on the head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe @-@ poked it into the roof of the net . Oliver Kahn , the Bayern goalkeeper , was motionless on the line . United had completed the come @-@ back . Bayern barely had time to restart the game , which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later . 
 During the celebrations United 's captain Peter Schmeichel and manager Alex Ferguson lifted the trophy together to the crowd . Despite their suspensions , both Keane and Scholes received winners ' medals on the rostrum . Keane claims that to date he has not looked at the medal , feeling that his absence had tainted the accomplishment to the extent that he " didn 't deserve the medal " . Substituted Bayern legend Lothar Matthäus removed his runner @-@ up medal as soon as he received it , and later remarked that United were " lucky " to win the final . 
 Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup ( first in its Champions League format ) , since Liverpool took the title in 1984 defeating Roma on penalties . The club also fittingly won on the date of Sir Matt Busby 's 90th birthday . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Almost 24 hours after the dramatics in Barcelona , a crowd of 500 @,@ 000 people turned up on the streets of Manchester to greet the United players , who paraded through the city in an open @-@ top bus . As champions of Europe , Manchester United were invited to play in the Intercontinental Cup against Brazilian side Palmeiras in Tokyo . Roy Keane scored the winner , ensuring the team became the first and last British side to win the trophy , which was abolished in 2004 . 
 To help England with its World Cup host bid , United controversially withdrew from the 1999 – 2000 FA Cup , the first time the holders had done so in order to play in the inaugural Club World Championship . They did not progress past the group stages , and Ferguson has since admitted his regrets in how they handled the situation . 
 Along with the Busby Babes , the 1999 treble @-@ winning team is regarded by supporters as the benchmark of Manchester United teams . In 2007 The Daily Telegraph in association with World Soccer Magazine published a list of the twenty greatest football teams of all time : United were ranked in last position , behind Liverpool 's double winners of 1977 . Two years later , the Daily Mail compiled their list of the Greatest Teams Of All Time , ranking Ferguson 's achievements at number two , losing out to the 1970 Brazilian national team . The extra @-@ time winner scored by Ryan Giggs in the FA Cup semi @-@ final against Arsenal topped a poll for the best goal in the competition and Channel 4 viewers rated the team 's comeback in the Champions League final at number four on the list of 100 Greatest Sporting Moments . 
 = = Attempted takeover by BSkyB = = 
 In September 1998 Manchester United were the target of a proposed takeover by British Sky Broadcasting , a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation . Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer , but had stalled after disagreements over the asking price . The satellite group ’ s original bid of £ 575 million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed too low by two members of United ’ s board ( chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith ) , who pressed for a higher figure . Two days of talks followed and in an attempt to close the deal , BSkyB made a final bid of £ 623 @.@ 4 million . 
 A year earlier , Murdoch 's Fox Entertainment Group purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers for $ <unk> . Fox also held exclusive rights to Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view , Murdoch ’ s acquisition looked more appealing . He was now able to control both programming content on his network and distribution rights to the Dodgers . For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox ’ s formula and went ahead with a takeover of a Premier League club . Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members . The club was the most valuable in English football , making £ 30 @.@ 1 million from gate receipts and programmes in 1997 alone . At the same time , more than 200 supporters ’ groups were established worldwide and the club 's fanbase exceeded 100 million , despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play . As a means of capitalising on this growing market , MUTV , a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998 . In co @-@ operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world ’ s first channel dedicated to a football club , funded entirely through subscriptions . On the pitch United 's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson , who assembled a team capable of dominating in the long haul . 
 = = = Formation of Shareholders United = = = 
 When BSkyB publicised their intentions to take over Manchester United , supporters reacted furiously to the news . The majority felt the club ’ s traditions , built on a loyal fan base and great teams including the Busby Babes and currently Fergie 's Fledglings would just be tarnished forever . United were no longer an independent entity , and major decisions affecting the club looked increasingly likely to be taken on the other side of the globe . 
 As a means of rallying supporters to get behind their cause , awareness campaigns against the takeover were launched . Red Issue issued pamphlets to fans and demonstrations in and around Old Trafford took place before the match against Charlton Athletic on 9 September . Football fans across the United Kingdom also lent support by lobbying their local MPs into passing a legislation , preventing further sport takeovers in the future . 
 Perhaps the significance of the protests was the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch , more commonly known as Manchester United Supporters ' Trust today , by journalist Michael Crick . Working alongside IMUSA ( Independent Manchester United Supporters Association ) , their joint aim was to seek a reference of the merger by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission . Both groups therefore submitted papers to the Office of Fair Trading , stressing the importance of why the merger shouldn ’ t be carried out . IMUSA in particular argued that BSkyB ’ s main intention was not that of United ’ s but their already dominant position . Sky Television ’ s relevant market was premium subscription channels and by buying an established Premier League team when they already had rights to the division was purely for financial gain . Moreover , Manchester United ’ s market was on the pitch and an acquisition by a media organisation – particularly one run by Murdoch – may create detrimental damage to the sport in the long term . 
 Bowing down to public pressure , the trade secretary Peter Mandelson referred the deal to the Mergers Commission in October 1998 . The report , finalised in April 1999 , found that BSkyB acted selfishly and blocked the broadcaster 's bid .

 Manchester United 's first departure of the 1998 – 99 season was Ben Thornley , who joined Huddersfield Town for £ 175 @,@ 000 on 3 July 1998 . A day later , Leon Mills signed for Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee , and Adam Sadler was released . Two of the club 's longest @-@ serving players , Brian McClair and Gary Pallister , also left . McClair had been at United since 1987 , and opted for a return to Motherwell in the Scottish Premier League ; he had played at Fir Park in the early 1980s . Pallister agreed to return to Middlesbrough in a £ 2 @.@ 5 million deal , nine years after he had left them for a £ 2 @.@ 3 million transfer to Old Trafford . On 4 November 1998 , Chris Casper signed for Reading for a fee of £ 300 @,@ 000 . 
 Addressing the loss of Pallister , Ferguson signed Jaap Stam from PSV Eindhoven , becoming the world 's most expensive defender in a £ 10 million deal . Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist soon followed , completing a £ 4 @.@ 4 million transfer in July before Dwight Yorke was controversially drafted in from Aston Villa to become the club 's record signing . Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert , who impressed during the World Cup , was on the verge of finalising a £ 9 million move from Milan , only for talks to fall through . A £ 5 @.@ 5 million offer for Ole Gunnar Solskjær from Tottenham Hotspur was accepted , but Solskjær himself turned down the transfer after a meeting with Alex Ferguson . 
 On 24 March , Michael Ryan signed for Wrexham for an undisclosed fee . A day later , Paul Gibson signed for Notts County , and on the same day , Philip <unk> signed for Norwich City .

 William " Billy " Windsor I is a cashmere goat who served as a lance corporal in the 1st Battalion , the Royal Welsh , an infantry battalion of the British Army . He served as a lance corporal from 2001 until 2009 , except for a three @-@ month period in 2006 when he was demoted to fusilier , after inappropriate behaviour during the Queen 's Official Birthday celebrations while deployed on active duty with the battalion on Cyprus . He retired to Whipsnade Zoo in May 2009 . 
 His young replacement is known as William Windsor II . 
 = = History = = 
 The tradition of having goats in the military originated in 1775 , when a wild goat walked onto the battlefield in Boston during the American Revolutionary War and led the Welsh regimental colours at the end of the Battle of Bunker Hill . Another Welsh military goat , Taffy IV , served in the First World War . Taffy , of 2nd Battalion , Welsh Regiment , is officially recorded as " The Regimental Goat " . He embarked for the war on 13 August 1914 and saw action in the Retreat from Mons , the First Battle of Ypres ( including the Battle of Gheluvelt ) and the Battles of Festubert and Givenchy , before dying on 20 January 1915 . He was posthumously awarded the 1914 Star , British War Medal and the Victory Medal . 
 The royal goat herd was originally obtained from Mohammad Shah Qajar , Shah of Persia from 1834 to 1848 , when he presented them to Queen Victoria as a gift in 1837 upon her accession to the throne . 
 The herd thrived on Llandudno 's Great Orme ; by 2001 they reached a population of 250 , and were in danger of running out of food . Following complaints about goats wandering into people 's gardens , the council rejected proposals for a cull , deciding to use a combination of <unk> and birth control . RSPCA marksmen tranquilised nannies and inserted contraceptive progesterone implants to control the numbers of the genetically unique breed . By 2007 , 85 goats had been relocated to areas including Kent , Yorkshire , the Brecon Beacons and Somerset , but further efforts were interrupted by an outbreak of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease . 
 = = William Windsor I = = 
 Billy , a Kashmir goat , is descended from the same royal bloodline as the original herd , but was not selected from the wild population ; he was born in Whipsnade Zoo . He was presented to the regiment by Queen Elizabeth II in 2001 . The tradition is not new : since 1844 , the British monarchy has presented an unbroken series of Kashmir goats to the Royal Welch Fusiliers from the Crown 's own royal herd . 
 Billy — Army number <unk> — is " not a mascot , but a ranking member of the regiment " , according to the BBC . Since joining in 2001 , he has performed duties overseas , and has paraded before royalty . His primary duty was to march at the head of the battalion on all ceremonial duties . He was present for every parade in which the regiment participated . Billy 's full @-@ time handler was Lance Corporal Ryan Arthur , who carried the title of " Goat Major " . 
 = = = Temporary demotion = = = 
 On 16 June 2006 , a parade was held to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II 's 80th birthday , at the <unk> base near Limassol , Cyprus on the Mediterranean island 's south coast . Invited dignitaries included the ambassadors of Spain , the Netherlands and Sweden and the Argentine commander of United Nations ' forces on Cyprus . 
 The deployment to Cyprus with the 1st Battalion was Billy 's first overseas posting , and despite being ordered to keep in line , he refused to obey . He failed to keep in step , and tried to headbutt a drummer . The goat major , Lance Corporal Dai Davies , 22 , from Neath , South Wales , was unable to keep him under control . 
 Billy was charged with " unacceptable behaviour " , " lack of decorum " and " disobeying a direct order " , and had to appear before his commanding officer , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Huw James . Following a disciplinary hearing , he was demoted to fusilier . The change meant that other fusiliers in the regiment no longer had to stand to attention when Billy walked past , as they had to when he was a lance corporal . 
 A Canadian animal rights group protested to the British Army , stating that he was merely " acting the goat " , and should be reinstated . Three months later , on 20 September at the same parade ground , Billy regained his rank during the Alma Day parade which celebrates the Royal Welsh victory in the Crimean War . Captain Simon Clarke said , " Billy performed exceptionally well , he has had all summer to reflect on his behaviour at the Queen 's birthday and clearly earned the rank he deserves " . 
 Billy received his promotion from the colonel of the Royal Welsh Regiment , Brigadier Roderick Porter . As a result of regaining his rank , he also regained his membership of the corporals ' mess . 
 Billy is not the first goat in the army to have troubles . At one time a royal goat was " prostituted " by being offered for stud services by the regiment 's serving goat major to a Wrexham goat breeder . First charged with lèse majesté , the goat major was ultimately court @-@ martialled under the lesser charge of " disrespect to an officer " and reduced in rank . The goat major claimed he did it out of compassion for the goat , but this failed to impress the court . Another royal fusilier goat earned the nickname " the rebel " , after he butted a colonel while he was stooped over fixing his uniform 's trouser @-@ strap . The incident was described as a " disgraceful act of insubordination . " 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 On 20 May 2009 , following 8 years of distinguished service , Billy retired due to his age . Soldiers from the battalion lined the route from his pen to the trailer as he left the camp for the last time , in ceremonial dress that included a silver headdress which was a gift from the queen in 1955 . Billy was taken to Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire where keepers say he had an easy life at the Children 's Farm . 
 = = William Windsor II = = 
 In order to replace Billy , thirty members of 1st Battalion set off to Great Orme in Llandudno on 15 June 2009 at 03 : 00 , hoping to catch the feral goats in a docile state . A team led by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Nick Lock ( Commanding Officer ) included the goat major and several veterinarians . Army spokesman Gavin O ’ Connor said , " We are looking for a goat which is calm under pressure and a team player " . During the selection of a replacement goat , the battalion helped to start an alternative vaccine method of birth control among the herd , since hormone implants that were previously employed to control numbers are no longer available . 
 With some difficulty , a five @-@ month @-@ old was chosen , and assigned army number <unk> — which represents regiment number <unk> , 23rd Regiment of Foot ( the original name of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers ) , and 01 denoting the 1st Battalion . The new goat will also be called William Windsor , beginning as a fusilier while being trained for military life . He will receive a ration of two cigarettes per day , which he eats , but will not be permitted Guinness until he is older . 
 = Streptococcus iniae = 
 Streptococcus iniae is a species of Gram @-@ positive , sphere @-@ shaped bacterium belonging to the genus Streptococcus . Since its isolation from an Amazon freshwater dolphin in the 1970s , S. iniae has emerged as a leading fish pathogen in aquaculture operations worldwide , resulting in over US $ 100M in annual losses . Since its discovery , S. iniae infections have been reported in at least 27 species of cultured or wild fish from around the world . Freshwater and saltwater fish including tilapia , red drum , hybrid striped bass , and rainbow trout are among those susceptible to infection by S. iniae . Infections in fish manifest as meningoencephalitis , skin lesions , and septicemia . 
 S. iniae has occasionally produced infection in humans , especially fish handlers of Asian descent . Human infections include sepsis , toxic shock syndrome , and inflammation of the skin , intervertebral discs , or inner layer of the heart . Identifying S. iniae in the laboratory can be difficult , since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results . It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species . The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity . Several antibiotics have been used to treat S. iniae infections . 
 = = History = = 
 Streptococcus iniae was first isolated in 1972 , from subcutaneous abscesses in a captive specimen of Amazon river dolphin ( Inia geoffrensis ) suffering from an infection known as " golf ball disease " . The bacterium was found to be sensitive to beta @-@ lactam antibiotics , and the dolphin was treated successfully with penicillin and <unk> . The causative organism was recognized to be a new species of Streptococcus , and was given the name Streptococcus iniae in 1976 . Around this time , other streptococcal outbreaks occurred in Asia , and the US ; some strains associated with the Japanese outbreaks were later suggested to be S. iniae . 
 In the 1980s , a purported new species of Streptococcus , named S. shiloi , was identified as one of the causes of an epidemic of meningoencephalitis ( an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes ) affecting farmed rainbow trout and tilapia in Israel since 1986 . Since S. shiloi was alpha @-@ hemolytic , had a G + C % content of 37 % and did not ferment sugar galactose , it was not classified as S. iniae , which is beta @-@ hemolytic , has a G + C % content of 32 % , and ferments galactose . In 1995 , S. shiloi was found in fact to be beta @-@ hemolytic , and after DNA @-@ DNA hybridization techniques with the ATCC type S. iniae and <unk> of the G + C % content , was reclassified by the same group as a junior synonym of S. iniae . 
 Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S ribosomal DNA suggest that S. iniae is closely related to other streptococcal pathogens of humans and animals . Specifically , it is clustered in the pyogenic group , along with other pathogenic streptococci such as S. pyogenes , S. agalactiae , S. uberis , S. canis , S. porcinus , S. <unk> , and S. intestinalis . Of these related species , it is most closely related to S. porcinus . Genomic restriction fragment analysis of diverse host and geographical panels of S. iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains , though multiple pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns have been identified among human isolates . 
 = = Identification = = 
 S. iniae may be easily misidentified ( or not identified at all ) by conventional automated microbiology systems . Molecular genetics methods , such as DNA sequencing and DNA @-@ DNA hybridization , can be useful for correct identification , although work by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested they are unnecessary in most cases . Several groups have used 16S rDNA sequencing to identify S. iniae isolates , and while it can differentiate this species from other related species , such as S. porcinus and S. uberis , 16S sequencing cannot be used to differentiate between strains of S. iniae . <unk> is a similar method , by which 16S and 23S rRNA genes are digested with restriction endonucleases and Southern blotted using species @-@ specific oligonucleotide probes . This method is more sensitive than 16S rDNA sequencing , as in addition to species differentiation , it can be used to differentiate between strains . <unk> was used in 1997 to differentiate between Israeli and American strains , thus ruling out the possibility of an epidemiological link between outbreaks in the two countries . 
 S. iniae is beta @-@ hemolytic when incubated in anaerobic conditions , although it may be misidentified as alpha @-@ hemolytic because , in some strains , zones of beta @-@ hemolysis ( complete destruction of red blood cells in the blood agar culture medium ) are surrounded by large zones of alpha @-@ hemolysis ( incomplete destruction of red blood cells with a greenish discoloration due to breakdown of hemoglobin ) . The bacterium is catalase @-@ negative and <unk> @-@ positive ( like all streptococci ) , <unk> @-@ test and CAMP @-@ test @-@ positive , does not hydrolyze sodium <unk> , and does not grow in bile <unk> agar . It does not express any of the known Lancefield antigens . 
 = = = Serotypes = = = 
 Two serotypes of S. iniae are established . The ATCC <unk> type strain first characterized in 1976 by Pier and <unk> is representative of serotype I isolates . <unk> II was first identified as the type strain ( ATCC <unk> ) isolated from another dolphin case of " golf ball disease " . A biochemical assay measuring arginine <unk> activity has been used to distinguish between serotypes ( serotype I is positive ) , though proposed <unk> of serotype II may represent the most significant functional difference between the two types . 
 = = Role in disease = = 
 = = = In fish = = = 
 S. iniae is highly pathogenic in freshwater , marine , and euryhaline fish , and is highly lethal : outbreaks may be associated with 30 – 50 % mortality . It is , therefore , one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture . In 1997 , the global economic impact of S. iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US $ 100 million ( one @-@ tenth of which in the United States ) . As of 2007 , infection had been reported in 27 species of fish , including tilapia ( genus Oreochromis and Tilapia ) , rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) , coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) , Japanese amberjack ( Seriola <unk> ) , red drum ( <unk> ocellatus ) , and barramundi ( Lates <unk> , which can be an asymptomatic carrier ) . Common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) , channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) , and goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) appear to be resistant . Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors ( i.e. suboptimal temperature , poor water quality , crowding , handling , etc . ) are most prone to S. iniae infection . Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S. iniae infection . 
 The site of S. iniae infection and its clinical presentation vary from species to species . In tilapia , S. iniae causes meningoencephalitis , with symptoms including lethargy , dorsal rigidity , and erratic swimming behavior ; death follows in a matter of days . In rainbow trout , it is typically associated with septicemia and central nervous system damage . Symptoms are consistent with septicemia , and include lethargy and loss of orientation ( as in tilapia ) , <unk> , corneal opacity , and external and internal bleeding . 
 = = = In humans = = = 
 S. iniae can cause opportunistic infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans . It is most commonly associated with <unk> cellulitis , but has been known to cause endocarditis , meningitis , osteomyelitis , and septic arthritis . The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994 , but the sources of infection were not determined . Human infection with S. iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995 , when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish . All three were found to have bacteremia , initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis , but later correctly identified as S. iniae . In February 1996 , a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia , and was also diagnosed with S. iniae bacteremia . A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area , for a total of nine patients ; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish ( mostly tilapia ) before developing infection . Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada , and have since been reported in Asia ( Hong Kong , Taiwan , and Singapore ) . Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases , but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection . 
 = = = Control and treatment = = = 
 Several measures can be taken to control infection in aquaculture once an S. iniae outbreak has been confirmed . Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce mortality rates , as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding . Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population . Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth . 
 A 2005 study showed the potential for using probiotics for controlling S. iniae infection in trout . This study used the gastrointestinal contents of rainbow trout to scan for bacteria that inhibited growth of S. iniae and <unk> garvieae . They identified Aeromonas <unk> as a potential candidate for control of S. iniae and L. garvieae infections in aquaculture . A. <unk> , given live in the feed , protected the trout when challenged with S. iniae or L. garvieae . 
 Several antibiotics have been used successfully to treat S. iniae infection in fish . <unk> , a <unk> antibiotic , has been used to great effect in hybrid striped bass ( Morone chrysops × M. <unk> ) , although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain . Amoxicillin , erythromycin , <unk> , and <unk> have also been used ( the last with varying success , only in barramundi ) . Vaccination against S. iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months ' immunity . 
 Penicillin has been suggested as the drug of choice for the treatment of S. iniae infection in mammals , including humans . In the 1995 – 1996 cluster of human cases , all clinical isolates were susceptible to penicillin , several cephalosporins , clindamycin , erythromycin , and co @-@ <unk> ( <unk> 0 @.@ 25 µg / ml ) ; all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta @-@ lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully . A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta @-@ lactams , macrolides , quinolones , and vancomycin . 
 = Drax power station = 
 Drax is a large coal @-@ fired power station in North Yorkshire , England , capable of co @-@ firing biomass and petcoke , and its name comes from the nearby village of Drax . It is situated on the River Ouse between Selby and Goole . Its generating capacity of 3 @,@ 960 megawatts is the highest of any power station in the United Kingdom ( and second @-@ highest in Western Europe , after 4 @,@ 400 MW Neurath Power Station in Germany ) , providing about 7 % of the United Kingdom 's electricity supply . 
 Opened in 1974 and extended in the mid @-@ 1980s , the station was initially operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board . Since privatisation in 1990 ownership has changed several times , and it is operated by Drax Group plc . Completed in 1986 , it is the newest coal @-@ fired power station in England , flue gas desulphurisation equipment was fitted between 1988 and 1995 ; high and low pressure turbines were replaced between 2007 and 2012 . Because of its large size , the station is the UK 's single largest emitter of carbon dioxide . 
 The station was c . 2010 co @-@ firing biomass ; in 2012 the company announced plans to convert up to three generating units to solely biomass , burning 7 @.@ 5 million tonnes imported from the United States and Canada . 
 = = History = = 
 After the Selby Coalfield was discovered in 1967 the Central Electricity Generating Board built three large power stations to use its coal . These were an expansion of the station at Ferrybridge , a new station at <unk> , and the station at Drax was constructed on the site of Wood House . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The station was constructed in three similar phases , each of three generating units . The first phase began in 1973 . Costain constructed the foundations and cable tunnels ; Sir Robert McAlpine laid the roads and built the ancillary buildings ; Mowlem laid the deep foundations ; Alfred McAlpine built the administration and control buildings ; Balfour Beatty undertook general building works ; and James Scott installed cabling . Although the first phase was not completed until 1975 , the station 's first generating set began generating electricity in 1974 . 
 The second phase began in 1985 . Tarmac Construction undertook the civil engineering works ; Holst Civil Engineers built the chimney ; <unk> Bailey installed cabling ; Reyrolle , English Electric and South Wales <unk> produced and installed the switchgear ; English Electric manufactured the generator cooling water pumps ; T.W. Broadbent maintained the temporary electrical supplies ; and Sulzer Brothers manufactured the boiler feed pumps . The second phase was completed in 1986 . In both stages the boilers were made by Babcock Power Ltd and the generators by C. A. Parsons and Company . Mitsui Babcock fitted flue @-@ gas desulphurisation ( FGD ) equipment between 1988 and 1995 . 
 = = = Post @-@ privatisation = = = 
 On privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1990 , the station was transferred from the Central Electricity Generating Board to the privatised generating company National Power , which sold it to the AES Corporation in November 1999 for £ 1 @.@ 87 billion ( US $ 3 billion ) . AES relinquished ownership in August 2003 , after falling into £ 1 @.@ 3 billion of debt . Independent directors continued the operation to ensure security of supply . In December 2005 , after refinancing , ownership passed to the Drax Group . 
 Separate acquisition offers from International Power , private equity group Texas Pacific , and a private equity backed bid from Constellation Energy were rejected for undervaluing the company . The company 's valuation subsequently increased to 2005 as a result of rising electricity prices , and on 15 December 2005 Drax Group plc floated its shares on the London Stock Exchange , issuing £ 400 million worth of shares , on a valuation of £ 2 @.@ 3 billion . 
 In 2009 , Drax Group submitted a planning application for the 300 MW biomass Ouse Renewable Energy Plant next to the power station . Government approval was obtained in mid 2011 . In February 2012 the company ceased planning development of the plant , citing logistics costs , and uncertainty concerning government financial support for biomass .

 = = = = Carbon capture and storage = = = = 
 In 2006 Drax Power Limited , in response to a government consultation , stated they were sponsoring development studies into carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , but noted that it was not then commercially viable , with costs comparable with nuclear or offshore wind power . On 17 June 2009 , Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband announced plans to require all UK coal @-@ fired power stations should be fitted with CCS technology by the early 2020s or face closure . 
 In 2012 a CCS project at Drax was shortlisted for government funding . In 2013 the White Rose CCS project ( formerly the UK OXY CCS project ) was shortlisted for the UK government 's CCS scheme and in late 2013 was awarded a two @-@ year <unk> contract ( Front End Engineering Design ) for the CCS project . As of June 2014 , Drax is engaged in a joint venture with Alstom and BOC to build a 626 MW oxygen @-@ fuelled combustion power plant adjacent to the existing Drax site . National Grid would simultaneously construct a pipeline to transport CO2 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the Yorkshire coast for sequestration . 
 In July 2014 the project was awarded € 300 million funding from the European Commission . 
 In September 2015 Drax announced it would not be making any further investments into the CCS scheme after completion of the feasibility study because negative changes to government support for renewable energy had made the project too financially risky , plus drops in the company 's share price due to the same uncertainty had reduced Drax 's ability to raise funds . Front End Engineering Design was expected to continue under Alstom and BOC with the project still being hosted at Drax . In late 2015 the UK Government withdrew its potential financial support for CCS projects - up to £ <unk> of funding , reversing support promised in the governing party 's 2015 election manifesto . As a result , Leigh Hackett , CEO of Capture Power stated that " [ I ] t is difficult to imagine its continuation in the absence of crucial government support " . 
 = = Design and specification = = 
 The main buildings are of steel frame and metal clad construction . The main features are a turbine hall , a boiler house , a chimney and 12 cooling towers . The boiler house is 76 m ( 249 ft ) high , and the turbine hall is 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) long . The reinforced concrete chimney stands 259 metres ( 850 ft ) high , with a diameter of 9 @.@ 1 metres ( 30 ft ) , and weighs 44 @,@ 000 tonnes . It consists of three flues , each serving two of the six boilers . When finished , the chimney was the largest industrial chimney in the world , and is still the tallest in the United Kingdom . The twelve 114 metres ( 374 ft ) high natural draft cooling towers stand in two groups of six to the north and south of the station . They are made of reinforced concrete , in the typical hyperboloid design , and each have a base diameter of 92 m ( 302 ft ) . Other facilities include a coal storage area , flue gas desulphurisation plant and gypsum handling facilities . 
 The station is the second largest coal @-@ fired power station in Europe , after <unk> Power Station in Poland . It produces around 24 terawatt @-@ hours ( TWh ) ( 86 @.@ 4 petajoules ) of electricity annually . Although it generates around 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 tonnes of ash and 22 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year , it is the most carbon @-@ efficient coal @-@ fired power plant in the United Kingdom . 
 = = = Ouse jetty = = = 
 The power station also has a jetty on the River Ouse , with a loading capacity of 200 <unk> historically the jetty was built and used for the construction of the power station in the 1960s / 70s - such as the delivery of equipment . In 2015 a planning application was submitted for the improvement of the jetty 's load capacity to 500 tonnes by White Rose CCS developer Capture Power Limited ( Drax / Alstom / BOC joint venture ) , for the construction of the CCS project . 
 = = Fuel supply = = 
 The main transport route to the power station for fuel ( originally coal ) is train via a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) -long freight @-@ only section of the former Hull and Barnsley Railway , from the Pontefract Line at <unk> Junction . A balloon loop rail layout is used so that wagons of coal do not need to be shunted after being unloaded . Merry @-@ go @-@ round trains are used , so that wagons can be unloaded without the train stopping as it passes through an unloading house . On average , there are 35 deliveries a day , 6 days a week . 
 The power station also has a jetty ( see § Jetty ) - imports via the jetty ended <unk> - in 2004 the jetty was trialled for the import of Tall Oil by barge . 
 = = = Coal supply = = = 
 The station has a maximum potential consumption of 36 @,@ 000 tonnes of coal a day . In 2011 , it consumed 9 @.@ 1 million tonnes of coal . This coal comes from a mixture of both domestic and international sources , with domestic coal coming from mines in Yorkshire , the Midlands and Scotland , and foreign supplies coming from Australia , Colombia , Poland , Russia and South Africa . 
 When the station opened , the majority of the coal burned was from local collieries in Yorkshire , including Kellingley Colliery , Prince of Wales , <unk> Hall , <unk> Colliery , <unk> Colliery , <unk> Colliery and Bentley Colliery . Following the miners ' strike in the mid @-@ 1980s , by 2006 , all but Kellingley have closed . ( Kellingley closed at the end of 2015 . ) UK Coal had a five @-@ year contract to supply coal , which ended at the end of 2009 , from Kellingley , Maltby and , until its closure in 2007 , Rossington . Coal was also brought from Harworth Colliery until it was mothballed , and was supplied by Daw Mill in Warwickshire . 
 The foreign coal is brought via various ports by rail . In <unk> GB Railfreight won a contract to move coal brought from the Port of Tyne , celebrated by the company naming one of their locomotives Drax Power Station in 2007 . DB Schenker Rail ( UK ) haul coal from the nearby ports of Hull and Immingham , and from Hunterston Terminal on the west coast of Scotland . Freightliner Group move coal imported through Redcar . 
 In addition to burning coal , the station also co @-@ fires coal with biomass and petroleum coke ( ' petcoke ' ) . 
 = = = Biomass = = = 
 = = = = Co @-@ firing = = = = 
 The station tested co @-@ firing biomass in the summer of 2004 , and in doing so was the first power station in the UK to be fuelled by wood . The initial trial of 14 @,@ 100 tonnes of willow was locally sourced from nearby <unk> . Since the trial , the station 's use of biomass has continued . It uses direct injection for firing the biomass , whereby it bypasses the pulverising mills and is either injected directly into the boiler or the fuel line , for greater throughput . In 2009 a target was set for 12 @.@ 5 % of the station 's energy to be sourced from biomass , and the shift to biomass was intended to contribute to the aim of cutting CO2 emissions by 15 % . The station burns a large range of biomass , mostly wood pellets , sunflower pellets , olive , peanut shell husk and rape meal . The majority comes from overseas . A 100 @,@ 000 tonne pa capacity straw <unk> facility was constructed at Capitol Park , Goole in 2008 , opened 2009 . Construction of specialised biomass handling facilities began in 2009 at the Port of Tyne and at Drax . 
 = = = = Proposed new build biomass plants = = = = 
 In the 2000s Drax Group applied for planning permission to build a new 300 MW power station , fuelled entirely by biomass , to the north of the station ; the Ouse Renewable Energy Plant was expected to burn 1 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 tonnes of biomass each year , saving 1 @,@ 850 @,@ 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions , and expected to create 850 construction jobs and 150 permanent jobs created once opened , through direct and contract employment . Plans were submitted to the Department of Energy and Climate Change in July 2009 for review ; if permission was granted , construction was scheduled begin in late 2010 and to take up to three and a half years . Two other 300 MW biomass plants were planned by Drax at the ports of Hull and Immingham . 
 In 2012 Drax group abandoned plans for the discrete biomass plant development , due to changes in government subsidies for biomass energy production favouring plant conversion over new build plant . It switched to a project to convert half of the units at its existing plant to biomass firing . 
 = = = = Full firing with biomass = = = = 
 In September 2012 Drax Group announced the conversion to full firing with biomass of three of its six units . The first unit was scheduled to be online by June 2013 , the second unit in 2014 , and the third by 2017 ; initially a biomass supply had been secured for the first unit . The cost was estimated at £ 700 million ( $ 1 @.@ 13 billion ) , including modifications to fuel mills and boilers and the construction of storage structures and conveyors for the wood pellet fuel . Each unit will consume about 2 @.@ 3 million tonnes of biomass yearly , requiring an estimated annual total of 7 @.@ 5 million tonnes in 2017 . This is equivalent to two @-@ thirds of Europe 's entire energy biomass consumption in 2010 , and requires 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 ha ( 4 @,@ 600 sq mi ; 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of forest to supply on a continuous basis . North America was expected to be the source of the vast majority of the biomass , although some would be domestically sourced willow and elephant grass . 
 Drax Group 's decision was enabled by a new UK government policy , effective in April 2013 , to award 1 @.@ 0 tradable <unk> ( renewable obligation certificates ) per megawatt of power generation from coal power plants that are fully converted to burn biomass ; CEO Dorothy Thompson stated the company intended to become a predominately biomass @-@ fuelled energy producer . By April 2013 financing for the scheme include £ 190 million through sale of shares , £ 100 million from Prudential / M & G UK Companies Financing Fund , £ 50 million from the UK Green Investment Bank , and £ 75 million Friends Life ( underwritten by HM Treasury ) , as well as a £ 400 million credit facility . 
 As of 2013 there were plans to install 1 million tonne per year wood pellets <unk> plants at Morehouse Parish , Louisiana , and Gloster , Mississippi , which would be shipped by road and rail to the port of Baton Rouge , Louisiana then shipped in 50 @,@ 000 @-@ tonne cargo ships to UK . In the financial report for 2013 , Drax announced that an additional 2 million tons <unk> capacity was being considered , likely to be built in the US . 
 In 2013 the company signed an agreement with ABP to develop handling facilities at the Port of Hull , Immingham and Grimsby ; construction of automated facilities began in 2013 , creating capacities of 3 and 1 million tonnes per year at the ports of Immingham and Hull respectively , adding to the 1 @.@ 4 million tonne per year Port of Tyne biomass facility built in 2009 . In the same year a new design covered rail wagon with high volumetric capacity for transporting the low density biomass pellets was unveiled for use by Drax in the UK ; 200 wagons of the type were ordered . At Drax pellets would be stored in domes , and transferred by a pneumatic conveyor system before grinding to dust for use . 
 The Shepherd Building Group was contracted to construct the biomass handling and storage facilities at Drax , with RPS Group as the civil engineer . The design included automated rail to storage handling , screening and storage facilities consisting of four 50 by 63 m ( 164 by 207 ft ) high by wide storage domes with a capacity of 110 @,@ 000 m3 ( 3 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 cu ft ) . The concrete dome technology was supplied by E & D Company , PLLC ( trading as Engineering System <unk> , ES2 ) and Dome Technology LLC . 
 By July 2013 one firing unit had been converted , and was reported to be functioning correctly ; by 2013 the conversion of the second and third units was scheduled for 2014 and during or before 2016 respectively . The second unit was converted by May 2014 , initially co @-@ firing an 85 % biomass / coal mix due to limited biomass supply . 
 In April 2014 Drax was awarded a renewable contract for difference ( <unk> ) subsidy for biomass based power generation on another converted coal firing unit , but a third unit , which had been previously marked as eligible for <unk> funding was excluded ; Drax Group then legally challenged the decision , initially obtaining a ruling in its favour , which was overturned in the Court of Appeal . In July 2014 the High Court ruled in Drax 's favour . 
 Biomass conversion at Drax led to it requiring 82 % of UK biomass imports from the USA in 2014 ( 60 % overall of all US wood pellet export ) , a large factor in a 40 % yearly increase in biomass export from that country ; USA sourced imports represented 58 % of Drax 's biomass use in 2014 , with 22 % from Canada . 
 The Baton Rouge port facility was completed by April 2015 . In mid 2015 Drax reached an agreement with Peel Ports ) to construct a <unk> ton per year biomass importation facility at the Port of Liverpool , estimated cost £ 100 million . The rail connected facility was to include 100 @,@ 000 tonnes storage , and be constructed by Graham Construction . 
 In September 2015 Drax Group and <unk> began a legal action against the UK government due to claimed insufficient notice being given about the withdrawal of a climate related tax exemption ( see Climate Change Levy ) - Drax claimed the change would reduce its earnings by £ 30 million . The claim was rejected by the High Court in February 2016 . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The station started to trial the co @-@ firing of petcoke in one of its boilers in June 2005 , ending in June 2007 , burning 15 % petcoke and 85 % coal . <unk> was burned to make the electricity more competitive as the price of running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive . The Environment Agency ( EA ) granted permission for the trial in June 2004 , despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council . To meet their concerns , emissions were constantly monitored through the trial , and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions . The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment , and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn . The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax 's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment . The station can now burn up to 300 @,@ 000 tonnes of the fuel a year , and stock up to 6 @,@ 000 tonnes on site . 
 = = Electricity generation = = 
 Coal is fed into one of 30 coal bunkers , each with a capacity of 1 @,@ 000 tonnes . Each bunker feeds two of the 60 pulverisers , each of which can crush 36 tonnes of coal an hour . The station has six Babcock Power boilers , each weighing 4 @,@ 000 tonnes . The powdered coal from ten pulverisers is blasted into each boiler through burners , which are ignited by propane . In 2003 the original burners were replaced by low nitrogen oxide burners . Each of the six boilers feed steam to a steam turbine set , consisting of one high pressure ( HP ) turbine , one intermediate pressure ( IP ) turbine and three low pressure ( LP ) turbines . The HP turbines generate at 140 megawatts ( MW ) . Exhaust steam from them is fed back to the boiler and reheated , then fed to the 250 MW IP turbines and finally passes through the 90 MW LP turbines . This gives each generating set a generating capacity of 660 MW : with six generating sets , the station has a total capacity of 3 @,@ 960 MW . Each of the generating units is equipped with the Advanced Plant Management System ( APMS ) , a system developed by RWE npower and Thales , and implemented by <unk> . 
 The station also has six gas turbines providing backup for breakdowns , or shut downs in the National Grid . Their annual output is generally low , generating 75 MW and three of the units have been mothballed and are out of operation , but they could be refurbished . Emissions from these units are released through the station 's second , smaller chimney , to the south of the main stack . 
 Between 2007 and 2012 the high and low pressure turbines were replaced by Siemens in a £ 100 million programme . 
 = = = Cooling system = = = 
 Water is essential to a thermal power station , heated to create steam to turn the steam turbines . Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site . Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse . Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river , north of the station .

 All six units are served by an independent wet limestone @-@ gypsum flue gas desulphurisation ( FGD ) plant , which was installed between 1988 and 1996 . This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry , which removes at least 90 % of the sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) . This is equivalent to removing over 250 @,@ 000 tonnes of SO2 each year . The process requires 10 @,@ 000 tonnes of limestone a week , sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire . A byproduct of the process is gypsum , with 15 @,@ 000 tonnes produced each week . This goes to be used in the manufacture of plasterboard . The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum , and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore ( on the Settle @-@ Carlisle Line ) , East Leake ( on the former Great Central Main Line ) and occasionally to Robertsbridge ( on the Hastings Line ) . DB Schenker transport the gypsum . 
 = = = Ash use and disposal = = = 
 Pulverised fuel ash ( PFA ) and furnace bottom ash ( FBA ) are two byproducts from the burning of coal . Each year , the station produces about 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 tonnes of PFA and around 220 @,@ 000 tonnes of FBA : all FBA and 85 % of PFA is sold . Under the trade name Drax Ash Products , the ash is sold to the local building industry , where it is used in the manufacture of blocks , cement products , grouting and the laying of roads . The ash is also used in other parts of the country . Between 2005 and 2007 , PFA was used as an infill at four disused salt mines in Northwich in Cheshire . 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 tonnes was used in the project , which was to avoid a future risk of subsidence in the town . Ash was delivered by DB Schenker in ten trains a week , each carrying 1 @,@ 100 tonnes . Following a trial in January 2010 , PFA is also transported to Waterford in Ireland by boat . One ship a month will transport 1 @,@ 200 tonnes for the manufacture of construction materials . This will replace 480 lorry journeys annually and is deemed more environmentally friendly . 
 The unsold PFA is sent by conveyor belt to the Barlow ash mound , which is used for disposal and temporary stockpile . Three conveyors feed the mound , with a total capacity of 750 tonnes an hour . FGD gypsum is disposed of on the mound if it is not of a high enough grade to be sold . The mound has won a number of awards for its nature conservation work . 
 = = Environmental effects = = 
 The environmental effects of coal burning are well documented , the most significant of which is global warming caused by the release of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into the Earth 's atmosphere . Coal is considered to be " easily the most carbon @-@ intensive and polluting form of energy generation available " . In 2007 the station produced 22 @,@ 160 @,@ 000 tonnes of CO2 , making it the largest single source of CO2 in the UK . Between 2000 and 2007 , there has been a net increase in carbon dioxide CO2 of over 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 tonnes . The station also has the highest estimated emissions of nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) in the European Union . 
 In 2007 , in a move to try to lower CO2 emissions , Drax Group signed a £ 100 million contract with Siemens Power Generation to re @-@ blade the steam turbines over four years . This is the largest steam turbine modernisation ever undertaken in the UK , and will increase efficiency . Coupled with the co @-@ firing of biomass , this is part of a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 15 % by 2011 . 
 Drax 's annual report for 2013 reported that Drax 's annual emissions were at 20 @,@ 612 @,@ 000 tonnes of CO2 . This was a slight decrease from 2007 levels due to the burning of biomass . Drax still remains the UK 's largest single source of emissions . 
 Drax has opted in to the Large Combustion Plant Directive ( <unk> ) and thus is permitted to continue operating beyond 2015 . The use of flue gas desulfurisation ensures that the limits on sulphur dioxide emissions are not exceeded .

They then mounted a banner reading " Leave it in the ground " on the side of the wagon and tied the train to the bridge , preventing it moving . They then shovelled more than 20 tonnes of coal on to the railway line . The protest lasted the whole day , until several protesters were removed from the train by police that night .

 Katrina Kaif ( pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] , born Katrina <unk> ; 16 July 1983 ) is a British film actress and model . Primarily known for her work in Hindi films , Kaif has also appeared in Telugu and Malayalam films . In addition to being one of Bollywood 's highest @-@ paid actresses , she is considered one of India 's most attractive celebrities by the media . 
 Born in British Hong Kong , Kaif and her family lived in several countries before she moved to India . She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model . At a fashion show in London , filmmaker <unk> <unk> spotted Kaif and decided to cast her in Boom ( 2003 ) , a critical and commercial failure . While filming in India , Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career . However , filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi . After appearing in the Telugu film , Malliswari ( 2004 ) , Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya ? ( 2005 ) and <unk> London ( 2007 ) . She followed with a series of box @-@ office hits , but was criticised for her acting , repetitive roles and inclination to male @-@ dominated films . 
 Kaif 's performance in the 2009 terrorism drama New York was better received , earning her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination . After roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani ( 2009 ) , Raajneeti ( 2010 ) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara ( 2011 ) , she received her second Filmfare nomination for her performance in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan ( 2011 ) . Kaif featured in the thrillers Ek Tha Tiger ( 2012 ) and Dhoom 3 ( 2013 ) , both of which rank among the highest @-@ grossing Bollywood films of all time . Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics for her acting prowess , she has established herself as a commercially successful actress of Hindi cinema . 
 In addition to acting , Kaif is involved with her mother 's charity and participates in stage shows . She is guarded about her personal life , which is a subject of media scrutiny . Her background has also been a topic of discussion , with some sources accusing her of fabricating her history . 
 = = Early life and background = = 
 Katrina Kaif was born in Hong Kong with her mother 's surname <unk> ( also spelt Turcotte ) , on 16 July 1983 . According to the actress , her father ( Mohammed Kaif ) is a British businessman of Kashmiri Indian descent and her mother ( Suzanne , also spelt Susanna ) is an English lawyer and charity worker . She has seven siblings : three elder sisters ( Stephanie , Christine and Natasha ) , three younger sisters ( Melissa , Sonia , Isabel ) and an elder brother , Michael . Isabel Kaif is also a model and actress . Kaif 's parents divorced when she was a child , and her father moved to the United States . She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up , and they were raised by their mother . On her father 's absence in her life , Kaif stated : " When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families , I say , if only I had that . But instead of complaining , I should be grateful for all the other things I have " . In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express , she said she was not in touch with her father . 
 Kaif says that her mother decided to " dedicate her life to social causes " , which led to the family 's relocation to a number of countries for varying lengths of time : 
 Our transitions in growing up were — from Hong Kong where I was born , to China , then to Japan , and from Japan by boat to France ... After France , Switzerland — and I 'm cutting out many East European countries where we were for only a few months each — then Poland in Kraków ... After that we went to Belgium , then to Hawaii , which was a short time , and then came to London . 
 Due to their frequent relocation , Kaif and her siblings were home @-@ schooled by a series of tutors . Although she is thought to have grown up in London , she lived there for only three years before moving to India . According to Kaif , she then changed her surname to her father 's because she thought it would be easier to pronounce . 
 Kaif 's paternal parentage has been questioned by some members of the film industry . In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror , Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history : " We created an identity for her . She was this pretty young English girl , and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi . We thought we 'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry , to connect with the audience ... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too ... religious ? ... Mohammad Kaif was at the top , and so we said , Katrina Kaif sounds really great " . Kaif called Shroff 's comments " hurtful " .

 At the age of fourteen , Kaif won a beauty contest in Hawaii , and received her first modelling assignment in a jewellery campaign . She subsequently modelled professionally in London , working for freelance agencies and appearing regularly at London Fashion Week . At a fashion show Kaif attracted the attention of London @-@ based filmmaker <unk> <unk> . He selected her for a role in the English @-@ Hindi erotic heist film Boom as part of an ensemble cast that included Amitabh Bachchan , Gulshan Grover , Jackie Shroff , Madhu <unk> and Padma Lakshmi . While filming in India , Kaif received other offers and decided to stay in the country . In 2003 , she received notice as a model after walking the ramp for Rohit Bal at the India Fashion Week and appeared in the first Kingfisher Calendar . Kaif soon established a successful modelling career in India after endorsing brands such as Coca @-@ Cola , LG , <unk> and Samsung . 
 Kaif 's career as a model led to anticipation surrounding her Bollywood debut . Boom ( 2003 ) had its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival , and was heavily promoted at the event . Boom was a commercial and critical failure . Kaif 's enactment of a supermodel ensnared in the Mumbai underworld was poorly received , with Ziya U. Salam of The Hindu attributing the weak performances of the film 's leading ladies to " the vacuity of their expressions " . Hindustan Times reported that after Boom 's release , Kaif was written off due to her poor Hindi and thick British accent . She later dismissed the film : " I don 't count Boom among important happenings in my life . When I signed this film , I didn 't know much about India and its film audience " . Although Kaif was offered a number of modelling assignments , filmmakers were hesitant to cast her because of her poor command of Hindi . In one instance , Mahesh Bhatt replaced her with Tara Sharma in Saaya ( 2003 ) as he found her an " inconsistent performer " . Subsequently , Kaif began working on her diction through Hindi classes . 
 = = = Early film work ( 2004 – 06 ) = = = 
 After the failure of her first Bollywood project , Kaif appeared in the Telugu film Malliswari ( 2004 ) . With Daggubati Venkatesh , she played the title role of a princess forced to flee from her murderous caretaker . Kaif received a reported ₹ 7 @.@ 5 million ( US $ 110 @,@ 000 ) for the film , the highest salary for a South Indian film actress at the time . Despite negative reviews for her acting , Malliswari was a profitable venture . 
 The following year , Kaif appeared briefly as Abhishek Bachchan 's girlfriend in Ram Gopal Varma 's political thriller Sarkar . She next featured alongside Salman Khan , Sushmita Sen and Sohail Khan in Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya ? , a film she considered her " first real step into Bollywood " . Directed by David Dhawan , the film was a successful remake of the romantic comedy Cactus Flower . For her role as a suicidal model , Kaif received the Stardust Award for Breakthrough Performance – Female . According to Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com , " Katrina 's Disney princess @-@ like charm adds to her adorable screen presence " . Kaif followed with a small part in her second Telugu film , Allari <unk> . 
 In 2006 , she appeared with Akshay Kumar for the first of many films in Raj Kanwar 's unsuccessful <unk> Deewana Kar Gaye , a story of two like @-@ minded strangers who fall in love despite being engaged to others . Sify wrote that Kaif was " passably competent in a tailor @-@ made role , giving a mild emotional spin to a couple of scenes " but was overshadowed by her supporting actresses . Kaif also appeared with Mammootty in the Malayalam crime thriller <unk> vs. <unk> , in which Rishi Raj Singh of The Hindu called her performance " marvellous " .

 Kaif 's career prospects changed in 2007 , when she appeared in four Bollywood hits . In an interview with The Indian Express , she called Vipul Amrutlal Shah 's romantic comedy <unk> London a milestone , saying that " for the first time , [ she ] had a dominating role " . Kaif used her life in London as a reference for her role as a spoilt British Indian girl intent on marrying her self @-@ centred British boyfriend , despite her parents ' disapproval . Although critics expressed mixed views on the film , Sukanya Verma wrote that Kaif " suits the role to the T " and " brings the zingy mix of her character alive with style and substance " . Kaif 's chemistry with co @-@ star Akshay Kumar was particularly well received , with Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India calling their casting " refreshing " . 
 She had a supporting role as a doctor in the sports drama Apne . The film was highly anticipated as it marked the first appearance of Dharmendra with his sons , Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol . After Apne she rejoined director David Dhawan and Salman Khan for the comedy Partner , a remake of Hitch which also starred Govinda and Lara Dutta . With a worldwide revenue of ₹ 1 @.@ 03 billion ( US $ 15 million ) , the film was a major financial success . Kaif 's final film of the year was Anees Bazmee 's comedy Welcome , alongside Akshay Kumar , Nana Patekar , Mallika Sherawat and Anil Kapoor . Although the film generated mostly negative reviews , it proved to be the second highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of 2007 . The similarity of Kaif 's roles was noted by <unk> Chaudhury of Tehelka , who called her " unabashed eye @-@ candy " , adding that she was " a pretty prop in Welcome " and " more of the same in Partner and Apne " . 
 In 2008 , the actress had three releases , the first of which was Abbas @-@ Mustan 's action thriller Race , a story about two stepbrothers @-@ turned @-@ rivals who are in contention for their father 's insurance money . Kaif played Saif Ali Khan 's secretary , who is his stepbrother 's ( Akshaye Khanna ) lover . Nikhat Kazmi was appreciative of the film , praising its " super cool look [ and ] testosterone @-@ high action sequences " but found Kaif " too pale " in her role . After Race , Kaif rejoined Akshay Kumar in Anees Bazmee 's action comedy Singh Is <unk> . The film earned ₹ 1 @.@ 25 billion ( US $ 19 million ) worldwide , making it Kaif 's sixth consecutive box @-@ office success . However , she received mixed reviews for her performance . Rajeev Masand of CNN @-@ IBN reviewed : " Katrina Kaif is an eyesore ... her acting so weak you want to urge her to watch everyone from Madhubala to Madhuri so she might pick up a few tricks " . 
 Kaif 's final film of the year — Subhash Ghai 's drama Yuvvraaj — was a major box @-@ office failure . In preparation for her role as a cellist she practised her playing with orchestra members . Her portrayal of a girl forbidden by her father from marrying her poor lover was well received by Sify 's Sonia Chopra : " Katrina is wonderful , plays the cello convincingly , and looks ethereal " . Despite the film 's mixed critical reception , its screenplay was added to the library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its artistic merit . 
 Before New York , Kaif 's voice was dubbed over by voice artists in most of her films due to her lack of fluency in Hindi and other Indian languages . Although she appeared in a series of successful films , critics noted that she had little to do in them as they were generally male @-@ dominated . Her performances were also largely criticised . About her series of glamorous roles , Kaif said that her " first few films were really a process of learning ... There was no target " .

 After a string of films in which she was cast to add glamour , Kaif appeared in Kabir Khan 's terrorism drama New York ( 2009 ) . Featuring John Abraham and Neil Nitin Mukesh in lead roles , the film tells the story of how three friends ' lives are changed when the former is wrongly detained after 9 / 11 . Kaif played Maya , a college student who later marries a terrorist . The actress said that she identified with Maya , since she experienced similar isolation because of her skin colour when she was growing up in London . Kaif also remarked that she was tired of " arm candy " roles and was looking for more substantial parts . New York did well at the box office and received favourable reviews . According to Subhash K. Jha , Kaif " comes into her own as an actress of substance ... From the carefree effervescent campus girl to the anguished wife , Katrina makes the journey look plausible all the way " . New York brought Kaif her first Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actress . She then appeared in a cameo for India 's first underwater thriller Blue . 
 Kaif starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Rajkumar Santoshi 's hit comedy , Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani ( 2009 ) , as an orphan forced to marry a rich man . Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote , " Katrina Kaif continues to surprise ... She scores in both emotional and light scenes " and called her chemistry with Kapoor " electrifying " . Her final film of the year was Priyadarshan 's comedy De Dana Dan . 
 In 2010 , Kaif appeared in Prakash Jha 's political thriller Raajneeti as part of an ensemble cast which included Ranbir Kapoor , Ajay Devgan , Arjun Rampal , Nana Patekar , Manoj Bajpai and Sarah Thompson . The film took inspiration from The Mahabharata and Mario Puzo 's 1969 novel The Godfather . Set in Bhopal , the film described a fiercely @-@ fought election campaign by two parties attempting to seize power with manipulation , corruption and treachery . Although there was media speculation before the film 's release that Kaif 's character was based on Sonia Gandhi , the actress denied this . In preparation for her role as Indu ( a politician loosely based on Draupadi ) , she watched Priyanka Gandhi 's election campaign videos to study the body language and interaction of politicians . The film received mainly positive reviews from critics . Rajeev Masand found Raajneeti " thrilling and gripping " , though Namrata Joshi was more critical and expressed her disappointment over the film 's depiction of women . Nikhat Kazmi considered Kaif 's performance to be " carefree and camera @-@ unconscious " and wrote that she " seems to slip into the high @-@ powered shoes easily " . The film was highly successful at the box office , receiving a total collection of ₹ 1 @.@ 4 billion ( US $ 21 million ) . 
 Kaif collaborated with Akshay Kumar for the sixth time in the slapstick comedy Tees Maar Khan ( 2010 ) . For her role as an aspiring actress , Kaif appeared in a popular item number titled " Sheila Ki Jawani " . The song was choreographed by the film 's director Farah Khan and for the belly dancing portion of the song , Kaif was trained by expert Veronica D 'Souza . " Sheila Ki Jawani " was often compared to another item number released the same year " Munni Badnaam Hui " from Dabangg . Despite the song 's popularity , Tees Maar Khan was panned by critics and underperformed at the box office . Kaif 's portrayal was not well received ; Renuka Rao of Daily News and Analysis said that her " drama queen act is performed ... poorly " , but noted that she " does full justice " to the item number . 
 The following year , Kaif was paired with Hrithik Roshan in Zoya Akhtar 's coming @-@ of @-@ age dramedy Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara . The film narrates the story of three friends on a bachelor trip , and how the workaholism of one was overcome with the help of Laila ( Kaif ) . The film was a critical and commercial success . Richard Kuipers of Variety commented that she is " delightful as the sweet @-@ natured girl who inspires everyone to look in the mirror and do something about it " . Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was one of the most awarded films of the year and received numerous Best Film accolades . 
 Kaif then featured in Yash Raj Films ' romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan ( 2011 ) with Imran Khan and Ali Zafar , She was cast as Dimple Dixit , a " talkative " , " unpredictable " girl , a role she described as challenging as the character 's personality contrasted with her own . While the film earned mixed reviews , Kaif was generally praised for her portrayal . The book Mother Maiden Mistress called Dimple one of the more interesting female characters of the year and Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times said the film was watchable because of " Katrina 's live @-@ wire energy wherein she never goes overboard and keeps bustling with vivacity through the runtime " . For this performance , Kaif received her second Filmfare nomination in the Best Actress category .

 In 2012 , Kaif appeared in " Chikni Chameli " , an item number in Agneepath that incorporated dance steps from the <unk> genre ( a Maharashtrian folk dance ) . The song was filmed over a ten @-@ day period and , according to the actress , " It was hard work . It was very fast and it was not a style I was used to , but I took it as a challenge " . Kaif appeared next in Kabir Khan 's espionage thriller Ek Tha Tiger as a Pakistani ISI agent who falls in love with an Indian RAW agent . Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote about her performance : " Katrina is an able , animated foil to Salman , her long legs making her leaps and kicks credible " . The film received predominantly positive reviews , with Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis calling it " smart and stylish " . With worldwide earnings of ₹ 3 @.@ 1 billion ( US $ 46 million ) , Ek Tha Tiger was the highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of the year . 
 That year Kaif also appeared with Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma in Yash Chopra 's swan song , the romance Jab Tak Hai Jaan . About working with Chopra , she remarked that he " undoubtedly is the king of romance and I have always admired the way he presents his heroines . It was always a dream to work with him and the reality is even better " . She played Meera , a woman who promises God to end her affair with her comatose lover if he survives . Although the film received mostly positive reviews , Kaif 's performance had a mixed reception . CNN @-@ IBN wrote : " Meera 's role was a difficult one and Katrina falls short in emotional scenes . It seems Katrina still doesn 't feel very easy in front of the camera and has difficulty with complex expressions " . Commercially , the film proved a box @-@ office hit with revenues of ₹ 2 @.@ 11 billion ( US $ 31 million ) worldwide . 
 In 2013 , she appeared briefly with Aamir Khan in Vijay Krishna Acharya 's action thriller Dhoom 3 . To prepare for her role as a circus performer , she undertook a year @-@ long regimen of Pilates , functional training and aerial straps .

 Kaif 's next appearance was in Siddharth Anand 's Bang Bang ! ( 2014 ) , a remake of the 2010 action comedy Knight and Day . She played a bank receptionist who unwittingly gets caught up with a secret agent ( Hrithik Roshan ) . Raja Sen of Rediff.com was disappointed with her performance , describing it as " insufferable " . Although the film was commercially successful , financial analysts observed that it failed to meet box @-@ office expectations . In 2015 , Kaif 's sole appearance was with Saif Ali Khan in Kabir Khan 's post 26 / 11 counter @-@ terrorism drama Phantom . 
 As of April 2016 , Kaif appeared in Abhishek Kapoor 's adaptation of Charles Dickens ' Great Expectations , entitled <unk> in which she played a role based on Estella Havisham <unk> Aditya Roy Kapur and Tabu .

 Kaif 's personal life has been the subject of extensive media attention . She is reluctant to discuss her romantic life : " I have always believed that there is life before marriage and after marriage . Before marriage ... you are termed a single woman and I choose to conduct that part of my life with absolute dignity and discretion " . Although rumours of a relationship with Salman Khan first emerged in 2003 , it was not until after their 2010 break @-@ up that Kaif spoke of the affair , calling it her first serious relationship . They have remained friends , and the actress credits Khan with giving her confidence and guidance : 
 He ’ s had a huge role in my career . There ’ s no doubt about that . I value his opinion . But as a person , Salman has had the biggest impact on my life . I became friends with him when I was young . And his persona is very strong . If I were to look back and see his impact on my life , it ’ s been tremendous . 
 Although Kaif does not own a house in India , she has bought property in London . As a British citizen , she works in India on a visa . Kaif has a close relationship with her family , and the lack of a father figure in her life has given her a sense of responsibility towards them .

 According to an India Today article , despite her dissimilarity to a conventional Bollywood heroine , Kaif " turned every adversity into opportunity and climbed the slippery pole of stardom " . Although she is one of the most commercially successful actresses in contemporary Bollywood , she has received mixed reviews for her acting prowess .

 State Route 1002 ( SR 1002 ) , locally known as Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard , is a major 13 @.@ 8 mi ( 22 @.@ 2 km ) long east – west road in the Allentown @-@ Bethlehem @-@ Easton metropolitan area of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania . The majority of the roadway is the former alignment of U.S. Route 22 , maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation as a Quadrant Route , and is not signed except on small white segment markers . 
 Tilghman Street begins at Pennsylvania Route 100 in Fogelsville , though SR 1002 continues west on Main Street ( also old US 22 ) to the intersection of Church Street ( SR <unk> ) . It becomes Union Boulevard just east of the bridge over the Lehigh River in Allentown ; SR 1002 ends at the interchange with Pennsylvania Route 378 in Bethlehem . Union Boulevard continues over Monocacy Creek , which forms the border between Lehigh and Northampton Counties , and ends in downtown Bethlehem . 
 The highway attracts more than the average traffic for roads in the Lehigh Valley . An average of 21 @,@ 018 vehicles use it in South Whitehall Township and 21 @,@ 706 in Allentown each day . 
 = = History = = 
 When the state began taking over state highways through the Sproul Road Bill , signed May 31 , 1911 , this system did not include the direct Allentown @-@ Harrisburg route that Interstate 78 and the parallel Tilghman Street now form part of . The main route to Harrisburg , which would soon become the William Penn Highway , left Allentown further south , on Hamilton Boulevard ( now Pennsylvania Route 222 and U.S. Route 222 ) ; the portion near Allentown was Legislative Route 157 ( LR 157 ) . Another route west from Allentown ( LR 163 , later U.S. Route 309 ) ran northwest from Allentown via <unk> Avenue to <unk> . Travelers could continue via New Tripoli to Lenhartsville , and then along a route approximating the present I @-@ 78 to Harrisburg . From Allentown east to downtown Bethlehem , LR 159 used Hanover Avenue and Broad Street . No state highways existed within the city limits of Allentown . 
 The William Penn Highway was organized as an alternative to the Lincoln Highway being parallel to the Pennsylvania Railroad west of Harrisburg . The route 's New York Extension , adopted in 1916 , passed through Allentown . The state assigned the Pennsylvania Route 3 designation to this road in 1924 , and in 1926 it became part of U.S. Route 22 . The road west from Allentown , now College Heights Boulevard , Broadway , Tilghman Street , and Main Street , was designated LR 443 in 1925 , and soon the entire shortcut between Allentown and Harrisburg was designated Pennsylvania Route 43 . The New York Times was recommending use of this cutoff by early 1931 and the American Association of State Highway Officials officially moved US 22 to PA 43 on June 8 , 1931 . The Pennsylvania Department of Highways moved the William Penn Highway name to match . Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard ( then Union Street ) were once local streets in Allentown and Bethlehem , with no bridge over the Lehigh River connecting them ; Allentown built that bridge in 1929 . 
 Prior to 1931 , there were no state highways in Allentown or a number of other major cities in the state . However , the state did define paths through these cities for the public ; in Allentown , US 22 used Hamilton Street , and PA 43 entered on Liberty Street and turned south on 17th Street to reach Hamilton Street . The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed , on June 22 , 1931 , a law defining state highways through these cities and changing routes in other cities . LR 443 was defined to use College Heights Boulevard and Tilghman Street to 15th Street , where LR 157 continued along Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard to the Allentown @-@ Bethlehem line . LR 159 was redefined to begin at the same point , continuing on Union Boulevard to Main Street in downtown Bethlehem ( and beyond to Easton ) . The newest part of Tilghman Street includes the bridge over Little Cedar Creek in Trexler Park west of Cedar Crest Boulevard , which dates to 1936 , and bypasses the older route via Broadway and College Heights Boulevard . Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard became a major long @-@ distance traffic route , and as of 1999 had eight diners as a reminder of this past importance . 
 In addition to US 22 , Tilghman Street also carried U.S. Route 309 and Pennsylvania Route 29 between 19th Street and Seventh Street . They were moved from Hamilton Street with US 22 in 1931 , and to a freeway bypass of Allentown in the late 1950s . The Lehigh Valley Thruway , a freeway taking US 22 around Allentown and Bethlehem to the north , was opened on September 21 , 1954 . With the opening of these two highways , and the western extension of the Thruway in the late 1950s , no signed Traffic Routes remained on Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard , yet the road was still state maintained . It still carried LR 443 , LR 157 , and LR 159 through the cities , since the Thruway was assigned a new number — LR 772 — but west of the crossing at <unk> , LR 443 was moved to the freeway , and the old route became LR Old 443 , later LR 443 Parallel . 
 The road west of Church Street in Fogelsville , which was also a state highway ( LR <unk> ) , was removed from the state highway system in the late 1970s . A gap in LR 159 through downtown Bethlehem was created in 1971 , at the same time as Washington Avenue and <unk> Boulevard were added to the system as a bypass , with Union Boulevard east of Pennsylvania Route 378 becoming a city street . Thus in 1987 , when the new Location Referencing System was adopted , only the portion of Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard between Church Street and PA 378 was assigned a new number : State Route 1002 . 
 In late October 2012 , the Tilghman Street Bridge over the Lehigh River was repaved in order to accommodate construction vehicles for the long @-@ awaited beginning of the American Parkway Bridge project .

 = = = Tilghman Street = = = 
 SR 1002 begins at an intersection with Church and Main Streets ( State Route <unk> ) in Fogelsville . It then proceeds east for three @-@ tenths of a mile ( 0 @.@ 5 km ) as Main Street to an intersection with Pennsylvania Route 100 . Upon crossing SR 100 , SR 1002 becomes Tilghman Street . As Tilghman Street approaches the limited @-@ access U.S. Route 22 , the road splits into two carriageways in preparation for an interchange with US 22 , northeast of where US 22 separates from Interstate 78 . Past the interchange with US 22 , Tilghman Street returns to an undivided roadway and enters the village of <unk> . 
 At an intersection with <unk> Road , SR 1002 connects to Interstate 476 ( the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike ) via a ramp leading to the toll plaza for the nearby I @-@ 476 / US 22 interchange . SR 1002 continues to the southeast , passing over the turnpike . After turning to the northeast , Tilghman Street has a cloverleaf interchange with Pennsylvania Route 309 . SR 1002 enters Allentown one quarter mile west of this interchange just before its intersection with 40th Street . Tilghman Street then re @-@ enters South Whitehall for about one block as it crosses Cedar Crest Boulevard , a local north – south arterial , before entering into the city 's incorporated limits for a second time . 
 In Allentown , Tilghman Street ( SR 1002 ) crosses more than 30 major streets in the city . In the more populated part of the city , SR 1002 intersects the 6th and 7th street one @-@ way couplet forming Pennsylvania Route 145 . East of 4th Street , the road uses the Tilghman Street Bridge to cross Jordan Creek and American Parkway . After intersecting Front Street , SR 1002 crosses the Lehigh River on the Tilghman Street Viaduct and becomes Union Boulevard . Tilghman Street is still found in east @-@ side Allentown , but it is not connected to SR 1002 in west @-@ side , center city , and upper east @-@ side Allentown . 
 = = = Union Boulevard = = = 
 East of the Tilghman Street Viaduct , SR 1002 traverses numerous streets in the eastern section of Allentown . After the intersection with Fenwick Street , SR 1002 has a solid west – east routing . East of the Irving Street intersection , SR 1002 intersects Airport Road , the main road to Lehigh Valley International Airport . Briefly east of Airport Road , Union Boulevard traverses the other streets of east Allentown . SR 1002 enters the city of Bethlehem from the west as West Union Boulevard . 
 Approximately 1 @,@ 500 feet east of the Allentown @-@ Bethlehem boundary , Eaton Avenue is concurrent with SR 1002 for one @-@ tenth of a mile . The route turns to the south near the junction with Pennsylvania Avenue before taking an increasingly eastern alignment . Third Avenue provides access to and from PA 378 south . SR 1002 terminates at an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 378 . The highway only has access to PA 378 north . The designation continues as W. Union Boulevard upon entering the eastern sections of Bethlehem in Northampton County .

 = Meteorological history of Hurricane Georges = 
 The meteorological history of Hurricane Georges spanned seventeen days from September 15 to October 1 , 1998 . Hurricane Georges began as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa during mid @-@ September 1998 . Tracking westward , the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later , which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression . On September 16 , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges , and to Hurricane Georges the next day . Over the next few days , an eye developed and deep Atmospheric convection persisted around it . Strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures allowed the storm to intensify as it tracked towards the west @-@ northwest . The storm reached its peak intensity on September 20 with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) , just below Category 5 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , and a barometric pressure of 937 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 68 inHg ) . 
 Over the following five days , the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles , making five landfalls , four as a Category 3 hurricane and one as a Category 1 . Shortly after entering the Caribbean , the Georges weakened slightly ; however , shortly before crossing Puerto Rico , the storm re @-@ attained major hurricane status . After weakening slightly once more , the storm rapidly organized near the Dominican Republic . A well @-@ defined eye formed and outflow re @-@ established , allowing the storm to reach an intensity of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) just prior to landfall . During its passage of Hispaniola the circulation was severely disrupted , but Georges maintained hurricane @-@ intensity . On September 23 , the storm made landfall in southeastern Cuba as a minimal hurricane . 
 By September 25 , Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane . The storm re @-@ organized over the gulf , with the eye fully reforming and deep convection persisting around the center of circulation . By September 27 , Georges reached an intensity of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . Several hours prior to landfall the next day , the hurricane weakened slightly and tracked inland near Biloxi , Mississippi with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . Upon landfall , the hurricane 's forward motion slowed , executing a brief clockwise loop before maintaining an eastward drift . Gradually weakening , the hurricane was only a tropical depression by the afternoon of September 29 . Two days later , Georges fully dissipated near the Atlantic coast of Florida . 
 = = Formation and intensification = = 
 Late on September 13 , 1998 , a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa . The following day the system featured a large area of organized deep convection and the <unk> technique was initiated . By September 15 , ships within the vicinity of the wave reported that a surface circulation had developed and by 1200 UTC , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) estimated that a tropical depression , the seventh of the season , while situated about 345 miles ( 555 kilometres ) south @-@ southwest of the Cape Verde Islands . The depression tracked roughly due west in response to a mid @-@ level ridge , building westward , to the north of the cyclone . Throughout the day , banding features developed around the system and deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation . Roughly 24 hours after being declared a depression , the NHC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and gave it the name Georges . 
 For the following ten days , Georges maintained a general west @-@ northwest track for ten days due to a persistent mid to upper @-@ level tropospheric ridge . Gradual intensification took place as the system developed strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures aided in fueling further development . Easterly wind shear caused disruption of the storms ' outflow ; however , the center , previously surrounded by two deep areas of convection , was situated underneath one area of thunderstorm activity . By the late morning hours of September 17 , an eyewall developed within the circulation , indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane @-@ status . 
 = = Peak intensity and Lesser Antilles = = 
 Later on September 17 , a banding @-@ eye feature appeared on satellite imagery , leading the NHC to upgrade Georges into a hurricane at 1800 UTC that day . The next day , an anticyclone began to develop over the hurricane , enhancing the storms ' outflow . Several hours later , Georges attained Category 2 status as sustained winds around the eye increased to 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . Ahead of the storm , the NHC reported that there were no factors inhibiting further intensification and anticipated Georges to strengthen into a Category 4 hurricane before reaching the Lesser Antilles . A concentric eyewall began to develop late on September 18 , briefly stalling the strengthening of the storm . This resulted from an eyewall replacement cycle that led to the formation of a larger eye . 
 On September 19 and 20 , Georges underwent a period of rapid intensification , in which winds increased by 45 mph ( 85 km / h ) in a 24 @-@ hour span . At the end of this phase , Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 937 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 68 inHg ) , just below Category 5 status . At the time of peak intensity , a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight @-@ level winds up to 168 mph ( 270 km / h ) while dropsondes measured surface winds up to 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) . One of the readings from a dropsonde , that was disregarded , recorded winds of 191 mph ( 307 km / h ) in the lower @-@ levels of the eyewall . This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges . The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm @-@ force winds , prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles . Around the time of peak intensity , the eye of Georges was roughly 35 mi ( 55 km ) in diameter . 
 Shortly after attaining peak intensity on September 20 , Georges began to weaken , as upper @-@ level vertical wind shear caused the eye to become cloud @-@ filled and was no longer visible on satellite imagery . Convection associated with the storm also became less symmetric in nature . In spite of these factors , Georges remained a major hurricane through September 21 . Continued weakening took place as the shear restricted a portion of the hurricane 's outflow . At 0430 UTC on September 21 , Georges made its initial landfall on Antigua with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . Several hours later , the storm passed directly over St. Kitts . Shortly after passing over the island , the storm weakened to Category 2 status and winds decreased to 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . 
 = = Caribbean islands = = 
 As the storm approached Puerto Rico late on September 21 , the wind shear began to relent , allowing Georges to re @-@ organize ; however , its outflow was unable to fully redevelop due to its proximity to land . Around 2200 UTC , the storm reattained Category 3 intensity and made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) before weakening again . Hours later , the storm entered the Mona Passage and began to once again reorganize . As Georges approached the Dominican Republic , it unexpectedly developed a well @-@ defined eye and began to intensify , attaining winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) ; satellite imagery suggested that Georges re @-@ attained Category 4 intensity . It made landfall on the Dominican Republic at 1230 UTC on September 22 as a Category 3 hurricane . 
 Hispaniola 's mountainous terrain was a large factor in the expected weakening of the storm ; however , by six hours after landfall , the storm 's eye maintained its structure , outflow remained strong , and banding features were still organized . By September 23 , however , the center became ill @-@ defined and Hurricane Hunters were unable to fly into the storm until it moved back over water . The hurricane 's core was severely disrupted by the 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) mountains of Hispaniola . Although Georges was exceptionally disorganized , it retained minimal hurricane intensity throughout its passage of the island . 
 Later on September 23 , the storm entered the Windward Passage , maintaining a broad circulation with well @-@ defined banding and an eye @-@ like feature . Little change occurred during the day ; the storm made its fifth landfall near Guantanamo Bay , Cuba with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . The storm began to take a more northwesterly track in response to a mid- to upper @-@ level high pressure area to the northeast and a mid- to upper @-@ level low over the Yucatán Peninsula . Throughout its passage across Cuba , Georges maintained a well @-@ defined outflow pattern despite having an ill @-@ defined center . By September 24 , the storm moved over water north of Cuba , and the eyewall quickly began to redevelop . 
 = = Gulf of Mexico and dissipation = = 
 As the hurricane neared the Florida Keys on September 25 , its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery . The reorganization led to an increase in intensity , and at about 1530 UTC , Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105 mph ( 160 km / h ) . The hurricane 's forward motion shifted to west @-@ northwest , and forecast models indicated that Georges would re @-@ attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast . The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track , mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye . Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) , restricting outflow within the hurricane and confining the most intense convection to the eastern side of the circulation . 
 Between September 26 and 27 , the storm continued to slow while turning northwestward . Its wind field became asymmetric during the afternoon of September 26 , with hurricane @-@ force winds present only in the eastern side . Later in the day , winds around the center increased to 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) , just short of major hurricane status . The possibility of rapid intensification at the time was low . 
 The central barometric pressure continued to decrease through September 28 , bottoming out at 961 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 39 inHg ) . By that time , the storm had become visible on New Orleans , Louisiana , radar imagery , which depicted an incomplete eyewall . The storm continued to slow as it neared its final landfall , and winds around the eyewall slightly decreased . Around 1130 UTC , Georges made landfall near Biloxi , Mississippi with winds of 105 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Several hours after moving ashore , Georges weakened to Category 1 status and became quasi @-@ stationary . The storm 's slow movement led to extreme amounts of rainfall throughout the southeastern United States , peaking at 38 @.@ 46 in ( 977 mm ) in Munson , Florida . 
 By September 29 , Georges had weakened to a tropical storm and completed a small clockwise loop over southern Mississippi . Subsequently , the storm began tracking west @-@ northwestward at a faster pace . Around 1200 UTC , Georges weakened to a tropical depression , and the NHC issued their final advisory on the system . At this time , the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center ( HPC ) initiated public advisories . The depression maintained a well @-@ defined circulation as it tracked close to the Gulf of Mexico ; however , the center of circulation remained inland . Large quantities of tropical moisture fed the storm , allowing it to produce torrential rainfall . By September 30 , the low @-@ level circulation began to detach from the upper @-@ level circulation . The HPC issued their final advisory on the depression early on October 1 as it neared the Atlantic Ocean , and it fully dissipated several hours later . 
 = Cyclone Jokwe = 
 Cyclone Jokwe of March 2008 was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Mozambique since Cyclone Favio struck in the previous year . The tenth named storm of the 2007 – 08 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season , Jokwe was first classified as a tropical depression on March 2 over the open Southwest Indian Ocean . It tracked west @-@ southwest , crossing northern Madagascar as a tropical storm on March 5 before intensifying into a tropical cyclone on March 6 . Jokwe rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) , before weakening slightly and striking Nampula Province in northeastern Mozambique . It quickly weakened while paralleling the coastline , though the storm restrengthened as it turned southward in the Mozambique Channel . Late in its duration , it remained nearly stationary for several days , and steadily weakened due to wind shear before dissipating on March 16 . 
 The storm caused minor damage in northern Madagascar . In Mozambique , the cyclone affected 200 @,@ 000 people , and left at least sixteen fatalities . Cyclone Jokwe destroyed over 9 @,@ 000 houses and damaged over 3 @,@ 000 more , with the heaviest damage in Angoche and the Island of Mozambique in Nampula Province . The storm also caused widespread power outages and crop damages . The name Jokwe was submitted to the World Meteorological Organization by Botswana . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In the beginning of the month , an area of convection persisted in association with a broad low @-@ level circulation about 565 km ( 350 mi ) west @-@ southwest of Diego Garcia . The disturbance tracked west @-@ southwestward , and on March 2 the Météo @-@ France ( MFR ) declared it as a weak depression . Initially in an area of moderate wind shear , the system at first failed to maintain deep convection . Early on March 4 , convection increased and organized around the center of circulation , and the MFR classified it as Tropical Depression Twelve , about 270 km ( 170 mi ) southwest of the Agaléga Islands . Initially the MFR forecast that the depression would intensify further before striking Madagascar . 
 The cyclone tracked generally westward along the northern periphery of a ridge . The circulation became better defined , though convection was displaced to the west of the center due to persistent wind shear . Intensification was favored , though , due to warm water temperatures and good outflow . Early on March 5 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 22S . Shortly thereafter , the MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Jokwe about 675 km ( 420 mi ) southwest of the Agalega Islands , or about 230 km ( 140 mi ) northeast of the northern tip of Madagascar . At first , the storm was smaller than usual , with gale force winds extending 37 km ( 23 mi ) from the center . Jokwe turned to the west @-@ southwest in response to the development of a trough of low pressure in the Mozambique Channel , and late on March 5 the storm crossed over northern Madagascar . The low @-@ level circulation became disorganized due to land interaction , though its mid and upper @-@ level circulation remained well @-@ organized . Subsequently , the storm encountered more favorable conditions , and an eye developed ; Jokwe underwent rapid deepening and intensified to tropical cyclone status , or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane , midday on March 6 off the northwest coast of Madagascar . 
 Shortly after attaining tropical cyclone status , Jokwe began weakening as its eye disappeared , and it weakened to tropical storm status . The weakening trend was short @-@ lived , and after turning westward the storm re @-@ developed a 13 km ( 8 mi ) eye . Jokwe again underwent rapid intensification as it approached the coast of Mozambique , becoming an intense " midget cyclone " with winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) late on March 7 ; the MFR explained its rapid intensity changes due to its small size . Excellent upper @-@ level outflow and warm waters contributed to the intensification . At 0000 UTC on March 8 , Jokwe attained peak winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) about 75 km ( 45 mi ) east of the Island of Mozambique in Nampula Province ; at the same time , its gusts reached about 275 km / h ( 170 mph ) . It weakened slightly while paralleling the coastline just offshore , and at 1015 UTC Jokwe made landfall between the Island of Mozambique and Angoche . 
 Cyclone Jokwe remained over land for about 18 hours before emerging into the Mozambique Channel , weakening quickly to tropical storm status . Upon reaching open waters , convection increased over the center , and late on March 9 Jokwe re @-@ intensified to a tropical cyclone as an eye reappeared on satellite imagery . The cyclone turned to the south @-@ southeast , around the periphery of a ridge to its east . An upper @-@ level low to its south produced good outflow which , in combination with warm waters , allowed Jokwe to re @-@ intensify . Late on March 10 , the storm passed about 35 km ( 21 mi ) east of Europa Island , and shortly thereafter the MFR upgraded Jokwe to intense tropical cyclone status with winds of 170 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Subsequently , an increase in wind shear caused a steady weakening trend , and by March 12 Jokwe weakened to tropical storm status as its center became partially exposed from the deep convection ; at the same time , the storm turned to the southwest . 
 Later on March 12 , thunderstorms reformed over the center , as its movement became nearly stationary due to a ridge to its south and northwest . Early on March 13 , it began a steady movement to the northwest , and its organization increased with an eye re @-@ appearing ; after briefly re @-@ attaining tropical cyclone status , Jokwe again weakened to tropical storm status due to persistent wind shear . Convection continued to diminish , and on March 14 Jokwe weakened to tropical depression status as the center became almost fully exposed . Early on March 15 , the MFR issued its last advisory on the system . The remnants accelerated southeastward and dissipated on March 16 to the southwest of Madagascar . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Crossing northern Madagascar as a tropical storm , Jokwe damaged or destroyed 44 buildings in Nosy Be , leaving 400 homeless . Satellite @-@ based rainfall estimates reached over 200 mm ( 8 inches ) in northwestern Madagascar . 
 On March 7 , the National Emergency Operational Centre of Mozambique warned for coastal residents in Nampula and Zambezia provinces to be on alert . A day later , the agency issued a Red Alert for northern Nampula Province , advising potentially affected residents to seek shelter . Subsequently , the alert was extended southwestward along the coastline . Strong winds and heavy rains from the storm left the island of Mozambique without power , as well as water . There winds knocked down several poorly constructed houses , and also destroyed the roofs of two schools . Satellite @-@ based rainfall estimates reached over 300 mm ( 12 inches ) in northwestern Madagascar . Across Nampula Province , heavy agricultural damage was reported ; a total of 508 animals on farms were killed , and about 2 million cashew trees were destroyed . Widespread power outages were reported , with 75 % of power transmission lines damaged or destroyed . The cyclone destroyed at least 200 boats and the roofs of at least 80 schools . The storm destroyed a bridge across the <unk> River , which left the town of <unk> isolated . Across Nampula Province , Jokwe destroyed 9 @,@ 316 houses and damaged 3 @,@ 220 more , most of which in Angoche . In Pebane District in neighboring Zambezia Province , the cyclone destroyed nine houses . Rainfall was reported throughout the province , though damage was not as heavy due to lack of strong winds . Throughout Mozambique , the cyclone affected 200 @,@ 000 people , with a total of 55 @,@ 000 people left homeless . Ten people were killed in Nampula Province , and six more were killed in coastal districts of Zambezia Province . 
 On March 10 , a station on Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel reported a pressure of 985 @.@ 5 mbar .

 Shortly after the cyclone moved ashore along Mozambique , officials distributed tents and food to the affected citizens . The government activated the National Civil Protection Unit to clear fallen trees from roadways , as well as assist in rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes . A few days after the storm , the Mozambique Red Cross began delivering mosquito nets , blankets , plastic buckets , and sleeping mats . The government of Nampula estimated it would require $ 8 million ( USD ) to repair storm damage in the province . 
 Two weeks after the storm , the World Food Programme announced it would provide food for 60 @,@ 000 people in the impacted areas of Mozambique . On March 27 , the government of Portugal donated $ 700 @,@ 000 ( USD ) to the Mozambique National Disasters Management Institute ; over half of the total was aid for flood victims affected by Jokwe and flooding earlier in the year . 
 = Sprang = 
 Sprang is an ancient method of constructing fabric that has a natural elasticity . Its appearance is similar to netting , but unlike netting sprang is constructed entirely from warp threads . Archaeological evidence indicates that sprang predates knitting ; the two needlework forms bear a visible resemblance and serve similar functions but require different production techniques . 
 Although examples of sprang have been unearthed from as early as the bronze age , sprang was almost entirely undocumented in written records until the late nineteenth century when archaeological finds generated interest in Europe . Museum examples of sprang had been misidentified as knitting or lace until discoveries of ancient examples prompted reexamination of newer pieces . Subsequently , sprang has been identified in a variety of cultures and traditions across several continents . Its practice as a folk art waned during the twentieth century and sprang traditions have disappeared in most locales . Knitting has largely supplanted sprang . 
 = = Technique = = 
 In principle , sprang may be regarded as a practical application of the fiber manipulation techniques used in the children 's game known as cat 's cradle . Sprang is made by preparing a set of warp threads either on a rectangular frame or between a pair of beams . The craftsperson then generates a fabric by interlinking the warp threads . Unlike most textile production techniques that add new rows at the end of completed rows , sprang works upon the center of a group of fibers and the material grows inward from both ends with symmetrical top and bottom halves . The craftsperson must maintain control of the center area or the structure unravels : most sprang worked upon has too many fibers to keep in hand , so rods or sticks maintain the appropriate fiber positions . The fiber manipulation itself is done by the craftsperson 's fingers . Decorative patterns may be generated by regular variations in the fiber crossings . As crossings accumulate the craftsperson beats the material flat with a stick . Work continues with the material growing from both edges toward the middle until the center band becomes too tight to continue work . The completed fabric is either separated into two identical items or permanently secured at the middle to stabilize the contrary twists . In traditions where two halves of sprang are not severed by cutting , this center seam is a telltale sign of sprang manufacture . 
 = = History and uses = = 
 The English word sprang is of Swedish origin . It may have spread southward toward the Mediterranean during the iron age or possibly the late bronze age . The earliest surviving example of sprang is a hair net , c . 1400 B.C. , that was recovered from a bog in Denmark . Most archaeological finds of sprang fabric come from the later classical era and early Dark Ages : locations include Norway ( third to fifth centuries A.D. ) , Switzerland , Egypt ( possibly twenty @-@ second dynasty , also early Coptic ) , and various Roman sites . Use of sprang has also been conjectured from archaeological recoveries of ancient looms and from depictions in period artwork . 
 Sprang is also an indigenous needlework technique among the peoples of South America , with the earliest known examples dating from before 900 A.D. among the Paracas culture and Nazca culture in present @-@ day Peru . Sprang has also been noted in the Middle East , Central Asia , the Indian Subcontinent , and North America . Indigenous North American sprang includes woolen scarves by the Ho @-@ Chunk of Wisconsin , and Hopi wedding sashes . The natural elasticity of sprang makes it suitable for stockings , hair nets , sleeves , bags , scarves , and other purposes where pliant material is required . Most sprang needlework is utilitarian and hence was overlooked by scholars until late in its history , according to needlework historian Catherine Amoroso Leslie . 
 In fact , it was not until the nineteenth century and the discovery of sprang at archaeological sites that it was recognized as a separate and distinct form of needlework . Many museum objects that were wrongly classified as knitting or lace have now been correctly identified as sprang . 
 Following nearly simultaneous archaeological finds in Denmark and Egypt during the 1870s , an example of Coptic sprang brought to Austria in 1882 inspired the management of a factory near Vienna to manufacture sprang hammocks . The Paris World 's Fair of 1889 included an exhibit that duplicated ancient sprang , which led to renewed interest in the technique . Traditionally , cultures that practiced sprang had not produced written records of its manufacture or use . Shortly after the Paris exhibition , living traditions of sprang began to be documented . During the 1890s Ukrainian villagers were identified as practicing sprang in the manufacture of women 's caps . Soon afterward , local sprang production for various garments was also documented in parts of Eastern Europe and in Denmark . Local European traditions generally endured until the mid @-@ twentieth century . Sprang is , however , largely a historical technique that has been supplanted for most purposes by the later invention of knitting , whose earliest known example dates from the third century A.D. 
 During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries a military fashion of decorative sprang sashes in silk known as <unk> in Spain gained international popularity among generals as a distinguishing ornament of rank . The fashion spread to northern Europe and to North America . George Washington wore a sash made of red silk sprang around the year 1779 .

 In a study of folk textiles of Anatolia , Greece , Linda Welters identifies the zonari as a long fringed belt constructed of sprang . The zonari is a rounded material of indeterminate length around 2 or 3 meters long and is wrapped multiple times when worn . From interviews conducted during the 1980s , Welters found that the technique was practiced by elderly women and regarded as a specialized skill which they worked on pairs of beams . Their vocabulary had no special term to correspond with sprang , so they referred to it with descriptive phrases such as knitting with sticks , plaiting , and weaving without passing through . The zonari are made from sheep 's wool hand spun with a drop spindle and dyed red , blue , or black depending on local custom . <unk> belts are a custom in much of <unk> and Corinthia where they are traditional dowry items worn by women from marriage onward and associated with fertility and donned on ritual occasions . Welters observes that these were mostly owned and worn by older women . 
 The sprang technique also survives as a traditional method for making hammocks in Guatemala , Mexico , and Colombia , and also in Colombia for making a shopping bag known as <unk> . The work in these locations is generally performed on a <unk> loom . Handmade Mesoamerican sprang hammocks continue to be produced for export to a variety of international markets . Additionally , sprang remains in use for making silk trouser <unk> for male and female attire in Punjab in India & Pakistan . There village women still use the technique to create colourful check / <unk> / zigzag designs that have been handed down the generations . They finish the ends of the work using a weaving technique to make a hard <unk> <unk> ' with bunched twisted threads & knot . These sprang <unk> are also used for the ' <unk> ' [ full long skirts worn traditionally by Punjabi women : <unk> has been fashionable at times to have the drawstring ends on show , hanging with the ' <unk> ' having colourful pom @-@ poms or jewellery added on . The sprang technique is also used to make the black ' <unk> ' traditionally plaited into women 's <unk> they also have a colourful ' <unk> <unk> fixed at the <unk> can be found on sale in Punjab even now . <unk> , baby cradles , hanging baskets for fruit were also made . In attempts to retain traditional Punjabi culture , there are cultural craft centres in and around <unk> where sprang technique is one of several old textile arts being passed on to young craftspeople . Contemporary art textiles sometimes employ sprang in wall hangings .

 The family goes to Nifty Fifties Diner , a 1950s @-@ themed restaurant , and they see waiters dressed up as celebrities from the 1950s , including James Dean , Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley . Peter obtains a record of his favorite song , The Trashmen 's " Surfin ' Bird " from the restaurant ( which was about to be thrown away because it was released in 1963 ) . Peter repeats the song over and over on the way home in bed and even when waking up Lois , annoying his family . However the final straw of the family 's hatred of Surfin ' Bird is when Peter spends over $ 6 @,@ 000 of the family fortune to buy himself a two @-@ minute clip on TV saying that " I dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word " and singing the song again . 
 Stewie and Brian steal the record while Peter is asleep one night and destroy it . In a fit of rage , Peter accuses the others , saying they had a motive as he changed his will and left everything to the record . Oblivious to the fact that Lois , Chris and Meg have evidence to prove they did not take it he accuses them of conspiring to destroy his record , and suspects his kids for possible motives . He then furiously goes to the town 's only record shop the next morning to buy another copy , but it turns out the stores had already been visited by " a dog " and " a baby " ( Brian and Stewie ) who bought all the copies . Peter is frustrated , but gets distracted as he recognizes the record sales clerk to be Jesus Christ . 
 Jesus reveals he goes to Earth every 100 years or so to check on the world , and since his father had become highly irritable after giving up smoking , he needed some time away . He and Peter become friends , and Peter invites him to dinner , along with Brian . Brian asks Jesus for proof he is Jesus Christ , so Jesus proves he is , by turning everyone 's dinner into sundaes and , on Peter 's request , makes Lois ' breasts enlarge to massive proportions .

 = William de Braose , 3rd Lord of Bramber = 
 William de Braose , 3rd Lord of Bramber ( fl . 1135 – 1179 ) was a 12th @-@ century Marcher lord who secured a foundation for the dominant position later held by the Braose family in the Welsh Marches . In addition to the family 's English holdings in Sussex and Devon , William had inherited Radnor and Builth , in Wales , from his father Philip . By his marriage he increased the Braose Welsh holdings to include Brecon and Abergavenny . 
 William remained loyal to King Stephen during the 12th @-@ century period of civil war . He became a trusted royal servant during the subsequent reign of Henry II , accompanying the king on campaigns in France and Ireland . He served as sheriff of Herefordshire from 1173 until 1175 . The family 's power reached its peak under his son William during the reigns of King Richard I and King John . 
 = = Lands and family = = 
 William was the eldest son of Philip de Braose , lord of Bramber . His mother was <unk> , daughter of <unk> of Totnes . He was the third in the line of the Anglo @-@ Norman Braose family founded by his grandfather , the first William de Braose . After his father died in the 1130s William inherited lordships , land and castles in Sussex , with his caput at Bramber . He also held Totnes in Devon and Radnor and Builth in the Welsh Marches . He confirmed the grants of his father and grandfather to the abbey of St Florent in Anjou and made further grants to the abbey 's dependent priory at Sele in Sussex . In about 1155 , he also inherited through his mother 's family one half of the honour of Barnstaple in Devon , paying a fee of 1000 marks for the privilege . William became an internationally recognised figure . When Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was asked by Pope Adrian IV to inquire into the background of a certain Walter , canon of St Ruf , his reply , dated to 1154 / 9 read : 
 The facts which you demand need but little enquiry ; for they shine so brightly in themselves that they cannot be hid ; so great is the brilliance of his noble birth and the glory of all his kin . For Walter , as we know for a fact , was the son of a distinguished knight and born of a noble mother in lawful wedlock , and he is closely related by blood to the noble William de Braose . 
 William had married Bertha , daughter of Miles of Gloucester and Sibyl de Neufmarché , by 1150 . When each of Bertha 's four brothers died leaving no issue , William 's marriage became unexpectedly valuable . He gained control of the lordships of Brecon and Abergavenny after 1166 when the last brother died . These additional land holdings greatly expanded the territorial power and income of the Braose family . They now held a vast block of territory in the Welsh Marches as well as their extensive interests in Sussex and Devon . William 's daughters were able to make good marriages , notably Sibyl to William de Ferrers , Earl of Derby . Maud was married to John de Brompton of Shropshire . William 's son and heir , another William de Braose , became a major player in national politics under King John . 
 = = Royal service = = 
 Empress Maud , the only legitimate living child of Henry I , landed in England in 1139 in an attempt to press her claim to the monarchy . She was soon besieged by King Stephen 's forces at Arundel castle . Stephen allowed Maud a safe conduct to Bristol and provided her with an escort , which included William de Braose , suggesting that he was an adherent of King Stephen . William was present as a witness when three charters were issued by Stephen at Lewes dated to the years 1148 – 53 , therefore it appears that he remained loyal to the king until the Treaty of Wallingford ended the hostilities . 
 William was in Sussex in 1153 , but he followed Duke Henry , soon to become King Henry II , to Normandy in 1154 . William was frequently with the new king . He was one of the military leaders who supported Henry at Rhuddlan in 1157 . He witnessed one of the king 's charters at Romsey in 1158 , and he is recorded at the king 's court in Wiltshire in 1164 when the Constitutions of Clarendon were enacted . He accompanied the king on expedition to France , witnessing at <unk> in 1161 and Chinon in 1162 . William is also documented on the Irish campaign at Dublin in 1171 and Wexford 1172 . William 's younger brother , Philip , also accompanied the king to Ireland , and remained with the garrison at Wexford . In 1177 Philip was granted the kingdom of Limerick by Henry but failed to take possession after the citizens set fire to the town . 
 When Henry was facing war with his sons in 1173 , William was appointed as sheriff of Herefordshire at Easter . He maintained the King 's interests in Herefordshire until 1175 . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 King Henry withdrew his favour from the family after William 's son organised the murder of <unk> ap Dyfnwal and other Welsh princes at Abergavenny in 1176 . There is little subsequent record of William in public life , and it is likely that he retired to his estates in Sussex . William died after 1179 and was succeeded by his son , William de Braose , 4th Lord of Bramber , who gained the favour of both King Richard I and King John and became a dominant force in the Welsh Marches during their reigns . 
 = Ontario Highway 148 = 
 King 's Highway 148 , commonly referred to as Highway 148 , is a provincially maintained highway in Ontario , Canada . The highway acts as an extension of Route 148 in Quebec , once connecting it with Highway 17 , the Trans @-@ Canada Highway , near Pembroke . It was shortened to its present terminus in 1997 , and now connects downtown Pembroke to the provincial border . Highway 148 follows a route that was once part of Highway 17 and Highway 62 until the Pembroke Bypass opened in 1982 . 
 The 7 @.@ 0 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) route of Highway 148 takes it along the Ontario shoreline of the Ottawa River from the outskirts of Pembroke to the opposite shore as L 'Isle @-@ aux @-@ <unk> , where it crosses the river into Quebec . The section of the highway within Pembroke is locally maintained under a Connecting Link agreement . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 148 connects Pembroke to the Quebec border at L 'Isle @-@ aux @-@ <unk> , a distance of 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) . It originally connected to Highway 17 west of Pembroke , and was 15 @.@ 1 km ( 9 @.@ 4 mi ) long . However , its length was truncated on April 1 , 1997 when the province downloaded responsibility for the portion from Highway 17 to Boundary Street . At that time , the connecting link status of Highway 148 through Pembroke itself was revised , and the current signed terminus of the highway is now Mackay Street , which was formerly Highway 41 . Approximately 11 @,@ 400 vehicles drive along Highway 148 on an average day , with just under half that many crossing from or into Quebec . 
 Provincial control of Highway 148 begins at the Pembroke boundary , approximately 60 m ( 200 ft ) northwest of Angus Campbell Drive . From there , the route travels southeast through the urban @-@ rural fringe of the city , passing east of two large shopping complexes . After passing west of the community of Pleasant View , the route enters a rural area and curves south alongside farmland . 
 At a four @-@ way stop with channelized right turn lanes , drivers must turn to remain on the highway . To the south is Renfrew County Road 40 , which continues to Highway 17 at the southern end of the Pembroke Bypass . Highway 148 continues east , crossing the Ottawa Valley Railway and the entrance to <unk> Bay before entering the community of <unk> Island . The highway curves northeast and crosses the Ottawa River , entering Quebec midspan .

 Highway 148 follows the route of what was the northernmost section of Highway 62 , prior to the opening of the Pembroke Bypass . Highway 17 was also signed concurrently with Highway 62 between Round Lake Road and Renfrew County Road 40 , as it followed the Ottawa River in the Pembroke area at that time . On September 10 , 1982 , the Pembroke Bypass was ceremoniously opened to traffic , diverting Highway 17 to the west . In the process , Highway 62 was truncated at the new bypass ; the removed section was redesignated Highway 148 , giving it the same number as the route in Quebec that it served to connect with the Trans @-@ Canada Highway . Highway 148 was 14 @.@ 4 km ( 8 @.@ 9 mi ) long . However , its length was truncated on April 1 , 1997 when the province downloaded responsibility for the portions between Highway 17 and Highway 41 to the Town of Pembroke and County of Renfrew .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 miles ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and as of 2014 , broadcast <unk> went into the race as reigning champions having won the previous year 's race by two @-@ thirds of a length , while Oxford held the overall lead , with 23 victories to Cambridge 's 19 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 The coaches for Cambridge were Donaldson , Charles William Moore ( who represented Cambridge in the 1881 , 1882 , 1883 and 1884 races ) and Herbert Edward Rhodes ( who rowed in the 1873 , 1874 , 1875 and 1876 races ) . Oxford 's coaches were Tom Cottingham Edwards @-@ Moss ( who rowed for the Dark Blues four times between the 1875 and the 1878 races ) , R. S.

 The weather for the race was good , as was the tide , but a strong breeze made for some rough water .

Oxford came back into contention and by the time the crews shot Hammersmith Bridge there was " little or no daylight between the boats . " The other side of the bridge the crews hit rough water and as Cambridge had the advantage of shelter on their side of the river , they pulled away quickly to be three lengths clear by Chiswick . As the bend of the river began to favour the Dark Blues , they drew up once again and were almost level by Barnes Bridge when their number seven Douglas McLean broke his oar in two , effectively ending his participation in the race . Cambridge pulled away again and won by two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 52 seconds . It was their second consecutive victory and their fastest time since the 1876 race . The win took the overall record to 23 – 20 in Oxford 's favour . 
 = Battle of Labuan = 
 The Battle of Labuan was an engagement fought between Allied and Japanese forces on the island of Labuan off Borneo during June 1945 . It formed part of the Australian invasion of North Borneo , and was initiated by the Allied forces as part of a plan to capture the Brunei Bay area and develop it into a base to support future offensives . 
 Following several weeks of air attacks and a short naval bombardment , soldiers of the Australian 24th Brigade were landed on Labuan from American and Australian ships on 10 June . The Australians quickly captured the island 's harbour and main airfield . The greatly outnumbered Japanese garrison was mainly concentrated in a fortified position in the interior of Labuan , and offered little resistance to the landing . The initial Australian attempts to penetrate the Japanese position in the days after the invasion were not successful , and the area was subjected to a heavy bombardment . A Japanese raiding force also attempted to attack Allied positions on 21 June , but was defeated . Later that day , Australian forces assaulted the Japanese position . In the following days , Australian patrols killed or captured the remaining Japanese troops on the island . A total of 389 Japanese personnel were killed on Labuan and 11 were captured . Australian casualties included 34 killed . 
 After securing the island , the Allied forces developed Labuan into a significant base . The 24th Brigade left from the island to capture the eastern shore of Brunei Bay in late June , and the island 's airfield was repaired and expanded to host Royal Australian Air Force units . While occupying Labuan , the Allies had to reconstruct the island 's infrastructure and provide assistance to thousands of civilians who had been rendered homeless by the pre @-@ invasion bombardment . Following the war , a major Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery was established on Labuan .

 Labuan is a small island in the mouth of Brunei Bay with an area of 35 square miles ( 91 km2 ) . Before the Pacific War , it formed part of the British @-@ administered Straits Settlements and had a population of 8 @,@ 960 . The island had a town , Victoria , on its south coast which fronted onto Victoria Harbour , with a population of 8 @,@ 500 and limited port facilities . Aside from a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ yard ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) beach just to the east of Victoria , the coast was ringed by coral . 
 On 3 January 1942 , Japanese forces captured Labuan unopposed during the Battle of Borneo . The Japanese developed two airfields ( Labuan and Timbalai ) on the island , which were built by labourers who had been conscripted from the Lawas and <unk> regions of mainland Borneo . The island population was also subjected to harsh occupation policies . After Japanese forces suppressed a revolt at the town of Jesselton in late 1943 , which was led by Chinese @-@ ethnic civilians , 131 of the rebels were held on Labuan . Only nine rebels survived to be liberated by Australian forces in 1944 . Until mid @-@ 1944 , few Japanese combat units were stationed in Borneo . 
 In March 1945 the Australian Army 's I Corps , whose main combat elements were the veteran 7th and 9th Divisions , was assigned responsibility for liberating Borneo . Planning for the offensive was undertaken over the following weeks . While invading the Brunei Bay area did not form part of the initial iteration of the plans , it was added in early April after a proposed landing on Java was cancelled . The main purpose of attacking Brunei Bay was to secure it as a base for the British Pacific Fleet ( BPF ) , and gain control of oil fields and rubber plantations in the area . Labuan was to be developed as an air base and form part of a string of strategic positions which would allow the Allies to control the seas off the Japanese @-@ occupied coast between Singapore and Shanghai . 
 While the liberation of the Brunei area had been authorised by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff , it was not supported by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee . The British leadership did not want the BPF to be diverted from the main theatre of operations off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the Philippines . In response to a suggestion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south @-@ east Asia , the Chiefs of Staff Committee judged that it would take too long to establish facilities there , especially as Singapore might have been recaptured by the time they were complete .

 = = = Allied planning = = = 
 The plans for the invasion of Borneo evolved considerably during April . Initially , the offensive was to commence on 23 April with the landing of a brigade from the 6th Division on the island of Tarakan , off the east coast of Borneo . The 9th Division would then assault Balikpapan followed by Banjarmasin in south @-@ east Borneo . These positions would be used to support the invasion of Java by the remainder of I Corps . After the attack on Java was cancelled , it was decided to employ two brigades of the 7th Division at Brunei Bay , and I Corps conducted further preparations on this basis . However , on 17 April General Douglas MacArthur 's General Headquarters ( to which I Corps reported ) swapped the roles of the 7th and 9th Divisions . Accordingly , the final plan for the attack against Borneo specified that one of the 9th Division 's brigades would land on Tarakan island on 29 April ( later postponed to 1 May ) , with the remainder of the division to invade the Brunei Bay area on 23 May . The 7th Division was scheduled to assault Balikpapan on 1 July . The Borneo campaign was designated the " Oboe " phase of the Allied offensive through the southern Philippines towards the Netherlands East Indies , and the landings at Tarakan , Brunei Bay and Balikpapan were designated Operations Oboe One , Six and Two respectively . 
 The 9th Division began to move from Australia to the island of Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies , where the Borneo campaign would be staged , in March 1945 . The division had seen extensive combat in North Africa and New Guinea , and its officers and enlisted men were well trained for amphibious operations and jungle warfare . However , the 9th Division had been out of action since early 1944 , leading to poor morale among its combat units . A large number of support , logistics and Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) units were assigned to the division for the operations at Brunei Bay , taking its strength to over 29 @,@ 000 personnel ( including 1 @,@ 097 in United States and British units ) . 
 Final preparations for the landings in the Brunei Bay area took place in May 1945 . After shortages of shipping delayed I Corps ' movement from Australia to Morotai , General Headquarters agreed on 8 May to reschedule the operation from 23 May to 10 June . The 9th Division 's staff completed their plans for operations in the Brunei Bay area on 16 May . The 24th Brigade Group was assigned responsibility for capturing Labuan , and the 20th Brigade Group was tasked with securing Brunei and Muara Island . Both brigades were to land simultaneously on the morning of 10 June . The invasion of the Brunei Bay region was to be preceded by attacks on Japanese bases and transport infrastructure across western and northern Borneo by United States and Australian air units , as well as three days of minesweeping operations in the bay itself . 
 The 24th Brigade Group was commanded by Brigadier Selwyn Porter . His main combat units for operations on Labuan were the 2 / 28th and 2 / 43rd Battalions , the 2 / 11th Commando Squadron and the 2 / 12th Field Regiment . In addition , a squadron from the 2 / 9th Armoured Regiment ( equipped with Matilda II tanks ) , a company of the 2 / 2nd Machine Gun Battalion and a range of engineer , signals and logistics units formed part of the brigade group . A party of 13 officers from the British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit ( BBCAU ) was also attached to the 24th Brigade and were tasked with restoring the colonial government on the island and distributing supplies to its civilian population . The 24th Brigade 's third infantry battalion , the 2 / 32nd Battalion , was assigned to the 9th Division 's reserve force . Porter and the 2 / 28th Battalion 's commander , Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Norman , had a difficult relationship which generated ill @-@ feeling between the two men and their respective headquarters . Porter considered relieving Norman of command before the landing on Labuan in the belief that he was exhausted and not capable of effectively leading his battalion , but decided against doing so after Norman made an emotional appeal to remain in his position . 
 The plans for the capture of Labuan specified that the 24th Brigade Group 's two infantry battalions were to land simultaneously on the beach near Victoria ( designated Brown Beach ) at 9 : 15 am , with the 2 / 28th Battalion coming ashore on the western side of the beach and the 2 / 43rd to the east . The 2 / 11th Commando Squadron was to be initially held in reserve on board the invasion fleet . The brigade group 's objectives were to secure a beachhead , capture the main airfield ( located north of Victoria and designated " No. 1 Strip " by the Australians ) , destroy the Japanese garrison , and prepare for further operations on the eastern shore of Brunei Bay . Priority was given to rapidly opening the port and airfield so that they could be used to support other operations . 
 Porter expected that fighting for the main objectives would begin soon after the landing , and decided to begin landing his artillery and heavy mortars with the assault waves of infantrymen , just before the tanks came ashore . The 2 / 28th Battalion was initially assigned responsibility for securing Victoria and Flagstaff Hill to its north , while the 2 / 43rd Battalion was tasked with capturing the airfield . Once these areas were in Australian hands , the 2 / 28th Battalion would secure the western part of the island while the 2 / 11th Commando Squadron captured the western shore of Victoria Harbour . Due to the Australian Army 's manpower shortages , all elements of the 9th Division were under orders to minimise their casualties during the Borneo Campaign and unit commanders would rely heavily upon the available air and artillery support during operations . The Australians estimated that the Japanese garrison on Labuan comprised 650 personnel , made up of 400 airfield troops , 100 naval troops and 150 other lines @-@ of @-@ communications personnel . 
 = = = Japanese preparations = = = 
 As the Allies advanced towards Borneo , additional units were dispatched from Japan during the second half of 1944 and the 37th Army was established in September to coordinate the island 's defence . In December 1944 , Japanese staff officers deduced that it was likely that Australian troops would be landed at strategic points on the east and west coasts of Borneo in about March the next year ( by which time they also expected United States forces to have liberated the Philippines ) . Accordingly , several Japanese units stationed in north @-@ east Borneo were ordered to march to the western side of Borneo . This movement proceeded slowly , owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks . 
 By June 1945 around 550 Japanese military personnel were stationed on Labuan . The main unit on the island was the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion ( almost in its entirety , save for one company located elsewhere ) with a strength of around 350 . This battalion formed part of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade , which had arrived at Tawao in north @-@ east Borneo from Japan in July 1944 with six infantry battalions . During early 1945 the brigade headquarters , 371st Independent Infantry Battalion and three other battalions marched across the island to assume responsibility for defending the Brunei Bay area . Many of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade 's soldiers fell sick during the march , and all four combat battalions were considerably below their authorised strength by the time they arrived at Brunei Bay . In June 1945 the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion was commanded by Captain <unk> Okuyama . A detachment of about 50 men from the 111th Airfield Battalion was also on Labuan , along with around 150 men assigned to other small units . In line with Japanese doctrine , the Labuan garrison did not make preparations to contest the Allied landing force as it came ashore . Instead , it constructed defensive positions inland from the island 's beaches . Documents captured by Australian soldiers during the fighting on Labuan indicated that Okuyama had instructions to attempt to withdraw his force from the island if the battle went against him .

 = = = Pre @-@ invasion operations = = = 
 Australian and United States air units began their pre @-@ invasion attacks on north Borneo in late May . The first attack on the Brunei Bay area took place on 3 May , and included a raid targeting the town of Victoria on Labuan . A large number of further attacks were conducted to suppress Japanese airfields and other facilities throughout north @-@ western and north @-@ eastern Borneo . The plans for the invasion of Brunei Bay had specified that the landings would be supported by aircraft based at Tarakan , but delays in rebuilding the airfield there rendered this impossible and reduced the scale of the pre @-@ invasion bombardment . 
 United States Navy minesweepers commenced operations in Brunei Bay on 7 June , and a flotilla of four cruisers and seven destroyers ( including an Australian light cruiser and destroyer ) served as a covering force . The minesweeping operation was successful , though USS Salute struck a mine on 8 June and sank with the loss of four lives . Underwater demolition teams investigated all of the landing beaches on 9 June searching for obstacles which could impede the landing craft . The teams assigned to clear obstacles off Labuan were endangered by an unauthorised attack on the island conducted by a force of American B @-@ 24 Liberator heavy bombers . Following the landings on 10 June , American Thirteenth Air Force aircraft flying from a base on Palawan Island in the Philippines provided close air support for the forces on Labuan until RAAF units based on the island were ready to take over . 
 The Australian Services Reconnaissance Department ( SRD ) also collected intelligence on Labuan and other parts of the Brunei Bay area during May . On the first of the month several RAAF PBY Catalina aircraft carrying SRD personnel overflew Labuan . These aircraft later landed near two native prahu and questioned their crews ; two sailors were flown back to an Allied base for further questioning . On 15 May two Malays working for the SRD were landed in Brunei Bay by a Catalina , and sailed to Labuan on board a prahu . These agents recruited a local civilian from Labuan , and the party was extracted by a Catalina near the mainland village of Kampong <unk> on 19 May . The intelligence gained from these operations provided the Australians with a good understanding of Labuan 's geography and infrastructure . In addition , civilians who had been recruited by the SRD 's <unk> 2 team ( which had been parachuted into Borneo during April ) provided intelligence on the size and movements of Labuan 's garrison force . 
 During the last days of May the 9th Division embarked at Morotai onto the ships which would transport it to Brunei Bay , and undertook rehearsals for the landing . Due to a shortage of shipping , the available vessels were heavily loaded and many soldiers were forced to endure cramped and hot conditions during the ten days before the landing . Australian official historian Gavin Long later wrote that for many troops these conditions " were as uncomfortable as any of the experiences that followed " during the campaign . The 24th Brigade Group was carried by a variety of landing ships : the two large Australian LSIs HMAS Manoora and Westralia , as well the attack cargo ship USS Titania , LSD USS Carter Hall , ten LSTs , five LCIs and seven LSMs from the United States Navy . A total of 38 small LCVPs and 26 LCMs were also assigned to land the brigade once it arrived off Labuan . Due to the coral reefs surrounding the island , the assault waves landed in LVTs of the US Army 's <unk> Amphibious Tractor Battalion . The convoy carrying the 9th Division left Morotai on 4 June and arrived in Brunei Bay before dawn on 10 June . The main body of the convoy anchored off Labuan , and the remainder proceeded to the Brunei area . A Japanese aircraft dropped a bomb near two of the transport ships off Labuan at 6 : 51 am , but caused no damage . 
 = = = Landing = = = 
 The landing of the assault troops at Labuan went well . The Allied fleet began bombarding the landing area from 8 : 15 am , and seven Australian B @-@ 24 Liberators dropped anti @-@ personnel bombs in the area behind the intended beachhead . No Japanese forces opposed the two battalions ' assault forces as they came ashore in LVTs , and the landing of later waves of infantry and tanks went smoothly . The 2 / 43rd Battalion rapidly advanced north and captured No. 1 Strip in the evening of 10 June . Some Japanese soldiers attempted to defend the airfield area , and the 2 / 43rd Battalion claimed to have killed 23 Japanese for the loss of four Australians wounded . 
 A company from the 2 / 28th Battalion captured Victoria shortly after coming ashore , and the battalion first met opposition at Flagstaff Hill at 10 : 45 am . One of the battalion 's companies subsequently captured the hill , while its other companies continued to advance . The 2 / 28th Battalion encountered increasing opposition as the day progressed , particularly to the west of its area of responsibility . During the afternoon of 10 June the battalion engaged Japanese troops in the area west of Flagstaff Hill ( at the junction of Callaghan and MacArthur Roads ) , with the infantrymen being supported by tanks and mortars ; the Australians counted 18 Japanese dead by the end of the day , and suffered several fatalities and men wounded in this fighting . After civilians reported that no Japanese were stationed on the Hamilton peninsula which formed the western side of Victoria Harbour , a troop from the 2 / 11th Commando Squadron was landed in the area during 10 June and secured it without opposition . 
 During the afternoon of 10 June a group of senior officers , including General Douglas MacArthur , his air commander General George Kenney , and Australians Lieutenant General Morshead and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock ( head of RAAF Command ) , made an inspection tour of the Labuan beachhead . MacArthur insisted on seeing Australian soldiers in action , and the party visited a group of front line infantrymen before departing . The process of unloading supplies from the invasion fleet during 10 June proceeded quickly , and the ships began to depart for Morotai during the afternoon of 11 June . 
 The 24th Brigade 's goal for 11 June was to secure the airfield area . The 2 / 43rd Battalion patrolled to the north and west of the airfield during the day , meeting only light opposition . In contrast , the 2 / 28th Battalion ( which was tasked with advancing into Labuan 's interior ) encountered entrenched Japanese forces , and it became clear that it was facing the main body of the island 's garrison . Norman manoeuvred his companies to push the Japanese back , but the rate of advance was slow . The airfield engineers of No. 62 Wing RAAF were also landed during 11 June to begin work on returning No. 1 Strip to service ; reconstruction of the airfield began the next day . 
 On the basis of the fighting on 11 June , Porter judged that the Japanese were withdrawing into a stronghold position located to the north of Victoria and about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the west of the airfield . On 12 June he directed the two battalions to patrol around the stronghold area . The 2 / 43rd Battalion patrolled the interior of Labuan to the west of No. 1 Strip , but located only a single Japanese position . This position was attacked and destroyed that day by the 2 / 43rd Battalion 's C Company supported by three tanks . The 2 / 28th Battalion sent patrols towards the stronghold area , with a company supported by a tank troop meeting heavy resistance as it pushed westwards along a track towards MacArthur Road . The 2 / 11th Commando Squadron also advanced north , and linked up with elements of the 2 / 43rd Battalion near the centre of Labuan during the late afternoon . The 371st Independent Infantry Battalion 's main radio was destroyed during an air attack on 12 June , cutting the unit off from the 37th Army 's headquarters . As a result of the patrolling , by the end of 12 June the location of the Japanese position was fairly well known to the Australian force . The 24th Brigade 's casualties to this point in the battle were 18 killed and 42 wounded , and the Australians believed that at least 110 Japanese had been killed . The 2 / 32nd Battalion was also landed on Labuan during 12 June , but remained in divisional reserve . 
 On 13 and 14 June the 24th Brigade Group continued operations aimed at forcing the Japanese garrison into the stronghold — dubbed " the Pocket " by the Australians . The 2 / 43rd Battalion secured the emergency airstrip at Timbalai on Labuan 's west coast on 13 June , and elements of the 2 / 28th Battalion continued to push west into the Pocket along MacArthur Road . A company from the 2 / 28th Battalion made another attack into the Pocket the next day after the 2 / 12th Field Regiment had fired 250 rounds into the area , but was forced to withdraw after being unable to overcome heavy resistance . By the conclusion of 14 June the Australians judged that , aside from the Pocket , the island was now secure . Porter assessed that an attack on this position would need to be made in strength using well @-@ coordinated forces . 
 Following the landing the BBCAU detachment and 24th Brigade were faced with a significant humanitarian challenge . The Allied air and naval attacks had destroyed almost all of the buildings on Labuan , rendering large numbers of civilians homeless . Within days of the invasion , about 3 @,@ 000 civilians were housed in a compound within the beachhead . The BBCAU party were unable to assist so many civilians , and the 24th Brigade needed to assign soldiers to support them and transport supplies . 
 = = = Destruction of the Japanese garrison = = = 
 The Japanese stronghold position was about 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) long from north to south , and 600 yards ( 550 m ) wide . The terrain within this area comprised a series of small jungle @-@ covered ridges , and the position was bordered on the western and southern sides by swamps . The main terrain features within the Pocket were three areas of high ground named Lushington Ridge , Norman Ridge and Lyon Ridge by the Australians . There were only two feasible routes into the area . The first was a track which led south into the position along Lyon Ridge and Norman Ridge ; this was passable by tanks but heavily mined . The other route was a track which ran into the eastern side of the Pocket from MacArthur Road along Lushington Ridge and joined the other track at Norman Ridge . It is likely that around 250 Japanese personnel were initially stationed within the Pocket . 
 In order to minimise the casualties to his brigade , Porter decided to isolate the Pocket with two infantry companies while a heavy artillery barrage was fired into the area over several days . An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made once it was judged that the Japanese were no longer capable of resisting effectively . As part of this plan , the 2 / 12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June . 
 The 2 / 28th Battalion probed into the Pocket on 16 June . The previous day a 2 / 11th Commando Squadron patrol had reported that the track along Lyon Ridge would be passable by tanks if a bomb crater was filled , and on the morning of the 16th A Company from the 2 / 28th Battalion accompanied by a troop of three tanks and a bulldozer began to move south along it . After the bulldozer filled the crater , the force continued along Lyon Ridge but became pinned down by heavy fire from Japanese troops on Eastman Spur to the south @-@ east of the ridge . One of the Australian tanks was damaged . A subsequent attempt by a section from the 2 / 11th Commando Squadron to advance towards Eastman Spur to the east of A Company was also beaten back , with two Australians killed and another wounded . A Company resumed its advance during the afternoon , supported by a new troop of tanks . The three tanks moved ahead of the infantry , and killed eight or ten Japanese personnel , but one was damaged by a bomb and another became bogged . By the end of the day , A Company had suffered five men killed and 23 wounded . Overall , 150 patients were admitted by the 24th Brigade 's attached medical units during 16 June , which stretched their capacity . 
 Due to the losses his brigade suffered on 16 June , Porter decided to continue the bombardment before undertaking further attacks . On 18 and 19 June the bombardment of the Pocket was intensified when the heavy cruiser HMAS Shropshire fired into the area . Infantrymen supported by tanks conducted another probe into the Pocket on 19 June , and killed 10 Japanese ; three Australians were wounded . On 20 June the 2 / 12th Field Regiment fired a particularly heavy bombardment and six Allied bombers attacked the Pocket . Porter judged that this would be sufficient to suppress the Japanese defenders , and ordered that the Pocket be attacked by two companies from the 2 / 28th Battalion supported by tanks ( including " Frog " flamethrower variants of the Matilda II ) the next day . 
 In the early hours of 21 June a force of about 50 Japanese troops slipped out of the Pocket and attempted to attack Australian positions on Labuan . Different groups of Japanese troops attacked a prisoner of war enclosure , dock facilities and No. 1 Strip , but all were defeated by Australian and American logistics personnel and engineers . A total of 32 Japanese personnel were killed around Victoria , and another 11 were killed at the airfield . Three Americans and two Australians were killed in these engagements . 
 The Japanese attack did not delay the Australian assault on the Pocket . At 10 am on 21 June , C Company of the 2 / 28th Battalion began to advance to the west along Lushington Ridge , and D Company moved south from Eastman Spur . D Company was supported by a troop of three conventional Matilda tanks and two Frog flamethrowers . C Company advanced about half of the way into the Pocket before being halted by Norman who was concerned that they might be accidentally attacked by D Company , which was also making good progress . The force built around D Company subsequently completed the occupation of the Pocket , with the flamethrower tanks playing a key role . The Japanese soldiers who had survived the artillery bombardment offered little resistance to the Australian forces . The 24th Brigade assessed that 60 Japanese personnel were killed in the final assault on the Pocket , with 117 being killed by the artillery bombardment which had preceded it . 
 From 21 June , the 2 / 12th Commando Squadron conducted patrols of the outlying areas of Labuan to clear them of any Japanese forces ; up to this point the squadron had formed part of the 9th Division 's reserve . Each troop of the squadron was assigned a different sector of Labuan , and by mid @-@ July had completed its task . During these patrols the squadron killed 27 Japanese soldiers , mainly as part of repelling a raid on the BBCAU compound on 24 June , and captured a single prisoner . The 2 / 12th Commando Squadron was subsequently directed to undertake topographic work in order to improve the quality of maps of the island . The 24th Brigade 's total combat casualties in its operations on Labuan were 34 killed and 93 wounded . The Australian soldiers counted 389 Japanese dead and took 11 prisoners . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The process of bringing No. 1 Strip back into service went well . Nos 4 and 5 Airfield Construction Squadrons were assigned the task . A 4 @,@ 000 @-@ by @-@ 100 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 220 by 30 m ) unsurfaced temporary runway was constructed at a 5 ° angle to the existing strip . The first RAAF aircraft , two P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks from No. 76 Squadron , landed on the strip on 17 June , and commenced operations from this base the next day . No. 457 Squadron , which was equipped with Spitfires , arrived on 18 June though two of its aircraft crashed on the still @-@ unfinished runway and had to be written off . The units based at the airfield took over responsibility for providing air support for the Army units on Labuan that day , and flew their first close air support sorties over the island on 19 June . No. 86 Wing 's two flying squadrons — No. 1 and No. 93 — also arrived on Labuan in late July , but conducted few operations from this base before the end of the war . The wing had originally been scheduled to move to Labuan in late June , but it took longer than expected to extend No. 1 Strip 's runway to the length needed by No. 1 Squadron 's Mosquito light bombers . 
 To reconstruct No. 1 's existing runway as an all @-@ weather strip , the bomb craters had to have the water pumped out of them and then be filled in . Sandstone from a quarry on northern Labuan was placed over the clay and sand subbase , and the runway was topped with crushed coral from the west coast of the island , and sealed with bitumen . The 5 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) runway had 70 hardstandings for aircraft . With 70 also on the dry weather strip , the air base could accommodate 140 aircraft . The 9th Division 's engineers also undertook a wide range of construction projects on Labuan . These included building 356 @,@ 000 square feet ( 33 @,@ 100 m2 ) of storage , new port facilities , bridges and oil tanks as well as surfacing 29 miles ( 47 km ) of roads . A wharf for Liberty ships was begun on 18 June , allowing the first ship to berth on 10 July . A fuel jetty was in operation by 20 June , and a fuel tank farm with seven 2 @,@ 300 @-@ US @-@ barrel ( 270 @,@ 000 l ; 72 @,@ 000 US gal ; 60 @,@ 000 imp gal ) tanks was completed on 12 July , as was a 600 @-@ bed hospital . Work then began on a 1 @,@ 200 @-@ bed general hospital . The 2 / 4th and 2 / 6th Australian General Hospitals were transferred from Morotai to Labuan during July , though the later unit 's hospital facilities were not completed until 17 September . 
 Once Labuan was secured , the 24th Brigade was ordered to capture the eastern shore of Brunei Bay . On 16 June , the 2 / 32nd Battalion was transported from Labuan to <unk> Bay . The battalion captured the town of Weston the next day . The remainder of the 24th Brigade was transported across the bay during the last week of June , and the force advanced inland to capture the town of Beaufort which was defended by between 800 and 1 @,@ 000 Japanese personnel . Following some heavy fighting , the town was secured on 28 June . The brigade then advanced further inland to Papar in early July . Later that month the 9th Division 's commander , Major General George Wootten , relieved Norman from command over an incident in which he had lost control of the 2 / 28th Battalion during the fighting on Labuan . Following the announcement of the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945 and the formal ceremony held in Tokyo Bay on 2 September , the commander of the 37th Army , Major General Masao Baba , surrendered to Wootten on 10 September at a ceremony conducted at the 9th Division 's headquarters on Labuan . 
 After the war , Labuan was one of several locations at which the Australian military conducted trials to prosecute suspected Japanese war criminals . A total of 16 trials were held on the island between 3 December 1945 and 31 January 1946 , during which 128 men were convicted and 17 acquitted . Labuan War Cemetery was also established as the burial place for all of the Commonwealth personnel killed on or near Borneo . It includes 3 @,@ 900 graves , most of which are for prisoners of war who died while being held by the Japanese . 
 Memorials have also been erected on Labuan to mark its wartime history . These include the Australian Battle Exploit Memorial at Brown Beach , a plaque marking the location of the 37th Army 's surrender ceremony and a Japanese peace park .

 = From Russia , with Love ( novel ) = 
 From Russia , with Love is the fifth novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond . Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica ; at the time he thought it may be his final Bond book . The novel was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957 . 
 The story centres on a plot by SMERSH , the Soviet counter @-@ intelligence agency , to assassinate Bond in such a way as to discredit both him and his organisation . As bait , the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor , a Soviet decoding machine . Much of the action takes place in Istanbul and on the Orient Express . The book was inspired by Fleming 's visit to Turkey on behalf of The Sunday Times to report on an Interpol conference ; he returned to Britain by the Orient Express . From Russia , with Love deals with the East – West tensions of the Cold War , and the decline of British power and influence in the post @-@ Second World War era . 
 From Russia , with Love received broadly positive reviews at the time of publication . The book 's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming 's Goldeneye estate , and the publication of an article in Life , which listed From Russia , with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy 's ten favourite books . The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper , first in an abridged , multi @-@ part form and then as a comic strip . In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series , starring Sean Connery . 
 = = Plot = = 
 SMERSH , the Soviet counterintelligence agency , plans to commit a grand act of terrorism in the intelligence field . For this , it targets the British secret service agent James Bond . Due in part to his role in the defeat of the SMERSH agents Le Chiffre , Mr Big and Hugo Drax , Bond has been listed as an enemy of the Soviet state and a " death warrant " has been issued for him . His death is planned to precipitate a major sex scandal , which will run in the world press for months and leave his and his service 's reputations in tatters . Bond 's killer is to be the SMERSH executioner Red Grant , a psychopath whose homicidal urges coincide with the full moon . Kronsteen , SMERSH 's chess @-@ playing master planner , and Colonel Rosa Klebb , the head of Operations and Executions , devise the operation . They instruct an attractive young cipher clerk , Corporal Tatiana Romanova , to falsely defect from her post in Istanbul having , she would claim , fallen in love with Bond after seeing a photograph on his file . As an added lure for Bond , Romanova will provide the British with a Spektor , a Russian decoding device much coveted by MI6 . She is not told the details of the plan . 
 The offer of defection is received by MI6 in London , ostensibly from Romanova , but is conditional that Bond collects her and the Spektor from Istanbul . MI6 is unsure of Romanova 's motive , but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore ; Bond 's superior , M , orders him to go to Turkey . Once there , Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim , head of the British service 's station in Turkey . Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor . He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the Orient Express . Bond and Kerim quickly discover three Russian MGB agents on board , travelling incognito . Kerim uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train , but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third agent , both — unbeknown to Bond — having been killed by Grant . 
 At Trieste a fellow MI6 agent , " Captain Nash " , introduces himself and Bond presumes he has been sent by M as added protection for the rest of the trip . Romanova is suspicious of Nash , but Bond reassures her that the man is from his own service . After dinner , at which Nash has drugged Romanova , they rest ; Bond wakes up to find a gun pointing at him and Nash reveals himself to be the killer Grant . Instead of killing Bond immediately , Grant reveals SMERSH 's plan , including the detail that he is to shoot Bond through the heart and that the Spektor is booby @-@ trapped to explode when examined . As Grant talks , Bond places his metal cigarette case between the pages of a magazine he holds in front of him , positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet . After Grant fires , Bond pretends to be wounded ; when Grant steps over him , Bond attacks and Grant is killed . Bond and Romanova escape . 
 Later , in Paris , after successfully delivering Romanova and the booby @-@ trapped Spektor to his superiors , Bond meets Rosa Klebb . She is captured but manages to kick Bond with a poisoned blade concealed in her shoe ; the story ends with Bond fighting for breath and falling to the floor . 
 = = Background and writing history = = 
 By January 1956 the author Ian Fleming had published three novels — Casino Royale in 1953 , Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955 . A fourth , Diamonds Are Forever , was being edited and prepared for production . That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia , with Love . He followed his usual practice , which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine : " I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour 's work between six and seven in the evening . I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula , you write 2 @,@ 000 words a day . " He returned to London in March that year with a 228 @-@ page first @-@ draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works . One of the significant re @-@ writes changed Bond 's fate ; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend , the American author Raymond Chandler : " My muse is in a very bad way ... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks . " Fleming re @-@ wrote the end of the novel in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond , which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted . Fleming 's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance . By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story , and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica . 
 Fleming 's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 to cover an Interpol conference for The Sunday Times was a source of much of the background information in the story . While there he met the Oxford @-@ educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan , who became the model for Darko Kerim ; Fleming took down many of Kalkavan 's conversations in a notebook , and used them verbatim in the novel . 
 Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels , John Griswold and Henry Chancellor — both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications — have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole . Chancellor put the events of From Russia , with Love in 1955 ; Griswold is more precise , and considers the story to have taken place between June and August 1954 . 
 In August 1956 , for fifty guineas , Fleming commissioned Richard Chopping to provide the art for the cover , based on Fleming 's design ; the result won a number of prizes . After Diamonds Are Forever had been published in March 1956 , Fleming received a letter from a thirty @-@ one @-@ year @-@ old Bond enthusiast and gun expert , Geoffrey Boothroyd , criticising the author 's choice of firearm for Bond . Boothroyd 's suggestions came too late to be included in From Russia , with Love , but one of his guns — a .38 Smith & Wesson snub @-@ nosed revolver modified with one third of the trigger guard removed — was used as the model for Chopping 's image . Fleming later thanked Boothroyd by naming the armourer in Dr. No Major Boothroyd .

 = = = Plot inspirations = = = 
 As with several of his works , Fleming appropriated the names or backgrounds of people he knew or had heard of for the story 's characters : Red Grant , a Jamaican river guide — whom Fleming 's biographer Andrew Lycett described as " a cheerful , voluble giant of villainous aspect " — was used for the half @-@ German , half @-@ Irish assassin . Rosa Klebb was partly based on Colonel <unk> — a real @-@ life member of the Lenin Military @-@ Political Academy about whom Fleming had written an article for The Sunday Times . The Spektor machine used as the bait for Bond was not a Cold War device , but had its roots in the Second World War Enigma machine , which Fleming had tried to obtain while serving in the Naval Intelligence Division . 
 The idea of the Orient Express came from two sources : Fleming had returned from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train , but found the experience drab , partly because the restaurant car was closed . He also knew of the story of Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express : Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who , in February 1950 , took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris , carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc . Soviet assassins were already on the train . The conductor was drugged and Karp 's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg . Fleming had a long @-@ standing interest in trains and , following his involvement in a near @-@ fatal crash in 1927 , associated them with danger ; they also feature in Live and Let Die , Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun . 
 The cultural historian Jeremy Black points out that From Russia , with Love was written and published at a time when tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high . A joint British and American operation to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet @-@ occupied zone had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956 . The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour , an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers . In October and November that year a popular uprising in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 To make Bond a more rounded character , Fleming put further aspects of his personality into his creation . The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that Bond 's " physical and mental ennui " is a reflection of Fleming 's poor health and low spirits when he wrote the book . Following on from the character development of Bond in his previous four novels , Fleming adds further background to Bond 's private life , largely around his home life and personal habits , with Bond 's introduction to the story seeing him at breakfast with his housekeeper , May . The novelist Raymond Benson — who later wrote a series of Bond novels — sees aspects of self @-@ doubt entering Bond 's mind with the " soft " life he has been leading when he is introduced in the book . Benson identifies Bond 's fear when the flight to Istanbul encounters severe turbulence from a storm , and notes Bond 's apparent nervousness when he first meets Romanova ; he seems concerned and guilty about his mission . The other characters in the book are also well developed , according to Benson . He considers that the head of the Turkish office , Darko Kerim Bey , is " one of Fleming 's more colourful characters " ; Kerim is a similar type of dependable and appealing ally that Fleming also created with Quarrel ( in Live and Let Die ) and Colombo ( in the short story " Risico " ) . Parker considers that Kerim is " an antidote " to Bond 's lethargy , while the essayist Umberto Eco sees the character as having some of the moral qualities of the villains in the series , but that those qualities are used in support of Bond . 
 From Russia , with Love is one of the few stories by Fleming in which the Soviets are the main enemy , although Eco considers Bond 's Russian opponents " so monstrous , so improbably evil that it seems impossible to take them seriously " . Fleming introduced what was a new development for him , a female opponent for Bond , although much like the former adversaries in the series , Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive , with poor hygiene and gross tastes . Eco — and Anthony Synnott , in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels — consider that despite Klebb being female , the character is more akin to a " sexually neuter " individual . Red Grant was Fleming 's first " psychotic opponent " for Bond , according to Benson . Charlie Higson — who later wrote the Young Bond series — finds Grant to be " a very modern villain : the relentless , remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a ' drowned man ' . " 
 = = Style = = 
 According to Higson , Fleming spent the first four novels changing the style of his books , and his approach to his characters , but in From Russia , with Love the author " finally hits on the classic Bond formula , and he happily moved into his most creative phase " . The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that the previous novels were , in essence , episodic detective stories , while From Russia , with Love is structured differently , with an " extended opening picture " that describes Grant , the Russians and Romanova before moving onto the main story and then bringing back some of the elements when least expected . The extensive prose that describes the Soviet opponents and the background to the mission takes up the first ten chapters of the book , and Bond is only introduced into the story in chapter eleven . Eco identifies that the opening passage introducing Red Grant is a " cleverly presented " beginning , similar to the opening of a film . Eco remarks that " Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill " . 
 Benson describes the " Fleming Sweep " as taking the reader from one chapter to another using " hooks " at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next . He feels that the " Fleming Sweep steadily propels the plot " of From Russia , with Love and , though it was the longest of Fleming 's novels , " the Sweep makes it seem half as long " . Kingsley Amis , who later wrote a Bond novel , considers that the story is " full of pace and conviction " , while Parker identifies " cracks " in the plot of the novel , but believes that " the action mov [ es ] fast enough for the reader to skim over them " . 
 Fleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism , which Amis calls " the Fleming effect " . Amis describes " the imaginative use of information , whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond 's world ... [ is ] bolted down to some sort of reality , or at least counter @-@ balanced . " 
 = = Themes = = 
 The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett consider that Fleming 's preface note — in which he informs readers that " a great deal of the background to this story is accurate " — indicates that in this novel " cold war tensions are most massively present , saturating the narrative from beginning to end " . As in Casino Royale , the concept of the loss of British power and influence during the post @-@ Second World War and Cold War period was also present in the novel . The journalist William Cook observes that , with the British Empire in decline " Bond pandered to Britain 's inflated and increasingly insecure self @-@ image , flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight . " Woollacott and Bennett agree , and maintain that " Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining . " In From Russia , with Love , this acknowledgement of decline manifested itself in Bond 's conversations with Darko Kerim when he admits that in England " we don 't show teeth any more — only gums . " 
 Woollacott and Bennett argue that in selecting Bond as the target for the Russians , he is " deemed the most consummate embodiment of the myth of England " . The literary critic Meir Sternberg sees the theme of Saint George and the Dragon running through several of the Bond stories , including From Russia , with Love . He sees Bond as Saint George — the patron saint of England — in the story , and notes that the opening chapter begins with an examination of a dragonfly as it flies over the supine body of Grant .

 From Russia , with Love was released in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957 , by the publishers Jonathan Cape . The American edition was published a few weeks later by Macmillan . In November 1956 the Prime Minister , Sir Anthony Eden , had visited Fleming 's Jamaican Goldeneye estate , to recuperate from a breakdown in his health . This was much reported in the British press , and the publication of From Russia , with Love was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming 's raised public profile . The serialisation of the story in The Daily Express in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book ; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later . In an article in Life on 17 March 1961 , the US President John F. Kennedy listed From Russia , with Love as one of his ten favourite books . This accolade , and its associated publicity , led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest @-@ selling crime writer in the US . There was a further boost to sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963 , which saw the sales of the Pan paperback rise from 145 @,@ 000 in 1962 to 642 @,@ 000 in 1963 and 600 @,@ 000 in 1964 . 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 From Russia , with Love received mainly positive reviews from critics . Julian Symons , in The Times Literary Supplement , considered that it was Fleming 's " <unk> , most exciting and most brilliant tale " , that the author " brings the thriller in line with modern emotional needs " , and that Bond " is the intellectual 's Mike Hammer : a killer with a keen eye and a soft heart for a woman " . The critic for The Times was less persuaded by the story , suggesting that " the general tautness and brutality of the story leave the reader uneasily hovering between fact and fiction " . Although the review compared Fleming in unflattering terms to Peter Cheyney , a crime fiction writer of the 1930s and 1940s , it concluded that From Russia , with Love was " exciting enough of its kind " . 
 The Observer 's critic , Maurice Richardson , thought that From Russia , with Love was a " stupendous plot to trap ... Bond , our deluxe cad @-@ clubman agent " and wondered " Is this the end of Bond ? " The reviewer for the Oxford Mail declared that " Ian Fleming is in a class by himself " , while the critic for The Sunday Times argued that " If a psychiatrist and a thoroughly efficient copywriter got together to produce a fictional character who would be the mid @-@ twentieth century subconscious male ambition , the result would inevitably be James Bond . " 
 Writing in The New York Times , Anthony Boucher — described by a Fleming biographer , John Pearson , as " throughout an avid anti @-@ Bond and an anti @-@ Fleming man " — was damning in his review , saying that From Russia , with Love was Fleming 's " longest and poorest book " . Boucher further wrote that the novel contained " as usual , sex @-@ cum @-@ sadism with a veneer of literacy but without the occasional brilliant setpieces " . The critic for the New York Herald Tribune , conversely , wrote that " Mr Fleming is intensely observant , acutely literate and can turn a cliché into a silk purse with astute alchemy " . Robert R Kirsch , writing in the Los Angeles Times , also disagreed with Boucher , saying that " the espionage novel has been brought up to date by a superb practitioner of that nearly lost art : Ian Fleming . " In Kirsch 's opinion , From Russia , with Love " has everything of the traditional plus the most modern refinements in the sinister arts of spying " . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 From Russia , with Love was serialised in The Daily Express from 1 April 1957 ; it was the first Bond novel the paper had adapted . In 1960 the novel was also adapted as a daily comic strip in the paper and was syndicated worldwide . The series , which ran from 3 February to 21 May 1960 , was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky . The comic strip was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books in the Dr. No anthology , which also included Diamonds Are Forever and Casino Royale . 
 The film From Russia with Love was released in 1963 , produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman , and directed by Terence Young . It was the second Bond film in the Eon Productions series and starred Sean Connery as Bond . The film version contained some changes to the novel , with the leading villains switching from SMERSH to SPECTRE , a fictional terrorist organisation . In the main it was a faithful adaptation of the novel ; the ending was changed to make clear Bond 's survival . Benson declares that " many fans consider it the best Bond film , simply because it is close to Fleming 's original story " . 
 In 2012 the novel was dramatised for radio by Archie Scottney , directed by Martin Jarvis and produced by Rosalind Ayres ; it featured a full cast starring Toby Stephens as James Bond and was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 . It continued the series of Bond radio adaptations featuring Jarvis and Stephens following Dr. No in 2008 and Goldfinger in 2010 .

 " Who 's That Chick ? " was written by David Guetta , Frédéric Riesterer , Giorgio Tuinfort and Kinda " Kee " Hamid . Production of the song was helmed by Guetta , Riesterer and Tuinfort . In an interview with Akshay Bhansali for MTV News , Guetta explained that the song was originally intended for inclusion on Rihanna 's fifth studio album , Loud ( 2010 ) , but that he decided to include it on the re @-@ release of his own album , One Love ( 2009 ) , when it did not make Loud 's final cut . Guetta revealed that he was asked to produce tracks for Loud , but did not have anything which he felt would compliment Rihanna . He stated that although two artists want to collaborate and are fans of each other , it does not always come to fruition . However , after brainstorming ideas for what he could produce for the singer , Guetta came up with an idea for a song called " Who 's That Chick ? " , and decided that it was " perfect " for Rihanna . 
 After he completed the demo , he pre @-@ viewed the song 's instrumental on a French radio station , but did not confirm which artist would contribute vocals . Guetta played the song to Rihanna whilst backstage at one of her Last Girl on Earth Tour ( 2010 – 11 ) concerts , to which Rihanna said " Yeah , I like it . " Guetta confessed that he felt as though the singer did not like it on first impressions and doubted it , but stated that after the concert , the singer told Guetta that she could not stop thinking about the song 's beat whilst she performed , and asked to record it . The final cut of the song was included on One More Love ( 2010 ) and Rihanna appeared as a featured artist . Guetta concluded the interview by saying that he felt " honored " to have worked with Rihanna . Prior to the release of Loud , Rihanna clarified via Twitter that " Who 's That Chick ?

In an interview for the Daily Star , Guetta addressed the song being removed from European radio stations playlists , saying " My record label sent letters to all the radio stations asking them to stop playing Who 's That Chick as Rihanna 's album was out at the same time . It was strange because normally record labels ask radio stations to play your music . "

He concluded his reviewing with " It 's a good job , then , that bopping along to this – and warming yourself up in the process – is pretty much impossible to resist .

Becky Bain for Idolator praised the song for not sounding as " generic " as Katy Perry 's releases " California Gurls " and " Teenage Dream " ( 2010 ) .

 Both the daytime and nighttime videos for " Who 's That Chick ? " are the same , however , the former features Rihanna in a " bright and bubbly " setting while the latter depicts a darker scenario . Before the song 's audio begins to play , the video begins with a view of outer space before it cuts to what appears to be the interior of a spaceship . Guetta is then shown to step out of an airlock where smoke surrounds him . Different shots of television screens and other spaceship hardware are shown before Guetta puts a CD into a CD player . At this moment , the song 's audio begins to play . Various video stills of Rihanna sitting down on a chair and surrounded by extras are intermittently shown one after the other . The majority of the video revolves around Rihanna and the extras dancing in a room , while various special effects are incorporated ; Guetta continues to observe the singer 's actions from a control room . In the daytime video , Rihanna wears a colorful outfit , and she wears a black outfit in the nighttime video . 
 Rap @-@ Up commented that by having the two different videos , it shows that " every good girl has a bad side . " Becky Bain for Idolator described the daytime video as " the super @-@ colorful cheery vid " and the nighttime video as a " macabre Halloween makeover .

 Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC . The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment , of the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom , and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will ( called <unk> ) that is in accord with nature . Because of this , the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life ( lex <unk> ) , and they thought that the best indication of an individual 's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved . To live a good life , one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature . 
 Later Stoics — such as Seneca and Epictetus — emphasized that , because " virtue is sufficient for happiness " , a sage was immune to misfortune . This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase " stoic calm " , though the phrase does not include the " radical ethical " Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free , and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious . 
 From its founding , Stoic doctrine was popular with a following in Roman Greece and throughout the Roman Empire — including the Emperor Marcus Aurelius — until the closing of all pagan philosophy schools in AD 529 by order of the Emperor Justinian I , who perceived them as being at odds with Christian faith . <unk> was a syncretic philosophical movement , joining Stoicism and Christianity , influenced by Justus Lipsius .

 The Stoics provided a unified account of the world , consisting of formal logic , monistic physics and naturalistic ethics . Of these , they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge , though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers . 
 Stoicism teaches the development of self @-@ control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions ; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason ( logos ) . A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual 's ethical and moral well @-@ being : " Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature . " This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships ; " to be free from anger , envy , and jealousy , " and to accept even slaves as " equals of other men , because all men alike are products of nature . " 
 The Stoic ethic espouses a deterministic perspective ; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue , Cleanthes once opined that the wicked man is " like a dog tied to a cart , and compelled to go wherever it goes . " A Stoic of virtue , by contrast , would amend his will to suit the world and remain , in the words of Epictetus , " sick and yet happy , in peril and yet happy , dying and yet happy , in exile and happy , in disgrace and happy , " thus positing a " completely autonomous " individual will , and at the same time a universe that is " a rigidly deterministic single whole " . This viewpoint was later described as " Classical <unk> " ( and was adopted by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza ) . 
 Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire , to the point where , in the words of Gilbert Murray " nearly all the successors of Alexander [ ... ] professed themselves Stoics . " 
 = = History = = 
 Beginning at around 301 BC , Zeno taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile ( i.e. , " the painted porch " ) , from which his philosophy got its name . Unlike the other schools of philosophy , such as the Epicureans , Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space , which was a colonnade overlooking the central gathering place of Athens , the Agora . 
 Zeno 's ideas developed from those of the Cynics , whose founding father , Antisthenes , had been a disciple of Socrates . Zeno 's most influential follower was Chrysippus , who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism . Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe , over which one has no direct control . 
 Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases : 
 Early Stoa , from the founding of the school by Zeno to Antipater . 
 Middle Stoa , including <unk> and Posidonius . 
 Late Stoa , including <unk> Rufus , Seneca , Epictetus , and Marcus Aurelius . 
 No complete work by any Stoic philosopher survives from the first two phases of Stoicism . Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive .
