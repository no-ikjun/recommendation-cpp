 = Zirconium = 
 Zirconium is a chemical element with symbol Zr and atomic number 40 . The name of zirconium is taken from the name of the mineral zircon , the most important source of zirconium . The word zircon comes from the Persian word <unk> <unk> , meaning " gold @-@ colored " . It is a lustrous , grey @-@ white , strong transition metal that resembles hafnium and , to a lesser extent , titanium . Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier , although small amounts are used as an alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion . Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride , respectively . Five isotopes occur naturally , three of which are stable . Zirconium compounds have no known biological role . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Zirconium is a lustrous , greyish @-@ white , soft , ductile and malleable metal that is solid at room temperature , though it is hard and brittle at lesser <unk> . In powder form , zirconium is highly flammable , but the solid form is much less prone to ignition . Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis , acids , salt water and other agents . However , it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid , especially when fluorine is present . Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35 K. 
 The melting point of zirconium is 1855 ° C ( <unk> ° F ) , and the boiling point is 4371 ° C ( 7900 ° F ) . Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1 @.@ 33 on the Pauling scale . Of the elements within d @-@ block , zirconium has the fourth lowest electronegativity after yttrium , lutetium and hafnium . 
 At room temperature zirconium exhibits a hexagonally close packed crystal structure , α @-@ Zr , which changes to β @-@ Zr a body @-@ centered cubic crystal structure at 863 ° C. Zirconium exists in the β @-@ phase until the melting point .

 Naturally occurring zirconium is composed of five isotopes . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are stable , although <unk> is predicted to undergo double beta decay ( not observed experimentally ) with a half @-@ life of more than 1 @.@ 10 × 1017 years . <unk> has a half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 4 × 1019 years , and is the longest @-@ lived radioisotope of zirconium . Of these natural isotopes , <unk> is the most common , making up 51 @.@ 45 % of all zirconium . <unk> is the least common , comprising only 2 @.@ 80 % of zirconium . 
 Twenty @-@ eight artificial isotopes of zirconium have been synthesized , ranging in atomic mass from 78 to 110 . <unk> is the longest @-@ lived artificial isotope , with a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 53 × 106 years . <unk> , the heaviest isotope of zirconium , is the most radioactive , with an estimated half @-@ life of 30 milliseconds . Radioactive isotopes at or above mass number 93 decay by β − , whereas those at or below 89 decay by β + . The only exception is <unk> , which decays by ε . 
 Five isotopes of zirconium also exist as metastable isomers : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Of these , <unk> has the shortest half @-@ life at 131 nanoseconds . <unk> is the longest lived with a half @-@ life of 4 @.@ 161 minutes .

 Zirconium has a concentration of about 130 mg / kg within the Earth 's crust and about 0 @.@ 026 μg / L in sea water . It is not found in nature as a native metal , reflecting its intrinsic instability with respect to water . The principal commercial source of zirconium is zircon ( ZrSiO4 ) , a silicate mineral , which is found primarily in Australia , Brazil , India , Russia , South Africa and the United States , as well as in smaller deposits around the world . As of 2013 , two @-@ thirds of zircon mining occurs in Australia and South Africa . Zircon resources exceed 60 million tonnes worldwide and annual worldwide zirconium production is approximately 900 @,@ 000 tonnes . Zirconium also occurs in more than 140 other minerals , including the commercially useful ores <unk> and <unk> . 
 Zr is relatively abundant in S @-@ type stars , and it has been detected in the sun and in meteorites . Lunar rock samples brought back from several Apollo missions to the moon have a high zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks . 
 = = Production = = 
 Zirconium is a by @-@ product of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile , as well as tin mining . From 2003 to 2007 , while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from $ 360 to $ 840 per tonne , the price for <unk> zirconium metal decreased from $ 39 @,@ 900 to $ 22 @,@ 700 per ton . Zirconium metal is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes are expensive . 
 Collected from coastal waters , zircon @-@ bearing sand is purified by spiral concentrators to remove lighter materials , which are then returned to the water because they are natural components of beach sand . Using magnetic separation , the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile are removed . 
 Most zircon is used directly in commercial applications , but a small percentage is converted to the metal . Most Zr metal is produced by the reduction of the zirconium ( IV ) chloride with magnesium metal in the Kroll process . Commercial @-@ quality zirconium for most uses still has a content of 1 % to 3 % hafnium . This contaminant is important only in nuclear applications . The resulting metal is sintered until sufficiently ductile for metalworking . 
 = = = Separation of zirconium and hafnium = = = 
 Commercial zirconium metal typically contains 1 – 2 @.@ 5 % of hafnium , which is not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar . Their neutron @-@ absorbing properties differ strongly , however , necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for nuclear reactors . Several separation schemes are in use . The liquid @-@ liquid extraction of the thiocyanate @-@ oxide derivatives exploits the fact that the hafnium derivative is slightly more soluble in methyl isobutyl ketone than in water . This method is used mainly in United States . 
 Zr and Hf can also be separated by fractional crystallization of potassium <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is less soluble in water than the analogous hafnium derivative . 
 Fractional distillation of the <unk> , also called extractive distillation , is used primarily in Europe . 
 The product of a quadruple <unk> ( vacuum arc melting ) process , combined with hot extruding and different rolling applications is cured using high @-@ pressure , high @-@ temperature gas <unk> . This produces reactor @-@ grade zirconium that is about 10 times more expensive than the hafnium @-@ contaminated commercial grade . 
 Hafnium must be removed from zirconium for nuclear applications because hafnium has a neutron absorption cross @-@ section 600 times greater than zirconium . The separated hafnium can be used for reactor control rods .

 Like other transition metals , zirconium forms a wide range of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes . In general , these compounds are colourless diamagnetic solids wherein Zr has the oxidation state IV + . Far fewer Zr ( III ) compounds are known , and Zr ( II ) is very rare . 
 = = = Oxides , nitrides and carbides = = = 
 The most common oxide is zirconium dioxide , ZrO2 , also known as zirconia . This colourless solid has exceptional fracture toughness and chemical resistance , especially in its cubic form . These properties make zirconia useful as a thermal barrier coating , although it is also a common diamond substitute .

Wailes and H. <unk> , is a metallocene used in organic synthesis for transformations of alkenes and alkynes . 
 Zirconium is also a component of some Ziegler @-@ Natta catalysts , used to produce polypropylene . This application exploits the ability of zirconium to reversibly form bonds to carbon . Most complexes of Zr ( II ) are derivatives of zirconocene , one example being ( C5Me5 ) <unk> ( CO ) 2 . 
 = = History = = 
 The zirconium @-@ containing mineral zircon and related minerals ( <unk> , hyacinth , <unk> , <unk> ) were mentioned in biblical writings . The mineral was not known to contain a new element until 1789 , when Klaproth analyzed a <unk> from the island of Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) . He named the new element <unk> ( zirconia ) . Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis , but failed . Zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube . 
 The crystal bar process ( also known as the Iodide Process ) , discovered by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925 , was the first industrial process for the commercial production of metallic zirconium . It involves the formation and subsequent thermal decomposition of zirconium tetraiodide , and was superseded in 1945 by the much cheaper Kroll process developed by William Justin Kroll , in which zirconium tetrachloride is reduced by magnesium : 
 ZrCl4 + 2 Mg → Zr + 2 MgCl2

 Most zircon is used directly in high temperature applications . This material is refractory , hard , and resistant to chemical attack . Because of these properties , zircon finds many applications , few of which are highly publicized . Its main use is as an opacifier , conferring a white , opaque appearance to ceramic materials . Because of its chemical resistance , zircon is also used in aggressive environments , such as moulds for molten metals . 
 Zirconium dioxide ( ZrO2 ) is used in laboratory crucibles , in metallurgical furnaces , and as a refractory material . Because it is mechanically strong and flexible , it can be sintered into ceramic knives and other blades . Zircon ( ZrSiO4 ) and the cubic zirconia ( ZrO2 ) are cut into gemstones for use in jewelry . 
 Zirconia is a component in some abrasives , such as grinding wheels and sandpaper . 
 = = = Metal = = = 
 A small fraction of the zircon is converted to the metal , which finds various niche applications . Because of zirconium 's excellent resistance to corrosion , it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments , such as surgical appliances , light filaments , and watch cases . The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes . The same property is ( probably ) the purpose of including Zr nano @-@ particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU @-@ 97 / B Combined Effects Bomb . 
 = = = = Nuclear applications = = = = 
 <unk> for nuclear reactor fuels consumes about 1 % of the zirconium supply , mainly in the form of <unk> . The desired properties of these alloys are a low neutron @-@ capture cross @-@ section and resistance to corrosion under normal service conditions . Efficient methods for removing the hafnium impurities were developed to serve this purpose . 
 One disadvantage of zirconium alloys is that zirconium reacts with water at high temperatures , producing hydrogen gas and accelerated degradation of the fuel rod cladding : 
 Zr + 2 H2O → ZrO2 + 2 H2 
 This exothermic reaction is very slow below 100 ° C , but at temperature above 900 ° C the reaction is rapid . Most metals undergo similar reactions . The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures . This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979 , but at that time , the containment building was not damaged . The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1 , 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant ( Japan ) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11 , 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents . After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors , the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded , severely damaging the installations and at least one of the containment buildings . To avoid explosion , the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option . Now , to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor ( PWR ) containment buildings , a catalyst @-@ based <unk> is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises .

Until recently , radiolabeling with 89Zr was a complicated procedure requiring multiple steps . In 2001 – 2003 an improved multistep procedure was developed using a <unk> derivative of <unk> B ( N @-@ <unk> ) as a <unk> chelate , and a better way of binding 89Zr to <unk> was reported in 2009 .

 Zirconium binds urea , a property that has been utilized extensively to the benefit of patients with chronic kidney disease . For example , zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent <unk> regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system , which was first introduced in 1973 . More than 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system . Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives , new sorbent @-@ based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Renal Solutions developed the <unk> technology , a portable , low water dialysis system . Also , developmental versions of a <unk> Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent @-@ based technologies .

 Short @-@ term exposure to zirconium powder can cause irritation , but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention . Persistent exposure to zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs . However , in a study of 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~ 4 % zirconium oxide , there were no adverse effects on growth rate , blood and urine parameters , or mortality . The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) legal limit ( permissible exposure limit ) for zirconium exposure is 5 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) recommended exposure limit ( REL ) is 5 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday and a short term limit of 10 mg / m3 . At levels of 25 mg / m3 , zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health . However , zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard . Furthermore , reports of zirconium @-@ related adverse reactions are rare and , in general , rigorous cause @-@ and @-@ effect relationships have not been established . No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic . 
 Among the numerous radioactive isotopes of zirconium , <unk> is among the most common .

For a few years , the <unk> flew from Michigan to Los Angeles for auditions when his talent agency called , and returned to Grand Rapids for school sometimes the same day . Lautner balanced karate and acting with being on the football and baseball teams at his school , and taking up jazz and hip @-@ hop dance . After that became tiring , Lautner and his family decided to move to California for a month , to try it out , before moving to Santa Clarita , California , permanently in 2002 .

 In his first months after moving to Los Angeles , Lautner appeared in small television roles , small film roles , and ads and commercials . In 2001 , Lautner first appeared in the made @-@ for @-@ television film , Shadow Fury . He then got a voice @-@ over job in a commercial for Rugrats Go Wild . He then appeared in small television roles on The Bernie Mac Show , My Wife and Kids , and Summerland . Lautner then earned voice @-@ over roles in animated series such as Danny Phantom , Duck Dodgers , and What 's New , Scooby @-@ Doo ? . The same year , he earned his first breakout role , starring in the film , The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3 @-@ D. Lautner spent three months on location in Austin , Texas , to film the movie , which was received with negative reviews from critics , and was a minor international success . However , Lautner was nominated at the 2006 Young Artist Awards for Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Actor . For the film , Lautner choreographed all of his fight scenes after director Robert Rodríguez learned of his extensive martial arts training . Months later , he played Eliot Murtaugh in Cheaper by the Dozen 2 , which was panned by critics , being named one of the " Worst Films of the 2000s " by Rotten Tomatoes . After returning from Canada filming the latter movie , Lautner said he realized his newfound fame , from Sharkboy and Lavagirl . In 2008 he appeared in the show Love Inc. and the TV special He 's a Bully , Charlie Brown . Two years later , Lautner appeared in a lead role in the short @-@ lived NBC drama , My Own Worst Enemy , portraying Christian Slater 's son , Jack Spivey . Rolling Stone coined his early roles as either " the popular kid , jock , or bully . "

 In 2007 , filmmakers began a search for actors to portray Jacob Black , a Native American friend of lead character Bella Swan in Twilight , the first film in the The Twilight Saga film series . In January 2008 , an open casting call was held in Portland , Oregon . Lautner had not heard of the Twilight series before , but was urged by his agent to audition . At his audition , he read lines with Kristen Stewart , who had already been cast as Bella , and they acted out scenes from The Twilight Saga : New Moon and The Twilight Saga : Eclipse . The film was a commercial success , earning $ 69 million its opening weekend , and has grossed $ 392 million worldwide . It received mixed reviews from critics , having a " Rotten " rating with a weighted average of 5 @.@ 5 / 10 . In describing the critical consensus , it stated : " Having lost much of its bite transitioning to the big screen , Twilight will please its devoted fans , but do little for the uninitiated . " On Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics , it has an average score of 56 from the 37 reviews . At the 2009 MTV Movie Awards , Lautner was nominated for Male Breakthrough Performance , which was won by co @-@ star Robert Pattinson . 
 Initially , director Chris Weitz wanted to recast the role of Jacob Black for Twilight 's sequel , The Twilight Saga : New Moon , due to the major physical changes that occur in Black between the two novels , and have an actor that would accurately portray " the new , larger Jacob Black . " Black 's role in the novel also increases significantly , with him falling in love with Bella and becoming a werewolf , putting the actor in a starring role . Representatives for Weitz had stated that they were make a full effort to recast the " high @-@ profile gig , " and MTV News confirmed that Weitz was looking at Michael <unk> to take on the role ; however , Summit Entertainment said a decision had not been made . In an attempt to keep the role , Lautner weight @-@ trained extensively and gained approximately 30 pounds of muscle . In January 2009 , Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue to play the role of Jacob in the sequel . In an interview , fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner 's transformation saying , " He 's an entirely different person physically . " Stewart later said , " He gets a lot of attention because he 's buff , but I think as soon as the movie comes out , people are going to realize that 's not why he got the job . " Co @-@ star Robert Pattinson said after seeing Lautner 's body , " I saw him and thought ' Jesus , I 'm going to get fired . " In an interview with The Wrap , Weitz said Lautner deserved a lot of credit for the movie 's box office , stating , " If you look at the movie , it should have been the weakest in the franchise , because Robert Pattinson doesn 't play as big a role . " Weitz said Lautner had to " pick up that slack , and if his character hadn 't been emotionally , not just physically , appealing , the movie wouldn 't have been as big a hit . " The commercial performance of the film outpaced the first film , setting several box office records including the biggest midnight opening in the United States and Canada and the biggest single @-@ day opening . The opening weekend of New Moon is the third highest opening weekend in domestic history with $ 142 @,@ 839 @,@ 137 . The Twilight Saga : New Moon also has the sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $ 274 @.@ 9 million total . Critical reception was less favorable , with the movie getting a 4 @.@ 6 / 10 average from Rotten Tomatoes , and a 44 on Metacritic . Lautner won Favorite Breakout Movie Actor at the 35th People 's Choice Awards . 
 Although it began after the release of the first film , upon release of New Moon , Lautner and his co @-@ stars Stewart and Pattinson transitioned to teen idol status , with Lautner particularly admired by teens for his new physical characteristics , becoming a sex symbol . The trio appeared on many covers and televised appearances together . In between the second and third films in the Twilight series , Lautner was a part of the ensemble cast in the movie Valentine 's Day as Willy Harrington , acting alongside his rumored girlfriend at the time , American country pop singer Taylor Swift . The duo was nominated at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss . Although it received generally negative reviews , the film grossed $ 213 million and had the second biggest opening in the United States for a romantic comedy film . Lautner presented at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the 82nd Academy Awards . Lautner hosted Saturday Night Live on December 12 , 2009 , making him one of the youngest celebrity hosts in the show 's history .

 Lautner returned for the third Twilight film , The Twilight Saga : Eclipse , in 2010 . Receiving mixed reviews from critics , the film surpassed its predecessor to become the highest @-@ grossing film of the franchise and the highest @-@ grossing romantic fantasy , werewolf and vampire movie of all time at the American and Canadian box office . It ranks as the 36th highest grossing film of all @-@ time in the U.S. and Canada . The popularity of Lautner and his cast members continued to summit , especially via the " Team Edward vs. Team Jacob " campaign that promoted the film . Lautner 's fanbase also began to expand to older audiences . Lautner won Best Fantasy Actor at the 2010 Scream Awards , and he is nominated for Favorite Movie Actor for his role in Eclipse at the 37th People 's Choice Awards . On November 2010 The Hollywood Reporter named Lautner as one of the young male actors who are " pushing – or being pushed " into taking over Hollywood as the new " A @-@ List " . 
 Lautner was initially supposed to be in two films , Northern Lights and a movie based on Max Steel , but pulled out of both films due to scheduling conflicts and better offers . Other planned projects were the lead in a movie about Stretch Armstrong and a hostage thriller , Cancun . Lautner filmed a Bourne Identity @-@ esque spy film with Lily Collins , entitled Abduction . It was released in September 2011 to universally negative reviews from critics and Lautner 's performance was heavily criticised . He appeared in the remaining parts of the Twilight series , the The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn films , which were released over a two @-@ year period from 2011 – 2012 . 
 In 2010 , Lautner was considered to be the highest @-@ paid teen actor in Hollywood . In February 2014 , it was confirmed that Lautner would be joining the BBC Three comedy series Cuckoo , replacing Andy Samberg . Lautner continued in this role for two years , co @-@ starring in the BBC comedy for three series . On the 23rd of June 2016 it was announced that Lautner had been cast in the Ryan Murphy comedy horror series Scream Queens .

 Publications such as GQ , Rolling Stone , and People have referred to Lautner as a sex symbol , with the latter publication calling the actor a future epitome of pop culture . He has been called the new young adult star that can " both woo the girls with his intensity and impress the boys with his rugged agility . " According to Mickey Rapkin of GQ , the use of Lautner 's physique in films has been compared to Megan Fox in her work . After his massive physical change following Twilight , Lautner became a tabloid teen idol with his co @-@ stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart . Lautner , determined to stay in the series , worked out every day and gained over 30 pounds ( 14 kg ) of muscle in order to bulk up for the role of Jacob Black in the remaining films in the The Twilight Saga . Michelle Lanz of MSN Wonderwall said that Lautner 's change may have saved his career . Several critics credit Lautner 's physical characteristics for much of the success of the Twilight series , with critic Sharon Waxman stating , " as a tabloid teen idol , he certainly deserves some credit for New Moon 's $ 700 million worldwide gross . " Lautner 's abs in particular have been subject to media attention , with The Wrap stating that companies bidding for the actor in movies in 2011 would " shell out for the young actor 's much @-@ on @-@ display though mostly untried abs . " Mickey Rapkin of GQ said , " the film 's marketing issues were solved when Lautner 's " abdominal muscles became New Moon 's main talking point , not to mention his calling card . " He was named number one on Access Hollywood 's " Top 5 Hollywood Abs " list . 
 Before the actor turned 18 , his sexualized image was often critiqued , and subject to controversy . In December 2009 , Lautner appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in a wet T @-@ shirt . Jennifer Cady of E ! Online said to wait a few months when Lautner would " be of age , which will make this whole operation you got going on completely legal . " In his interview with the magazine , after declining to talk about whether he was dating Taylor Swift , the magazine pressed Lautner on rumors of him being homosexual , which he brushed off . Brent Hartinger , a columnist for AfterElton , blasted the magazine , calling the questioning " unimaginably irresponsible , " commenting that Lautner was just " a 17 @-@ year old kid " and that while the rumors were baseless and speculation from certain blogs and fans , it was disappointing that a " legitimate media outlet " would print gossip . Hartinger said the magazine reached a " new low " and did not have common decency , noting that the line between child and adult " is there for a good reason " . 
 Lautner has stated that he does not want to be just known for his looks , as some have attributed his popularity to that and not his actual acting skill . In an interview , the actor revealed that he was originally supposed to have a baring scene in the movie Valentine 's Day . He stated , " The script said we were walking into school and Willy takes off his shirt . I said , ' Whoa , whoa , whoa . Time out . He 's gonna take off his shirt in the middle of school ? No , no , no . The reason I took off my shirt for New Moon is because it 's written in the book that way . And there 's reasons behind it . " Lautner later said he would not bare his chest for any role that did not call for it . In June 2010 , Lautner covered GQ magazine . The actor was lampooned in conservative writer Laura Ingraham 's satirical The Obama Diaries , commenting to have Lautner as a mascot for the White House Easter Egg Roll , to fit their health @-@ conscious theme , and have Lautner don a furry bunny head and appear shirtless . In 2010 , Lautner was ranked number two on Glamour 's " 50 Sexiest Men of 2010 " list . Men 's Health ranked him at third on their list of " Top 10 Summer Bodies . " Additionally in 2010 , he was ranked fourth on People 's " Most Amazing Bodies " list . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Lautner has an intricate workout plan , which was covered by Men 's Health , and has a specific diet after developing his body for The Twilight Saga : New Moon . In addition , he still practices and trains in martial arts regularly . He has stated that he is drug and alcohol free . 
 Lautner resides with his parents and younger sister in Valencia , California , which he says he prefers because of the paparazzi . Lautner has said that he has never thought of moving out on his own , stating , " The thing I love is that my home life hasn 't changed . I still help out with the garbage . I still help out with the lawn . " He owns a BMW 5 series , with dark @-@ tinted windows intended to provide anonymity . 
 The boost given to his career by the success of the Twilight films made him too busy to attend school , so he took the California High School Proficiency Exam to graduate from high school in 2008 . He has stated on Late Show with David Letterman that if he does not have work , he would like to go back to school . In 2010 , he stated that " I finished high school and enrolled in my local community college " .

 = Hepatorenal syndrome = 
 Hepatorenal syndrome ( often abbreviated HRS ) is a life @-@ threatening medical condition that consists of rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure . HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed , although various treatments , such as dialysis , can prevent advancement of the condition . 
 HRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis ( regardless of cause ) , severe alcoholic hepatitis , or fulminant liver failure , and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of an acute insult such as an infection , bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract , or overuse of diuretic medications . HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis , occurring in 18 % of cirrhotics within one year of their diagnosis , and in 39 % of cirrhotics within five years of their diagnosis . Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines , altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys . The kidney failure of HRS is a consequence of these changes in blood flow , rather than direct damage to the kidney . The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition . Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been defined : Type 1 HRS entails a rapidly progressive decline in kidney function , while type 2 HRS is associated with ascites ( fluid accumulation in the abdomen ) that does not improve with standard diuretic medications . 
 The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high ; the mortality of individuals with type 1 HRS is over 50 % over the short term , as determined by historical case series . The only long @-@ term treatment option for the condition is liver transplantation . While awaiting transplantation , people with HRS often receive other treatments that improve the abnormalities in blood vessel tone , including supportive care with medications , or the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS ) , which is a small shunt placed to reduce blood pressure in the portal vein . Some patients may require hemodialysis to support kidney function , or a newer technique called liver dialysis which uses a dialysis circuit with albumin @-@ bound membranes to bind and remove toxins normally cleared by the liver , providing a means of extracorporeal liver support until transplantation can be performed . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Hepatorenal syndrome is a particular and common type of kidney failure that affects individuals with liver cirrhosis or , less commonly , with fulminant liver failure . The syndrome involves constriction of the blood vessels of the kidneys and dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation , which supplies the intestines . The classification of hepatorenal syndrome identifies two categories of kidney failure , termed type 1 and type 2 HRS , which both occur in individuals with either cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure . In both categories , the deterioration in kidney function is quantified either by an elevation in creatinine level in the blood , or by decreased clearance of creatinine in the urine . 
 = = = Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome = = = 
 Type 1 HRS is characterized by rapidly progressive kidney failure , with a doubling of serum creatinine to a level greater than 221 μmol / L ( 2 @.@ 5 mg / dL ) or a halving of the creatinine clearance to less than 20 mL / min over a period of less than two weeks . The prognosis of individuals with type 1 HRS is particularly grim , with a mortality rate exceeding 50 % after one month . Patients with type 1 HRS are usually ill , may have low blood pressure , and may require therapy with drugs to improve the strength of heart muscle contraction ( <unk> ) or other drugs to maintain blood pressure ( vasopressors ) . 
 = = = Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome = = = 
 In contrast , type 2 HRS is slower in onset and progression . It is defined by an increase in serum creatinine level to > 133 μmol / L ( 1 @.@ 5 mg / dL ) or a creatinine clearance of less than 40 mL / min , and a urine sodium < 10 μmol / L. It also carries a poor outlook , with a median survival of approximately six months unless the affected individual undergoes liver transplantation . Type 2 HRS is thought to be part of a spectrum of illness associated with increased pressures in the portal vein circulation , which begins with the development of fluid in the abdomen ( ascites ) . The spectrum continues with diuretic @-@ resistant ascites , where the kidneys are unable to excrete sufficient sodium to clear the fluid even with the use of diuretic medications . Most individuals with type 2 HRS have diuretic @-@ resistant ascites before they develop deterioration in kidney function . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Both types of hepatorenal syndrome share three major components : altered liver function , abnormalities in circulation , and kidney failure . As these phenomena may not necessarily produce symptoms until late in their course , individuals with hepatorenal syndrome are typically diagnosed with the condition on the basis of altered laboratory tests . Most people who develop HRS have cirrhosis , and may have signs and symptoms of the same , which can include jaundice , altered mental status , evidence of decreased nutrition , and the presence of ascites . Specifically , the production of ascites that is resistant to the use of diuretic medications is characteristic of type 2 HRS . <unk> , which is a decrease in urine volume , may occur as a consequence of kidney failure ; however , some individuals with HRS continue to produce a normal amount of urine . As these signs and symptoms may not necessarily occur in HRS , they are not included in the major and minor criteria for making a diagnosis of this condition ; instead HRS is diagnosed in an individual at risk for the condition on the basis of the results of laboratory tests , and the exclusion of other causes . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Hepatorenal syndrome usually affects individuals with cirrhosis and elevated pressures in the portal vein system ( termed portal hypertension ) . While HRS may develop in any type of cirrhosis , it is most common in individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis , particularly if there is concomitant alcoholic hepatitis identifiable on liver biopsies . HRS can also occur in individuals without cirrhosis , but with acute onset of liver failure , termed fulminant liver failure . 
 Certain precipitants of HRS have been identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure . These include bacterial infection , acute alcoholic hepatitis , or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract . Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , which is the infection of ascites fluid , is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals . HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease : iatrogenic precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of diuretic medications or the removal of large volumes of <unk> fluid by paracentesis from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 There can be many causes of kidney failure in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure . Consequently , it is a challenge to distinguish hepatorenal syndrome from other entities that cause kidney failure in the setting of advanced liver disease . As a result , additional major and minor criteria have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome . 
 The major criteria include liver disease with portal hypertension ; kidney failure ; the absence of shock , infection , recent treatment with medications that affect the function of the kidney ( <unk> ) , and fluid losses ; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1 @.@ 5 litres of intravenous normal saline ; the absence of proteinuria ( protein in the urine ) ; and , the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on ultrasound . 
 The minor criteria are the following : a low urine volume ( less than 500 mL ( 18 imp fl oz ; 17 US fl oz ) per day ) , low sodium concentration in the urine , a urine osmolality that is greater than that in the blood , the absence of red blood cells in the urine , and a serum sodium concentration of less than 130 mmol / L. 
 Many other diseases of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome . Individuals with pre @-@ renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys , but as in individuals with HRS , have kidney dysfunction due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys . Also , similarly to HRS , pre @-@ renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration . In contrast to HRS , however , pre @-@ renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids , resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium . Acute tubular necrosis ( ATN ) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney , and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis , because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure . Because of the damage to the tubules , ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine . As a result , ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing , as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS ; however , this may not always be the case in cirrhotics . Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy @-@ brown casts in the urine on microscopy , whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material , as the kidneys have not been directly injured . Some viral infections of the liver , including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney . Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity ( notably the antibiotic <unk> ) or contrast nephropathy , caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 The kidney failure in hepatorenal syndrome is believed to arise from abnormalities in blood vessel tone in the kidneys . The predominant theory ( termed the <unk> theory ) is that blood vessels in the kidney circulation are constricted because of the dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation ( which supplies the intestines ) , which is mediated by factors released by liver disease . Nitric oxide , prostaglandins , and other vasoactive substances have been hypothesized as powerful mediators of splanchnic vasodilation in cirrhosis . The consequence of this phenomenon is a decrease in the " effective " volume of blood sensed by the <unk> apparatus , leading to the secretion of renin and the activation of the renin @-@ angiotensin system , which results in the vasoconstriction of vessels systemically and in the kidney specifically . However , the effect of this is insufficient to counteract the mediators of vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation , leading to persistent " <unk> " of the kidney circulation and worsening kidney vasoconstriction , leading to kidney failure . 
 Studies to quantify this theory have shown that there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome , but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced , suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure . Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes , including atrial <unk> factor , <unk> , thromboxane A2 , and endotoxin . In addition to this , it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation ( such as <unk> , <unk> , and octreotide ) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate ( which is a quantitative measure of kidney function ) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome , providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis . 
 The <unk> theory involves activation of the renin @-@ angiotensin @-@ aldosterone system , which leads to an increase in absorption of sodium from the kidney tubule ( termed renal sodium avidity ) mediated by aldosterone , which acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal convoluted tubule . This is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of ascites in cirrhotics as well . It has been hypothesized that the progression from ascites to hepatorenal syndrome is a spectrum where splanchnic vasodilation defines both resistance to diuretic medications in ascites ( which is commonly seen in type 2 HRS ) and the onset of kidney vasoconstriction ( as described above ) leading to hepatorenal syndrome . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high ; consequently , there is a significant emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS , and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS . As infection ( specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis , and are common triggers for HRS , specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications to prevent HRS . Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable . The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided . In addition , many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications ( such as some antibiotics ) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS . Also , large volume paracentesis — which is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort — may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS , and should be avoided in individuals at risk . The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large volume paracentesis , and may prevent HRS . Conversely , in individuals with very tense ascites , it has been hypothesized that removal of <unk> fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins . 
 Individuals with ascites that have become infected spontaneously ( termed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or SBP ) are at an especially high risk for the development of HRS . In individuals with SBP , one randomized controlled trial found that the administration of intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on the third day in hospital reduced both the rate of kidney insufficiency and the mortality rate . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 = = = Transplantation = = = 
 The definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation , and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation . While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS , the mortality of individuals with HRS has been shown to be as high as 25 % within the first month after transplantation . Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction ( quantified as <unk> scores above 36 ) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation . A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies ; however , this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys , and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as <unk> and <unk> that are known to worsen kidney function . Over the long @-@ term , however , individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function , and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS . 
 In anticipation of liver transplantation ( which may be associated with considerable in @-@ hospital delay ) , several other strategies have been found to be beneficial in preserving kidney function . These include the use of intravenous albumin infusion , medications ( for which the best evidence is for analogues of vasopressin , which causes splanchnic vasoconstriction ) , radiological shunts to decrease pressure in the portal vein , dialysis , and a specialized albumin @-@ bound membrane dialysis system termed molecular adsorbents recirculation system ( MARS ) or liver dialysis . 
 = = = Medical therapy = = = 
 Many major studies showing improvement in kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have involved expansion of the volume of the plasma with albumin given intravenously . The quantity of albumin administered intravenously varies : one cited regimen is 1 gram of albumin per kilogram of body weight intravenously on the first day , followed by 20 to 40 grams daily . Notably , studies have shown that treatment with albumin alone is inferior to treatment with other medications in conjunction with albumin ; most studies evaluating pre @-@ transplant therapies for HRS involve the use of albumin in conjunction with other medical or procedural treatment . 
 <unk> is an alpha @-@ agonist and octreotide is an analogue of somatostatin , a hormone involved in regulation of blood vessel tone in the gastrointestinal tract . The medications are respectively systemic <unk> and inhibitors of splanchnic vasodilation , and were not found to be useful when used individually in treatment of hepatorenal syndrome . However , one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement in kidney function when the two were used together ( with <unk> given orally , octreotide given subcutaneously and both dosed according to blood pressure ) , with three patients surviving to discharge . Another <unk> , observational study of individuals with HRS treated with subcutaneous octreotide and oral <unk> showed that there was increased survival at 30 days . 
 The vasopressin analogue <unk> was found in a number of studies to be useful in improvement of kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome , but has been limited in its use , as it can cause severe ischemia to major organs . <unk> is a vasopressin analogue that has been found in one large study to be useful for improving kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome with a lesser incidence of ischemia but is not available in the United States . A key criticism of all of these medical therapies has been heterogeneity in the populations investigated and the use of kidney function , instead of mortality , as an outcome measure . 
 Other agents that have been investigated for use in treatment of HRS include <unk> , acetylcysteine , and <unk> . The evidence for all of these therapies is based on either case series , or in the case of <unk> , extrapolated from a subset of patients treated for alcoholic hepatitis . 
 = = = Procedural treatments = = = 
 A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS ) involves the decompression of the high pressures in the portal circulation by placing a small stent between a portal and hepatic vein . This is done through radiologically guided catheters which are passed into the hepatic vein either through the internal jugular vein or the femoral vein . Theoretically , a decrease in portal pressures is thought to reverse the hemodynamic phenomena that ultimately lead to the development of hepatorenal syndrome . TIPS has been shown to improve kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome . Complications of TIPS for treatment of HRS include the worsening of hepatic encephalopathy ( as the procedure involves the forced creation of a <unk> @-@ systemic shunt , effectively bypassing the ability of the liver to clear toxins ) , inability to achieve adequate reduction in portal pressure , and bleeding . 
 Liver dialysis involves extracorporeal dialysis to remove toxins from the circulation , usually through the addition of a second dialysis circuit that contains an albumin @-@ bound membrane . The molecular adsorbents recirculation system ( MARS ) has shown some utility as a bridge to transplantation in patients with hepatorenal syndrome , yet the technique is still nascent . 
 Renal replacement therapy may be required to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation , although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used . The use of dialysis , however , does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS , and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place . In patients who undergo hemodialysis , there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS , although appropriate studies have yet to be performed . As a result , the role of renal replacement therapy in patients with HRS remains unclear . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 As the majority of individuals with hepatorenal syndrome have cirrhosis , much of the epidemiological data on HRS comes from the cirrhotic population . The condition is quite common : approximately 10 % of individuals admitted to hospital with ascites have HRS . A retrospective case series of cirrhotic patients treated with <unk> suggested that 20 @.@ 0 % of acute kidney failure in cirrhotics was due to type 1 HRS , and 6 @.@ 6 % was due to type 2 HRS . It is estimated that 18 % of individuals with cirrhosis and ascites will develop HRS within one year of their diagnosis with cirrhosis , and 39 % of these individuals will develop HRS within five years of diagnosis . Three independent risk factors for the development of HRS in cirrhotics have been identified : liver size , plasma renin activity , and serum sodium concentration . 
 The prognosis of these patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival . The severity of liver disease ( as evidenced by the <unk> score ) has been shown to be a determinant of outcome . Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS , with an incidence of about 20 % seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis .

 The first reports of kidney failure occurring in individuals with chronic liver diseases were from the late 19th century by <unk> and Flint . However , the hepatorenal syndrome was first defined as acute kidney failure that occurred in the setting of biliary surgery . The syndrome was soon re @-@ associated with advanced liver disease , and , in the 1950s , was clinically defined by Sherlock , Hecker , <unk> and <unk> as being associated with systemic hemodynamic abnormalities and high mortality . Hecker and Sherlock specifically identified that individuals with HRS had low urinary output , very low sodium in the urine , and no protein in the urine . Murray Epstein was the first to characterize splanchnic vasodilation and kidney vasoconstriction as the key alterations in hemodynamics in patients with the syndrome . The functional nature of the kidney impairment in HRS was crystallized by studies demonstrating that kidneys transplanted from patients with hepatorenal syndrome returned to function in the new host , leading to the hypothesis that hepatorenal syndrome was a systemic condition and not a kidney disease . The first systematic attempt to define hepatorenal syndrome was made in 1994 by the International <unk> Club , a group of liver specialists . The more recent history of HRS has involved elucidation of the various vasoactive mediators that cause the splanchnic and kidney blood flow abnormalities of the condition . 
 = J. R. Kealoha = 
 J. R. Kealoha ( died March 5 , 1877 ) was an American Union Army soldier of Native Hawaiian descent . Considered one of the " Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War " , he was among a group of more than one hundred documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii @-@ born combatants who fought in the American Civil War while the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi was still an independent nation . 
 Kealoha enlisted in the 41st United States Colored Infantry , a United States Colored regiment formed in Pennsylvania . Participating in the Siege of Petersburg , he and another Hawaiian soldier met the Hawaii @-@ born Colonel Samuel Chapman Armstrong , who recorded their encounter in a letter home . With the 41st USCT , Kealoha was present at the unconditional surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 . After the war , Kealoha returned to Hawaiʻi . He died on March 5 , 1877 , and was buried in an unmarked grave in Honolulu 's Oʻahu Cemetery . 
 For a period of time after the end of the war , the legacy and contributions of Kealoha and other documented Hawaiian participants in the American Civil War were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians . However , there has been a revival of interest in recent years in the Hawaiian community . In 2010 , these " Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War " were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu . And in 2014 , through another local effort , a grave marker was dedicated over the burial site of J. R. Kealoha which had stayed unmarked for 137 years . 
 = = Life = = 
 After the outbreak of the American Civil War , the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi under King Kamehameha IV declared its neutrality on August 26 , 1861 . Many Native Hawaiians and Hawaii @-@ born Americans ( mainly descendants of American missionaries ) abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy . Native Hawaiians participating in the American wars during its period of independence was not unheard of . Individual Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812 , and even more served during the American Civil War . Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaiʻi 's ties to New England through its missionaries and the whaling industries , and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of slavery . 
 Nothing is known about the life of J. R. Kealoha before the war . He enlisted in 1864 as a private and was assigned to the 41st Regiment United States Colored Troops ( USCT ) , a colored regiment formed in Camp William Penn , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , between September 30 and December 7 of 1864 under the command of Colonel Llewellyn F. Haskell . Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to the colored regiments because of their dark skin color and the segregationist policy in the military at the time . Kealoha is one of the few Hawaiian soldiers of the Civil War whose real name is known ; many combatants served under anglicized pseudonyms ( nome de guerre ) because they were easier for English @-@ speaking Americans to pronounce than Hawaiian language names . They were often registered as <unk> , the 19th @-@ century term for Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders , with the " Sandwich Islands " ( i.e. Hawaiʻi ) noted as their place of origin . 
 From October 1864 to April 1865 , Kealoha fought in the Richmond – Petersburg Campaign , which is better @-@ known as the Siege of Petersburg . During the campaign , Kealoha and another Hawaiian named Kaiwi , of the 28th Regiment United States Colored Troops , came across Samuel Chapman Armstrong , a son of an American missionary and a native of Maui . Armstrong wrote of the encounter in a letter home that was later published in the Hawaiian missionary newspaper The Friend in 1865 : 
 Yesterday , as my orderly was holding my horse , I asked him where he was from . He said he was from Hawaii ! He proved to be a full @-@ blood Kanaka , by the name of Kealoha , who came from the Islands last year . There is also another , by the name of Kaiwi , who lived near Judge Smith 's , who left the Islands last July . I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good <unk> in kanaka . Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops , and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th <unk> , in the pioneer corps . Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me . 
 Kealoha survived months of trench warfare during the Richmond @-@ Petersburg Campaign and fought with the 41st USCT at the Battle of Appomattox Court House ; he was present at the unconditional surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 . The 41st USCT regiment was mustered out of service November 10 , 1865 at Brownsville , Texas and was discharged December 14 , 1865 at Philadelphia . Kealoha 's enlistment of service are not present in any existing records or history from the 41st USCT regiment . Historians Justin Vance and Anita Manning speculate that " it is possible that his service is noted under a different name " or his name was never recorded because only the muster @-@ out rolls from the regiment were returned to the Adjutant General 's office after the unit disbanded . 
 After the war , Kealoha returned to Hawaiʻi . He died on March 5 , 1877 , and was buried with eighteen other Native Hawaiians in an unmarked grave in Section 1 , Lot 56 of the Oʻahu Cemetery , Honolulu . During the Hawaii Territorial period , Kealoha 's Civil War service was recorded by the United Veterans Service Council ( <unk> ) , a precursor of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs , which included his name in their records as a " Deceased Veterans " and listed the location of his burial place . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 For 137 years , Kealoha 's burial site remained unmarked until a Hawaiian group affiliated with the organization Hawaiʻi Civil War Round Table , consisting of Anita Manning , Nanette Napoleon , Eric Mueller , and Justin Vance , started an effort to give him a grave marker . Historian Anita Manning , a member of this group , had discovered the records containing Kealoha 's name at the Hawaii State Archives in 2011 . It listed his service in the war and the location of his burial place , but when Manning went to the site of his grave , she was disappointed by the <unk> of a headstone . Giving the reason for the significance of Kealoha 's service , Manning stated : 
 Kealoha represents many Hawaiian men and men from Hawaii who served in the Civil War who knew what they were getting into , who took a risk , and we all are the beneficiaries of that work and risk that they took [ . ] ... We owe it to them to recognize that service . 
 The group petitioned the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for a marker for Kealoha but the Department denied the request because there was no next of kin to approve the request . A 2009 policy change enacted in 2012 required that only next of kin could request VA memorials . After the request 's denial , Honor Life Memorials , a local monument maker , donated a granite marker for Kealoha . 
 The marker was formally dedicated and unveiled on October 25 , 2014 . Members of the Hawaiʻi Civil War Round Table and others dressed in period costumes took part in the dedication ceremony at Oʻahu Cemetery . The ceremony was marked by military honors and a gun salute by a unit of Civil War re @-@ enactors . Hawaiian minister Kahu Silva presided over the dedication ceremony , and in accordance with traditional Hawaiian customs , the consecrated marker was adorned with a sacred <unk> lei and a koa branch , representing " Kealoha 's noble qualities of bravery , courage and valor . " The marker is inscribed with his name , regiment , death date , and the text in Hawaiian and English : " He Koa <unk> , a brave and honorable soldier " . 
 Other Hawaiian veterans of the Civil War are honored in Honolulu 's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific with a bronze memorial plaque that was erected in 2010 in recognition of the " Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War " , the more than one hundred documented Hawaiians who served for the Union and the Confederacy . As of 2014 , researchers have identified 119 documented Hawaiian and Hawaii @-@ born combatants from historical records . The exact number remains unclear because of the lack of records . Of the 48 identified Native Hawaiian combatants , including James Wood Bush and Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman , Kealoha is the only one buried in Hawaii whose gravesite is known . According to Hawaiian news reporter Chelsea Davis , Kealoha has come to " represents all the men of Hawaii who took up arms in America 's Civil War but who have been forgotten . " 
 = Richard Dannatt = 
 General Francis Richard Dannatt , Baron Dannatt , GCB , CBE , MC , DL ( born 23 December 1950 ) is a retired senior British Army officer and the incumbent Constable of the Tower of London . He was commissioned into the Green Howards in 1971 , and his first tour of duty was in Belfast as a platoon commander . During his second tour of duty , also in Northern Ireland , Dannatt was awarded the Military Cross . Following a major stroke in 1977 , Dannatt considered leaving the Army , but was encouraged by his commanding officer ( CO ) to stay . After Staff College , he became a company commander and eventually took command of the Green Howards in 1989 . He attended and then commanded the Higher Command and Staff Course , after which he was promoted to brigadier . Dannatt was given command of 4th Armoured Brigade in 1994 and commanded the British component of the Implementation Force ( IFOR ) the following year . 
 Dannatt took command of 3rd Mechanised Division in 1999 and simultaneously commanded British forces in Kosovo . After a brief tour in Bosnia , he was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff ( ACGS ) . Following the attacks of 11 September 2001 , he became involved in planning for subsequent operations in the Middle East . As Commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps ( ARRC ) , a role he assumed in 2003 , Dannatt led the ARRC headquarters in planning for deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan . The ARRC served in Afghanistan in 2005 , but by this time Dannatt was Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Land Command — the day @-@ to @-@ day commander of the British Army . He was responsible for implementing a controversial reorganisation of the infantry which eventually resulted in his regiment , the Green Howards , being amalgamated into the Yorkshire Regiment . 
 Dannatt was appointed Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) in August 2006 , succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson . Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness , in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers and for a drawdown of operations in Iraq in order to better man those in Afghanistan . He also set about trying to increase his public profile , worried that he was not recognisable enough at a time when he had to defend the Army 's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq . He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and , later in his tenure , brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan . He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009 , taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London . 
 Between November 2009 and the British general election in May 2010 , Dannatt served as a defence adviser to David Cameron . He resigned when Cameron 's Conservative Party won the election , stating that , as prime minister , Cameron should rely on the advice of the incumbent service chiefs . Dannatt published an autobiography in 2010 and continues to be involved with a number of charities and organisations related to the armed forces . He is married with four children , one of whom served as an officer in the Grenadier Guards . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Dannatt , the son of Anthony and Mary ( née Chilvers ) , was born at home in Broomfield — now a suburb of Chelmsford — in Essex . His father and grandfather were architects , working from a practice in Chelmsford , and his mother was a part @-@ time teacher at the London Bible College . He had an elder sister who died from breast cancer in 1988 . Dannatt was heavily influenced by his paternal great @-@ grandfather , a Victorian farmer and devout Christian who devised an early drainage system . 
 Dannatt and his sister were sent to separate boarding schools . He attended <unk> Junior School , where he gained an ambition to become a professional cricketer . For his secondary education , he was sent to St. Lawrence College in Ramsgate , Kent , where he joined the Combined Cadet Force ( CCF ) and eventually rose to senior under @-@ officer . While at school , he developed a dislike of his first name , Francis , after it was mistaken for a girl 's and he was invited to a birthday party at which he was the only boy . He eventually switched to his middle name , Richard , when he was fifteen . By then aspiring to become a barrister , Dannatt applied to study law at Emmanuel College , Cambridge but was turned down after an interview , at which point his ambition switched towards a military career . 
 = = Early military career = = 
 Having initially been interested in a tank regiment , Dannatt was interviewed at the Regular Commissions Board ( later renamed the Army Officer Selection Board ) by an officer from the Green Howards , who persuaded him to consider the infantry and arranged for a visit to a barracks near Colchester . There he met Peter Inge , then a major , and Dannatt became set on joining the Green Howards . He entered the Royal Military Academy , Sandhurst in September 1969 and was commissioned into the Green Howards as a second lieutenant on 30 July 1971 . After a short period of leave , he was sent to Belfast , Northern Ireland , as a platoon commander . Upon completion of the tour , Dannatt returned to the British mainland to take a platoon commanders ' course , after which he rejoined the Green Howards at their barracks in West Germany . He and his platoon returned to Belfast in late 1972 . For gallantry on an operation in which his platoon came under fire in East Belfast , he was later awarded the Military Cross . His first promotion was to lieutenant on 30 January 1973 . Having completed his tour in Northern Ireland , Dannatt applied to take an " in @-@ service " degree — a degree at a civilian university sponsored by the Army — at Hatfield College , Durham University . He was accepted , and commenced study of economic history later in 1973 . During his first year at university , Dannatt attended a debate at Trinity College , Dublin — a rare opportunity for a serving British officer at the height of The Troubles . 
 As part of the arrangement for the " in @-@ service " degree , Dannatt was required to return to the Green Howards during the summer holidays . For both summers , the regiment was serving in Northern Ireland — in Armagh in 1974 and South Armagh in 1975 . It was during the 1975 tour that Dannatt was involved in an operation to destroy an improvised explosive device . However , the device was booby @-@ trapped and an attempt to disable it resulted in its detonation . Dannatt was uninjured but four soldiers , including Dannatt 's company commander — Major Peter Willis — were killed . Shortly after , Dannatt arrested a man in connection with the incident and later gave evidence against him in court . Dannatt graduated in 1976 and , rejoining his regiment , was posted to Berlin . He was appointed battalion adjutant and promoted to captain in July 1977 . On 11 November 1977 , Dannatt , then just 26 , suffered a major stroke and spent most of the next two years recovering , but was allowed to return to duty in 1978 . He was posted to Northern Ireland , accompanied by his wife , who gave birth to the couple 's first son in Craigavon Area Hospital a few weeks into the tour . 
 Dannatt left Northern Ireland ahead of the rest of the battalion and was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Surrey , then under the command of Major ( later General Sir ) Rupert Smith , and expected this to be his last posting in the light of his stroke . He applied for a variety of jobs outside the Army but , after Smith 's encouragement , sat the entrance exams for Staff College , Camberley , also in Surrey . He passed the entrance exams and turned down two civilian job offers to accept his place . Before Camberley , in late 1980 , Dannatt was posted to Catterick Garrison , North Yorkshire , as a company commander . In early 1981 , his company took over the running of HM Prison Frankland during a month @-@ long strike by prison officers . Shortly after the end of the strike , he was posted to Cyprus with the United Nations peacekeeping force before returning to Surrey for the start of the one @-@ year Command and Staff Course at Camberley . After completing the course , he was promoted to major on 30 September 1982 , and appointed chief of staff to 20th Armoured Brigade , based in West Germany . 
 After two years as chief of staff , Dannatt returned to the Green Howards , then also based in West Germany , to command a company for the second time in his career . He was posted to Northern Ireland for six months in 1985 , his fifth tour of the province , though it was significantly quieter than his previous tours . He was appointed Military Assistant to the Minister of State for the Armed Forces in 1986 , his first position at the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) in London . Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 30 June 1987 , Dannatt spent three years at the MoD , in a role he described as " bridging the gap " between the military and politicians , most of whom did not have first @-@ hand experience in the armed forces . At the end of his tenure , he was involved with Field Marshal Sir Nigel Bagnall 's British Military Doctrine in its final stages as it was submitted for ministerial approval . The Green Howards celebrated their 300th anniversary in 1988 and Dannatt took command of the regiment in 1989 . He was responsible for overseeing its transition into an airmobile role , forming part of 24th Airmobile Brigade . He served his sixth and final tour in Northern Ireland in 1991 when the Green Howards were deployed to South Armagh for a month . 
 Returning to Staff College , Camberley , Dannatt took the Higher Command and Staff Course ( <unk> ) , after which he was promoted to colonel on 31 December 1991 , backdated to 30 June 1991 , and tasked with the running of the <unk> , as well as updating the British Military Doctrine in the light of the end of the Cold War . He also drafted the campaign plan for Lieutenant General ( later General Sir ) Mike Rose 's command of the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in the Balkans . Dannatt was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1993 , backdated to 30 June 1993 , and took command of 4th Armoured Brigade , based in Germany . He spent 1994 commanding the brigade and overseeing training and , in 1995 , was posted to Bosnia along with his headquarters staff , leaving the rest of the brigade in Germany and taking command of separate units already deployed in Bosnia . He commanded UNPROFOR 's Sector South West , composed of troops from multiple nations , while also serving as Commander of British Forces ( COMBRITFOR ) , responsible for overseeing operations of all British troops in Bosnia . After the signing of the Dayton Agreement in November 1995 , UNPROFOR became the NATO @-@ led Implementation Force and Dannatt 's brigade was incorporated into a multi @-@ national division commanded by Mike Jackson . Dannatt was later appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) for his service in the Balkans . Handing over 4th Armoured Brigade to David Richards , Dannatt was appointed Director , Defence Programme Staff at the MoD in 1996 and was responsible for part of the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review , produced by the Labour government that had come to power in 1997 . 
 = = High command = = 
 After three years at the MoD , Dannatt attained general officer status with promotion to major general , and took command of the 3rd Mechanised Division in January 1999 . Later in the year , the prospect of NATO intervention in the Kosovo War became likely , and Dannatt and his staff began planning for a potential ground invasion of the territory . In the event , Slobodan Milošević agreed to withdraw Serbian – Yugoslav forces from Kosovo , the practicalities of which were negotiated by Mike Jackson . It was decided , given the large number of British troops serving as part of the multinational Kosovo Force ( KFOR ) , that the 3rd Division 's headquarters would deploy to oversee British operations , with Dannatt as COMBRITFOR . Not long after Dannatt 's arrival , a Russian armoured column moved into Kosovo and took control of Pristina Airport . Wesley Clark , NATO 's Supreme Allied Commander Europe , subsequently ordered Jackson , commander of KFOR , to block the runways of the airport and prevent Russia flying in reinforcements . The issue eventually became moot but Dannatt , as COMBRITFOR , had been ordered to veto the use of British troops — known in NATO as a " red card " , afforded to each national contingent commander — for any such operation . He was later awarded the Queen 's Commendation for Valuable Service for his conduct in Kosovo . 
 Returning to the 3rd Division , Dannatt planned two exercises at the British Army Training Unit Suffield in Canada . The first was , at the time , the largest exercise the Army had run since the end of the Cold War ; the second only took place after Dannatt 's tenure as commander had expired . Dannatt gave evidence as an expert witness in the trial of <unk> <unk> in relation to the Srebrenica massacre , shortly after which he was posted to Bosnia , where he served as deputy commander of NATO 's Stabilisation Force in 2000 . His tour , originally scheduled to last a full year was cut short when Sir Michael Willcocks took early retirement from the Army in order to become Black Rod . The resulting personnel changes to fill the vacancy meant that Dannatt was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff ( ACGS ) in April 2001 . In September 2001 , he was on a visit to British troops in Cyprus and watched the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks on television . As ACGS , he was peripherally involved in planning for the Army 's subsequent involvement in Afghanistan and later Iraq , as well as standing in for the Chief of the General Staff ( then Michael Walker ) when Walker was unavailable . Dannatt was succeeded as ACGS by David Richards , to whom he had handed over command of 4th Armoured Brigade in 1996 and who later succeeded Dannatt as Chief of the General Staff . 
 Dannatt was appointed Commander , Allied Rapid Reaction Corps ( COMARRC ) on 16 January 2003 and promoted to lieutenant general the same day . During his tenure , he was predominantly concerned with planning for possible deployment of the ARRC in Iraq and Afghanistan . It was eventually deployed to Afghanistan , but not until after Dannatt had handed over its command to David Richards . Dannatt was knighted with his investiture as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath ( KCB ) in June 2004 . He succeeded Sir Timothy Granville @-@ Chapman as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Land Command ( <unk> ) — responsible for day @-@ to @-@ day running of the Army — on 7 March 2005 , and was promoted to full general the same day . The prevailing issue during his tenure as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief was the reorganisation of the infantry , an emotive issue as it resulted in the loss of many historic regimental names , including Dannatt 's regiment , the Green Howards , which became 2nd Battalion , the Yorkshire Regiment ( Green Howards ) . However , his term also coincided with an increase in the intensity of simultaneous operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , and Dannatt formed the view that government spending priorities did not accurately reflect the commitments of the British Armed Forces at the time . 
 = = = Chief of the General Staff = = = 
 Upon the retirement of Sir Mike Jackson , Dannatt was appointed Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) — the professional head of the British Army — on 29 August 2006 . Concerned that the formation of the British Armed Forces Federation meant that soldiers were losing confidence in generals to lobby on their behalf , his first act as CGS was to write a long letter to the Secretary of State for Defence , Des Browne , which he copied to the MoD 's senior civil servant , Bill Jeffrey ; Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , Chief of the Defence Staff ( CDS ) ; and to the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Air Staff — his opposite numbers in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force respectively . In the letter , he asserted his view that the Army was over @-@ stretched by operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and that essential equipment , such as helicopters , was unavailable or ineffective and outdated , like the Snatch Land Rover . He also raised concerns with the standard of accommodation provided for soldiers at home and with soldiers ' wages . The following weekend , he travelled to Afghanistan on his first official visit as CGS . He met Des Browne in person for the first time two days after becoming CGS and later acknowledged the difficulties faced by defence secretaries in the little time they have to prepare for the role . 
 Later in his tenure as CGS , Dannatt became concerned that his public profile was not high enough that he would be listened to outside of the Army , especially given the ongoing controversy surrounding the courts @-@ martial of soldiers alleged to be involved in the death of Baha Mousa . As such , he accepted an invitation to an informal gathering of officers and journalists at the Cavalry and Guards Club in September 2006 . During the gathering , he raised issues with journalists about defence spending in general and soldiers ' wages in particular . To his surprise , and as a result of media pressure and internal lobbying , a bonus for soldiers who had served six @-@ month tours in Iraq and Afghanistan was announced a month later . Dannatt appeared in newspaper headlines in October 2006 when he gave an interview for Sarah Sands of the Daily Mail in which he opined that a drawdown of troops from Iraq was necessary in order to allow the Army to focus on Afghanistan , and that wounded soldiers should recover in a military environment rather than civilian hospitals . Several newspapers portrayed his comments as an attack on the government , and on Tony Blair — then the prime minister — personally . His comments were supported by several journalists and retired officers , though others believed Dannatt had acted improperly and called for his resignation , while Simon Jenkins of The Times called Dannatt 's comments " either daringly brave or totally naive " . 
 Dannatt went on to chair a conference of welfare providers to military personnel in order to show that the Army understood the issues affecting its soldiers and to organise a series of smaller conferences , hosted by himself and Sir Freddie <unk> — then Adjutant @-@ General to the Forces — to discuss welfare issues with commanding officers across the UK . In 2007 , Dannatt and his wife , Pippa , visited Headley Court , an MoD rehabilitation centre for wounded personnel , where the commanding officer informed the Dannatts of his desire for a swimming pool , but accepted that it was unlikely to receive government funding . Some time later , the Dannatts were introduced to Bryn and Emma Parry by Sarah @-@ Jane Shirreff — the wife of Sir Richard Shirreff — and the Dannatts assisted the Parrys with the formation of Help for Heroes , set up with the specific aim of funding the swimming pool at Headley Court . Dannatt initially worried that the charity 's ₤ 2 million goal might be unattainable , but it eventually raised enough money to build both the pool and a gymnasium , which were opened in 2010 . He and Pippa later assisted both Help For Heroes and <unk> Forces Help in efforts to build houses to accommodate the families of wounded servicemen at Headley Court and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham , inspired by the difficulties faced by the family of George Cross recipient Peter Norton . 
 Another of Dannatt 's priorities was tackling the perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , as he was concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions . Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage , he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews . During the visit , he managed to meet with his son , Bertie , who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards . Later in 2007 , Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London . Earlier that year , Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq . However , after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press , Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home . 
 In 2008 , in the first speech of its kind by any CGS , Dannatt addressed the Army @-@ sponsored Fourth Joint Conference on Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transsexual Matters , stating that homosexuals were welcome to serve in the Army . 
 Dannatt was raised from Knight Commander to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath ( GCB ) in the 2008 – 2009 New Year Honours List . His tenure as CGS expired in August 2008 and he was succeeded for the last time by Sir David Richards . The government took the unusual decision to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup as CDS , rather than promote one of the outgoing service chiefs . Thus all three , including Dannatt , retired , amid claims that Dannatt 's potential promotion to CDS had been personally vetoed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown . His last act as CGS was to nominate Nick Houghton to become the next Vice @-@ Chief of the Defence Staff . 
 = = = Honorary titles = = = 
 Dannatt was appointed Colonel , The Green Howards on 1 December 1994 , succeeding Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge . He was in turn relieved by Brigadier John Powell in May 2003 . Dannatt succeeded Sir Christopher Wallace as Deputy Colonel Commandant of the Adjutant General 's Corps on 1 April 1999 , holding the title until 17 June 2005 , when he was relieved by Major General Bill Rollo . He was appointed Colonel Commandant of the King 's Division , in succession to Sir Scott Grant , on 1 July 2001 . He relinquished the title on 10 December 2005 to fellow Green Howard , Lieutenant General ( later General Sir ) Nick Houghton . 
 Between appointments in 2002 , Dannatt spent six weeks at the School of Army Aviation at Army Air Corps Middle Wallop , where he was trained as a helicopter pilot in order to fulfil his duties as Colonel Commandant of the Army Air Corps ( AAC ) , to which he was appointed on 1 April 2004 , succeeding Michael Walker . Also in succession to Walker , he was appointed Aide de Camp General ( ADC Gen ) to Queen Elizabeth II on 5 June 2006 . He was succeeded in his position with the AAC by Major General Adrian Bradshaw on 1 July 2009 , and relinquished the appointment of ADC Gen on 1 September 2009 . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 It was announced in February 2009 that , after his retirement , Dannatt would be installed as the 159th Constable of the Tower of London . The tenure of the previous incumbent , General Sir Roger Wheeler , also a former CGS , expired on 31 July and Dannatt became constable on 1 August 2009 . The Constable has been the most senior official at the Tower of London since the eleventh century . Today , the role is largely ceremonial , and conferred on field marshals or retired generals who usually serve a five @-@ year term . 
 After leaving office as CGS , Dannatt effectively retired from the Army , but technically remained a serving officer until November 2009 . Shortly after leaving office , Dannatt was approached by David Cameron , then leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition . Cameron invited Dannatt to become a defence adviser for the shadow cabinet once he was officially retired from the Army and no longer bound by Queen 's Regulations , which mandate political neutrality in the armed forces . Although uncommon for a former service chief to align himself with one political party , Dannatt accepted the role on an informal basis . The timing of the decision , which became public in October 2009 — within two months of Dannatt 's effective retirement — attracted some controversy , with some former ministers and civil servants suggesting it potentially compromised the neutrality of the armed forces . He advised Cameron and his shadow cabinet until he resigned , shortly after the 2010 general election , stating that Cameron , by then prime minister , should turn to the incumbent chiefs of staff for defence advice and citing no desire to become a special adviser . He was nominated for a life peerage by David Cameron while Cameron was Leader of the Opposition . Although nominated for a political peerage on the Conservative Party benches , he opted to sit as a crossbencher and was ennobled as Baron Dannatt in November 2010 . 
 The Council of the Royal United Services Institute ( RUSI ) , a politically independent think tank dedicated to defence and security issues , elected Dannatt as the Institute 's Chairman in June 2009 . He took up the appointment on 1 September 2009 , but resigned in October the same year after the announcement that he was to become an adviser to David Cameron , believing that his resignation was necessary for RUSI to maintain its political neutrality . He was eventually succeeded by former Defence Secretary John Hutton , Baron Hutton of Furness . 
 Dannatt has written an autobiography , titled Leading from the Front , published by Bantam Press in 2010 . In the book , he was critical of the Labour government that led the UK from 1997 to 2010 and of Gordon Brown , Chancellor of the Exchequer and later prime minister , in particular , accusing him of " malign intervention " and , while chancellor , of refusing to fund Tony Blair 's defence policy . He also criticised Tony Blair for allowing himself to be effectively overruled by Brown and said of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , then CDS , that " although brilliant at what he did , [ he ] could not have been expected to understand the sights , sounds and smells of the battlefield " . The Daily Telegraph called the book " a searing indictment of how New Labour , and to some extent the military 's high command , failed to properly lead , fund and equip the armed forces for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan " . 
 In July 2010 , Dannatt gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry , focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002 . He described an initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment and the provision of naval and air support to the United States . He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over @-@ stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re @-@ stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests . Dannatt 's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS , General Sir Mike Jackson .

 In October 2012 , The Times of London attempted to entrap Dannatt , who was at the time subject to the Code of Conduct for Members of the House of Lords . According to The Guardian , Dannatt offered to lobby Bernard Gray , who was then Chief of Defence Materiel . Dannatt was quoted as saying he had engineered a seat at a formal dinner with the Ministry of Defence 's new permanent secretary , Jon Thompson , to help another company , Capita Symonds , which was bidding for a contract to manage MoD estates . According to The Independent , Dannatt acknowledged that he had offered to assist in facilitating conversations , but stated that he had rejected an offer of an £ 8 @,@ 000 per month fee to lobby on behalf of the organisation and that he had " no inclination " to contravene the rules on lobbying , and would regard any such claim as " seriously defamatory " .

 Dannatt met his wife , Philippa ( " Pippa " ; née Gurney ) during his first year at Durham University in 1973 . The couple became engaged , and married in March 1977 , after which Pippa accompanied Dannatt on his return to Berlin . They had four children — three boys and one girl . Bertie , their second son , served with the Grenadier Guards — Pippa 's father 's regiment — in Iraq and Afghanistan , earning a mention in despatches and reaching the rank of captain before leaving the Army in 2008 . 
 In 1977 , then just 26 , Dannatt suffered a major stroke , rendering him unable to speak and leaving the right @-@ hand side of his body paralysed . He spent much of the subsequent two years recovering and was eventually allowed to return to duty , though he still tires more quickly on his right @-@ hand side than on his left and has other minor residual effects . During his recovery , Dannatt , a devout Christian , was pointed to two Bible verses , which prompted him to believe that his commitment to his faith had thus far been " half @-@ hearted " and inspired him to make a greater commitment which , according to his autobiography , " helped define who I then became , both as a person and as a soldier " . Dannatt later attributed surviving his stroke and several other near @-@ death experiences — including the incident for which he was awarded the Military Cross — to a challenge from God to " devote his life to Christ " . 
 Dannatt has been Vice President of the Armed Forces Christian Union since 1998 and President of the Soldiers ' and Airmen 's Scripture Readers Association since 1999 . He was President of the Army Rifle Association from 2000 to 2008 and of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association in 2008 , presiding over that year 's Royal Norfolk Show , attended by Prince Harry at Dannatt 's invitation . He has served as a trustee of the Windsor Leadership Trust since 2005 and as patron of Hope and Homes for Children since 2006 , and continues his patronage of Help for Heroes , which he assisted in founding while CGS . He lists his leisure interests as cricket , tennis , fishing and shooting . He was appointed president of the Norfolk Churches Trust in November 2011 , and Vice President of The Western Front Association in 2013 . He is also the President of YMCA Norfolk . 
 = Fredrik Reinfeldt = 
 John Fredrik Reinfeldt ( pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 4 August 1965 ) is a Swedish economist , lecturer and former politician who was Prime Minister of Sweden from 2006 to 2014 and was also the chairman of the liberal conservative Moderate Party from 2003 to 2015 . He was the last rotating President of the European Council in 2009 . 
 A native of Stockholm County , Reinfeldt joined the Moderate Youth League in 1983 , and by 1992 had risen to the rank of chairman , a position he held until 1995 . He served as Member of Parliament from 1991 to 2014 , representing his home constituency . Reinfeldt was elected party leader on 25 October 2003 , succeeding Bo Lundgren . Under his leadership , the Moderate Party has transformed its policies and oriented itself towards the centre , branding itself " the New Moderates " ( Swedish : Nya <unk> ) . 
 Following the 2006 general election , Reinfeldt was elected Prime Minister on October 6 . Along with the three other political parties in the centre @-@ right Alliance for Sweden , Reinfeldt presided over a coalition government with the support of a narrow majority in parliament . At the age of 41 , he was the third @-@ youngest person to become Prime Minister of Sweden . 
 Reinfeldt 's first term in office was marked by the late @-@ 2000s financial crisis and recession . A drop in popularity before the financial crisis reversed as the economy of Sweden emerged as one of the strongest in Europe , which brought a resurgence of support for him , resulting in his government 's re @-@ election in 2010 . Despite the Moderate Party getting its best share of the vote since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1919 , Reinfeldt 's government was reduced to a minority government , but he remained in power as the first centre @-@ right Prime Minister since the Swedish @-@ Norwegian Union to be re @-@ elected . 
 His premiership was characterised by " <unk> " ( English : Working line ) with focus on getting more people into to the workforce , managing of the late @-@ 2000s financial crisis and recession which resulted in one of the world 's strongest public finances and top rankings in climate and health care . 
 Reinfeldt is the longest @-@ serving non @-@ Social Democratic Prime Minister since Erik Gustaf Boström in 1891 – 1900 . After defeat in the 2014 election , Reinfeldt announced that he would step down from leading the party which he did on 10 January 2015 . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 In 1965 , Fredrik Reinfeldt was born in Allmänna BB hospital in Stockholm and was the oldest of three brothers to his parents Bruno and Birgitta Reinfeldt . At the time of his birth , his parents lived in an apartment in <unk> in the south of Stockholm County , but a short time afterwards the family moved to London , where his father worked as a consultant for Shell . Upon returning to Sweden , the family first lived in an apartment in <unk> before moving to a terraced house in Bromsten in northwestern Stockholm . The Reinfeldt family was living in Bromsten when Fredrik 's younger brothers , Magnus and Henrik , were born in 1969 and 1973 . In 1976 the family moved into a single @-@ family home in Täby in northeastern Stockholm County . His mother Birgitta was a leadership and management consultant , and some of her professional skills might have inspired and impressed the young Fredrik . 
 At the age of 11 Reinfeldt became chairman of the student council ( Swedish : <unk> ) in his school , and became a fan of the football club Djurgårdens IF , a passion he maintains to this day . He started playing basketball for the " Tensta Tigers " while living in Bromsten ( which is located adjacent to Tensta ) , and continued to play for them after his family moved to Täby . He also enjoyed setting up and performing revues and cabarets . After school , Reinfeldt completed his military service as a ranger ( Swedish : <unk> ) at Lapland Rifle Regiment and finished first in his class as a cadet in Umeå . It was during this time that he became interested in politics , as a representative for his regiment in the congress of conscripts in the Swedish military ( Swedish : <unk> ) . Reinfeldt graduated from Stockholm University School of Business with a degree in Business and Economics ( Swedish : <unk> ) in 1990 . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Reinfeldt joined the Moderate Youth League — the youth wing of the Swedish Moderate Party — in 1983 at the age of 18 . As a member of the Moderate Youth League in Täby , he challenged the leaders of the local league , who preferred to use the premises as a place to drink beer and wine rather than engage in discussions about politics . Reinfeldt , who is said to dislike hard liquor and to consume wine and beer in moderate amounts , started " Conservative Youth " ( Swedish : <unk> <unk> ) and formed a bond with the mother party , eventually taking over the youth league in 1987 . In 1988 , he became a secretary ( Swedish : <unk> ) in the Stockholm Municipality Council . 
 He was active in student politics while studying at Stockholm University , eventually becoming chairman for the student party " <unk> <unk> – Opposition ' 68 " between 1988 and 1989 . In 1990 , he became chairman of the Moderate Youth League in Stockholm , and in 1991 Reinfeldt was elected a member of the Riksdag — the Swedish Parliament . In the Swedish general election of 1991 , the Moderate Party and its allies had considerable success , leading to the formation of a centre @-@ right coalition government under Moderate Party leader and Prime Minister Carl Bildt . The 1991 government was the first centre @-@ right government in Sweden since 1982 . 
 = = = Leader of the Moderate Youth League = = = 
 From 1992 to 1995 , Reinfeldt was the chairman of the Moderate Youth League . He ousted the former chairman , Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as The Battle of <unk> , gathering 58 of the delegates votes with Kristersson gathering 55 votes . The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians ; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians . Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League , he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life . Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today . During the period 1995 to 1997 , Reinfeldt was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe . 
 At the beginning of his term as leader of the Moderate Youth League , Reinfeldt supported the government of Prime Minister Bildt , but Reinfeldt gradually changed his views and became more critical of the party leadership . In 1993 , he wrote the book " Det sovande folket " ( The Sleeping Nation ) , in which he criticized the Swedish welfare state and argued for the introduction of a <unk> society . The book argues that the welfare state is a stillborn construction , as it systematically puts people in benefit dependency . It states that the people of Sweden can be divided into " fools " and " sleepy @-@ brains " , out of which the former stands for those who work , and the latter for the slackened people who depend on the contributions from the welfare state . A recurrent message in the book is that " Swedes are mentally handicapped and indoctrinated to believe that politicians can create and ensure welfare " . 
 Following the defeat of the Bildt government in the Swedish general election of 1994 , Reinfeldt publicly criticized the Moderate Party leader , whom he believed had gotten too much dominance in the party . 
 In 1995 , Reinfeldt co @-@ authored the book " <unk> " ( The Nostalgic Trip ) , which described several persons in the Moderate Party leadership , including Gunnar <unk> and Bo Lundgren , as " Carl Bildt @-@ lookalikes . " Bildt was described as being the perfect leader for the opposition to satirize ; a nobleman living in the affluent <unk> with a boyish expression and a better @-@ than @-@ you attitude . As for the other high party officials , the book stated that " If everyone appears similar to Carl it confirms peoples misconceptions about the Moderate Party . It becomes a party for Carl Bildt @-@ copies . " 
 This provoked swift reaction from the Moderate Party leadership , who believed that Reinfeldt 's criticisms had gone too far . On 14 February 1995 Reinfeldt was called to a meeting of the Moderate Party 's Riksdag group , which took place in the former second chamber ( Swedish : <unk> ) of the Swedish parliament building , a meeting where Bildt apparently scolded him for hours . After this , Reinfeldt toned down his criticism , but was ostracized within the Moderate Party and not given any important posts until after the change of leadership when Lundgren succeeded Bildt in 1999 . At that time , he was elected into a high party group , the <unk> . From 2001 to 2002 Reinfeldt was chairman of the justice committee of the Swedish parliament . During this time he traveled around the country gathering impressions and support at the local level of the Moderate Party . 
 = = = Leader of the Moderate Party = = = 
 In the Swedish general election of 2002 , the Moderate Party gathered 15 @.@ 3 percent of the votes — its lowest share of the vote in a general election since 1973 . Following the loss , Lundgren was forced to resign his position as leader of the Moderate Party . After the 2002 election Reinfeldt was elected as leader of the Moderate Party parliamentary group , spokesman for economic policy and vice chairman of the parliament 's finance committee . On 25 October 2003 , he was unanimously elected as the new leader of the Moderate Party . 
 = = = = " The New Moderates " = = = = 
 Under Reinfeldt 's leadership , the Moderate Party has adjusted its position in the political spectrum , moving towards the centre . To reflect these changes , the party 's unofficial name was altered to " The New Moderates " ( Swedish : De nya Moderaterna ) in order to emphasize the break with the past . The Moderate Party started to focus more on calls for tax cuts for low- and middle @-@ income groups , rather than on major tax cuts more benefiting high @-@ income earners . 
 As leader of the Moderate Party , Reinfeldt has tended to be less forceful in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors . Reinfeldt has instead proposed reforms to Sweden 's welfare state , which include cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits , in order to encourage the jobless to return to work . He has toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state , stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not dictated from the top down . Reinfeldt 's goal is said to be to fine @-@ tune the welfare state , by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment . He has worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system . 
 Reinfeldt has even extended an invitation to the Swedish Trade Union Confederation , traditional supporter of the Social Democrats and opponent of the Moderate Party . He also changed the Moderate Party 's traditional stance towards the Swedish Labour and employment laws , stating that he prefers small changes instead of any radical reform . 
 People both within and outside the party differ on their analysis of the transformation of the Moderate Party , with some arguing that the party is mainly honing the way it describes its visions , and others suggesting that it constitutes a substantial policy change towards the centre . As a consequence of Reinfeldt 's shift of the Moderate Party to the centre , the differences between the Moderate Party and their traditional opponents the Swedish Social Democratic Party have become harder to discern . In a series of radio and television debates , the then @-@ Social Democrat leader and Prime Minister Göran Persson portrayed his opponent as a classic conservative in disguise . Persson stated that , if in power , the conservatives would tamper with Sweden 's successful formula of high taxes , a large public sector and generous benefits . There is also some criticism within the party ; former Moderate Youth League chairman Christofer <unk> has called Reinfeldt 's political reform as " leftist rhetoric " ( Swedish : <unk> ) . 
 = = = = Alliance for Sweden = = = = 
 In the run @-@ up for the Swedish general election of 2006 , Reinfeldt , as leader of the Moderate Party , participated in the creation of the Alliance for Sweden . It has united the centre @-@ right in a coalition , which consists of the Moderate Party , the Centre Party , the Liberal People 's Party and the Christian Democrats . Reinfeldt is said to have been instrumental in uniting the four parties , which previously were known for being notoriously divided , in order to present a powerful alternative to the Social Democrats . The parties presented a joint election manifesto for the alliance . 
 = = = = 2006 Swedish general election = = = = 
 During the run @-@ up for the 2006 Swedish general election , Reinfeldt was subjected to a smear campaign . Mats Lindström , a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters , admitted to sending e @-@ mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud , false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father 's influence . The IP address used in the e @-@ mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters . Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita <unk> apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable . A short time after the e @-@ mail campaign , images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media . Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League , but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience . 
 Following the general election on 17 September 2006 , the Alliance for Sweden won a majority of the votes after the first count , defeating the Social Democrat Party . The Moderates gathered 26 @.@ 1 percent of the votes , a new record for the party which in the 2002 election had only managed to gather 15 @.@ 2 percent of the votes . The election result is historic in being the worst result for the Social Democrats ever ( 34 @,@ 6 percent ) in a general election with universal suffrage ( introduced in 1921 ) and the best result for the Moderates since 1928 . 
 Looking back at the defeat of the incumbent Social Democrats , the opinion among several members of the defeated incumbents was that the election was lost because the previous government failed to bring down unemployment , and failed to campaign on it as an issue . <unk> <unk> , the former chairman for the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League , stated that " the Moderates were right strategically to focus on unemployment " . Former Social Democratic minister Leif <unk> stated that internal fighting , authoritarianism and perceived aggressiveness as well as a loss of appeal to the middle class and city inhabitants contributed to the election loss .

 The Alliance for Sweden received a majority of votes , but not full majority in Parliament . But the fragmented opposition , especially after the entrance of the Sweden Democrats in parliament , the government could continue .

 Main article : Premiership of Fredrik Reinfeldt 
 Reinfeldt became the Prime Minister of Sweden on 6 October 2006 , serving concurrently as Leader of the Moderate Party . The 41 @-@ year old Reinfeldt became the youngest person to become Prime Minister since Rickard Sandler became Prime Minister at the age of 40 in 1925 . With victories in 2006 and in 2010 , Reinfeldt was the Moderate Party 's longest @-@ serving prime minister and the only person to lead the party to two consecutive general election victories . His Government compromised four parties ( including his own ) which prior to the election had formed an coalition named Alliance for Sweden , later turned into the Alliance . 
 At a press conference prior to his appointment , Reinfeldt commented that " this feels historic in many ways " partly because it was the first time in 36 years there would be a majority government in Sweden .

 = = = = 2008 Financial Crisis = = = = 
 A global financial crisis was triggered in 2008 , beginning in the United States . The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009 , had a major impact on the Swedish economy . Reinfeldt 's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority , combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce . The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances , with limited investments , and the support of Reinfeldt 's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government . 
 From 2009 , the Swedish economy emerged as one of the world 's fastest recovering economies with high competitiveness . Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis better than any other developed countries , and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the run @-@ up to 2010 general election . As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support , which eventually resulted in his re @-@ election in 2010 . This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re @-@ <unk> after completing a full first term . 
 = = = = President of the European Council = = = = 
 Reinfeldt became President of the European Council on 1 July 2009 , as Sweden took over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from the Czech Republic . His slogan was " taking on the challenge " . Reinfeldt immediately requested the European Union to do more to combat climate change . Days earlier , he had been interviewed by Reuters and said he spoke of his worry about increased European public debt . He spoke of his wish for Turkey to join the European Union . He also spoke of his other views , such as his hope that a second term would be possible quickly for the President of the European Commission and his desire that the European Union should not sanction Iran immediately following its election protests . 
 = = = Second term ( 2010 – 2014 ) = = = 
 In the 2010 general election , the Moderate Party increased its share of the vote to 30 @.@ 06 % . The Alliance got a majority of votes cast , but with 173 seats no absolute majority in parliament . With the opposition divided mainly by the Sweden Democrats , Reinfeldt could remain in government , but with a greater need to seek consensus on matters of substance with the opposition parties . 
 The second term compromised a slow recovery from the 2008 @-@ 2009 financial crisis and consolidation of policies from the first term . The political debate came from 2013 to be highly dominated by issues where the Government came in a defense mode , in particular for the poor performance of Swedish pupils in the international study of school performance , the Programme for International Student Assessment , and profits gained in private welfare , especially after the economic collapse that had preceded the closure of school group JB Education AB and questions of how key people in the Government , including himself , acted in the N.V. Nuon Energy affair . 
 Reinfeldt had during his second term , in contrast to his first term , no major international engagement . Contacts with other politicians , however , remained good , which was also marked by Barack Obama 's visit to Stockholm in September in 2013 . 
 = = Post @-@ premiership ( 2014 @-@ present ) = = 
 After defeat in 2014 , Reinfeldt announced he would step down as both Prime Minister of Sweden and as party leader of the Moderate Party . He stepped down from the office of Prime Minister on 3 October 2014 , being succeeded by Stefan <unk> . He resigned from the Riksdag on 31 December 2014 and stepped down as party leader on 10 January 2015 , being succeeded by Anna Kinberg Batra . 
 On 19 January 2015 , Reinfeldt announced that he had formed his own business Fredrik Reinfeldt AB where he will serve as an advisor and lecturer . He will also continue to promote his " job line " , which was a key part of his premiership , in a continued community deed . On 1 September 2015 he launched his autobiography , titled Halfway , where he reflects over his 25 years in Swedish and international politics . 
 On 11 December 2015 , Reinfeldt was nominated to become the next chairman of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative . He will be formally appointed in February 2016 . 
 In January 2016 , Reinfeldt was awarded H. M. The King 's Medal , 12th size with chain , for extraordinary efforts as Prime Minister . On 15 March 2016 it was announced that Reinfeldt had been hired by Bank of America Merrill Lynch as a senior adviser for its business in Europe , the Middle East and Africa . 
 = = Foreign policy = = 
 The Moderate Party has a pro @-@ European Union policy stance — including support for exchanging the SEK for the Euro — and also supports Sweden joining NATO . As one of Europe 's new conservative leaders , Reinfeldt is seen as an important ally of the United States . His party is a member of the conservative International Democrat Union , together with the Republican Party in the United States and the British Conservative Party , even though its policies are somewhat more liberal than these . During the 2000 United States presidential election , Reinfeldt visited the United States to support the campaign of George W. Bush . Prior to the 2004 United States presidential election , Reinfeldt again expressed his support for Bush . In an interview with the newspaper Stockholm City on 8 March 2004 , Reinfeldt said that he preferred Bush over the Democratic Party contender John Kerry , and in a poll conducted by the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet in April 2004 , Reinfeldt like a large majority of his party favoured Bush over Kerry . 
 Despite this , he has compared his government 's actions and policies to those of Bill Clinton 's administration , and supported Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election . 
 Reinfeldt visited Washington , D.C. on 15 May 2007 , meeting with President Bush . His trip also included meetings with others , including United Nations Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger . This is his first visit to the United States since becoming Prime Minister in 2006 . Bush and Reinfeldt mostly discussed climate change and free trade , focusing on the Doha Round . He visited President Barack Obama at first the White House and then in the Metropolitan Museum of Art on 23 September 2009 . 
 Reinfeldt was President of the European Council from 1 July to 1 December 2009 . The signing of the Treaty of Lisbon was Reinfeldt 's role as President of the Council , which also occurred on 13 December 2009 . Reinfeldt was also responsible in this role to put EU 's efforts to get into a binding agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009 but this did not succeed . 
 = = Public perception = = 
 Reinfeldt has been called a " Swedish David Cameron , " insofar as he succeeded in shifting the public perception of the Moderate Party from a right @-@ wing position to a center position in politics . On the other hand , he is thought to have influenced Cameron , since Reinfeldt was elected party leader in 2003 — two years before Cameron took control of the British Conservative Party in 2005 . Reinfeldt has also been described as a communitarian . 
 In a study by Sifo , a Swedish polling institute , Reinfeldt was the " most admired man in Sweden " in 2006 . Reinfeldt 's approval rating reached its highest measured point yet in December 2006 , at 57 % approval in an Aftonbladet / Sifo poll . Approval ratings for Reinfeldt as a person remained overall good but fluctuating through most of the period 2006 – 2010 , but did not always seem to translate into support for the cabinet . 
 Reinfeldt has been perceived as a controlled and harmonious person . He was described , already before he became prime minister , as " gentle , pensive and a good listener " and his " cool , soft @-@ spoken approach " is said to go down well with Swedish voters ; it also fits well with the promotion of the policies of his cabinet as being not ideological , but motivated by non @-@ political reason and common sense , in implicit contrast to the " ideological excesses " of the Social Democrats and their allies . Aware of this perception , Reinfeldt has said " I am by nature confident and calm . But that does not mean I am not passionate and wouldn 't feel strongly about things . " Regarding his family life , Reinfeldt has cultivated the image of a good family man who enjoys housework .

 In 1992 , Fredrik Reinfeldt married <unk> Holmberg , a Stockholm County municipal politician for the Moderate Party . During Fredrik 's tenure as prime minister , <unk> Reinfeldt was County Councillor for healthcare issues ( Swedish : <unk> ) in Stockholm . After being elected Prime Minister in 2006 , Reinfeldt moved into the prime minister 's official residence , the Sager House , together with his wife and their three children , Ebba , Gustaf and Erik . On 7 March 2012 it became known that the couple had separated . On 11 July 2012 the couple signed their divorce papers with consideration of 6 months . On 20 February 2013 they signed the last papers which conducted their divorce . 
 His father Bruno Reinfeldt was also formerly involved in local politics for the Moderate Party in Täby , but left all his political posts in February 2009 after having been arrested and later convicted for drunk driving . 
 On 23 February 2015 , Reinfeldt confirmed that he was now in a relationship with Roberta Alenius . Alenius served as Head of Communications ( Chief of the Press Secretaries ) at the Cabinet Office from 2006 to 2014 , while Reinfeldt served as Prime Minister . 
 During the 2006 election , it was brought to attention that Reinfeldt 's paternal great @-@ great @-@ grandfather was an African American circus director from New York , John Hood , who had a son with Emma Dorotea Reinfeld , a maid from <unk> in present @-@ day Latvia . Emma Dorotea Reinfeld later married the Swede Anders Karlsson , but her illegitimate son John kept his mother 's surname . The spelling was later changed to Reinfeldt . He also has Italian ancestry , via his paternal grandmother . 
 He has revealed that his personal distaste for the anti @-@ immigration Sweden Democrats party is based on his partly African ancestry . 
 Reinfeldt has said that he left the Church of Sweden when he was eighteen years old , critical of the left @-@ leaning perspectives of the church . In an interview as Prime Minister he however said that he could not state if he believed in God , discussing his belief " that something exist that is not just about the scientific explanation for how the Earth was created . But exactly what it is I don 't have an answer for , I am both searching and wondering . " He was however married , and had his children baptized in the Church of Sweden . 
 He has lately also attracted some attention as a political science fiction writer . His social dystopia " Det sovande folket " ( The Sleeping People ) was in 2013 featured as a play at Teater Alma in Stockholm .

 The Chalke Gate ( Greek : <unk> Πύλη ) , was the main ceremonial entrance ( vestibule ) to the Great Palace of Constantinople in the Byzantine period . The name , which means " the Bronze Gate " , was given to it either because of the bronze portals or from the gilded bronze tiles used in its roof . The interior was lavishly decorated with marble and mosaics , and the exterior façade featured a number of statues . Most prominent was an icon of Christ which became a major iconodule symbol during the Byzantine Iconoclasm , and a chapel dedicated to the Christ Chalkites was erected in the 10th century next to the gate . The gate itself seems to have been demolished in the 13th century , but the chapel survived until the early 19th century . 
 = = History = = 
 The gate lay on the southeastern corner of the <unk> , the main ceremonial plaza of the city , with the Hagia Sophia cathedral on the northern side and the Baths of <unk> and the Hippodrome of Constantinople on the southern and western sides . 
 The first structure in that location was erected by the architect <unk> during the reign of Emperor Anastasius I ( r . 491 – 518 ) to celebrate the victory in the Isaurian War ( 492 @-@ 497 ) . Like much of the city 's center , this structure burned down in the Nika riots of 532 , and was subsequently rebuilt by the Emperor Justinian I ( r . 527 – 565 ) . This building was extensively described by the historian Procopius in his De <unk> . In the 7th and 8th centuries , the Chalke itself or its dependencies became a prison , until Emperor Basil I ( r . 867 – 886 ) repaired it and converted it into a law court . 
 Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos ( r . 920 – 944 ) attached a small chapel dedicated to Christ Chalkites ( <unk> <unk> ) , which was later rebuilt on a grander scale by Emperor John I Tzimiskes ( r . 969 – 976 ) , who endowed it with relics and was himself buried there . This rebuilding was facilitated by the fact that his predecessor , Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas ( r . 963 – 969 ) , had enclosed the palace precinct with a new wall of reduced girth , to which the Chalke was no longer attached . The main gatehouse , denuded of its bronze gates by Emperor Isaac II Angelos during his first reign ( 1185 – 1195 ) , is not mentioned by Byzantine chroniclers after ca . 1200 . The chapel however survived long after : it is mentioned as being largely intact by Russian pilgrims in the 14th century , and in Ottoman times , the ruins of the chapel were known as <unk> and functioned as a menagerie . The remains of the chapel are depicted in 18th @-@ century drawings , until finally demolished in 1804 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Several literary descriptions of the gate survive . Procopius is the earliest and most prominent source , but accounts of the statues decorating the gatehouse 's façade also come from the later Parastaseis <unk> <unk> . 
 Justinian 's Chalke was a rectangular building , with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives , which in turn rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion . The piers to the south and north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west . The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north , each again featuring a vaulted roof . The relation of the Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear ; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left , but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself . It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform , and 18th @-@ century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia . 
 The vestibule 's interior decoration is also described by Procopius : the walls were decorated with slabs of multi @-@ colored marble , while the ceilings were covered with mosaics , which depicted Justinian and his empress Theodora flanked by the Senate , as well as the victories of Belisarius in the Vandalic and Gothic wars and his triumphal return bearing spoils , defeated kings and kingdoms to his emperor . 
 The external decoration is comparatively unknown , but the Parastaseis <unk> record the existence of various statues , probably placed in niches above the central doorway . These included Emperor Maurice ( r . 582 – 602 ) and his wife and children , a pair of statues of philosophers taken from Athens , stretching their arms towards one another , statues of Emperor Zeno ( r . 474 – 491 ) and Empress Ariadne , as well as four gorgon heads from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus that " surround the Chalke with the sign of the cross above them " . The same text also records that statues of Emperor Maximian ( r . 285 – 305 ) and the entire House of Theodosius were located " nearby " , while the exact location of a statue of Empress <unk> in relation to the building is unclear . Cyril Mango , who studied the problem of the statuary recorded in the Parastaseis , concluded that the references came from a text written in ca . 600 – in great part because the images of Emperor Maurice and his family are unlikely to have survived their overthrow and murder by Phocas in 602 . 
 = = Icon of Christ Chalkites = = 
 Above the main entrance of the Chalke , there stood an icon of Christ , the so @-@ called Christ Chalkites ( " Christ of the Chalke " ) . The origins of the icon are obscure : based on its mention in the Parastaseis , it may have existed by ca . 600 , but it cannot be stated with any certainty . Its prominent display on the very entrance to the imperial palace made it one of the city 's major religious symbols . Consequently , its removal , in 726 or 730 , by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ( r . 717 – 741 ) , was both a major political statement and a spark for violent rioting in the city , and marked the beginning of the official prohibition of icons in the Empire . The icon was restored a first time by Empress Eirene in ca . 787 , until it was again removed by Leo V the Armenian ( r . 813 – 820 ) and replaced by a simple cross . After the definitive restoration of the veneration of icons in 843 , a mosaic icon by the famed iconodule monk and artist Lazaros replaced it . 
 The exact appearance of the icon is unclear : although the early image has been interpreted as a bust of the Christ Pantocrator type , late Byzantine references , such as coins by John III Vatatzes ( r . 1221 – 1254 ) and the <unk> mosaic in the Chora Church , use the term for depictions of a standing Christ on a pedestal . 
 = Risk parity = 
 Risk parity ( or risk premia parity ) is an approach to investment portfolio management which focuses on allocation of risk , usually defined as volatility , rather than allocation of capital . The risk parity approach asserts that when asset allocations are adjusted ( leveraged or <unk> ) to the same risk level , the risk parity portfolio can achieve a higher Sharpe ratio and can be more resistant to market downturns than the traditional portfolio . 
 Roughly speaking , the approach of building a risk parity portfolio is similar to creating a minimum @-@ variance portfolio subject to the constraint that each asset ( or asset class , such as bonds , stocks , real estate , etc . ) contributes equally to the portfolio overall volatility . 
 Risk parity can also be a generalized term that denotes a variety of investment systems and techniques that utilize its principles . The principles of risk parity are applied differently according to the investment style and goals of various financial managers and yield different results . 
 Some of its theoretical components were developed in the 1950s and 1960s but the first risk parity fund , called the All Weather fund , was pioneered in 1996 . In recent years many investment companies have begun offering risk parity funds to their clients . The term , risk parity , came into use in 2005 and was then adopted by the asset management industry . Risk parity can be seen as either a passive or active management strategy . 
 Interest in the risk parity approach has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios , as well as many hedge funds . Some portfolio managers have expressed skepticism about the practical application of the concept and its effectiveness in all types of market conditions but others point to its performance during the financial crisis of 2007 @-@ 2008 as an indication of its potential success . 
 = = Description = = 
 Risk parity is a conceptual approach to investing which attempts to provide a lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60 % stocks and 40 % bonds which carries 90 % of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio ( see illustration ) . The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to a wider range of categories such as stocks , government bonds , credit @-@ related securities and inflation hedges ( including real assets , commodities , real estate and inflation @-@ protected bonds ) , while maximizing gains through financial leveraging . According to Bob Prince , CIO at Bridgewater Associates , the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets , low equity risk , and passive management . 
 Some scholars contend that a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight to reduce the potential for negative consequences as a result of leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels . For example , if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same , the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant . On the other hand some consider risk parity to be a passive approach , because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior . 
 The principles of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers , as they have different methods for categorizing assets into classes , different definitions of risk , different ways of allocating risk within asset classes , different methods for forecasting future risk and different ways of implementing exposure to risk . However , many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions , including passive management . The extent to which a risk parity portfolio is managed , is often the distinguishing characteristic between the various kinds of risk parity funds available today . 
 = = History = = 
 The seeds for the risk parity approach were sown when economist and Nobel Prize winner , Harry Markowitz introduced the concept of the efficient frontier into modern portfolio theory in 1952 . Then in 1958 , Nobel laureate James Tobin concluded that the efficient frontier model could be improved by adding risk @-@ free investments and he advocated leveraging a diversified portfolio to improve its risk / return ratio . The theoretical analysis of combining leverage and minimizing risk amongst multiple assets in a portfolio was also examined by Jack <unk> in 1961 , William F. Sharpe in 1964 , John Lintner in 1965 and Jan <unk> in 1966 . However , the concept was not put into practice due to the difficulties of implementing leverage in the portfolio of a large institution . 
 According to Joe Flaherty , senior vice president at MFS Investment Management , " the idea of risk parity goes back to the 1990s " . In 1996 , Bridgewater Associates launched a risk parity fund called the All Weather asset allocation strategy . Although Bridgewater Associates was the first to bring a risk parity product to market , they did not coin the term . Instead the term " risk parity " was first used by Edward Qian , of <unk> Asset Management , when he authored a white paper in 2005 . In 2008 the name Risk Parity ( short for Risk <unk> Parity ) was given to this portfolio investment category by Andrew <unk> at the investment consulting firm Alan Biller and Associates . Soon , the term was adopted by the asset management industry . In time , other firms such as Aquila Capital ( 2004 ) , <unk> , Wellington , Invesco , First Quadrant , Putnam Investments , ATP ( 2006 ) , <unk> Asset Management ( 2006 ) , BlackRock ( 2009 - formerly Barclays Global Investors ) , 1741 Asset Management ( 2009 ) , Neuberger Berman ( 2009 ) , <unk> ( 2010 ) , AQR Capital Management ( 2010 ) , Clifton Group ( 2011 ) , Salient Partners ( 2012 ) , Schroders ( 2012 ) , <unk> Asset Management ( 2013 ) and Allianz Global Investors ( 2015 ) began establishing risk parity funds .

 A white paper report from Callan Investments Institute Research in Feb 2010 reported that a " levered Risk Parity portfolio would have significantly underperformed " versus a standard institutional portfolio in the 1990s but " would have significantly outperformed " a standard institutional portfolio during the decade of 2000 to 2010 . According to a 2010 article in the Wall Street Journal " Risk @-@ parity funds held up relatively well during the financial crisis " of 2008 . For example AQR 's risk parity fund declined 18 % to 19 % in 2008 compared with the 22 % decline in the Vanguard Balanced Index fund . According to a 2013 Wall Street Journal report the risk parity type of fund offered by hedge funds has " soared in popularity " and " consistently outperformed traditional strategies since the financial crisis " . However , mutual funds using the risk parity strategy were reported to have incurred losses of 6 @.@ 75 % during the first half of the year . Proponents of risk parity argue that the value of balancing risks between asset classes will be realized over long periods including periods of recessions , growth and higher inflation regimes . Historical analysis does provide some evidence of better performance than equities in recessionary environments . 
 = = Reception = = 
 With the bullish stock market of the 1990s , equity @-@ heavy investing approaches outperformed risk parity in the near term . However after the March 2000 crash , there was an increased interest in risk parity , first among institutional investors in the United States and then in Europe . USA investors include the Wisconsin State Investment Board and the Pennsylvania Public School Employees ’ Retirement System ( <unk> ) which have invested hundreds of millions in the risk parity funds of AQR , BlackRock and Bridgewater Associates . The financial crisis of 2007 @-@ 2010 was also hard on equity @-@ heavy and Yale Model portfolios , but risk parity funds fared reasonably well . 
 Despite criticisms from skeptics , the risk parity approach has seen a " flurry of activity " following a decade of " subpar equity performance " . During the period 2005 to 2012 several companies began offering risk parity products including : Barclays Global Investors ( now BlackRock ) , Schroders , First Quadrant , Mellon Capital Management , Neuberger Berman and State Street Global Advisors . A 2011 survey of institutional investors and consultants suggests that over 50 % of America @-@ based benefit pension and endowments and foundations are currently using , or considering , risk parity products for their investment portfolios . A survey conducted by Chief Investor Officer magazine in 2014 shows how far the adoption has grown : 46 % of institutional investors surveyed are using risk parity and 8 % are considering investing . 
 = = Use of leverage = = 
 According to a 2011 article in Investments & Pensions Europe , the risk parity approach has " moderate risks " which include : communicating its value to boards of directors ; unforeseen events like the 2008 market decline ; market timing risks associated with implementation ; the use of leverage and derivatives and basis risks associated with derivatives . Other critics warn that the use of leverage and relying heavily on fixed income assets may create its own risk . Portfolio manager Ben Inker has criticized risk parity for being a benchmarking approach that gives too much relative weight to bonds when compared to other alternative portfolio approaches . However , proponents of risk parity say that its purpose is to avoid predicting future returns . Inker also says that risk parity requires too much leverage to produce the same expected returns as conventional alternatives . Proponents answer that the reduced risk from additional diversification more than offsets the additional leverage risk and that leverage through publicly traded futures and prime brokerage financing of assets also means a high percentage of cash in the portfolio to cover losses and margin calls . Additionally Inker says that bonds have negative skew , ( small probability of large losses and large probability of small gains ) which makes them a dangerous investment to leverage . Proponents have countered by saying that their approach calls for reduced exposure to bonds as volatility increases and provides less skew than conventional portfolios . 
 Proponents of the use of leverage argue that using leverage can be risk @-@ reducing rather than risk @-@ increasing provided four conditions are met : ( i ) enough unencumbered cash is kept to meet any margin calls ( ii ) leverage is applied to a well @-@ diversified portfolio ( iii ) assets can be rebalanced frequently and ( iv ) counterparty risk is minimized . 
 = = Risk parity and the bull market in bonds = = 
 A 2012 article in the Financial Times indicated possible challenges for risk parity funds " at the peak of a 30 @-@ year bull market for fixed income " . While advocates point out their diversification amongst bonds as well as " inflation @-@ linked securities , corporate credit , emerging market debt , commodities and equities , balanced by how each asset class responds to two factors : changes in the expected rate of economic growth and changes to expectations for inflation " . A 2013 article in the Financial News reported that " risk parity continues to prosper , as investors come to appreciate the better balance of different risks that it represents in an uncertain world . " 
 After the sharp fall in bond prices of 2013 ( " taper tantrum " ) , investors continued to question the impact of rising rates on risk parity portfolios or other more concentrated equity portfolios . A historical analysis of episodes of rising rates show the value in distinguishing between orderly and disorderly rising rates regimes . Risk parity has weaker performance in disorderly rising rates environments but its performance over time is not dependent on falling bond yields .

 Risk parity advocates assert that the <unk> risk parity portfolio is quite close to the tangency portfolio , as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data . Theoretical and empirical arguments are made in support of this contention . One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios . Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60 % stocks / 40 % bonds , and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage .

 " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " ( sometimes referred to as " Fancy Party " ) is the ninth episode of the third season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation , and the 39th overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 14 , 2011 . In the episode , Andy and April hold a dinner party , which turns out to be a surprise wedding , much to Leslie 's concern . Meanwhile , Ben mulls whether to remain in Pawnee or return to his old job in Indianapolis , and Ann feels extremely uncomfortable while attending a singles mixer . 
 The episode was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Michael Trim . The wedding between Andy and April was a culmination of a romantic subplot between the two characters that began in the second season episode " Hunting Trip " . The Parks and Recreation staff tried to keep the wedding secret to surprise viewers , but NBC accidentally ran a commercial advertising the wedding two months earlier , after the episode " Ron & Tammy : Part Two . " Series co @-@ creator Michael Schur initially said the promo was meant to refer to Ron and his ex @-@ wife Tammy , but later admitted it was an error . 
 " April and Andy 's Fancy Party " featured several guest performances by actors who appeared in previous episodes , including Ben Schwartz as Jean @-@ Ralphio Saperstein , Josh Duvendeck and Blake Lee as Derek and Ben , Minni Jo Mazzola as Natalie Ludgate , and Mark Rivers , Andrew Burlinson and Alan Yang as Andy 's band @-@ mates . According to Nielsen Media Research , the episode was seen by 5 @.@ 16 million household viewers , a slight increase over the previous original episode , " Camping " . It received generally positive reviews .

 During a cold open scene , Ron ( Nick Offerman ) horrifies the entire parks department by apparently pulling an aching tooth out of his own mouth with a pair of pliers . He later admits it was a prank , as a dentist had removed the tooth the previous day . Later , Andy ( Chris Pratt ) and April ( Aubrey Plaza ) invite everyone to a dinner party at the home of Andy 's band @-@ mate Burly ( Andrew Burlinson ) , where Andy is living . Ben ( Adam Scott ) tells Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) that his boss in Indianapolis wants him back on the road , but he has also been offered a job to work under Chris ( Rob Lowe ) in Pawnee . Although Leslie wants Ben to stay , she is hesitant to say so outright , disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take . 
 At the party , Leslie discovers Andy and April plan to surprise everyone by getting married that night . Leslie spends most of the party trying to dissuade them , since they have been dating less than a month and have no place to live . However , Ron believes it is not Leslie 's place to interfere with their decision . Tom ( Aziz Ansari ) is thrilled when Andy makes him his best man , but his excitement lessens when Andy also asks Ron , Chris , and several others to be his " best men " . Tom tries to throw an impromptu bachelor party and give a speech to make himself the " best " best man , but fails each time . 
 Although Leslie plans to object during the ceremony , she cannot bring herself to do it and comes to accept the marriage . Andy and April officially become husband and wife . Afterward , Ron explains to Leslie that she did not object because deep down she knew that Andy and April would get married no matter what , and that there is no correct way to do things when it comes to matters of the heart , using his own two former marriages as an example . During the reception , April privately tells Leslie how much she appreciates her , flattering Leslie . Andy makes a speech to the guests , where he calls Tom his " best " best man , much to Tom 's delight . He tells the crowd that life is short and he and April simply did what made them happy . Taking Andy ’ s advice , Leslie asks Ben to stay in Pawnee , and he surprises her by revealing that he has already accepted Chris ' job offer . 
 In a subplot , Ann ( Rashida Jones ) goes to a singles mixer where she is extremely uncomfortable . She runs into Donna ( Retta ) , who at first views Ann as competition , but then offers her advice after witnessing Ann 's awkward flirting . When Ann hears about Andy getting married from Leslie , she considers going home , as she and Andy dated for several years . Donna tells Ann to forget her past and enjoy herself in the present . Ann ends up having a good time at the mixer and gets several phone numbers .

 " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Michael Trim . It is referred to simply as " Fancy Party " in some publications . During a break between the development of the first six episodes of the season and the remaining episodes , the writing staff was contemplating what direction they should take with the romantic relationship between Andy and April . Parks co @-@ creator Michael Schur said they wanted to avoid the " standard @-@ issue TV romance plots : fights , other men / women driving them apart , and so on " . They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny , it made sense with the characters ' personalities , and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two . Schur said : " We just thought about who they were – two impulsive goofballs who don ’ t approach their lives in a responsible , adult manner – and decided , what the hell ? What if they just make a rash decision and get hitched ? " 
 The cast and crew of Parks and Recreation made a conscious effort not to discuss the Andy and April wedding during media interviews with the hopes of keeping it a surprise . However , after the original broadcast of the third season episode " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " , NBC ran a commercial advertising " April and Andy 's wedding registry " on the official Parks and Recreation website . At this point in the series , April and Andy were separated and had not yet reconciled . Shortly after the episode aired , HitFix television reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the commercial mistakenly used the wrong names and was actually referring to Ron and Tammy 's wedding registry . However , after " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " aired , Schur admitted the commercial was intended to run with that episode , but ran with " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " due to an error by NBC employees : 
 " In an effort to undo the spoiler , we publicly stated , in a number of interviews , that NBC had just accidentally gotten the character names wrong , and that there was no upcoming Andy @-@ April wedding . We sincerely hope that fans of the show are cool with us gently lying to them , in an effort to maintain the surprise nuptials as much as we could . Now if you 'll excuse us , we have to go shoot the season finale surprise Jerry @-@ Donna wedding scene . " 
 " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " featured several guest performances by actors who had appeared in previous Parks and Recreation episodes . Ben Schwartz reprised his role as Tom 's playboy @-@ like friend Jean @-@ Ralphio Saperstein . April 's flower men were Ben and Derek , played by Josh Duvendeck and Blake Lee .

Andy 's band Mouse Rat , which has appeared in previous episodes starting with the first season finale " Rock Show " , also appeared in " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " . Mark Rivers played the drums , Andrew Burlinson played guitar and Parks and Recreation screenwriter Alan Yang played bass guitar . Eric <unk> made his first appearance on the show as Orin , a creepy Goth friend of April . The character was mentioned offhandedly in the episode " Time Capsule " and Dippold loved the idea of him , so she worked Orin into the script . 
 The day the episode first aired , the term " Ron Swanson " , and the misspelled " Rob Swanson " , were so commonly discussed on the social @-@ networking website Twitter that they were listed among the site 's trending topics , which are indicative of being the most popular topics being discussed on Twitter at a given moment .

 " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " received generally positive reviews . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it " one of the funniest , sweetest , just plain best episodes of this season of this great comedy " , and that it embodied " intoxicating mix of laughs and sweetness that " Parks and Rec " consistently nails " . Sepinwall particularly praised the scene when April declared her love for Leslie , and enjoyed the comedic pairing of Ann and Donna . Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the episode showed Parks and Recreation in " top form " , and he praised the episode for avoiding television cliches about weddings . In most shows , he wrote , April and Andy would have been persuaded to stop the wedding at the last moment , or Andy would have panicked after realizing the enormity of what he had done . Matt Fowler of IGN called the episode " charming , effortless , and hilarious " and wrote " the strength of this episode was that it actually convinced us all that April and Andy getting married , after just a month of dating , was a great idea " . TV Guide writer Matt Roush called " Andy and April 's Fancy Wedding " the highlight of the night among NBC 's Thursday comedy shows , and said he particularly loved the scene with Ron Swanson pulling out his tooth , and another later scene where Ron criticized Chris for bringing a vegetarian loaf to the party instead of cake . 
 ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas said the fact that Andy and April 's wedding was subdued , not overhyped in commercials to attract ratings , shows how much the writers understand and respect their characters . He also praised the episode 's blend of " humor and heart " , of which he said : " No show on the air , and few shows I can think of ever , does it better . " Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he was surprised by the wedding twist , particularly by the fact that the wedding was not stopped at the last moment by a " TV @-@ style complication " . He also praised the subplot with Ann and Donna , and said he hoped the two characters would continue to interact with each other throughout the season . The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " showed how well the April and Andy characters have developed since their romantic story arc began in the second season episode " Hunting Trip " . Meslow said the episode " couldn 't have been better " and was even effective during unabashed sentimental scenes , like the wedding itself and April voicing her appreciation for Leslie . Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the wedding felt appropriate for the two characters , and he enjoyed the progression of Leslie going from dreading the wedding to accepting it . Heisler wrote , " Truly , I don 't think I 've ever watched an episode of Parks & Rec without feeling great at the end . " 
 Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the fact that the wedding scene works shows how genuine the characters are and how well they are presented by the writers . Sundermann also praised the cold open with Ron ripping his tooth out , and said he enjoyed the way Ann Perkins ' character has continued to develop through the season . Steve Kandell of New York magazine called April and Andy perhaps the " most convincingly matched and resoundingly sympathetic couple in sitcom history " , and said their storylines have been handled much more effectively than those of Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly in the NBC comedy The Office . Kandell was more critical of the Ann character , and said she did not seem to fit as a part of the show anymore . Some reviews were less positive . Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said there were individual elements of the episode she enjoyed , but felt the wedding happened too quickly and the lack of buildup reduced the tension leading up to the event . Joel Keller of TV Squad said , " In a mostly stellar season , this one sits near the bottom of the list . " Keller said the wedding ruined an otherwise funny episode , and that it felt ineffective and rushed because April and Andy were fighting with each other only four episodes earlier . He also criticized the Ann Perkins character : " I 've never seen Rashida Jones play a character this wishy @-@ washy before , and it 's not pleasant to watch . " 
 = September 2009 Vietnam tropical depression = 
 The September 2009 Vietnam tropical depression was a weak tropical depression that caused deadly flooding throughout central Vietnam in early September . Forming out of an area of low pressure on September 3 , the depression hardly intensified as it meandered off the coast of Vietnam . Initially situated in a favorable environment , convective banding features began to develop and shower and thunderstorm activity formed near the center . On September 4 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ; however , a sudden increase in wind shear caused the system to rapidly become disorganized , leading to the cancellation of the alert the next day . The system continued to slowly track off the coast of Vietnam , nearly dissipating on September 5 , before becoming better organized . However , the depression remained weak , with the JTWC reporting on September 7 that the depression had dissipated , though the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) continued to issue advisories until the depression dissipated during September 9 . 
 Although the depression did not make landfall , the outer rainbands of the storm led to heavy rainfall throughout central Vietnam , peaking at 430 mm ( 17 in ) . The ensuing floods killed at least six people and left three others missing . Large areas of cropland were inundated by the waters and numerous homes were damaged .

 The tropical depression originated from an area of low pressure in the South China Sea on September 1 . Scattered convection was associated with the system , with the center devoid of showers and thunderstorms , as the low slowly tracked westward in a weak steering environment . Weak outflow had formed along the northern edge of the system ; however , intensification was not anticipated . The following day , convection began to form around the center of circulation and weak diffluence was noted around the system due to an anticyclone to the north . With low wind shear , convective banding features began to develop and the possibility of the system becoming a tropical cyclone increased . Early on September 3 , the JMA began issuing advisories on the cyclone , classifying it as a tropical depression , the twentieth depression to be monitored by the JMA during the season . 
 Although the system had a partially exposed low @-@ level circulation center , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) as the depression was likely to intensify as it was situated over high sea surface temperatures and in a favorable environment . However , by September 4 , wind shear quickly increased and dislocated all of the convection associated with the depression from the center of circulation . This led to the JTWC canceling their TCFA as the environment was no longer favorable for development . The following day , the JTWC declared that the system had dissipated and was no longer a suspect area for tropical cyclone development as the system was virtually stationary off the coast of Vietnam . The JMA , on the other hand , continued to monitor the cyclone as a tropical depression . Although previously declaring that the system dissipated early on September 6 , the JTWC began monitoring the re @-@ developing system later that day . Convective banding had reformed , wind shear had decreased and the cyclone had less interaction with land as it slowly moved further into the South China Sea . However , late on September 8 , both agencies declared that the depression had dissipated off the coast of Vietnam .

Sixty @-@ one tons of fish were swept away during the floods and 8 @,@ 700 hectares of rice fields were destroyed . The city of Da Nang sustained the worst flooding from the storm , with some areas reporting flood depths of .8 m ( 2 @.@ 6 ft ) .

In Quảng Ngãi Province , two fishermen were left missing and five other people were injured by the storm . At least three homes sustained severe damage . Residents throughout Quảng Trị Province were advised to evacuate to safer areas as numerous landslides threatened homes . 
 Numerous bridges were washed away by flood waters exceeding 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) , isolating several communities . In the Sơn Tịnh District , 76 structures were destroyed by flooding and high winds .

 " Bethena , A Concert Waltz " ( copyright registered March 6 , 1905 ) is a composition by Scott Joplin . It was the first Joplin work since his wife Freddie 's death on September 10 , 1904 of pneumonia , ten weeks after their wedding . At the time the composer had significant financial problems ; the work did not sell successfully at the time of publication and was soon neglected and forgotten . It was rediscovered as a result of the Joplin revival in the 1970s and has received acclaim from Joplin 's biographers and other critics . The piece combines two different styles of music , the classical waltz and the rag , and has been seen as demonstrating Joplin 's excellence as a classical composer . The work has been described as " an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of Ragtime Waltzes " , a " masterpiece " , and " Joplin 's finest waltz " . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 Joplin 's principal claim to fame was the publication in 1899 of the Maple Leaf Rag , which became a best @-@ selling instrumental hit , and provided the composer with a steady income for the rest of his life from the royalties . Despite this success early on in his career ( he was named as the " King of Ragtime " by numerous contemporaries ) , he had continued financial problems and never repeated the success of the Maple Leaf Rag . In the fall of 1903 , Joplin lost a large amount of money on the national tour of his first opera , A Guest of Honor , when the box office receipts were stolen by an unidentified associate . Joplin 's belongings , including the score for the opera , were confiscated for non @-@ payment of his boarding @-@ house bills . The opera is now considered lost , as no copy was registered with the Copyright Office , and none has been found since . Subsequently , Joplin was short of money and is thought to have been actively seeking commissions . 
 After divorce from his first wife Belle — a " disastrous " relationship underscored by the loss of their infant daughter — Joplin married his 19 @-@ year @-@ old second wife Freddie in June 1904 . He had dedicated to her his rag The Chrysanthemum which was published in that year . She died on 10 September 1904 of pneumonia ten weeks after their wedding . Joplin 's whereabouts are unknown from that point until early 1905 , when he returned to St. Louis , Missouri where some of Joplin 's known associates , such as pianist Louis Chauvin and musician Joe Jordan , still lived . On 6 March , Joplin registered the copyright of Bethena , A Concert Waltz , and dedicated the work to the otherwise little @-@ known " Mr. and Mrs. Dan E. Davenport of St. Louis Mo " . The copyright date is significant because not all Joplin works were registered for copyright purposes and there is a lack of detail about many aspects of Joplin 's life , including when many of the pieces were composed . 
 Biographer Edward Berlin speculated that this dedication was unusual because the Davenports were not able to help Joplin professionally by showcasing his work or commissioning more , but was a recognition of the personal support that they had given him through the difficult time after Freddie 's death . The origin of the name " Bethena " is a mystery , and the identity of the woman featured on the cover of the work 's original publication is unknown . It has been claimed that the image is of Freddie from her wedding day , although positive identification is made more difficult because the photograph on the cover of the piece does not show the subject 's race clearly . 
 The work was published by the " T. Bahnsen Piano Manufacturing Company , St. Louis " , a firm which only published two other Joplin compositions . Berlin speculates that at this point in his career , despite the fame brought by the Maple Leaf Rag , Joplin was unable to arrange favorable terms with publishers ; for example Joplin announced in July 1905 the completion of the song " You Stand Good with Me , Babe " which was never published , and no copies of the song have ever been found . Bethena was released at a difficult time for Joplin , both emotionally and financially ; most of the compositions released in the two and a half years since the death of Freddie had been by little @-@ known and insignificant publishers , were largely unnoticed at the time of publication and , except for Bethena , were not " quality Joplin " . Joplin 's finances remained in an unsatisfactory state and he wrote several works for hire . 
 = = Form = = 
 Introduction A BB A CC DD EE A Coda 
 Bethena has five musical strains in five different keys ; G major , B @-@ flat major , F major , B minor , and D major respectively . The sections are linked by " transitional passages " which enable the work to change key between the strains by means of a chromatic interlude or modulation . Each of the themes is written with the instruction " Cantabile " , which means " <unk> and flowing in style " . 
 The piece is notated in 3 / 4 time with the main theme repeated three times in the work as well as in the introduction and the coda . The " sadly poignant " , " graceful , wistful " and tenderly nostalgic mood is partly dictated by this main theme , which starts with the melody note A harmonised against a G major chord thus creating a dissonance . In the next measure the theme is set against a different harmony before Joplin creates variations . There are variants of the theme in the " haunting " B minor key of the D strain and in the E strain 's D major key which " brightens the mood " . 
 Joplin combines the waltz ' " oom @-@ pa @-@ pah " rhythm and its conventionally accented three quarter notes in the bass , with a syncopated melody in the treble . The main melody line used in the introduction and then repeated regularly throughout , with its alternate unaccented eighth notes and accented quarter notes , is the rhythm of the Cakewalk minus the final note . The Cakewalk was a popular African @-@ American dance which originated in plantation slave communities in nineteenth century America , and ultimately contributed to the musical style Ragtime . The simultaneous sounding of the two independent rhythms , he combination of the waltz in the bass and the syncopation of the main theme in the treble , is an example of a 4 against 3 polyrhythm . There are many subtle variations of this sequence which occur throughout the work . 
 The left hand follows the standard approach of classical waltzes , with a bass note followed by two mid @-@ range chords , and in addition there are some contrapuntal passages where two melodies move independently but complement each other harmonically . For example the B and C themes are examples of Joplin employing counterpoint in octaves . The B theme in the key of B @-@ flat major is closely related to the main theme presenting its counterpoint with the bass and the treble melody lines moving in opposite directions ( in contrary motion ) , to each other and then exchanging their melodies ( bars 29 @-@ 30 and 31 @-@ 32 ) . This pattern repeats itself during the theme . In the opening phrase ( bars 77 @-@ 81 ) of the " rag @-@ like " C theme in the key of F major , counterpoint is evident with the harmony of the treble moving in contrary motion to the bass line in a similar way to that used in the B section . In the treble , the harmony falls from F to D , while the bass rises from F to G @-@ sharp 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 It is not clear what the composition 's reception was at the time , and the piece 's publication by a company which had little previous experience of this endeavour indicate that there was little positive impact on the composer 's financial problems . Joplin wanted to be considered as a serious artist , and spoke of his preference for " classical music " . Compositions such as Bethena , A Concert Waltz and his operas A Guest of Honor and <unk> indicate that he was trying to be taken seriously as a composer . Like many of his other works , Bethena was largely forgotten after Joplin 's death from syphilis in 1917 . The slow revival and re @-@ discovery of Ragtime and Joplin started in the 1940s , although it concentrated on the rags such as the Maple Leaf Rag , rather than Bethena . 
 Joshua Rifkin 's 1970 LP Piano Rags by Scott Joplin played a part in the Joplin revival of that decade , with sales of over 100 @,@ 000 in the first year and subsequently becoming Nonesuch Records ' first disk to sell over 1 million copies . Bethena was one of the pieces performed on the 1972 follow @-@ up , Volume 2 . The Billboard " Best @-@ Selling Classical LPs " chart for 28 September 1974 has the first record at number 5 , with the follow @-@ up " Volume 2 " at number 4 , and a combined set of both volumes at number 3 . Separately both volumes had been on the chart for 64 weeks . In 1979 New York Magazine wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin 's music on disk Nonesuch Records " created , almost alone , the Scott Joplin revival . " 
 The composition was featured on the soundtrack to the 2008 Hollywood film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button . The performance of the composition by the pianist Randy Kerber was described by one critic on National Public Radio as " letting the inherent wistfulness of the music emerge " , with the piece " perfectly suited " to the movie as it was a " tender and heartfelt remembrance of a love lost " . 
 Joplin biographer Edward A. Berlin believed that Bethena was " an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtime waltzes " because of the repeated main theme in G major , the contrapuntal passages , and the harmonies . Another biographer , Rudi <unk> , wrote that the work was a " masterpiece " , thanks to its rhythmic variations , the beauty of each strain 's melodies and the richly scored harmony , especially when considered in comparison to the unsyncopated light salon style of Binks Waltz published in the same year . In another publication , <unk> described the work as " Joplin 's finest waltz " . 
 Other critics have praised the piece , with the author of a survey of American music noting that the rhythms of the waltz and ragtime combined to produce an " ingenious and delightful example of such a stylistic accommodation " , showing that the composer was an " adventurous classicist par excellence " because he was able to combine tradition and innovation in a consistently inventive way . Another critic , the arranger of Joplin 's music for solo Guitar , wrote that Bethena displayed Joplin 's characteristic syncopated style in a " seductive " manner even in the waltz 's 3 / 4 time signature . 
 = Jump ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Jump " is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) . Written by Madonna , Stuart Price and Joe Henry , the song was supposed to be released as the third single of the album . However , since " Get Together " was decided as the third single , " Jump " was released as the fourth and final single from the album , on October 31 , 2006 by Warner Bros. Records . The song incorporates techno music with tributes to Pet Shop Boys . Madonna sings in her lower register in the song . Its lyrics talk about self @-@ empowerment and sufficiency while looking for the prospects of a new relationship . 
 Contemporary critics complimented the song and its empowerment theme . They compared it to Madonna 's 1980s music and praised the club @-@ anthem like quality of the song . The song peaked inside the top ten of the charts of some European countries , while peaking the charts in Italy and Hungary . In the United States , " Jump " placed in several Billboard dance charts and became one of the most popular dance hits of the decade . 
 The accompanying music video was shot in Tokyo during Madonna 's 2006 Confessions Tour stopover . It portrayed Madonna in a blond bob wig and a leather ensemble singing the song in front of a number of neon signs . The video also featured dancers who performed the physical discipline parkour . It was also incorporated in her Confessions Tour , where Madonna and her dancers jumped around the stage actively , while singing the song . The song was used in the movie The Devil Wears Prada ( 2005 ) and the Ugly Betty season 2 finale .

 The idea for " Jump " came from Joe Henry who presented it to Madonna and developed it into a song . During an interview with the singer for the British gay lifestyle magazine Attitude , journalist Matthew Todd described that " Jump " as an inspiration for " a whole generation of gay kids to pack their bags and head to the big city " , to which Madonna happily agreed . Initially it was to be released as the third single from the album . However , the song " Get Together " was chosen as the third single from the album to coincide with the start of Madonna 's 2006 Confessions Tour . The decision was also spurred by the fact that " Get Together " was the third best selling digital single from the Confessions on a Dance Floor album . Its digital sales stood at 20 @,@ 000 at that time , whereas digital sales for " Jump " was only 9 @,@ 000 . Hence , " Get Together " was finally chosen as the third single . On July 12 , 2006 , Billboard confirmed " Jump " to be the fourth single from the Confessions on a Dance Floor album .

 Musically the song is inspired by the 1980s . Essentially a club anthem , the song finds Madonna singing in her lower register . It incorporates the techno music played in the clubs of Ibiza . The song is set in common time with moderately fast dance groove tempo and a metronome of 126 beats per minute . It is set in the key of E major . Madonna 's voice spans from D3 to A4 . It follows in the chord progression of E – D – C – D in the verses , and C – D – E in the chorus , with an E synth drone playing continually . Lyrically the song talks about empowerment and the urge to move on . It also reflected Madonna 's change of style from her previous singles and shifting her focus on self @-@ sufficiency . The line " I can make it alone " in the song demonstrated the shift . The lyrics of " Jump " have been compared to the lyrics of Madonna 's 1990 song " Keep It Together " from the Like a Prayer album . The difference between them is that " Jump " focuses more on the potentials of finding new love rather than family values .

 Keith Caulfield from Billboard complimented the song 's " empowerment " theme , adding that " the song is a pulsing pop tune that has a positive universal message about <unk> in yourself " . According to the BBC , " ' Jump ' whisks the listener back to the heady eighties . " While reviewing the album , Alan Braidwood from BBC called the song as " lethally catchy " and one of the album 's highlights . Jennifer Vineyard from MTV noticed that " Jump " sounded like a sequel to Madonna 's 1990 single " Keep It Together " . Jon Pareles of The New York Times in review of Confessions on a Dance Floor , wrote that Madonna 's " somber side sounds best in ' Jump ' , about the urge to move on " . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that the song is a " gritty club anthem that wouldn 't have sounded out of place on Erotica , showcases her lower register " . David Browne from Entertainment Weekly called the song , along with previous single " Get Together " as fluid in nature . 
 Thomas Inskeep of Stylus magazine noted , " ... nearly the whole of ' Jump ' sounds to these ears like a Pet Shop Boys homage . " Matt <unk> of The Chicago Maroon wrote : " The stand @-@ out tracks here are ' Jump ' and ' Push ' , which sound as close to the 80s Madonna as we 're probably ever going to get again . The lyrics of Jump ' are joyous , recalling the fun , community @-@ minded Madonna of True Blue and Like a Prayer . " Diego Costa of UWM Post wrote that " Jump " is a " bossy , slightly sadistic spoken intro by Madonna , just like in ' Erotica ' , so who can resist ? A knock @-@ yourself @-@ out , club @-@ tailored take on the wasteful nature of inertia . " Margaret Moser of The Austin Chronicle called the song " slinky and sexy " .

 In the United States , the song was aimed and promoted at the Adult Contemporary and Hot AC format of radio . Warner Bros wanted to establish the song as a hit at those formats before they attempted to bring it to Top 40 CHR radio stations . However , the song reached a peak of 21 on this chart on the issue dated January 27 , 2007 . It was also used in the soundtrack of the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada and received minimal airplay on the CHR stations . 
 After its release to the iTunes Store , the song climbed up the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart and peaked at five , failing to progress further and chart on the Hot 100 . It became Madonna 's 37th number @-@ one single on the Hot Dance Club Play chart reaching the top on the issue dated November 18 , 2006 .

 While finishing her Confessions Tour in Japan , Madonna took time out from her schedule to shoot the video for " Jump " . The shoot took place in various outdoor locations throughout Tokyo , as well as on a soundstage . Madonna and hairstylist Andy <unk> decided to try a new look for her , a platinum blonde bob wig . She wore this wig in the last two nights of the Confessions Tour , and the look received compliments . Madonna also wore a black leather garment , which an Entertainment Weekly writer wrote accentuated her " toned body " . 
 The video featured the physical discipline parkour , in which parkour artist Sébastien Foucan performed routines around the buildings of Tokyo . The video begins showing the Tokyo skyline and parkour artists standing on rooftops . As the spoken introduction starts , Madonna is shown in her wig dancing in front of a number of neon signs which contain the words Madonna and Jump in Japanese . The song continues with the dancers jumping from buildings and running through the lanes of the city . Madonna dances to the music and swivels around metallic rods in and around her , of the same design present in her tour . Before the final chorus , the dancers cease their parkour routines and stand on a lamppost . 
 As the chorus starts , Foucan is joined by parkour <unk> Levi <unk> and Exo as they continue their routine around buildings . The video ends with Madonna stretching her arm and a shot of the Tokyo evening @-@ sky . Entertainment Weekly was not impressed with the video overall commenting , " [ f ] <unk> about low concept , we 're talking no concept !

 " Homer Simpson in : " Kidney Trouble " " is the eighth episode of The Simpsons ' tenth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 6 , 1998 . In the episode Grampa 's kidneys explode , leaving him in urgent need of a donor . His son Homer initially agrees to donate one of his kidneys , but after hearing of side effects of only having one kidney , he begins to have second thoughts about the operation . 
 " Homer Simpson in : " Kidney Trouble " " was directed by Mike B. Anderson and written by John Swartzwelder , although the episode 's premise was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer . Meyer also pitched the sequence involving the " ship of lost souls " , which received mixed reactions from The Simpsons staff members . The episode contains references to Night of the Living Dead and North by Northwest , among other things . In its original broadcast , the episode was seen by approximately 7 @.@ 2 million viewers and finished in 54th place in the ratings the week it aired . Following the release of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season , " Homer Simpson in : " Kidney Trouble " " received mixed reviews from critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer decides to take Marge and the kids down to Bloodbath Gulch , a ghost town turned tourist destination . On their way there , Homer 's car breaks down , right in front of the Springfield Retirement Castle , leaving Grampa to assume that they have come to visit him on his birthday . Homer tries his hardest to start the car up again , but is eventually forced to take Grampa with them after he is able to reach them . While in the town bar , Grampa drinks too much sarsaparilla and just as the family is leaving , says he needs to go to the bathroom . Homer refuses to stop , saying that he needs to get home in time to watch an episode of Inside the Actors Studio featuring F. Murray Abraham . Grampa is forced to hold it in for hours and as a result , his kidneys explode . Homer ignored this at first , thinking he needed a new muffler for the car . Dr. Hibbert informs the family that Grampa does not have much time to live , and that the only way he can be saved is if Homer donates one of his kidneys . Homer happily agrees , and is admired and pampered for it by his wife and kids . However , he becomes frightened after finding out about the risks involved in the operation and , while he makes it to the hospital , jumps out a window at the last minute . 
 Guilt @-@ ridden and ashamed , Homer deems himself unworthy of living amongst civilized people and decides to start a new life at sea , climbing aboard Captain McAllister 's ship , described as " the ship of lost souls " ( though the back of the ship reads , " Honeybunch " , because McAllister never painted over the name ) . While there , he meets several strange people including a man who looks and sounds like Peter Lorre , who have their own tales of misery . Homer tells them his story but is kicked off of the ship when he mentions that he ran away and left his father to die . Homer eventually drifts back to shore , where he witnesses a father and son build a sand castle and laments how he never had such a relationship with his own father or his kids . Homer decides determinedly to rectify his mistake and takes off for the hospital , trampling the sand castle in the process . 
 Homer arrives in time , reconciling with Grampa and apologizing for his behavior , but ultimately panics and flees again when Dr. Hibbert says " ... this may sting a little " . Homer 's mad dash from the hospital is stopped by an oncoming truck . While the driver ( Hans Moleman ) manages to hit the brakes just in time , one of the cars it was carrying slides off and lands on Homer . Homer later wakes up in traction in a hospital bed , and is greeted by Dr. Hibbert , Marge and the kids . Believing Grampa is dead , Homer sadly vows to visit his grave after he gets better . However Grampa , who is alive and well , appears in the doorway and declares that he 's never felt better . From the sheepish look of the others in the room , Homer looks down and discovers that , while he was unconscious , they took out one of his kidneys . Angry at first , Homer vows to get it back , but settles down after his family tells him that he did the right thing for Grampa . They engage in a group hug , and Homer proceeds to consider Bart as a potential donor for himself .

 " Homer Simpson in : " Kidney Trouble " " was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Mike B. Anderson . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 6 , 1998 . Although it was written by Swartzwelder , the idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer . Nevertheless , the episode still contains several " classic Swartzwelder moments " according to executive producer Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , including Homer escaping on a handcart and the line " this is everybody 's fault but mine " . Because the episode contained several scenes of the Simpsons driving , the animators " orchestrated " the scenes by using several different backgrounds . At one point in the episode 's setpiece , an arranged gunfight is seen . In the gunfight , there would originally be a man saying " Look , up on the roof , it 's a prostitute " and shoot her . Although he thought the gag was funny , Mike Scully , an executive producer and the showrunner for the episode , cut it because the word " prostitute " had already been uttered " at least a dozen times in the episode " . According to Scully , the Fox censors objected to showing Grampa giving Homer NyQuil in order to sleep . Scully compromised it by not showing the NyQuil label in the episode . The music that plays during the establishing shot of Springfield Hospital is based on the theme music from Ben Casey , an American medical drama series from the 1960s . 
 The sequence involving the " Ship of lost souls " was also pitched by Meyer . It was the last part of the episode to be animated , and was completed in one week . The Simpsons staff were split on whether to include the sequence in the episode at all , with series creator Matt Groening being notably hesitant . " I was very worried about that when I saw the script , " he said in the DVD commentary for the episode . Meyer was also unsure of the sequence : " You don 't see it coming at least , " he said , " I don 't know if it was totally successful . " Scully thought fondly of it however , calling it " very inspired " . The English soldier , French man and the tuxedo @-@ wearing man on the ship were both portrayed by main cast member Dan Castellaneta , who also plays Homer among other characters in the series . The woman on the ship was voiced by American voice actress Tress MacNeille . Honeybunch , the name of the sea captain 's boat , was pitched by Scully 's brother Brian Scully . The name came from Scully 's father , who used to call his wife Honeybunch as a term of endearment . 
 In a scene in the episode , the Simpsons , outside the Springfield Retirement Castle , try to turn on their car , while Grampa is slowly walking towards them . The scene parodies the 1968 film Night of the Living Dead , with Grampa acting as a zombie from the film . The dancing robots in the Western bar were based on English charity campaigner Heather Mills , while the robot cowboy chasing the robot dancer around in a circle on the bar 's balcony is a reference to a scene in the original Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland , where the pirates chased women in a similar fashion . The design and voice of the tuxedo @-@ wearing man in the " Ship of lost souls " were based on Austrian @-@ American actor Peter Lorre . Also , the bride is loosely based on Miss Havisham from Great Expectations . The scene of Homer nearly getting hit by a car during his second escape from the hospital is a reference to a scene in the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock film North by Northwest , in which Cary Grant 's character is almost hit by an oncoming truck . American actor Larry Hagman is also mentioned in the episode , when Dr. Hibbert says that Hagman took all the kidneys and livers needed for donors , while Homer states his desire to watch the episode of Inside The Actor 's Studio featuring F.

 = Wake Me Up ( Girls Aloud song ) = 
 " Wake Me Up " is a song recorded by British girl group Girls Aloud from their second studio album , What Will the Neighbours Say ? ( 2004 ) . It was released by Polydor Records on 21 February 2005 , as the fourth single from the album . The song had been initially considered as the lead single , however , it was deemed as sounding too harsh and the record company did not want to take the risk . The track was written by Miranda Cooper , Brian Higgins , Tim Powell , Shawn Lee , Lisa Cowling , Paul Woods and <unk> Maru 'e . " Wake Me Up " is a pop rock song composed of a " garage rock guitar riff " . It received mixed reviews from music critics . While some described it as predictable , others wrote that it appeared to be an attempt to recapture the sound of some of their previous release . Alex Kapranos , the lead singer of indie rock band Franz Ferdinand , said " Wake Me Up " inspired the band to work with producer Brian Higgins . 
 " Wake Me Up " debuted and peaked at number 4 on the UK Singles Chart , and became the band 's first single to miss the top three . The song also peaked inside the top ten in Ireland , but missed the top ten in Europe . The accompanying music video was directed by Harvey & Carolyn , and portrays the band as rocker chicks as they ride motorcycles along a desert road . " Wake Me Up " has been performed on all of the group 's concert tours , and also in a few live television appearances , including twice at the Top of the Pops , where Harley Davidson lent motorbikes for the members to use for the first performance , and at Today with Des and Mel . In 2005 , " Wake Me Up " won the award for the Popjustice £ 20 Music Prize , an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer ( s ) of the best British pop single of the past year .

 Following a brief hiatus , Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud 's second album in its entirety , following the success of their debut album . Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group 's contract unless he produced songs for the album . He continued , saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs , however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted . The album was recorded from April to September 2004 , with the lead single being released in June 2004 . 
 For the lead single from What Will the Neighbours Say ? , Polydor presented the band four singles choices , including " The Show " , " Wake Me Up " , " Graffiti My Soul " , and " Androgynous Girls " . Although " Wake Me Up " was the preferred choice , and also Sarah Harding 's favorite from the album , it was deemed as sounding too harsh and the record company didn 't want to take the risk . They also added " Androgynous Girls " as a b @-@ side to the album 's second single three months later . " The pressure to come up with singles was , as always , immense . But [ ... ] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio , " Higgins said . They decided to release " The Show " , which was debuted on 28 June 2004 , less than six months after the release of " Jump " . 
 " Wake Me Up " was eventually released as the fourth and final single from the album on 21 February 2005 . The first verse was recorded on the last day of sessions for What Will the Neighbours Say ? . Kimberley Walsh 's " dressed up and put on my make up " line was considered a " pivotal " point in the recording process . " Wake Me Up " was released on two CD single formats , as well as an additional 7 " picture disc . The first disc included a remix of Girls Aloud 's previous single , a cover version of The Pretenders ' " I 'll Stand by You " . The second CD format included the Tony Lamezma 's Love Affair remix of " Wake Me Up " , as well as an exclusive b @-@ side : the previously unreleased ballad , entitled " History " , which was co @-@ written by the band . The 7 " picture disc includes the Gravitas Club Mix of " Wake Me Up " and another new b @-@ side : another ballad , " Loving Is Easy " , which was also co @-@ written by Girls Aloud . It only appeared on vinyl until its inclusion on the special edition rarities disc of Girls Aloud 's first greatest hits album , The Sound of Girls Aloud , along with a demo version of " Wake Me Up " , which features an alternate first verse .

 Described as having a garage rock inspired guitar riff , " Wake Me Up " is a fast @-@ paced pop rock song with a " crunchy electro " sound . MusicOMH reviewer John Murphy said that the song " marries a garage rock guitar sound to strange , almost Aphex Twin @-@ like sound effects . " It was reported that Girls Aloud were going to re @-@ record the song because " <unk> are wary of playing the song on children 's TV in its unaltered form . " Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that the song sounds like what would happen if " you married an alarmingly fast techno thud to an implausibly dumb three @-@ chord garage rock riff . " A BBC Music critic , however , deemed the track , along with " Deadlines & Diets " and " I Say a Prayer for You " , an " <unk> predictable mix of well @-@ produced tunes covering the various pop styles and themes . " Reviewing Girls Aloud 's first greatest hits album , Paul Scott of Stylus Magazine said that " Wake Me Up " , " Long Hot Summer " ( 2005 ) and " Something Kinda Ooooh " ( 2006 ) , " all feel , to varying degrees , like attempts to recapture [ the ] seductive bludgeoning " of " The Show " . In 2005 , " Wake Me Up " won the award for the Popjustice £ 20 Music Prize , an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer ( s ) of the best British pop single of the past year .

 = SMS Mecklenburg = 
 SMS Mecklenburg ( " His Majesty 's Ship Mecklenburg " ) was the fifth ship of the Wittelsbach class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the German Imperial Navy . Laid down in May 1900 at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin , she was finished in May 1903 . Her sisters were Wittelsbach , Zähringen , Wettin , and Schwaben ; they were the first capital ships built under the Navy Law of 1898 , brought about by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz . Mecklenburg was armed with a main battery of four 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns and had a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Mecklenburg spent the first period of her active duty career in the I Squadron of the German fleet . During this period , she participated in the peacetime routine of training cruises and exercises . After the start of World War I in August 1914 , the ship was mobilized with her sisters as the IV Battle Squadron . She saw limited duty both in the Baltic Sea against Russian naval forces , and as a guard ship in the North Sea . The threat from submarines and naval mines had grown significantly by 1916 , and coupled with severe shortages in personnel , forced the German High Command to withdraw the ship from active service in January 1916 . For the remainder of her career , Mecklenburg served as a prison ship and as a barracks ship based in Kiel . The ship was stricken from the navy list in January 1920 and sold for scrapping the following year . 
 = = Description = = 
 Mecklenburg was 126 @.@ 8 m ( 416 ft 0 in ) long overall ; she had a beam of 22 @.@ 8 m ( 74 ft 10 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 95 m ( 26 ft 1 in ) forward . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion engines that drove three screws . Steam was provided by six coal @-@ fired Thornycroft boilers and six coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . Mecklenburg 's powerplant was rated at 14 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 13 @,@ 808 ihp ; 10 @,@ 297 kW ) , which gave her a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men . 
 Mecklenburg 's main armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns . Her weaponry was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all submerged in the hull ; one was in the bow , one in the stern , and the other four were on the broadside . Her armored belt was 225 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) thick in the central portion that protected her magazines and machinery spaces , and the deck was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The main battery turrets had 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor plating . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Mecklenburg 's keel was laid on 15 May 1900 , at the AG Vulcan in Stettin , under construction number 248 . She was ordered under the contract name " F " , as a new unit for the fleet . The vessel was the last member of the first class of battleships built under the direction of State Secretary Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , according to the terms of the Navy Law of 1898 . Mecklenburg , the last vessel of her class , was launched on 9 November 1901 ; the ceremony was attended by Frederick Francis IV , Grand Duke of Mecklenburg @-@ Schwerin . Fitting out work proceeded faster on Mecklenburg than on her sister Schwaben , and so the former was commissioned first , on 25 May 1903 , a full year before Schwaben . The ship 's cost totaled 22 @,@ 329 @,@ 000 marks . 
 Following her commissioning , Mecklenburg began sea trials , which lasted until mid @-@ December 1903 . She was assigned to the II Division of the I Squadron , alongside the battleships Kaiser Karl der Grosse and Kaiser Wilhelm II . Mecklenburg had to enter the drydock at Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) at Wilhelmshaven for minor improvements and repairs following her trials ; this work lasted until the end of February 1904 . After completion of these modifications , Mecklenburg took part in individual and squadron training exercises , and a fleet review for the visiting British King Edward VII in June . The following month , the German fleet went on a cruise to Britain , the Netherlands , and Norway that lasted until August . Mecklenburg then participated in the annual autumn fleet exercises , which took place in late August and September , and a winter training cruise in November and December . 
 Starting in mid @-@ December , Mecklenburg went into dock at Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance ; this work lasted until the beginning of March 1905 . After emerging from drydock , Mecklenburg joined her sister ship Wittelsbach on a cruise through the Skagerrak to Kiel . While steaming through the Great Belt on 3 March , Mecklenburg struck the Hatter Reef off Denmark and became stuck . Her other sister Wettin and the light cruiser Ariadne were sent to assist Wittelsbach in pulling Mecklenburg free from the reef . Mecklenburg then steamed to Kiel under her own power , where dockyard workers discovered a large dent in her bottom . Repair work was completed at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven by 20 April . She thereafter participated in the normal routine of training cruises and maneuvers with the rest of the fleet for the remainder of the year . During this period , the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet while it was moored in Swinemünde . From mid @-@ February to the end of March 1906 , Mecklenburg was in the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven for her annual overhaul . The training routine continued without incident through 1907 , though in early April 1908 , a major accident in one of her broadside torpedo rooms nearly sank the ship . Water began to flood the ship and could only be stopped by sealing the torpedo tubes from the outside . Repairs lasted until May . 
 Mecklenburg participated in a training cruise to the Azores in July and August 1908 . She also won the Kaiser 's Schießpreis ( Shooting Prize ) for the most accurate gunnery in her squadron , along with the battleship Lothringen . In mid @-@ December , she returned once again to Wilhelmshaven for the yearly overhaul . The years 1909 and 1910 passed uneventfully for Mecklenburg , with the same pattern of training cruises and maneuvers as in previous years . She began her annual overhaul on 2 December 1910 and returned to service on 7 March 1911 , though only briefly . On 31 July , Mecklenburg was replaced by the new dreadnought battleship Ostfriesland ; Mecklenburg was then decommissioned . After she was removed from active duty , Mecklenburg was assigned to the Reserve Division in the North Sea . On 9 May 1912 , she was transferred to the Reserve Division in the Baltic . She returned briefly to active service in 1912 from 9 to 12 May to move her from the North Sea to the Baltic , and again from 14 August to 28 September to participate in the fleet exercises that year . During the maneuvers , she served in the III Squadron . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Mecklenburg and the rest of her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron , under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt . The Squadron was initially allocated to the North Sea , but was temporarily transferred to the Baltic in September . Starting on 3 September , the IV Squadron , assisted by the armored cruiser Blücher , conducted a sweep into the eastern Baltic in the direction of the Svenska <unk> islands . The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle . The Squadron participated in a demonstration off Windau the following day . From 5 December to 2 April 1915 , Mecklenburg and the rest of the Squadron were assigned to guard duty in the North Sea , based in the mouth of the Elbe . 
 In May 1915 , IV Squadron , including Mecklenburg , was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area . Mecklenburg and her sisters were then based in Kiel . From 8 to 12 May , she participated in a sweep toward Gotland and Bogskär , which provided support to the assault on Libau . Mecklenburg and the other ships stood off Gotland in order to intercept any Russian cruisers that might try to intervene in the landings , which the Russians did not attempt . On 10 May , after the invasion force had entered Libau , the British submarines HMS E1 and HMS E9 spotted the IV Squadron , but were too far away to make an attack . After the conclusion of the operation , Mecklenburg and the rest of the IV Squadron returned to the Elbe for guard duties , which lasted until 4 July . The following day , Mecklenburg departed for Kiel in preparation for a major operation in the Baltic . She then proceeded to Danzig , and on 11 July departed for a sweep to <unk> <unk> ; another patrol to western Gotland followed on 21 – 22 July . Mecklenburg then steamed from Danzig to Libau on 2 August , where she joined another foray toward <unk> <unk> from 7 to 10 August . 
 Mecklenburg and her sisters were not included in the German fleet that assaulted the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 , due to the scarcity of escorts . The increasingly active British submarines forced the Germans to employ more destroyers to protect the capital ships . Mecklenburg took part in two sweeps to <unk> on 9 – 11 and 21 – 23 September . On 17 December she ran aground in the entrance to the harbor of Libau , but was towed free without suffering any damage . She was to replace the worn @-@ out armored cruiser Prinz Heinrich in the reconnaissance forces of the fleet in the Baltic , but Mecklenburg and her sisters were removed from service shortly thereafter . By this stage of the war , the German Navy was facing severe shortages of crews , which could be alleviated by the decommissioning of older , less effective warships . In addition , the loss of the armored cruiser Friedrich Carl to Russian mines , and the increasing threat from British submarines and Russian mines by 1916 in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach @-@ class ships from active service . On 6 January 1916 , Mecklenburg left Libau bound for Kiel , arriving there the following day . She was decommissioned on 24 January and placed in reserve . 
 Mecklenburg was initially based in Kiel and used as a floating prison . In early 1918 , she became a barracks ship for the crews of U @-@ boats being repaired in Kiel . The ship was briefly retained after the German defeat at the end of World War I , but was to be discarded under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , which limited the re @-@ formed Reichsmarine to eight pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Deutschland and Braunschweig classes , of which only six could be operational at any given time . Accordingly , on 25 January 1920 , Mecklenburg was stricken from the naval register . She was sold to Deutsche Werke , a ship @-@ builder based in Kiel , on 16 August 1921 for 1 @,@ 750 @,@ 000 Marks , and she was broken up for scrap metal that year at Kiel @-@ Nordmole . 
 = Alleyway = 
 Alleyway ( <unk> ) is a video game developed by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo as a global launch title for the Game Boy . It is a Breakout clone and one of the first four games developed and released for the system . The game was released first in Japan in 1989 , in North America later that year , and in Europe in 1990 . It was later re @-@ released via online distribution for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on June 6 , 2011 . 
 The name Alleyway references the in @-@ game gateway that the player 's spaceship ( represented as a paddle ) must pass through . While Alleyway is a portable clone of Breakout , it adds several new features , including alternating stages , bonus rounds , and hazards for the player at later levels . While the game 's original box art featured an unidentifiable protagonist , later international releases of the game replaced the character with Mario . Alleyway was released with limited advertising , receiving moderate to low scores from reviewers who compared it to games like Arkanoid . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player 's objective in Alleyway is to clear all bricks in each stage using a ball and paddle while keeping the ball from falling into the pit below , similar to that of Breakout . The paddle 's speed can be adjusted by holding either the B or A button on the controller while moving the paddle , which can move only horizontally at a fixed height . At the start of each life , the player can reposition the paddle before releasing the ball and commencing gameplay . When released , the ball will always begin at a 45 ° angle above the paddle aimed toward its center . The player starts the game with five paddles ; each time the ball falls into the pit below the paddle , a paddle is removed and the ball is reset . 
 The game ends when all the player 's paddles are depleted . An additional paddle is granted for each 1000 points scored , until the player has over 10 @,@ 000 points . The player may have up to nine paddles at once . The game lacks a continue feature , though the high score will be retained until the game is reset or turned off . As there is no battery @-@ backed <unk> or password feature , Alleyway can only be completed in one sitting on the Game Boy . This was later changed with the re @-@ release of the game for the Nintendo 3DS 's Virtual Console system , which allowed for in @-@ game progress to be recorded to a single save state accessible at any time while playing the game . 
 = = = Ball behavior = = = 
 The ball will only travel at 15 ° , 30 ° , or 45 ° angles . If the ball hits a brick , the brick disappears and the ball ricochets in a different direction at the same angle . The ball 's speed depends on the type of brick that it hits : gray and black bricks increase its speed , while white and square , indestructible bricks have no effect . A sound effect is also played when the ball collides with an object or wall , with walls producing the lowest pitch and black bricks the highest . 
 The ball 's direction and speed can be controlled by the paddle 's velocity and point of contact . Changing direction the moment the ball comes into contact with the paddle , called a snap technique , will bounce the ball upward with increased speed . Moving the paddle quickly in the opposite direction than the ball is headed will result in the ball bouncing in the same horizontal direction as the paddle at a 15 ° angle . If the player contacts the ball with the body of the paddle before it falls into the pit below , it will bounce back into the playing field . However , if instead either corner of the paddle collides with the ball at that moment , it will be knocked directly into the pit . 
 Alleyway 's ball cannot be locked in an infinite loop of ricochets . Whenever the ball starts to loop between objects such as the ceiling , indestructible blocks and / or the paddle itself , its velocity will change at a random point after the second cycle on its next collision . As a result , the ball will travel at a slightly raised or lowered angle depending on its current trajectory , and will break out of the loop . 
 = = = Levels = = = 
 The game features 24 levels , based on eight block patterns in groups of three . After every three regular stages , the player proceeds to a bonus stage , giving the game a total of 32 levels . Most levels follow a generic design , though one group is modeled after Mario 's head as it appears next to the remaining paddles icon . The player progresses to the next level once all bricks are destroyed , where the same pattern of bricks appears but behaves differently . Every second stage is a Scrolling Block Screen , featuring bricks that move from left to right ; every third is an Advancing Block Screen , where the bricks move downward the height of one regular brick in short bursts , increasing in speed as the ball bounces off the paddle . Any part of a brick below a height of ten bricks above the paddle is automatically removed ; thus they cannot impede the player 's movement but cannot contribute towards the player 's score either . 
 As the player progresses through patterns , new elements are added to the gameplay . After the fourth stage , if the ball comes into contact with the top of the area , the paddle 's size is halved until the stage is cleared or a life is lost . From this point on , the third stage variant features hidden bricks above the ceiling that descend progressively , using a similar — or same — layout that must also be cleared , meaning the pattern must be cleared twice . In later levels , bricks in the second stage variant may not move at the same speed or in the same direction . After the twelfth stage , indestructible bricks are incorporated into the brick patterns . 
 Bonus stages feature patterns based on various Nintendo Entertainment System Super Mario Bros. sprites , such as a Piranha Plant , Goomba or Bowser . Unlike regular levels , the ball will destroy blocks in these stages without ricocheting off them , and contact with the ceiling will not affect the paddle size . These stages are the only ones to feature background music during play , and cannot be paused . A timer is present for each bonus stage ; it starts at 95 for the first and is reduced by five for each subsequent bonus stage completed beforehand . If the timer ends , the ball falls into the pit ( no life is lost in this case ) , or all bricks are destroyed , the bonus stage ends . Destroying all bricks before the timer expires yields additional bonus points , which vary depending on the level . Once cleared , the brick pattern changes and gameplay reverts to the normal cycle . After finishing the final bonus round , the player is given a congratulations screen using the Mario graphic from the original Mario Bros. game . The game then loops back to the first stage , allowing for infinite play . 
 = = = Scoring = = = 
 Points are awarded for destroying bricks based on their shade , with one point awarded for the lightest and three for the darkest . The player may earn additional points for completing the bonus stages , with the bonus starting at 500 for the first and reaching 1500 for the last five . The player 's highest obtained score is recorded until the game is turned off . 
 The game only displays four digits of the player 's score , yet it has a maximum value of 65 @,@ 535 . Scores of 10 @,@ 000 and above are displayed as a combination of icons and the numerical display . For every 10 @,@ 000 points , a sprite from the NES Super Mario Bros. game is shown below the numerical score . A fire flower is shown for 10 @,@ 000 points , a mushroom for 20 @,@ 000 , and a <unk> for 30 @,@ 000 points and above . The game stops changing the sprite after awarding the <unk> icon . As a result , the highest score that can be displayed is 39 @,@ 999 ; however , the maximum score of 65 @,@ 535 is shown as 35 @,@ 535 . Once the maximum score has been reached , the score will roll over only if the player completes a bonus stage . A roll over does not affect the recorded high score . 
 = = Development = = 
 Based on classic ball @-@ and @-@ paddle arcade games such as Breakout and Arkanoid , Alleyway was a launch title for the Game Boy in 1989 for Japan and North America , alongside Super Mario Land , Baseball , and Tetris , though only with the first two in Japan . The game 's release predates Tetris ' by two months , due to legal battles between Nintendo and Tengen over the Tetris property . On June 6 , 2011 , the game was re @-@ released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console system via online distribution . It was first released in Japan , and then North America a year later . 
 Alleyway marks one of the first appearances of Mario on the Game Boy system alongside Super Mario Land , although its original box and cartridge art showed an unidentified character in a spacesuit piloting the paddle . The artwork was changed to show Mario at the controls on the game 's international release , but neither the manual nor the back of the box refer to the Nintendo mascot 's presence in the game . Nintendo Power 's preview made no mention of Mario in the title other than note of the pattern of bricks in Mario 's shape for the first bonus level . Official confirmation of the pilot being Mario only came about in 1990 with Club Nintendo 's preview of the game 's European release . 
 The game was one of the first titles made by the Nintendo R & D1 development team , alongside Tetris and Radar Mission . Years later , the game 's designer Gunpei Yokoi would reuse much of Alleyway 's source code ( such as paddle behavior and adapted physics engine ) for the Game Boy game Kirby 's Block Ball while working with Shigeru Miyamoto 's team . Alleyway was re @-@ released for download onto the Nintendo Power cartridge , occupying one memory block on the device . 
 Promotion of the title in Nintendo published material consisted of a segment taking up a third of the page the articles were on . Advertisements for Alleyway were grouped with those for the Game Boy itself and other titles for the system . Years after its initial release , a two @-@ page section in the Super Game Boy Nintendo Strategy Guide bundled with the Super Game Boy accessory appeared , which gave advice and color codes for the game .

 Although Alleyway sold well enough during its production run , it has not been re @-@ released as a Nintendo Player 's Choice title , and reviews of the game have been mostly mixed to negative . Mean Machines gave the game a score of 33 % , criticizing its repetitiveness and stating " this variant doesn 't have much more to offer than the original [ Breakout ] " . The magazine 's staff added " once you 've finished a couple of screens , you 'll be bored stiff " and compared the game to its predecessor , Arkanoid , regarding the lack of power @-@ ups in Alleyway . Electronic Gaming Monthly staff also reviewed the game , with four separate reviews giving the game scores of 6 / 10 , 6 / 10 , 5 / 10 , and 3 / 10 . All four reviewers compared it to Arkanoid , complaining about the lack of enhancement over the Breakout format . GamesRadar shared the sentiment in their review of the 3DS re @-@ release , with reviewer Nathan Meunier giving it a score of 5 / 10 and stating " Alleyway wasn 't so hot when it first came out , and it still pales when put it side @-@ by @-@ side to other similarly priced offerings " . He further added at times the game appeared to " hate " the player with its difficulty , though acknowledged that the addition of save states " takes some of the sting out of losing " . Retro Gamer 's Darran Jones called it " pretty piss @-@ poor all the way back in 1989 " , noting the bland levels and lack of power @-@ ups found in Arkanoid , and that many similar clones had outperformed it . 
 Not all comments about the game have been negative . The two Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers that gave the highest scores did state they felt the design was perfect for the Game Boy , one adding " It 's also a very good game that combines some new features ... with the original Break @-@ Out theme " and concluding " Alleyway is good — but a bit long " . German magazine Power Play gave the game a rating of 48 % , but also praised the game 's level variety . The book Rules of Play discusses the game as an example of improved design over a base core mechanic , citing the inclusion of distinct sound effects for ball collision as a means to praise the player for destroying bricks , and the varied level designs as " well done " and giving the player " an element of discovery to the overall experience . " Allgame noted that despite the simplicity and variety , " Alleyway is fun to play " , further adding that games of its kind " always play well on the Game Boy " . 
 = Effects of Hurricane Georges in Cuba = 
 The effects of Hurricane Georges in Cuba included $ 305 @.@ 8 million in damages and six deaths . Forming out of a tropical wave over the Atlantic Ocean , Georges attained a peak intensity of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) on September 20 , 1998 . On September 23 , the storm made landfall in southeastern Cuba as a minimal Category 1 hurricane . The storm tracked over the county for the following two days before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on September 25 and later making landfall in the United States as a Category 2 hurricane . Before the storm 's landfall in Cuba , officials reported that 200 @,@ 000 people were evacuated to shelters ; however , later reports indicated that upwards 711 @,@ 000 people evacuated . A state of emergency was declared for much of eastern Cuba and most of the country was placed under a tropical storm or hurricane warning during the storm 's passage . 
 More than 3 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed and 60 @,@ 000 damaged throughout the country , leaving an estimated 100 @,@ 000 people homeless . Agricultural losses were severe , with the plantain crop loss estimated at 70 % of annual production due to Georges , accounting for roughly $ 15 million of the total damages . Following the passage of the hurricane , several countries provided relief funds to Cuba for disaster recovery . Despite crop losses , affected residents were given essential supplies by the local government . By December , an estimated $ 90 million in funds was allocated for the impacts of Georges and the drought that preceded it .

 Hurricane Georges began as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa in mid @-@ September , 1998 . Tracking towards the west , the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression . On September 16 , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges and further to Hurricane Georges the next day . The storm reached its peak intensity on September 20 with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) , just below Category 5 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . Over the following five days , the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles , causing over 600 fatalities , mainly in the Dominican Republic and Haiti . 
 Late on September 23 , Georges made landfall about 30 mi ( 48 km ) south of Guantanamo Bay . Hurricane Georges maintained minimal Category 1 status for the following two days as it tracked over the northern coastline of Cuba . On September 25 , Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico . The storm made landfall three days later near Biloxi , Mississippi with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . Shortly after landfall , the hurricane significantly slowed , with forward motion reducing to a general drift towards the east . Georges dissipated on October 1 near the Atlantic coast of Florida .

 At 1900 UTC on September 21 , the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for eastern Cuba for areas between the provinces of Las Tunas and Guantánamo . The following day , the watch was extended northward to Sancti Spíritus Province . Areas south of Las Tunas were also placed under a hurricane warning at this time . By 0900 UTC on September 23 , all areas previously under a hurricane watch were under hurricane warnings . The watch was further extended to Cienfuegos Province as Georges tracked through southern Cuba . Areas south of Sancti Spíritus Province were also placed under a hurricane warning . By September 25 , all hurricane warnings were discontinued in the country and all watches were discontinued the following day . 
 On September 22 , much of eastern Cuba was placed under storm alert by President Fidel Castro . Authorities worked quickly to clean storm drains , trim trees , and move residents to safety , including 30 @,@ 000 children in the mountains who were picking coffee . On September 23 , authorities in Cuba evacuated 200 @,@ 000 residents from coastal areas as Georges neared landfall . The Cuban Red Cross reported that nearly 500 @,@ 000 people were evacuated , of which 200 @,@ 000 were placed in shelters . Later reports stated that about 711 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from dangerous areas . Flights in and out of the county were cancelled and schools were closed due to the storm . In addition to the evacuation of residents , more than 90 @,@ 000 head of cattle were relocated to higher ground . 
 In Guantánamo Province , 240 refugees from Haiti and 3 @,@ 000 residents from the town of Maisí were evacuated . An additional 2 @,@ 500 people were evacuated from Baracoa . In all , 50 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from the region . An estimated 140 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from Holguín Province as well as 8 @,@ 000 heads of cattle . In Santiago de Cuba Province , 12 @,@ 400 people were evacuated and relief crews were being staged at several shelters set up throughout the province . Another 1 @,@ 000 residents were evacuated from Ciego de Ávila Province and 17 @,@ 000 students were relocated from Sancti Spíritus Province . Construction crews worked quickly to secure dilapidated homes in Baracoa and evacuated tourists from the region . Tourists were sheltered in numerous hotels and hospitals and were warned for unknown reasons not to take pictures of the damage once the storm had passed . 
 Much of eastern Cuba , already under storm alert , was placed under a State of Emergency due to the threat of Georges . President Castro emphasized the severity of the hurricane during a two @-@ hour address to the nation on September 23 . He explained , in great detail , civil preparation maps and impacts from past hurricanes . His last note was that he would refuse any aid from the United States as they ( Cuba ) would not accept aid from a country that has an embargo on them . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Throughout Cuba , Hurricane Georges produced torrential rainfall , peaking at 24 @.@ 41 inches ( 620 mm ) in <unk> in the province of Guantánamo . Several other locations reported over a foot ( 300 mm ) of precipitation as well . Storm surge of 4 – 6 feet ( 1 – 2 m ) was expected along the eastern coastline , along with dangerous waves on top of the surge . Though winds were reduced by the time Georges hit Cuba , it still retained winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , along with stronger gusts in squalls . Waves exceeding 16 ft ( 4 @.@ 8 m ) impacted coastal regions of the county , with some areas reporting that waves were topping the sea wall . 
 The first community to lose power was in Maisí located within Guantánamo Province . Heavy rains from the outer bands of Hurricane Georges triggered flooding in the region as more than 10 in ( 254 mm ) of rain fell by September 24 . Sustained winds in the hurricane reached 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) with higher gusts as the storm tracked over eastern Cuba . By 9 pm on September 24 , the eye of Georges passed over Baracoa . In Guantánamo , four rivers overflowed their banks and flooded the provincial capital ; however , power lines were downed throughout the region and contact to officials in the area was impossible . 
 The hurricane 's heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides along the mountainous terrain . This , combined with strong winds , damaged 60 @,@ 475 homes , of which 3 @,@ 481 were completely destroyed . Along with other affected nations in the Caribbean , more than 100 @,@ 000 were left homeless due to Hurricane Georges . A total of 1 @,@ 117 businesses were also damaged , of which 12 were destroyed . High winds downed power lines , trees , and telephone poles , leaving many in eastern Cuba without electricity in the aftermath of the storm . Along the coast , severe flooding washed out railroad and highway bridges . Though eastern Cuba was the area most affected , the central and western portion of the island , including Havana , experienced torrential rains and strong wind gusts . There , strong waves broke over the seawall , and caused heavy flood damage to some of the town 's old buildings . 
 As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola , the severe drought during the El Niño of 1997 exacerbated the flood 's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba . The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly , despite the effort to harvest them prior to its arrival . Up to 70 % of the plantain crop , a chief food in the country 's diet , was destroyed . The sugarcane crop fared badly as well , limiting one of the country 's important export crops . The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane , further damaging the country 's food supply . A total of 15 @,@ 758 hectares of croplands as well as 36 @,@ 040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges . Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $ 15 million . 
 Well @-@ executed evacuations and warnings limited the death toll to six , while damage amounted to $ 305 @.@ 8 million ( 1998 USD , $ 409 @.@ 8 million 2009 USD ) . In addition to the six human lives lost , 497 heads of cattle and 21 @,@ 387 chickens were killed . All six human deaths were indirectly related to Georges ; the first death occurred when an 61 @-@ year @-@ old woman stepped on a downed wire and was electrocuted ; the second occurred when a 56 @-@ year @-@ old man drove over another downed wire on his motorcycle and was electrocuted . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On September 25 , the government of Spain approved $ 1 @.@ 07 million in food assistance for Cuba . On September 29 , the government of Japan sent water equipment , soap , towels , and emergency health kits worth $ 119 @,@ 200 to the affected areas in Cuba . By February 1999 , the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $ 1 million in disaster funds . An emergency cash grant of $ 50 @,@ 000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations . The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8 @,@ 700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island . Plastic sheeting was to be distributed for about a week for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes . The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $ 70 @,@ 000 to the Cuban Government on October 9 . By February 1999 , the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30 @,@ 000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5 @,@ 500 people in three provinces . Several months after the storm , the Cuban Government reported that they had allocated about $ 38 million in funds for Hurricane Georges . 
 Already suffering from food shortages due to a five @-@ month drought , President Fidel Castro announced that the government would supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60 , which accounts for roughly 36 % of Cuba 's population , with extra food aid . An estimated 156 @,@ 000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars . People who qualified for the aid would receive 4 @.@ 4 lbs ( 2 kg ) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6 @.@ 6 lbs ( 3 kg ) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999 . The United Nations World Food Program provided $ 20 @.@ 5 million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges . By December , the Cuban Government requested $ 90 million to help recover from the hurricane and drought . By this time , about $ 40 million had already been set aside for the same reason . The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92 @,@ 000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits , food , water , and other relief materials . 
 On December 18 , 1998 , the United Nations launched a large @-@ scale rehabilitation effort in Cuba . Roughly $ 14 million was spent on housing and infrastructure reconstruction and repair ; this portion of the project consisted of reconstruction of homes , schools , businesses , hospitals , irrigation and the water system . Another $ 1 @.@ 1 million was used to inform and protect residents against post @-@ storm diseases . The largest part of the effort involved jump @-@ starting agriculture and fisheries . Roughly $ 50 @.@ 4 million was provided to reconstruct fishing vessels , purchase new tools and gear . By mid @-@ February 1999 , the Governments of Italy , Germany , Canada and the European Union provided $ 1 million , $ 714 @,@ 000 , $ 50 @,@ 000 , and $ 510 @,@ 200 in funds respectively . The Government of Israel also supplied agricultural tools . The Government of Norway provided $ 29 @,@ 100 in water @-@ borne disease prevention funds . Through various agencies , the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided Cuba with roughly $ 86 million in disaster funding . 
 = Night Fishing ( album ) = 
 Night Fishing ( stylized as <unk> <unk> , Japanese pronunciation : [ <unk> : <unk> ] ) is the second studio album by Japanese band Sakanaction . It was released on January 23 , 2008 through Victor Entertainment 's BabeStar Label . The album primarily features music written by vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi since the release of their debut album Go to the Future ( 2007 ) . Compared to their debut album , which compiled songs that the band had already written , the majority of the songs on Night Fishing were written specifically for the release . The album was an attempt by the band to find a better balance between popular music and underground , and was an album where the members wanted to incorporate more of their own personal styles ; which caused the members to disagree over its content much more than on their debut album . 
 The album was preceded by the digital singles " Word " , " Sample " and " Night Fishing Is Good " , all released in December 2007 . Out of these , " Sample " was chosen as the main promotional track for the album , receiving high radio play in Hokkaido . Critically , the band was praised for their new direction on Night Fishing , with critics praising the album 's mix of pop and electronic musical elements , Yamaguchi 's poetic lyrics and " transparent " vocals . Night Fishing was more commercially successful than Go to the Future , reaching number 53 on the Oricon singles chart . 
 In 2009 , the album was made available globally as a digital download , alongside the band 's debut and third albums Go to the Future ( 2007 ) and Shin @-@ shiro ( 2009 ) . In 2015 , the album was reissued on CD , LP record and lossless digital formats . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Sakanaction was first formed in 2005 in Sapporo , Hokkaido . The band gained exposure in Hokkaido after winning the audition to perform as a newcomer artist at the Rising Sun Rock Festival in Otaru in August 2006 , and after demos of their songs " Mikazuki Sunset " and " Shiranami Top Water " performed well on College Radio Japan Sapporo . The band were signed to major label Victor Entertainment , and released their debut album Go to the Future on May 7 , 2007 , through Victor 's BabeStar Label . The group performed a short tour of Japan to promote the album 's release , performing concerts in Tokyo , Osaka , Nagoya and Sapporo in May . As a part of the Sapporo concert 's set @-@ list , the band performed the songs " Teenage " and " <unk> " ; then unpublished songs that would later be added to Night Fishing . Since their debut , the band had been based in Sapporo , and had recorded their albums there . Night Fishing would become their last Hokkaido @-@ based release , as the group moved to Tokyo in mid 2008 . 
 Due to the response to the band 's debut album Go to the Future , Sakanaction 's A & R team pushed them to quickly follow this up with a second album . They felt extremely pressured while creating the album , especially by their musical director at Victor Entertainment . 
 = = Writing and production = = 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 Most of the songs featured on Night Fishing were written specifically for it . The band members felt like the album was their first release that they had made together as a five @-@ member band , as opposed to Go to the Future , which the band 's vocalist and songwriter Ichiro Yamaguchi described as feeling like a " business card " due to the inclusion of mostly old material . The material for the album was created based on the response and criticism for their debut album , and the members realization that they should not be frightened to make bold changes . However , several songs were already written beforehand : " Sample " was originally a song released by Yamaguchi 's high school band Dutchman 2002 , and " <unk> " was a song written during Sakanaction 's early days in 2005 that did not make the album cut of Go to the Future , because Yamaguchi felt that the song did not fit well on their debut release . The band attempted to make a more commercial sound compared to Go to the Future , and tried to strike a balance between underground , minimal electronic music and " high entertainment " popular music . The band wanted to keep a sense of enjoyment in their music , and attempted to do so by experimenting with different musical styles , including progressive rock and choral singing , and experimenting with elements of ambient and folk music . After performing their first Japanese tour in 2008 , Sakanaction put more consideration into choosing arrangements that would work better at live concerts . 
 The album was created at a point where each of the band members wanted to incorporate more of their own personalities into the music of Sakanaction , which led to Night Fishing becoming the album where the members disagreed over its content the most . Sakanaction also had difficulty between themselves and their record label over deciding which song should have been the leading promotional song . The label had chosen " Sample " , but there was a lot of opposition to this from Yamaguchi , who preferred " Night Fishing Is Good " . When the band unveiled their song to their director at Studio Milk , he did not react very well to the song , and the label chose not to promote this song due to its six @-@ minute length . During this time , Yamaguchi had begun to realize the power of music videos after the rise in popularity of video @-@ sharing websites such as YouTube , so decided to make his own low @-@ budget video for the song ; describing " Night Fishing Is Good " as the underground leading promotional song for the album . 
 Demo recording sessions for Night Fishing began several days before the release of the band 's debut album Go to the Future in May 2007 . The band members formally proposed the album concepts to Victor Entertainment staff in June 2007 . The album 's official studio recording sessions began in September 2007 and concluded in October , and were entirely undertaken at Discovery Studio in the Maruyama Nishi @-@ <unk> area of Chūō @-@ ku , Sapporo . After the album sessions had finished , however , the band immediately kept on recording for their future projects . The album 's track order was not considered until the very final mastering stages of the album . Yamaguchi did much of the album 's final mixing himself personally . 
 Several of the band 's plans for the album did not come into fruition . Originally the band had planned for " Ame wa Kimagure " to be the leading song on the album , but after producing the song , Yamaguchi felt that the song 's arrangement was too stylized and not easily accessible . The band had wanted to shoot a video for " Atarashii Sekai " on location in Kyoto , however they abandoned plans for this . 
 = = = Song inspiration and production = = = 
 Lyrically , Yamaguchi worked around a " night " theme , and was inspired by creating film @-@ like imagery for each song . Yamaguchi wanted to compile lyrics featuring introspective feelings of worry and sadness that people primarily felt at night . Yamaguchi was further inspired to write more autobiographically , creating a documentary @-@ like non @-@ fiction work . He wanted to create lyrics closer to the style of haiku than standard pop <unk> , in order to express many things with as few phrases as possible . 
 Despite the album 's track order not being decided until the very end , Yamaguchi had thought from the start that " Ame wa Kimagure " , " Malaysia 32 " and " Uneri " should be in that order . After plans for " Ame wa Kimagure " to become the leading song were scrapped , Yamaguchi decided to elaborate on the " oriental " feel of the song . " Malaysia 32 " is the band 's first instrumental song , and was based on a synthesizer riff made by the band 's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera which was then completed with ideas from everyone in the band . The song was called " Malaysia " because of how at one point they added a vocal melody that sounded like the name of the city Kuala Lumpur . The number 32 in the title is a reference to the fact that the song is based on a synthesizer loop of 32 bars . Originally " Uneri " had been envisioned as a rock song , but the band decided against this after creating " Night Fishing Is Good " . The band 's musical director suggested that they perform the song acoustically instead , which led to the final studio arrangement of " Uneri " . 
 " Night Fishing Is Good " was inspired by the style of musical theatre and classical music . Originally the other band members were hesitant about the song when Yamaguchi first played it to them , and they suggested that they split the piece into two compositions . During the song 's recording , Yamaguchi felt that the song would benefit from having a similar style to the English rock band Queen , which the band 's pianist Emi Okazaki in particular responded well to . Iwadera added Queen @-@ style guitar riffs to the song , and the group decided to add a vocal chorus , in the style of a Queen song . Only after " Night Fishing Is Good " had been finished did the band decide to title the album after this song . 
 = = Promotion and release = = 
 The album was first announced on November 12 , 2007 . In December , Sakanaction traveled to the Tokyo area to promote the album , where they performed at the Countdown Japan 07 / 08 new year 's music festival . 
 On December 5 , the songs " Word " and " Sample " were released as a two @-@ track single to iTunes . On December 26 , the song " Night Fishing Is Good " was similarly released as a stand @-@ alone digital download to promote the album . " Sample " was chosen as the album 's leading promotional track , receiving heavy rotation on radio stations such as Hokkaido 's FM North Wave in early February , while " Word " received minor airplay during the same period . 
 Three songs on the album were promoted with music videos : " Word " , " Sample " and " Night Fishing Is Good " . The music video for " Sample " was recorded on December 20 , at a lake close to Mount Fuji in Shizuoka Prefecture , and was directed by Kanji <unk> . " Night Fishing Is Good " was shot in a single day during the new year period in 2008 at the Arata River in Gifu , in two takes , by " Mikazuki Sunset " director Yoshihiro Mori . It was released after the album was available in stores , on February 4 . 
 In mid @-@ January , the band unveiled a special website for Night Fishing , featuring sound samples and song commentary by Ichiro Yamaguchi , and also opened their official MySpace profile . Sakanaction were featured on the February 26 episode of Fuji Television 's Factory , where they performed a four song set , featuring " Sample " as well as songs from Go to the Future . Special features on Sakanaction were published in the magazines Pia , Musica , <unk> ! , Bass Magazine and Rockin ' On Japan . 
 In March 2008 , the band held a Japan @-@ wide tour to promote the album , 2nd Album 2008 " Night Fishing Is Good " . The tour began in Nagasaki on March 1 , and finished in Osaka on March 29 . In 2015 , the band re @-@ released their studio albums , due to the pregnancy of their bassist Ami Kusakari . In March , Night Fishing was released for the first time as a lossless digital release and as a vinyl record / A remastered CD edition was also released during this time . 
 = = Reception = = 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Critical reception in Japan to the album was positive . Music journalist Takehiko Hosaka gave a very positive review of the album , noting the band 's new and wider direction , and felt it was at the forefront of modern pop music . He felt that Night Fishing had a Don Quixote @-@ like strong volition that was easy to become obsessed about . CDJournal reviewer Mori listed it as his third favorite release of the year , praising the word @-@ play , melodies and arrangements on Night Fishing . Yuji Tanaka of CDJournal praised the album 's addition of " opera @-@ like choral work " on the album , noting it as the biggest change compared to Go to the Future . 
 Haruki Terada of Musica believed that the album was a great improvement on Go to the Future in all aspects , calling it a " masterpiece " . He felt that the album 's experimentation was " special " , likening it to the lyricism and eloquence of 1970s Japanese <unk> songs . He noted that Yamaguchi 's " transparent " vocals expressed pain no matter how he sung , and felt that the band were able to incorporate funk elements due to the band having a keyboardist . Terada felt that there were three important factors to the album 's success : Yamaguchi 's vocals , the " intimacy " felt between band members , and Yamaguchi 's songwriting skills ; something that Terada saw as a strong unchanging factor between Go to the Future and Night Fishing . Terada felt that the album 's lyrics had a consistent poetic worldview , and often switched between sentimentality and frigidity . 
 Atsushi Sasaki of Invitation described the album 's appeal being its " fusion of home recorded @-@ style arrangements and US indie @-@ like band sound , overlaid with naive and noble vocals . " He felt like Night Fishing inherited the " bedroom techno meets guitar pop " that the Japanese bands Supercar and <unk> had in the early 2000s . He noted progressive aspects to the album 's style , but felt that the band were still in the process of growth . Terada felt that the reason why many people saw the band as being a successor to Supercar and <unk> was not just their " nostalgic <unk> " : a mix of <unk> and speedy inorganic four on the floor arrangements , but simply Yamaguchi 's " comfortable " vocals . 
 Shunsuke Kosugi of Musica called the use of electronic beats on the album " excellent " , praised them as " detailed " and " precise " , and noted how they stirred up nostalgic feelings that " pulled at the heartstrings " . Kosugi felt that there was a uniformity to the beats on the album , and stressed that listeners should listen to the work as a whole to experience this properly . Reviewers for So @-@ en praised the album for Yamaguchi 's vocals and Sakanaction 's atypical band sound , feeling that listening to the album created a " floating feeling like being in space " . They further praised Yamaguchi 's " unique " lyrical worldview , and the high level of perfection found in the recordings . 
 Kei Iwasaki of the band <unk> , writing for Musica , felt that Ichiro Yamaguchi 's dual love of 1990s pop music and electronic musicians such as Daft Punk and Cornelius strongly expressed itself throughout the album . He lauded Sakanaction 's efforts to mix electronica and pop , but felt that mixing these two genres was a double @-@ edged sword that invariably influenced the composition of songs . Because of this , he felt that Night Fishing might be more successful musically if the songs were re @-@ recorded .

 = Alice Ayres = 
 Alice Ayres ( 12 September 1859 – 26 April 1885 ) was an English nursemaid honoured for her bravery in rescuing the children in her care from a house fire . Ayres was a household assistant and nursemaid to the family of her brother @-@ in @-@ law and sister , Henry and Mary Ann Chandler . The Chandlers owned an oil and paint shop in Union Street , Southwark , then just south of London , and Ayres lived with the family above the shop . In 1885 fire broke out in the shop , and Ayres rescued three of her nieces from the burning building , before falling from a window and suffering fatal injury . 
 Britain , in the wake of the Industrial Revolution , experienced a period of great social change in which the rapidly growing news media paid increasing attention to the activities of the poorer classes . The manner of Ayres ' death caused great public interest , with large numbers of people attending her funeral and contributing to the funding of a memorial . Shortly after her death , she underwent what has been described as a " secular canonisation " , being widely depicted in popular culture and , although very little was known about her life , widely cited as a role model . Various social and political movements promoted Ayres as an example of the values held by their particular movement . The circumstances of her death were distorted to give the impression that she was an employee willing to die for the sake of her employer 's family , rather than for children to whom she was closely related . In 1902 her name was added to the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice and in 1936 a street near the scene of the fire was renamed Ayres Street in her honour . 
 The case of Alice Ayres came to renewed public notice with the release of Patrick Marber 's 1997 play Closer , and the 2004 film based on it . An important element of the plot revolves around a central character who fabricates her identity based on the description of Ayres on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice , with some of the film 's key scenes shot around the memorial . 
 = = Work with the Chandler family = = 
 Alice Ayres was born into a large family in 1859 , the seventh of ten children of a labourer , John Ayres . In December 1877 , her sister Mary Ann ( older than Alice by eleven years ) married an oil and paint dealer , Henry Chandler . Chandler owned a shop at 194 Union Street in Southwark , about 400 yards ( 370 m ) south of the present @-@ day Tate Modern . 
 In 1881 Ayres worked as a household assistant to Edward <unk> , a doctor specialising in ear and throat disorders . By 1885 she had become a household assistant and nursemaid to the Chandlers , living with the family . After her death , Ayres was described by a local resident as " not one of your fast sort — gentle and quiet @-@ spoke , and always busy about her work " . Another neighbour told the press that " no merry making , no excursion , no family festivity could tempt her from her self @-@ imposed duties . The children must be bathed and put to bed , the clothes must be mended , the rooms must be ' tidied up ' , the cloth must be laid , the supper carefully prepared , before Alice would dream of setting forth on her own pleasures " . 
 = = Union Street fire = = 
 The Chandler 's shop at Union Street , as depicted in a contemporary newspaper illustration , occupied the corner premises of a building of three storeys . The family lived above the shop , with Henry and Mary Ann Chandler sleeping in one bedroom with their six @-@ year @-@ old son Henry , and Ayres sharing a room on the second floor with her nieces , five @-@ year @-@ old Edith , four @-@ year @-@ old Ellen , and three @-@ year @-@ old Elizabeth . On the night of 24 April 1885 , fire broke out in the oil and paint shop , trapping the family upstairs . Gunpowder and casks of oil were stored in the lower floors of the building , causing the flames to spread rapidly . Although the shop was near the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade and the emergency services were quickly on scene , by the time the fire engine arrived intense flames were coming from the lower windows , making it impossible for the fire brigade to position ladders . Meanwhile , Ayres , wearing only a nightdress , had tried to reach her sister but was unable to get to her through the smoke . The crowd that had gathered outside the building were shouting to Ayres to jump . Instead she returned to the room she shared with the three young girls and threw a mattress out of the window , carefully dropping Edith onto it . Despite further calls from below to jump and save herself , she left the window and returned carrying Ellen . Ellen clung to Ayres and refused to be dropped , but Ayres threw her out of the building , and the child was caught by a member of the crowd . Ayres went back into the smoke a third time and returned carrying badly injured Elizabeth , whom she dropped safely onto the mattress . 
 After rescuing the three girls , Ayres tried to jump herself , but overcome by smoke inhalation , fell limply from the window , striking the projecting shop sign . She missed the mattress and the crowd below and fell onto the pavement , suffering spinal injuries . Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy 's Hospital where , because of the public interest that her story excited , hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady @-@ in @-@ waiting to enquire after her condition . 
 The oil and paint stored in the shop caused the fire to burn out of control , and when the fire services were eventually able to enter the premises the rest of the family were found dead . The body of Henry Chandler was found on the staircase , still clutching a locked strongbox filled with the shop 's takings , while the badly burnt remains of Mary Ann Chandler were found lying next to a first floor window , the body of six @-@ year @-@ old Henry by her side . Ayres 's condition deteriorated and she died in Guy 's Hospital on 26 April 1885 . Her last words were reported as " I tried my best and could try no more " . Elizabeth , the last of the children to be rescued , had suffered severe burns to her legs and died shortly after Ayres .

 Ayres 's body was not taken to Guy 's Hospital 's mortuary , but was laid in a room set aside for her . The estimated value of the floral tributes came to over £ 1 @,@ 000 ( about £ 97 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . Ayres was posthumously recognised by the Metropolitan Board of Works @-@ controlled Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire ( today the Society for the Protection of Life from Fire ) , who awarded her father John Ayres a sum of 10 guineas ( about £ 1 @,@ 020 as of 2016 ) in her honour . A memorial service for Ayres at St Saviour 's Church ( now Southwark Cathedral ) attracted such a large crowd that mourners were turned away due to lack of standing room , while a collection taken at the memorial service comprised 951 coins , totalling over £ 7 . Ayres was given a large public funeral , attended by over 10 @,@ 000 mourners . Her coffin was carried from her parents ' house to her grave in Isleworth Cemetery by a team of 16 firemen , relieving each other in sets of four . The church service was attended by a group of 20 girls , dressed in white , from the village school that Ayres had attended . It had been planned that the girls should follow the coffin to the graveside and sing , but a severe hailstorm prevented this . 
 Henry and Mary Ann Chandler were buried in Lambeth Cemetery along with the two children who had died in the fire . Edith and Ellen Chandler were accepted by the Orphan Working School in Kentish Town and trained as domestic servants .

 Shortly after the fire it was decided to erect a monument to Ayres , to be funded by public subscription , and by August 1885 the fund had raised over £ 100 ( about £ 10 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . On 15 August 1885 work began on the memorial . The monument was erected above her grave in Isleworth Cemetery , and was of an Egyptian design inspired by Cleopatra 's Needle , which had been raised in central London in 1878 . It took the form of a 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) solid red granite obelisk , and is still today the tallest grave marker in the cemetery . On the front of the obelisk is inscribed 
 Sacred to the memory of ALICE <unk> , aged 26 years , who met her death through a fire which occurred in Union Street , Borough , the 24th of April , 1885 A.D. 
 Amidst the sudden terrors of the conflagration , with true courage and judgement , she heroically rescued the children committed to her charge . To save them , she three times braved the flames ; at last , leaping from the burning house , she sustained injuries from the effects of which she died on April 26th 1885 . 
 This memorial was erected by public subscription to commemorate a noble act of unselfish courage . " Be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of life . " 
 The right hand side of the monument lists the ten members of the Alice Ayres Memorial Committee , chaired by Rev H. W. P. Richards . The Union Street fire and Ayres 's rescue of the children caused great public interest from the outset , and the fire , Ayres 's death and funeral , and the fundraising for and erection of the memorial were all reported in detail in the local and national press and throughout the British Empire . 
 = = " A secular canonisation " = = 
 The British government had traditionally paid little attention to the poor , but in the wake of the Industrial Revolution attitudes towards the accomplishments of the lower classes were changing . The growth of the railways , the mechanisation of agriculture and the need for labour in the new inner @-@ city factories had broken the traditional feudal economy and caused the rapid growth of cities , while increasing literacy rates led to a greater interest in the media and current affairs among ordinary workers . In 1856 the first military honour for bravery open to all ranks , the Victoria Cross , had been instituted , while in 1866 the Albert Medal , the first official honour open to civilians of all classes , was introduced . Additionally , a number of private and charitable organisations dedicated to lifesaving , most prominently the Royal Humane Society ( 1776 ) and Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( 1824 ) , were increasing in activity and prominence , and gave awards and medals as a means of publicising their activities and lifesaving advice . 
 Painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts and his second wife , designer and artist Mary Fraser Tytler , had long been advocates of the idea of art as a force for social change , and of the principle that narratives of great deeds would provide guidance to address the serious social problems of British cities . Watts had recently painted a series of portraits of leading figures he considered to be a positive social influence , the " Hall of Fame " , which was donated to the National Portrait Gallery ; since at least 1866 he had proposed as a companion piece a monument to " unknown worth " , celebrating the bravery of ordinary people . 
 On 5 September 1887 , a letter was published in The Times from Watts , proposing a scheme to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria by means of collecting and commemorating " a complete record of the stories of heroism in every @-@ day life " . He cited the death of Alice Ayres as an example of the type of event he proposed to commemorate , and included in his letter a distorted account of Ayres 's actions during the Union Street fire . 
 The roll would be a long one , but I would cite as an example the name of Alice Ayres , the maid of all work at an <unk> 's in Gravel @-@ lane , in April , 1885 , who lost her life in saving those of her master 's children . 
 The facts , in case your readers have forgotten them , were shortly these : — <unk> by the cries of " Fire " and the heat of the fiercely advancing flames the girl is seen at the window of an upper story , and the crowd , holding up some clothes to break her fall , entreat her to jump at once for her life . Instead she goes back , and reappears dragging a feather bed after her , which , with great difficulty , she pushes through the window . The bed caught and stretched , the girl is again at the window , a child of three in her arms , which with great care and skill she throws safely upon the mattress . Twice again with still older children she repeats the heroic feat . When her turn comes to jump , suffocated or too exhausted by her efforts , she cannot save herself . She jumps , but too feebly , falls upon the pavement , and is carried insensibly to St. Thomas 's Hospital , where she dies . 
 Watts had originally proposed that the monument take the form of a colossal bronze figure , but by 1887 was proposing that the memorial take the form of " a kind of Campo Santo " , consisting of a covered way and marble wall inscribed with the names of everyday heroes , to be built in Hyde Park . Watts 's suggestion was not taken up , leading Watts to comment that " if I had proposed a race course round Hyde Park , there would have been plenty of sympathisers " . However , his high profile lobbying further raised the already high public awareness of the death of Alice Ayres . 
 = = = Depiction in literature and art = = = 
 Emilia Aylmer Blake wrote perhaps the first poem about Ayres , titled Alice Ayres , which she recited at a social gathering in June 1885 . Sir Francis Hastings Doyle also wrote a well @-@ received poem in honour of Ayres , as did leading social reformer and women 's rights campaigner Laura Ormiston Chant . By the late 1880s Ayres was coming to be seen as a model of British devotion to duty , and her story was told in collections of heroic and inspirational stories for children , including as the first story in F. J. Cross 's influential Beneath the Banner , in which Cross remarked that : " She had tried to do her best always . Her loving tenderness to the children committed to her care and her pure gentle life were remarked by those around her before there was any thought of her dying a heroic death . So , when the great trial came , she was prepared ; and what seems to us Divine unselfishness appeared to her but simple duty . " 
 In 1890 a series of painted panels by Walter Crane were unveiled in Octavia Hill 's Red Cross Hall , 550 yards ( 500 m ) from the site of the Union Street fire . Inspired by George Frederic Watts 's proposals , the panels depicted instances of heroism in everyday life ; Watts himself refused to become involved in the project , as his proposed monument was intended to be a source of inspiration and contemplation as opposed to simply commemoration , and he felt that an artistic work would potentially distract viewers from the most important element of the cases , the heroic sacrifices of the individuals involved . 
 The first of Crane 's panels depicted the Union Street fire . It is an idealised image depicting Ayres as the rescued rather than the rescuer , blending religious imagery with traditional 19th @-@ century symbols of British heroism , and bears no relationship to actual events . Ayres , in a long and flowing pure white gown , stands at a first floor window , surrounded in flames and holding a small child . A fireman stands on a ladder and reaches out to Ayres and the child ; meanwhile , a sailor in full Royal Navy uniform holds a second child . Although in reality Ayres had been at a much higher level of the building and the heat of the burning oil and gunpowder had made it impossible for the fire brigade to approach the building , by depicting Ayres with the fireman and sailor , widely seen as symbols of British heroism and British strength , Crane 's picture further enhanced her growing reputation as a heroic figure . Crane 's picture in the Red Cross Hall was itself mentioned in Alice Ayres , a border ballad by National Trust founder Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley published in his 1896 Ballads of Brave Deeds , for which George Frederic Watts wrote the preface . 
 = = = Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice = = = 
 In 1898 George Frederic Watts was approached by Henry Gamble , vicar of St Botolph 's Aldersgate church in the City of London . St Botolph 's former churchyard had recently been converted , along with two smaller adjoining burial grounds , into Postman 's Park , one of the largest public parks in the City of London , and the church was engaged in a protracted financial and legal dispute over ownership of part of the park . To provide a public justification for keeping the disputed land as part of the park , and to raise the park 's profile and assist in fundraising , the church offered part of the park as a site for his proposed memorial . Watts agreed , and in 1900 the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice was unveiled by Alfred Newton , Lord Mayor of London , and Mandell Creighton , Bishop of London . The Memorial consisted of a 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) long and 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) tall wooden loggia with a tiled roof , designed by Ernest George , sheltering a wall with space for 120 ceramic memorial tablets . 
 The memorial tablets were handmade and expensive to produce , and at the time of the Memorial 's unveiling only four were in place . In 1902 a further nine tablets were unveiled , including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had long lobbied . Made by William De Morgan in the Arts and Crafts style , the green @-@ and @-@ white tablet reads " Alice Ayres , daughter of a bricklayer 's labourer who by intrepid conduct saved 3 children from a burning house in Union Street , Borough , at the cost of her own young life April 24 , 1885 " . 
 = = = Changing attitudes and differing perceptions = = = 
 Although the public would have been familiar with the concept of a female national heroic figure following the widespread coverage and public admiration of Harriet Newell , Grace Darling , and Florence Nightingale , the ongoing coverage of Ayres and her elevation as a national hero was unusual for the period . Ayres was an uneducated working @-@ class woman , who after her death underwent what has been described as " a secular canonisation " , at a time when , despite the gradual formal recognition of the contributions of the lower classes , national heroes were generally male and engaged in exploration , the military , religion or science and engineering . 
 This was a period in which political pressures for social reform were growing . The version of Ayres presented to the public as a woman devoted entirely to duty embodied the idealised British character at the time , while the image of a hard working but uncomplaining woman who set the welfare of others above her own embodied the idealised vision of the working class presented by social reformers , and the ideal selfless and dedicated woman presented by campaigners for women 's rights . At the unveiling of the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice the Lord Mayor , Alfred Newton , had remarked that it was " intended to perpetuate the acts of heroism which belonged to the working classes " , while George Frederic Watts , although he was opposed in principle to discrimination based on class and saw the Memorial as being theoretically open to all classes , had remarked that " the higher classes do not or ought not to require reminders or inducements " . Watts saw the purpose of his Memorial not as a commemoration of deeds , but as a tool for the education of the lower classes . 
 Watts 's view was shared by others who sought to provide inspirational material on British heroes , and authors writing about Ayres systematically altered the fact that the children rescued were members of her family , instead describing them as the children of her employer . Press reports at the time of the fire described Ayres variously as a " little nursemaid " , " a willing , honest , hard @-@ working servant " , and a " poor little domestic " . As well as Watts 's 1887 description of Ayres as " the maid of all work at an <unk> 's " , Cross 's chapter on Ayres in Beneath the Banner is titled " Only a Nurse Girl ! " , while Rawnsley called her " the nursemaid in the household " . Barrington , writing five years after the fire at the unveiling of Price 's panel , acknowledges in a footnote that Ayres was related to the Chandlers , but nonetheless describes her as displaying the " typical English virtues — courage , fortitude , and an unquestioning sense of duty " . 
 While George and Mary Watts and their fellow <unk> social reformers , along with the broadly sympathetic mainstream British press , portrayed Ayres as an inspirational selfless servant to her employer , others had a different view . The left @-@ wing Reynolds Weekly Newspaper complained that the lack of support for Ayres 's family from the state was symbolic of poor treatment of workers as a whole . The pioneering feminist periodical The Englishwoman 's Review described their " righteous pride " at Ayres 's " instinctive motherhood " ; on the other hand Young England , an imperialist children 's story paper , said that " there is no sex in self @-@ sacrifice " , lauding Ayres as a model of devotion to duty .

 In 1936 the new Labour administration of the London County Council renamed White Cross Street , near the site of the Red Cross Hall and the scene of the Union Street fire , to Ayres Street in tribute to Alice Ayres , a name it retains today . The Chandlers ' house at 194 Union Street no longer stands , and the site is occupied by part of the Union House office complex ; immediately opposite the site of the fire is the present @-@ day headquarters of the London Fire Brigade . 
 Alice Ayres came to renewed public notice with the release of the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber and the 2004 BAFTA <unk> and Golden Globe @-@ winning film Closer based on it starring Natalie Portman , Julia Roberts , Jude Law and Clive Owen . A key plot element revolves around the memorial tablet to Ayres in Postman 's Park , in which it is revealed that the character Jane Jones ( played by Portman in the film ) , who calls herself Alice Ayres for most of the story , has in fact fabricated her identity based on the tablet on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice , which she reads at the time of her first meeting with Dan Woolf ( played by Jude Law in the film ) at the beginning of the action . The park , and the memorial to Ayres , feature prominently in the opening and closing scenes of the film .

 He was part of a 2005 Chicago area sophomore class that was considered to be the best in the history of the state of Illinois . It included Derrick Rose and his St. Joseph 's teammate Turner . Isiah Thomas is St. Joseph 's most famous basketball alum , but McCamey was at the time mentioned as the potential next great St. Joseph 's product . The class of 2007 was compared to the Chicago area class of 1979 that included Thomas , Terry Cummings , and Darrell Walker as well as the class of 1998 that included Quentin Richardson , Corey Maggette , Frank Williams , Bobby Simmons , Michael Wright . McCamey was considered the second best area prospect after Rose . 
 As a junior , he and Turner attended 2005 Midnight Madness with the Wisconsin Badgers men 's basketball team . At the beginning of his junior season , Chicago Tribune named him to its annual top Chicago metropolitan area basketball players list , and it ranked St. Joseph number three in the area .
