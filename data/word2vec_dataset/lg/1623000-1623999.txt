 In February 1941 , Oregon was redesignated IX @-@ 22 . Due to the outbreak of World War II , it was decided that the scrap value of the ship was more important than her historical value , so she was sold . Her stripped hulk was later returned to the Navy and used as an ammunition barge during the battle of Guam , where she remained for several years . During a typhoon in November 1948 , she broke loose and drifted out to sea . She was located 500 mi ( 800 km ) southeast of Guam and towed back . She was sold on 15 March 1956 and scrapped in Japan . 
 = Andromeda Galaxy = 
 The Andromeda Galaxy ( / <unk> / ) , also known as Messier 31 , M31 , or NGC 224 , is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs ( 2 @.@ 5 million light @-@ years ) from Earth . It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts . It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears , the constellation of Andromeda , which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda . 
 Being approximately 220 @,@ 000 light years across , it is the largest galaxy of the Local Group , which also contains the Milky Way , the Triangulum Galaxy , and about 44 other smaller galaxies . Despite earlier findings that suggested that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and could be the largest in the grouping , the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that Andromeda contains one trillion ( 1012 ) stars : at least twice the number of stars in the Milky Way , which is estimated to be 200 – 400 billion . 
 The mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1 @.@ 5 × 1012 solar masses , while the Milky Way is estimated to be 8 @.@ 5 × 1011 solar masses . In comparison , a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and M31 are about equal in mass , while a 2006 study put the mass of the Milky Way at ~ 80 % of the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy . The Milky Way and Andromeda are expected to collide in 3 @.@ 75 billion years , eventually merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disc galaxy . 
 The apparent magnitude of the Andromeda Galaxy , at 3 @.@ 4 , is one of the brightest of any of the Messier objects , making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights , even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution . Although it appears more than six times as wide as the full moon when photographed through a larger telescope , only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye or when viewed using binoculars or a small telescope , making it appear similar to a star . 
 = = Observation history = = 
 In the year 964 , the Persian astronomer Abd al @-@ Rahman al @-@ Sufi described the Andromeda Galaxy , in his Book of Fixed Stars as a " nebulous smear " . Star charts of that period labeled it as the Little Cloud . In 1612 , the German astronomer Simon Marius gave an early description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on telescopic observations . In 1764 , Charles Messier catalogued Andromeda as object M31 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer despite it being visible to the naked eye . In 1785 , the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of M31 . He believed M31 to be the nearest of all the " great nebulae " and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula , he incorrectly guessed that it is no more than 2 @,@ 000 times the distance of Sirius . In 1850 , William Parsons , 3rd Earl of Rosse , saw and made the first drawing of Andromeda 's spiral structure . 
 In 1864 , William Huggins observed the spectrum of M31 and noted that it differs from a gaseous nebula . The spectra of M31 displays a continuum of frequencies , superimposed with dark absorption lines that help identify the chemical composition of an object . M31 's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars , and from this it was deduced that M31 has a stellar nature . In 1885 , a supernova ( known as S Andromedae ) was seen in M31 , the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy . At the time M31 was considered to be a nearby object , so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a nova , and was named accordingly ; " Nova 1885 " . 
 In 1887 , Isaac Roberts took the first photographs of M31 , which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy . Roberts actually mistook M31 and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed . In 1912 , Vesto Slipher used spectroscopy to measure the radial velocity of M31 with respect to our solar system — the largest velocity yet measured , at 300 kilometres per second ( 190 mi / s ) . 
 = = = Island universe = = = 
 In 1917 , American astronomer Heber Curtis observed a nova within M31 . Searching the photographic record , 11 more novae were discovered . Curtis noticed that these novae were , on average , 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky . As a result , he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 500 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 3 @.@ 2 × 1010 AU ) . He became a proponent of the so @-@ called " island universes " hypothesis , which held that spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies . 
 In 1920 , the Great Debate between Harlow Shapley and Curtis took place , concerning the nature of the Milky Way , spiral nebulae , and the dimensions of the universe . To support his claim of the Great Andromeda Nebula being , in fact , an external galaxy , Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy , as well as historical observations of Andromeda 's significant Doppler shift . In 1922 Ernst Öpik presented a method to estimate the distance of M31 using the measured velocities of its stars . His result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about 450 @,@ 000 parsecs ( 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 ly ) . Edwin Hubble settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extra @-@ galactic Cepheid variable stars for the first time on astronomical photos of M31 . These were made using the 2 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 100 @-@ in ) Hooker telescope , and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined . His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our own Galaxy , but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way . 
 M31 plays an important role in galactic studies , as it is the nearest major galaxy ( although not the nearest galaxy ) . In 1943 Walter Baade was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy . Baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity , naming the young , high velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older , red stars in the bulge Type II . This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way , and elsewhere . ( The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort . ) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables , which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to M31 , as well as the remainder of the Universe . 
 Radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was first detected by Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory using the 218 @-@ ft Transit Telescope , and was announced in 1950 ( earlier observations were made by radio astronomy pioneer Grote Reber in 1940 , but were inconclusive , and were later shown to be an order of magnitude too high ) . The first radio maps of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group . The core of the Andromeda Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalogue . In 2009 , the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy . This was detected using a technique called microlensing , which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object . 
 = = General = = 
 The estimated distance of the Andromeda Galaxy was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is another , dimmer type of Cepheid . In the 1990s , measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the Hipparcos satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances . 
 = = = Formation and history = = = 
 According to a team of astronomers reporting in 2010 , M31 was formed out of the collision of two smaller galaxies between 5 and 9 billion years ago . 
 A paper published in 2012 has outlined M31 's basic history since its birth . According to it , Andromeda was born roughly 10 billion years ago from the merger of many smaller protogalaxies , leading to a galaxy smaller than the one we see today . 
 The most important event in M31 's history was the merger mentioned above that took place 8 billion years ago . This violent collision formed most of its ( metal @-@ rich ) galactic halo and extended disk and during that epoch Andromeda 's star formation would have been very high , to the point of becoming a luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years . M31 and the Triangulum Galaxy ( M33 ) had a very close passage 2 – 4 billion years ago . This event produced high levels of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy 's disk – even some globular clusters – and disturbed M33 's outer disk . 
 While there has been activity during the last 2 billion years , this has been much lower than during the past . During this epoch , star formation throughout M31 's disk was thought to have decreased to the point of near @-@ inactivity , however , such activity had increased relatively recently . There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32 , M110 , or others that have already been absorbed by M31 . These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda 's Giant Stellar Stream . A merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter @-@ rotating disk of gas found in the center of M31 as well as the presence there of a relatively young ( 100 million years old ) stellar population . 
 = = = Recent distance estimate = = = 
 At least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances to the Andromeda Galaxy . 
 In 2003 , using the infrared surface brightness fluctuations ( I @-@ <unk> ) and adjusting for the new period @-@ luminosity value of Freedman et al . 2001 and using a metallicity correction of − 0 @.@ 2 mag dex − 1 in ( O / H ) , an estimate of 2 @.@ 57 ± 0 @.@ 06 million light @-@ years ( 1 @.@ 625 × 1011 ± 3 @.@ 8 × 109 AU ) was derived . 
 Using the Cepheid variable method , an estimate of 2 @.@ 51 ± 0 @.@ 13 million light @-@ years ( 770 ± 40 kpc ) was reported in 2004 . 
 In 2005 Ignasi Ribas ( CSIC , Institute for Space Studies of Catalonia ( <unk> ) ) and colleagues announced the discovery of an eclipsing binary star in the Andromeda Galaxy . The binary star , designated <unk> + <unk> , has two luminous and hot blue stars of types O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars , which occur every 3 @.@ <unk> days , astronomers were able to measure their sizes . Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars , they were able to measure their absolute magnitude . When the visual and absolute magnitudes are known , the distance to the star can be measured . The stars lie at a distance of 2 @.@ 52 × 10 ^ 6 ± 0 @.@ 14 × 10 ^ 6 ly ( 1 @.@ 594 × 1011 ± 8 @.@ 9 × 109 AU ) and the whole Andromeda Galaxy at about 2 @.@ 5 × 10 ^ 6 ly ( 1 @.@ 6 × 1011 AU ) . This new value is in excellent agreement with the previous , independent Cepheid @-@ based distance value . 
 M31 is close enough that the Tip of the Red Giant Branch ( <unk> ) method may also be used to estimate its distance . The estimated distance to M31 using this technique in 2005 yielded 2 @.@ 56 × 10 ^ 6 ± 0 @.@ 08 × 10 ^ 6 ly ( 1 @.@ 619 × 1011 ± 5 @.@ 1 × 109 AU ) . 
 Averaged together , all these distance estimates give a combined value of 2 @.@ 54 × 10 ^ 6 ± 0 @.@ 11 × 10 ^ 6 ly ( 1 @.@ 606 × 1011 ± 7 @.@ 0 × 109 AU ) . And , from this , the diameter of M31 at the widest point is estimated to be 220 ± 3 kly ( 67 @,@ 450 ± 920 pc ) . Applying trigonometry ( angular diameter ) , this is equivalent to an apparent 4 @.@ 96 ° angle in the sky . 
 = = = Mass and luminosity estimates = = = 
 = = = = Mass = = = = 
 Mass estimates for the Andromeda Galaxy 's halo ( including dark matter ) give a value of approximately 1 @.@ 5 × 1012 M ☉ ( or 1 @.@ 5 trillion solar masses ) compared to 8 × 1011 M ☉ for the Milky Way . This contradicts earlier measurements , that seem to indicate that Andromeda and the Milky Way are almost equal in mass . Even so , M31 's spheroid actually has a higher stellar density than that of the Milky Way and its galactic stellar disk is about twice the size of that of the Milky Way . The total stellar mass of Andromeda is estimated to be 1 @.@ 1 × 1011 M ☉ . , ( i.e. , around twice as massive as that of the Milky Way ) , or up to 1 @.@ 5 × 1011 M ☉ according to other estimates , with around 30 % of that mass in the central bulge , 56 % in the disk , and the remaining 14 % in the halo . 
 In addition to it , M31 's interstellar medium contains at least around 7 @.@ 2 × 109 M ☉ in the form of neutral hydrogen , at least 3 @.@ 4 × 108 M ☉ as molecular hydrogen ( within its innermost 10 kiloparsecs ) , and 5 @.@ 4 × 107 M ☉ of dust . 
 Studies made with the help of the Hubble Space Telescope and published in 2015 , have uncovered a large and massive halo of hot gas enveloping M31 . This halo is estimated to contain half the mass of the stars in the Andromeda galaxy itself . As of May 7 , 2015 , the halo is about six times larger and 1 @,@ 000 times more massive than previously measured . The nearly invisible halo stretches about a million light @-@ years from its host galaxy , halfway to our Milky Way galaxy . Simulations of galaxies indicate the halo formed at the same time as the Andromeda galaxy . The halo is enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium , formed from supernovae and its properties are the expected on a galaxy that lies in the green valley of the color @-@ magnitude diagram ( see below ) . The supernovae erupt in Andromeda 's star @-@ filled disk and eject these heavier elements into space . Over Andromeda 's lifetime , nearly half of the heavy elements made by its stars have been ejected far beyond the galaxy 's 200 @,@ 000 @-@ light @-@ year @-@ diameter stellar disk . 
 = = = = Luminosity = = = = 
 M31 appears to have significantly more common stars than the Milky Way , seeming to predominate the old stars with ages > 7 × 109 years , and the estimated luminosity of M31 , ~ 2 @.@ 6 × 1010 L ☉ , is about 25 % higher than that of our own galaxy . However , the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light , so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy ( including to propose it is the second brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega parsecs of the Milky Way , after the Sombrero Galaxy , with an absolute magnitude of around <unk> or close ) 
 An estimation done with the help of Spitzer Space Telescope published in 2010 suggests an absolute magnitude ( in the blue ) of − 20 @.@ 89 ( that with a color index of + 0 @.@ 63 translates to an absolute visual magnitude of − 21 @.@ 52 , compared to − 20 @.@ 9 for the Milky Way ) , and a total luminosity in that wavelength of 3 @.@ 64 × 1010 L ☉ . 
 The rate of star formation in the Milky Way is much higher , with M31 producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3 – 5 solar masses for the Milky Way . The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of M31 . This suggests that M31 once experienced a great star formation phase , but is now in a relative state of quiescence , whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation . Should this continue , the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of M31 . 
 According to recent studies , like the Milky Way , the Andromeda Galaxy lies in what in the galaxy color – magnitude diagram is known as the green valley , a region populated by galaxies in transition from the blue cloud ( galaxies actively forming new stars ) to the red sequence ( galaxies that lack star formation ) . Star formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star @-@ forming gas in the interstellar medium . In simulated galaxies with similar properties , star formation will typically have been extinguished within about five billion years from now , even accounting for the expected , short @-@ term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between Andromeda and the Milky Way . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Based on its appearance in visible light , the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA ( s ) b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs – Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies . However , data from the 2MASS survey showed that the bulge of M31 has a box @-@ like appearance , which implies that the galaxy is actually a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way , with the Andromeda Galaxy 's bar viewed almost directly along its long axis . 
 In 2005 , astronomers used the Keck telescopes to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself . This means that the spiral disk of stars in M31 is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated . This constitutes evidence that there is a vast , extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than 220 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 67 @,@ 000 pc ) in diameter . Previously , estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy 's size ranged from 70 @,@ 000 to 120 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 21 @,@ 000 to 37 @,@ 000 pc ) across . 
 The galaxy is inclined an estimated 77 ° relative to the Earth ( where an angle of 90 ° would be viewed directly from the side ) . Analysis of the cross @-@ sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced , S @-@ shaped warp , rather than just a flat disk . A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near M31 . The galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in M31 's arms , though more precise distances and radial velocities are required . 
 Spectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the rotational velocity of M31 as a function of radial distance from the core . The rotational velocity has a maximum value of 225 kilometres per second ( 140 mi / s ) at 1 @,@ 300 light @-@ years ( 82 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 AU ) from the core , and it has its minimum possibly as low as 50 kilometres per second ( 31 mi / s ) at 7 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 440 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 AU ) from the core . Further out , rotational velocity rises out to a radius of 33 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 2 @.@ 1 × 109 AU ) , where it reaches a peak of 250 kilometres per second ( 160 mi / s ) . The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance , dropping to around 200 kilometres per second ( 120 mi / s ) at 80 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 5 @.@ 1 × 109 AU ) . These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about 6 × 109 M ☉ in the nucleus . The total mass of the galaxy increases linearly out to 45 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 2 @.@ 8 × 109 AU ) , then more slowly beyond that radius . 
 The spiral arms of M31 are outlined by a series of H II regions , first studied in great detail by Walter Baade and described by him as resembling " beads on a string " . his studies show two spiral arms that appear to be tightly wound , although they are more widely spaced than in our galaxy . His descriptions of the spiral structure , as each arm crosses the major axis of M31 , are as follows § <unk> § <unk> : 
 Since the Andromeda Galaxy is seen close to edge @-@ on , however , the studies of its spiral structure are difficult . While as stated above rectified images of the galaxy seem to show a fairly normal spiral galaxy with the arms wound up in a clockwise direction , exhibiting two continuous trailing arms that are separated from each other by a minimum of about 13 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 820 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 AU ) and that can be followed outward from a distance of roughly 1 @,@ 600 light @-@ years ( 100 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 AU ) from the core , other alternative spiral structures have been proposed such as a single spiral arm or a flocculent pattern of long , filamentary , and thick spiral arms . 
 The most likely cause of the distortions of the spiral pattern is thought to be interaction with galaxy satellites M32 and M110 . This can be seen by the displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars . 
 In 1998 , images from the European Space Agency 's Infrared Space Observatory demonstrated that the overall form of the Andromeda Galaxy may be transitioning into a ring galaxy . The gas and dust within M31 is generally formed into several overlapping rings , with a particularly prominent ring formed at a radius of 32 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 2 @.@ 0 × 109 AU ) ( 10 kiloparsecs ) from the core , nicknamed by some astronomers the ring of fire . This ring is hidden from visible light images of the galaxy because it is composed primarily of cold dust , and most of the star formation that is taking place in M31 is concentrated there . 
 Later studies with the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope showed how Andromeda 's spiral structure in the infrared appears to be composed of two spiral arms that emerge from a central bar and continue beyond the large ring mentioned above . Those arms , however , are not continuous and have a segmented structure . 
 Close examination of the inner region of M31 with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust ring that is believed to have been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago . Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the galaxy in Andromeda along the latter 's polar axis . This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in M31 . It is the co @-@ existence of the long @-@ known large ring @-@ like feature in the gas of Messier 31 , together with this newly discovered inner ring @-@ like structure , offset from the barycenter , that suggested a nearly head @-@ on collision with the satellite M32 , a milder version of the Cartwheel encounter . 
 Studies of the extended halo of M31 show that it is roughly comparable to that of the Milky Way , with stars in the halo being generally " metal @-@ poor " , and increasingly so with greater distance . This evidence indicates that the two galaxies have followed similar evolutionary paths . They are likely to have accreted and assimilated about 100 – 200 low @-@ mass galaxies during the past 12 billion years . The stars in the extended halos of M31 and the Milky Way may extend nearly one @-@ third the distance separating the two galaxies . 
 = = Nucleus = = 
 M31 is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very center . In a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge . The luminosity of the nucleus is in excess of the most luminous globular clusters . 
 In 1991 Tod R. Lauer used WFPC , then on board the Hubble Space Telescope , to image M31 's inner nucleus . The nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by 1 @.@ 5 parsecs ( 4 @.@ 9 ly ) . The brighter concentration , designated as P1 , is offset from the center of the galaxy . The dimmer concentration , P2 , falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a black hole measured at 3 – 5 × 107 M ☉ in 1993 , and at 1 @.@ 1 – 2 @.@ 3 × 108 M ☉ in 2005 . The velocity dispersion of material around it is measured to be ≈ 160 km / s . 
 Scott Tremaine has proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole . The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital <unk> , creating a concentration of stars . P2 also contains a compact disk of hot , spectral class A stars . The A stars are not evident in redder filters , but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus , causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1 . 
 While at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus is the remnant of a small galaxy " cannibalized " by M31 , this is no longer considered a viable explanation , largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to tidal disruption by the central black hole . While this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it , the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center . 
 = = Discrete sources = = 
 Apparently , by late 1968 , no X @-@ rays had been detected from the Andromeda Galaxy . A balloon flight on October 20 , 1970 , set an upper limit for detectable hard X @-@ rays from M31 . 
 Multiple X @-@ ray sources have since been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy , using observations from the ESA 's XMM @-@ Newton orbiting observatory . Robin Barnard et al. hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or neutron stars , which are heating incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X @-@ rays . The spectrum of the neutron stars is the same as the hypothesized black holes , but can be distinguished by their masses . 
 There are approximately 460 globular clusters associated with the Andromeda Galaxy . The most massive of these clusters , identified as Mayall II , nicknamed Globular One , has a greater luminosity than any other known globular cluster in the Local Group of galaxies . It contains several million stars , and is about twice as luminous as Omega Centauri , the brightest known globular cluster in the Milky Way . Globular One ( or G1 ) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular . As a result , some consider G1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by M31 in the distant past . The globular with the greatest apparent brightness is <unk> which is located in the south @-@ west arm 's eastern half . Another massive globular cluster <unk> 037 @-@ <unk> , discovered in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the Andromeda Galaxy 's interstellar dust , was thought to be more massive than G1 and the largest cluster of the Local Group ; however other studies have shown is actually similar in properties to G1 . 
 Unlike the globular clusters of the Milky Way , which show a relatively low age dispersion , Andromeda 's globular clusters have a much larger range of ages : from systems as old as the galaxy itself to much younger systems , with ages between a few hundred million years to five billion years 
 In 2005 , astronomers discovered a completely new type of star cluster in M31 . The new @-@ found clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars , a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters . What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger — several hundred light @-@ years across — and hundreds of times less dense . The distances between the stars are , therefore , much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters . 
 In the year 2012 , a microquasar , a radio burst emanating from a smaller black hole , was detected in the Andromeda Galaxy . The progenitor black hole was located near the galactic center and had about 10 <formula> . Discovered through a data collected by the ESA 's XMM @-@ Newton probe , and subsequently observed by NASA 's Swift and Chandra , the Very Large Array , and the Very Long Baseline Array , the microquasar was the first observed within the Andromeda Galaxy and the first outside of the Milky Way Galaxy . 
 = = Satellites = = 
 Like the Milky Way , the Andromeda Galaxy has satellite galaxies , consisting of 14 known dwarf galaxies . The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110 . Based on current evidence , it appears that M32 underwent a close encounter with M31 ( Andromeda ) in the past . M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31 , and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region , which lasted until the relatively recent past . 
 M110 also appears to be interacting with M31 , and astronomers have found in the halo of M31 a stream of metal @-@ rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies . M110 does contain a dusty lane , which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation . 
 In 2006 it was discovered that nine of these galaxies lie along a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy , rather than being randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions . This may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites . 
 = = Collision with the Milky Way = = 
 The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 110 kilometres per second ( 68 mi / s ) . It has been measured approaching relative to our Sun at around 300 kilometres per second ( 190 mi / s ) as the Sun orbits around the center of our galaxy at a speed of approximately 225 kilometres per second ( 140 mi / s ) . This makes Andromeda one of about 100 blueshifted galaxies that we observe . Andromeda 's tangential or side @-@ ways velocity with respect to the Milky Way is relatively much smaller than the approaching velocity and therefore it is expected to directly collide with the Milky Way in about 4 billion years . A likely outcome of the collision is that the galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy or perhaps even a large disc galaxy . Such events are frequent among the galaxies in galaxy groups . The fate of the Earth and the Solar System in the event of a collision is currently unknown . Before the galaxies merge , there is a small chance that the Solar System could be ejected from the Milky Way or join M31 . 
 = Lactarius vietus = 
 Lactarius vietus ( commonly known as the grey milkcap ) is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae , first described by Elias Magnus Fries . It produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms , which grow on the forest floor or on rotting wood . The flattened @-@ convex cap can vary in shape , sometimes forming the shape of a wide funnel . It is typically grey , but the colour varies . The species has crowded , light @-@ coloured gills , which produce white milk . The spore print is typically whitish , but also varies considerably . The mushrooms typically have a strong , acrid taste and have been described as inedible , but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling . L. vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees , and it favours birch . It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe , North America and eastern Asia . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Lactarius vietus was first described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 as Agaricus vietus in his Systema Mycologicum . In his 1838 work Epicrisis <unk> <unk> , Fries reclassified the species as a Lactarius , giving it its current name . Subsequent attempts to reclassify the species have been unsuccessful . In his 1871 work Der Führer in die Pilzkunde , Paul Kummer reclassified the species as a member of Galorrheus , and in Otto Kuntze 's 1891 Revisio generum plantarum , the species was placed in the genus Lactifluus . Both Galorrheus vietus and Lactifluus vietus are now considered obligate synonyms ( different names for the same species based on one type ) of Lactarius vietus . The specific epithet is from the Latin vietus , meaning shrunken . It is commonly known as the grey milkcap .

The stem measures 2 @.@ 5 to 8 centimetres ( 1 to 3 in ) by 2 to 7 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 8 to 3 in ) , and is generally cylindrical in shape . Sometimes the stem narrows downwards , or is club @-@ shaped . In colour , the stem whitish or greyish , paler at the top , and is rather weak and easily broken . The flesh is a whitish @-@ buff colour , and is often absent in the stem , leaving it hollow . The crowded gills are can be decurrent ( with the gill running down the stem ) or adnate ( with the entire depth of the gill connecting to the stem ) , and in colour are whitish to a dirty buff . They are thin and flaccid , and there are three to four tiers of lamellulae ( short gills that do not reach the stem from the cap margin ) . The gills produce white milk , which dries a brownish or greenish grey after about 20 minutes . The mushroom flesh will slowly stain a greyish colour if a drop of FeSO4 solution is applied to it as a chemical colour test .

 The spore print is typically a creamy white , with a slight salmon tinge , but it has been observed to vary from white to yellow depending on the density , meaning that it is not a useful means of identification . Individual spores are a buff @-@ white , amyloid ( staining blue in Melzer 's reagent ) and hyaline . In shape , the spores are elliptic , with a moderately well @-@ developed network of ridges , measuring between 8 and 9 @.@ 5 by 6 @.@ 5 to 7 @.@ 5 micrometres ( μm ) . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the face of the gills ) are shaped like narrow spindles , typically measuring between 40 and 75 μm long , but sometimes reaching 86 μm in length , by 6 and 11 μm wide at the widest point . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the edge of the gills ) are leaf or spindle shaped , measuring between 30 and 52 μm long by 4 to 7 μm wide .

 Lactarius uvidus is similar in appearance . In colour , it is a pale pink @-@ buff , and its flesh turns a violet @-@ lilac colour when cut . The white milk has a mild taste . Lactarius <unk> , a species described by Fries but not often mentioned by the mycological community for some time after his death , is also similar . Meinhard Moser , examining the identity of L. <unk> , concluded that it " is certainly more closely related to L. vietus than to L. fuscus , but differs in habit and colour . The spores are slightly longer and the sculptures are less pronounced in L. vietus . "

 Lactarius vietus milk has a very hot taste , and the mushroom lacks a distinctive smell . Although described by many mycologists as inedible , David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling , allowing it to be consumed . Though the strong , acrid taste is a defining feature of the species , it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms , which is not unusual for Lactarius species . Occasionally , however , mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste ; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes . 
 = = Distribution , habitat and ecology = = 
 Lactarius vietus is fairly common , and can be found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn , often among Sphagnum moss . Though it strongly favours beech , it has also been found under oak . It forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship with the trees under which it grows . It can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces ; specimens have been observed on both conifer and hardwood logs . These are typically smaller specimens , and it is possible that they represent a dwarf variety . Despite growing on rotting wood , the species is not saprotrophic ; instead , the mycelia of the species are linking with tree roots growing through or near the wood . This is a particularly useful adaptation when the soil is either wet or nutrient @-@ poor . Mushrooms can sometimes grow in large numbers , but they can also be found growing in tight clumps , or solitarily when growing out of season . The species can be found in Europe , with collections in Scandinavia , the British Isles Bulgaria , Germany , and northern Turkey ; in North America , it has been recorded as common in Canada and both the northern and southern United States ; in northern Asia , it was found in regions near both the Oka River and the central <unk> River in Siberia ; and in eastern Asia , it has been collected in China . 
 = HMS Basilisk ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Basilisk was a B @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy around 1930 . Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet , she was transferred to the Home Fleet in 1936 . The ship escorted convoys and conducted anti @-@ submarine patrols early in World War II before participating in the Norwegian Campaign . Basilisk was sunk by German aircraft during the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Basilisk displaced 1 @,@ 360 long tons ( 1 @,@ 380 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 790 long tons ( 1 @,@ 820 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 32 feet 3 inches ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 3 inches ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . She was powered by Brown @-@ Curtis geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . Basilisk carried a maximum of 390 long tons ( 400 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 134 officers and enlisted men , although it increased to 142 during wartime . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre QF 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Basilisk had two 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on a platform between her funnels . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . The ship was fitted with a Type 119 ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water .

 The ship was ordered on 4 March 1929 from John Brown & Company at Clydebank , Glasgow , under the 1928 Naval Programme . She was laid down on 19 August 1929 , and launched on 6 August 1930 , as the eighth RN ship to carry this name . Basilisk was completed on 4 March 1931 at a cost of £ 220 @,@ 342 , excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns , ammunition and communications equipment . After her commissioning , she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1936 . The flotilla was reassigned to the Home Fleet in September 1936 . 
 In February 1937 Basilisk arrived at the post of Málaga , Spain , captured a few days before by the Franco 's forces in the Spanish Civil War . Basilisk 's captain gained the release of Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell , a British zoologist resident in Málaga , who was arrested by Franco 's troops due to his support of the Spanish Republic . 
 The ship became the emergency destroyer at Devonport in March 1939 and was assigned to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla when World War II began . 
 Basilisk spent the next two months escorting convoys and patrolling in the English Channel and the North Sea . The ship and her sister Blanche were escorting the minelayer Adventure on the morning of 13 November in the Thames Estuary when they entered a minefield laid the night before by several German destroyers . Adventure and Blanche both struck mines ; the latter lost all power and later capsized whilst under tow . Basilisk continued to escort convoys and patrol until April 1940 when the Norwegian Campaign began . On 24 April , the ship , together with the destroyers Wren and Hesperus , escorted the battleship Resolution to Narvik on 24 April . In early May , she escorted the troopship Empress of Australia to Norway . Basilisk supported the Allied landings on 12 – 13 May at Bjerkvik during the Battle of Narvik . 
 The ship was transferred from the Western Approaches Command on 30 May to support the evacuation from Dunkirk . She made two trips to Dover during the following day and evacuated a total of 695 men . Basilisk returned to La Panne to load more troops on the morning of 1 June and was attacked three times by German bombers . One bomb from the first wave detonated inside the No. 3 boiler room , killed all of her boiler and engine room personnel , fractured her steam lines and knocked out all her machinery . Near misses from the same attack buckled the sides of her hull and her upper deck . The ship 's torpedoes and depth charges were jettisoned to reduce topweight and the French fishing trawler Jolie <unk> attempted to tow Basilisk . A second attack caused no further damage , but caused the French ship to drop the tow . The third attack around noon sank Basilisk in shallow water at 51 ° 08 ′ 16 ″ N 02 ° 35 ′ 06 ″ E. Jolie <unk> and the destroyer Whitehall rescued eight officers and 123 crewmen from the ship . Whitehall then destroyed the wreck with gunfire and torpedoes . 
 = DNA = 
 <unk> acid ( / <unk> , <unk> / ; DNA ) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth , development , functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses . DNA and RNA are nucleic acids ; alongside proteins and complex carbohydrates ( polysaccharides ) , they are one of the three major types of <unk> that are essential for all known forms of life . Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix . 
 The two DNA strands are known as <unk> since they are composed of simpler units called nucleotides . Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen @-@ containing nucleobase — either cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , adenine ( A ) , or thymine ( T ) — as well as a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group . The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next , resulting in an alternating sugar @-@ phosphate backbone . According to base pairing rules ( A with T , and C with G ) , hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double @-@ stranded DNA . The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5 @.@ 0 x 1037 , and weighs 50 billion tonnes . In comparison , the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 <unk> ( trillion tons of carbon ) . 
 DNA stores biological information . The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage , and both strands of the double @-@ stranded structure store the same biological information . Biological information is replicated as the two strands are separated . A significant portion of DNA ( more than 98 % for humans ) is non @-@ coding , meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences . 
 The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore anti @-@ parallel . Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases ( informally , bases ) . It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information . Under the genetic code , RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins . These RNA strands are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription . 
 Within eukaryotic cells , DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes . During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication , providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes . Eukaryotic organisms ( animals , plants , fungi , and protists ) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles , such as mitochondria or chloroplasts . In contrast , prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm . Within the eukaryotic chromosomes , chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA . These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins , helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed . 
 DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869 . Its molecular structure was identified by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 , whose model @-@ building efforts were guided by X @-@ ray diffraction data acquired by Rosalind Franklin . DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories , such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity . The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano @-@ fabrication . Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA @-@ based hybrid materials . 
 = = Properties = = 
 DNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides . The structure of DNA is non @-@ static , all species comprises two helical chains each coiled round the same axis , and each with a pitch of 34 ångströms ( 3 @.@ 4 nanometres ) and a radius of 10 ångströms ( 1 @.@ 0 <unk> ) . According to another study , when measured in a particular solution , the DNA chain measured 22 to 26 ångströms wide ( 2 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 6 nanometres ) , and one nucleotide unit measured 3 @.@ 3 Å ( 0 @.@ 33 nm ) long . Although each individual repeating unit is very small , DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions of nucleotides . For instance , the DNA in the largest human chromosome , chromosome number 1 , consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85 mm long if straightened . 
 In living organisms DNA does not usually exist as a single molecule , but instead as a pair of molecules that are held tightly together . These two long strands entwine like vines , in the shape of a double helix . The nucleotide repeats contain both the segment of the backbone of the molecule , which holds the chain together , and a nucleobase , which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix . A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide . A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides ( as in DNA ) is called a polynucleotide . 
 The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues . The sugar in DNA is 2 @-@ deoxyribose , which is a pentose ( five @-@ carbon ) sugar . The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings . These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction . In a double helix the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand : the strands are antiparallel . The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are called the 5 ′ ( five prime ) and 3 ′ ( three prime ) ends , with the 5 ′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3 ′ end a terminal hydroxyl group . One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar , with the 2 @-@ deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA . 
 The DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces : hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base @-@ stacking interactions among aromatic nucleobases . In the aqueous environment of the cell , the conjugated π bonds of nucleotide bases align perpendicular to the axis of the DNA molecule , minimizing their interaction with the solvation shell and therefore , the Gibbs free energy . The four bases found in DNA are adenine ( abbreviated A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) and thymine ( T ) . These four bases are attached to the sugar / phosphate to form the complete nucleotide , as shown for adenosine monophosphate . Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine . It was represented by A @-@ T base pairs and G @-@ C base pairs . 
 = = = <unk> classification = = = 
 The nucleobases are classified into two types : the purines , A and G , being fused five- and six @-@ membered heterocyclic compounds , and the pyrimidines , the six @-@ membered rings C and T. A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase , uracil ( U ) , usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring . In addition to RNA and DNA a large number of artificial nucleic acid analogues have also been created to study the properties of nucleic acids , or for use in biotechnology . 
 <unk> is not usually found in DNA , occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine . However , in a number of bacteriophages – Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages <unk> and <unk> and Yersinia bacteriophage <unk> @-@ 37 – thymine has been replaced by uracil . Another phage - Staphylococcal phage S6 - has been identified with a genome where thymine has been replaced by uracil . 
 Base J ( beta @-@ d @-@ <unk> ) , a modified form of uracil , is also found in a number of organisms : the flagellates <unk> and Euglena , and all the <unk> genera . Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps : in the first step a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into <unk> ; in the second <unk> is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified . These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the <unk> oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia . J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II . 
 = = = Grooves = = = 
 Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone . Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces , or grooves , between the strands . These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a binding site . As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other , the grooves are unequally sized . One groove , the major groove , is 22 Å wide and the other , the minor groove , is 12 Å wide . The width of the major groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove . As a result , proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double @-@ stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove . This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell ( see below ) , but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form . 
 = = = Base pairing = = = 
 In a DNA double helix , each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand . This is called complementary base pairing . Here , purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines , with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds , and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds . This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a base pair . As hydrogen bonds are not covalent , they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily . The two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper , either by a mechanical force or high temperature . As a result of this complementarity , all the information in the double @-@ stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand , which is vital in DNA replication . Indeed , this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms . 
 The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds , AT forming two hydrogen bonds , and GC forming three hydrogen bonds ( see figures , right ) . DNA with high GC @-@ content is more stable than DNA with low GC @-@ content . 
 As noted above , most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands , bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds ; this double stranded structure ( dsDNA ) is maintained largely by the <unk> base stacking interactions , which are strongest for G , C stacks . The two strands can come apart – a process known as melting – to form two single @-@ stranded DNA molecules ( ssDNA ) molecules . Melting occurs at high temperature , low salt and high pH ( low pH also melts DNA , but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination , low pH is rarely used ) . 
 The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC @-@ content ( % G , C basepairs ) but also on sequence ( since stacking is sequence specific ) and also length ( longer molecules are more stable ) . The stability can be measured in various ways ; a common way is the " melting temperature " , which is the temperature at which 50 % of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules ; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA . As a result , it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA . Long DNA helices with a high GC @-@ content have stronger @-@ interacting strands , while short helices with high AT content have weaker @-@ interacting strands . In biology , parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily , such as the <unk> <unk> box in some promoters , tend to have a high AT content , making the strands easier to pull apart . 
 In the laboratory , the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds , their melting temperature ( also called Tm value ) . When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt , the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules . These single @-@ stranded DNA molecules ( ssDNA ) have no single common shape , but some conformations are more stable than others . 
 = = = Sense and antisense = = = 
 A DNA sequence is called " sense " if its sequence is the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein . The sequence on the opposite strand is called the " antisense " sequence . Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA ( i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences ) . In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes , antisense RNA sequences are produced , but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear . One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA @-@ RNA base pairing . 
 A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes , and more in plasmids and viruses , blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes . In these cases , some DNA sequences do double duty , encoding one protein when read along one strand , and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand . In bacteria , this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription , while in viruses , overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called DNA supercoiling . With DNA in its " relaxed " state , a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10 @.@ 4 base pairs , but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound . If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix , this is positive supercoiling , and the bases are held more tightly together . If they are twisted in the opposite direction , this is negative supercoiling , and the bases come apart more easily . In nature , most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called <unk> . These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication . 
 = = = Alternative DNA structures = = = 
 DNA exists in many possible conformations that include A @-@ DNA , B @-@ DNA , and Z @-@ DNA forms , although , only B @-@ DNA and Z @-@ DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms . The conformation that DNA adopts depends on the hydration level , DNA sequence , the amount and direction of supercoiling , chemical modifications of the bases , the type and concentration of metal ions , as well as the presence of polyamines in solution . 
 The first published reports of A @-@ DNA X @-@ ray diffraction patterns — and also B @-@ DNA — used analyses based on Patterson transforms that provided only a limited amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA . An alternative analysis was then proposed by Wilkins et al . , in 1953 , for the in vivo B @-@ DNA X @-@ ray diffraction / scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions . In the same journal , James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X @-@ ray diffraction patterns to suggest that the structure was a double @-@ helix . 
 Although the " B @-@ DNA form " is most common under the conditions found in cells , it is not a well @-@ defined conformation but a family of related DNA conformations that occur at the high hydration levels present in living cells . Their corresponding X @-@ ray diffraction and scattering patterns are characteristic of molecular <unk> with a significant degree of disorder . 
 Compared to B @-@ DNA , the A @-@ DNA form is a wider right @-@ handed spiral , with a shallow , wide minor groove and a narrower , deeper major groove . The A form occurs under non @-@ physiological conditions in partially dehydrated samples of DNA , while in the cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands , as well as in enzyme @-@ DNA complexes . Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form . Here , the strands turn about the helical axis in a left @-@ handed spiral , the opposite of the more common B form . These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z @-@ DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription . 
 = = = Alternative DNA chemistry = = = 
 For a number of years <unk> have proposed the existence of a shadow biosphere , a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life . One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA . A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium <unk> @-@ 1 , was announced , though the research was disputed , and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules . 
 = = = <unk> structures = = = 
 At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres . The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase , as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3 ′ ends of chromosomes . These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends , and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected . In human cells , telomeres are usually lengths of single @-@ stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple <unk> sequence . 
 These guanine @-@ rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four @-@ base units , rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules . Here , four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four @-@ base units then stack on top of each other , to form a stable G @-@ quadruplex structure . These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four @-@ base unit . Other structures can also be formed , with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases , or several different parallel strands , each contributing one base to the central structure . 
 In addition to these stacked structures , telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops , or T @-@ loops . Here , the single @-@ stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere @-@ binding proteins . At the very end of the T @-@ loop , the single @-@ stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double @-@ stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double @-@ helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands . This triple @-@ stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D @-@ loop . 
 = = = Branched DNA = = = 
 In DNA , fraying occurs when non @-@ complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double @-@ strand of DNA . However , branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre @-@ existing double @-@ strand . Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA , complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible . Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes , see the section on uses in technology below . 
 = = Chemical modifications and altered DNA packaging = = 
 = = = Base modifications and DNA packaging = = = 
 The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes , in a structure called chromatin . Base modifications can be involved in packaging , with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases . DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes ( see <unk> remodeling ) . There is , further , crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification , so they can <unk> affect chromatin and gene expression . 
 For one example , cytosine methylation , produces 5 @-@ methylcytosine , which is important for X @-@ chromosome inactivation . The average level of methylation varies between organisms – the worm Caenorhabditis elegans lacks cytosine methylation , while vertebrates have higher levels , with up to 1 % of their DNA containing 5 @-@ methylcytosine . Despite the importance of 5 @-@ methylcytosine , it can <unk> to leave a thymine base , so methylated <unk> are particularly prone to mutations . Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria , the presence of 5 @-@ <unk> in the brain , and the glycosylation of uracil to produce the " J @-@ base " in kinetoplastids . 
 = = = Damage = = = 
 DNA can be damaged by many sorts of mutagens , which change the DNA sequence . <unk> include oxidizing agents , alkylating agents and also high @-@ energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X @-@ rays . The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen . For example , UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers , which are cross @-@ links between pyrimidine bases . On the other hand , oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage , including base modifications , particularly of guanosine , and double @-@ strand breaks . A typical human cell contains about 150 @,@ 000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage . Of these oxidative lesions , the most dangerous are double @-@ strand breaks , as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations , insertions and deletions from the DNA sequence , as well as chromosomal translocations . These mutations can cause cancer . Because of inherent limitations in the DNA repair mechanisms , if humans lived long enough , they would all eventually develop cancer . DNA damages that are naturally occurring , due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species , the hydrolytic activities of cellular water , etc . , also occur frequently . Although most of these damages are repaired , in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes . These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues . This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging . 
 Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs , this is called intercalation . Most <unk> are aromatic and planar molecules ; examples include <unk> bromide , <unk> , <unk> , and doxorubicin . For an <unk> to fit between base pairs , the bases must separate , distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix . This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication , causing toxicity and mutations . As a result , DNA <unk> may be carcinogens , and in the case of thalidomide , a teratogen . Others such as benzo [ a ] pyrene diol epoxide and <unk> form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication . Nevertheless , due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication , other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells . 
 = = Biological functions = = 
 DNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes , and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes . The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome ; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes . The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes . Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing . For example , in transcription , when a cell uses the information in a gene , the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides . Usually , this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation , which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides . In alternative fashion , a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication . The details of these functions are covered in other articles ; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome . 
 = = = Genes and genomes = = = 
 Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called DNA condensation to fit the small available volumes of the cell . In eukaryotes , DNA is located in the cell nucleus , as well as small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts . In prokaryotes , the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid . The genetic information in a genome is held within genes , and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype . A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism . Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed , as well as regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers , which control the transcription of the open reading frame . 
 In many species , only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome encodes protein . For example , only about 1 @.@ 5 % of the human genome consists of protein @-@ coding exons , with over 50 % of human DNA consisting of non @-@ coding repetitive sequences . The reasons for the presence of so much noncoding DNA in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in genome size , or C @-@ value , among species represent a long @-@ standing puzzle known as the " C @-@ value enigma " . However , some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional non @-@ coding RNA molecules , which are involved in the regulation of gene expression . 
 Some noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes . <unk> and centromeres typically contain few genes , but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes . An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes , which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation . These sequences are usually just molecular fossils , although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence . 
 = = = Transcription and translation = = = 
 A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism . Within a gene , the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence , which then defines one or more protein sequences . The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino @-@ acid sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of translation , known collectively as the genetic code . The genetic code consists of three @-@ letter ' words ' called codons formed from a sequence of three nucleotides ( e.g. ACT , CAG , TTT ) . 
 In transcription , the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase . This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base @-@ pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA , which carries amino acids . Since there are 4 bases in 3 @-@ letter combinations , there are 64 possible codons ( 43 combinations ) . These encode the twenty standard amino acids , giving most amino acids more than one possible codon . There are also three ' stop ' or ' nonsense ' codons signifying the end of the coding region ; these are the TAA , TGA , and TAG codons . 
 = = = Replication = = = 
 Cell division is essential for an organism to grow , but , when a cell divides , it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent . The double @-@ stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication . Here , the two strands are separated and then each strand 's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase . This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing , and bonding it onto the original strand . As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction , different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix . In this way , the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand , and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA . 
 = = = Extracellular nucleic acids = = = 
 Naked extracellular DNA ( <unk> ) , most of it released by cell death , is nearly ubiquitous in the environment . Its concentration in soil may be as high as 2 μg / L , and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg / L. Various possible functions have been proposed for <unk> : it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer ; it may provide nutrients ; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or <unk> ions or antibiotics . Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of a number of bacterial species . It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm ; it may contribute to biofilm formation ; and it may contribute to the biofilm 's physical strength and resistance to biological stress . 
 = = Interactions with proteins = = 
 All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins . These protein interactions can be non @-@ specific , or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence . Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these , the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important . 
 = = = DNA @-@ binding proteins = = = 
 Structural proteins that bind DNA are well @-@ understood examples of non @-@ specific DNA @-@ protein interactions . Within chromosomes , DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins . These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin . In eukaryotes this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones , while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved . The histones form a disk @-@ shaped complex called a nucleosome , which contains two complete turns of double @-@ stranded DNA wrapped around its surface . These non @-@ specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar @-@ phosphate backbone of the DNA , and are therefore largely independent of the base sequence . Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation , phosphorylation and acetylation . These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones , making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription . Other non @-@ specific DNA @-@ binding proteins in chromatin include the high @-@ mobility group proteins , which bind to bent or distorted DNA . These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes . 
 A distinct group of DNA @-@ binding proteins are the DNA @-@ binding proteins that specifically bind single @-@ stranded DNA . In humans , replication protein A is the best @-@ understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated , including DNA replication , recombination and DNA repair . These binding proteins seem to stabilize single @-@ stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem @-@ loops or being degraded by nucleases . 
 In contrast , other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences . The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors , which are proteins that regulate transcription . Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters . The transcription factors do this in two ways . Firstly , they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription , either directly or through other mediator proteins ; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription . Alternatively , transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter . This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase . 
 As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism 's genome , changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes . Consequently , these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development . The specificity of these transcription factors ' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases , allowing them to " read " the DNA sequence . Most of these base @-@ interactions are made in the major groove , where the bases are most accessible . 
 = = = DNA @-@ modifying enzymes = = = 
 = = = = Nucleases and ligases = = = = 
 Nucleases are enzymes that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds . Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called <unk> , while endonucleases cut within strands . The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases , which cut DNA at specific sequences . For instance , the <unk> enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6 @-@ base sequence 5 ′ <unk> @-@ 3 ′ and makes a cut at the vertical line . In nature , these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell , acting as part of the restriction modification system . In technology , these sequence @-@ specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting . 
 Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands . <unk> are particularly important in lagging strand DNA replication , as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete copy of the DNA template . They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination . 
 = = = = Topoisomerases and helicases = = = = 
 Topoisomerases are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity . These proteins change the amount of supercoiling in DNA . Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate , thereby reducing its level of supercoiling ; the enzyme then seals the DNA break . Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break , before rejoining the helix . Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA , such as DNA replication and transcription . 
 <unk> are proteins that are a type of molecular motor . They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates , predominantly ATP , to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands . These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases . 
 = = = = Polymerases = = = = 
 Polymerases are enzymes that synthesize polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates . The sequence of their products are created based on existing polynucleotide chains — which are called templates . These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3 ′ hydroxyl group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain . As a consequence , all polymerases work in a 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction . In the active site of these enzymes , the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base @-@ pairs to the template : this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template . Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use . 
 In DNA replication , DNA @-@ dependent DNA polymerases make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains . In order to preserve biological information , it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand . Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity . Here , the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides . If a mismatch is detected , a 3 ′ to 5 ′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed . In most organisms , DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the <unk> that contains multiple accessory subunits , such as the DNA clamp or helicases . 
 RNA @-@ dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA . They include reverse transcriptase , which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses , and telomerase , which is required for the replication of telomeres . <unk> is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure . 
 Transcription is carried out by a DNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA . To begin transcribing a gene , the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands . It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator , where it halts and detaches from the DNA . As with human DNA @-@ dependent DNA polymerases , RNA polymerase II , the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome , operates as part of a large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits . 
 = = Genetic recombination = = 
 A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA , and in human cells the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called " chromosome territories " . This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information , as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in chromosomal crossover which occurs during sexual reproduction , when genetic recombination occurs . Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break , swap a section and then rejoin . 
 Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes , which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins . Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair , particularly in the cell 's response to double @-@ strand breaks . 
 The most common form of chromosomal crossover is homologous recombination , where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences . Non @-@ homologous recombination can be damaging to cells , as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities . The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as <unk> , such as RAD51 . The first step in recombination is a double @-@ stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA . A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction , in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix . The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes , swapping one strand for another . The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re @-@ ligation of the released DNA . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 DNA contains the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function , grow and reproduce . However , it is unclear how long in the 4 @-@ billion @-@ year history of life DNA has performed this function , as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material . RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes . This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases . This would occur , since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade @-@ off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes . However , there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems , as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years , and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution . Claims for older DNA have been made , most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old , but these claims are controversial . 
 Building blocks of DNA ( adenine , guanine and related organic molecules ) may have been formed <unk> in outer space . Complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life , including uracil , cytosine and thymine , have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space , using starting chemicals , such as pyrimidine , found in meteorites . Pyrimidine , like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , the most carbon @-@ rich chemical found in the universe , may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds . 
 = = Uses in technology = = 
 = = = Genetic engineering = = = 
 Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms , such as phenol @-@ chloroform extraction , and to manipulate it in the laboratory , such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction . Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology . Recombinant DNA is a man @-@ made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences . They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format , by using a viral vector . The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins , used in medical research , or be grown in agriculture . 
 = = = DNA profiling = = = 
 Forensic scientists can use DNA in blood , semen , skin , saliva or hair found at a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual , such as a perpetrator . This process is formally termed DNA profiling , but may also be called " genetic fingerprinting " . In DNA profiling , the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA , such as short tandem repeats and <unk> , are compared between people . This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA . However , identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people . DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys , and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case . 
 The development of forensic science , and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood , skin , saliva or hair has led to a re @-@ examination of a number of cases . Evidence can now be uncovered that was not scientifically possible at the time of the original examination . Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places , this can allow cases to be reopened where previous trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury . People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes . The most obvious defence to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross @-@ contamination of evidence has taken place . This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime . DNA profiling is also used to identify victims of mass casualty incidents . As well as positively identifying bodies or body parts in serious accidents , DNA profiling is being successfully used to identify individual victims in mass war graves – matching to family members . 
 DNA profiling is also used in DNA paternity testing in order to determine if someone is the <unk> or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99 @.@ 99 % when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child . Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth but there are new methods to test paternity while the mother is still pregnant . 
 = = = DNA enzymes or catalytic DNA = = = 
 <unk> , also called DNAzymes or catalytic DNA are first discovered in 1994 . They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated from a large pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or SELEX . DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA / DNA cleavage , RNA / DNA ligation , amino acids phosphorylation / <unk> , carbon @-@ carbon bond formation , and etc . DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @-@ fold over the uncatalyzed reaction . The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes are RNA @-@ cleaving DNAzymes which have been used in detection of different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents . Several metal @-@ specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR @-@ 5 DNAzyme ( lead @-@ specific ) , the CA1 @-@ 3 DNAzymes ( copper @-@ specific ) , the 39E DNAzyme ( uranyl @-@ specific ) and the <unk> DNAzyme ( sodium @-@ specific ) . The <unk> DNAzyme , which is reported to be more than 10 @,@ 000 @-@ fold selective for sodium over other metal ions , was used to make a real @-@ time sodium sensor in living cells . 
 = = = Bioinformatics = = = 
 Bioinformatics involves the development of techniques to store , data mine , search and manipulate biological data , including DNA nucleic acid sequence data . These have led to widely applied advances in computer science , especially string searching algorithms , machine learning and database theory . String searching or matching algorithms , which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters , were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides . The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct . These techniques , especially multiple sequence alignment , are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function . Data sets representing entire genomes ' worth of DNA sequences , such as those produced by the Human Genome Project , are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome . Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA @-@ coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms , which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally . Entire genomes may also be compared , which can shed light on the evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events . 
 = = = DNA nanotechnology = = = 
 DNA nanotechnology uses the unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self @-@ assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties . DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information . This has led to the creation of two @-@ dimensional periodic lattices ( both tile @-@ based and using the " DNA origami " method ) as well as three @-@ dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra . <unk> devices and algorithmic self @-@ assembly have also been demonstrated , and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins . 
 = = = History and anthropology = = = 
 Because DNA collects mutations over time , which are then inherited , it contains historical information , and , by comparing DNA sequences , geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms , their phylogeny . This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology . If DNA sequences within a species are compared , population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations . This can be used in studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology ; For example , DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel . 
 = = = Information storage = = = 
 In a paper published in Nature in January 2013 , scientists from the European Bioinformatics Institute and <unk> Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA 's ability to code information as a means of digital data storage . The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code , synthesize the actual DNA , then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form , with a reported 100 % accuracy . The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files . A prior experiment was published in August 2012 . It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University , where the text of a 54 @,@ 000 @-@ word book was encoded in DNA . 
 = = History of DNA research = = 
 DNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher who , in 1869 , discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages . As it resided in the nuclei of cells , he called it " nuclein " . In 1878 , Albrecht <unk> isolated the non @-@ protein component of " nuclein " , nucleic acid , and later isolated its five primary nucleobases . In 1919 , Phoebus Levene identified the base , sugar and phosphate nucleotide unit . Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups . Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order . In 1937 , William Astbury produced the first X @-@ ray diffraction patterns that showed that DNA had a regular structure . 
 In 1927 , Nikolai Koltsov proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a " giant hereditary molecule " made up of " two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi @-@ conservative fashion using each strand as a template " . In 1928 , Frederick Griffith in his experiment discovered that traits of the " smooth " form of Pneumococcus could be transferred to the " rough " form of the same bacteria by mixing killed " smooth " bacteria with the live " rough " form . This system provided the first clear suggestion that DNA carries genetic information — the Avery – MacLeod – McCarty experiment — when Oswald Avery , along with coworkers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty , identified DNA as the transforming principle in 1943 . DNA 's role in heredity was confirmed in 1952 , when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase in the Hershey – Chase experiment showed that DNA is the genetic material of the T2 phage . 
 In 1953 , James Watson and Francis Crick suggested what is now accepted as the first correct double @-@ helix model of DNA structure in the journal Nature . Their double @-@ helix , molecular model of DNA was then based on a single X @-@ ray diffraction image ( labeled as " Photo 51 " ) taken by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in May 1952 , as well as the information that the DNA bases are paired . 
 Experimental evidence supporting the Watson and Crick model was published in a series of five articles in the same issue of Nature . Of these , Franklin and Gosling 's paper was the first publication of their own X @-@ ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partially supported the Watson and Crick model ; this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by Maurice Wilkins and two of his colleagues , whose analysis and in vivo B @-@ DNA X @-@ ray patterns also supported the presence in vivo of the double @-@ helical DNA configurations as proposed by Crick and Watson for their double @-@ helix molecular model of DNA in the previous two pages of Nature . In 1962 , after Franklin 's death , Watson , Crick , and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients . A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery . 
 In an influential presentation in 1957 , Crick laid out the central dogma of molecular biology , which foretold the relationship between DNA , RNA , and proteins , and articulated the " adaptor hypothesis " . Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double @-@ helical structure followed in 1958 through the Meselson – Stahl experiment . Further work by Crick and coworkers showed that the genetic code was based on non @-@ overlapping triplets of bases , called codons , allowing Har Gobind Khorana , Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg to decipher the genetic code . These findings represent the birth of molecular biology . 
 = Florence Nagle = 
 Florence Nagle ( 26 October 1894 – 30 October 1988 ) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses , a breeder of pedigree dogs , and an active feminist . Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913 , and went on to own or breed twenty @-@ one United Kingdom Champions . Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman , who was bred , owned and exhibited by Nagle . She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters , from the 1920s until the mid @-@ 1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions . The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle 's Irish Setters . 
 Described as " the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing " , Nagle trained her first racehorse in 1920 , the Irish @-@ bred colt Fernley . At that time women were forced to employ men to hold a Jockey Club trainers licence on their behalf , or to have licences in their husbands ' names . Nagle worked peacefully to redress such injustices to her sex . She successfully challenged the well @-@ established leading gentlemen 's clubs of the racing and canine worlds over their gender inequality , and in 1966 became one of the first two women in the United Kingdom licensed to train racehorses . The first racehorse officially trained in Nagle 's name was Mahwa , registered as being owned by her friend Miss Newton Deakin , with whom she jointly owned some of her dogs . 
 Dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for women jockeys , Nagle sponsored the Florence Nagle Girl Apprentices ' Handicap first run in 1986 at Kempton Park . She died at her home in West Chiltington , Sussex , two years later at the age of 94 , leaving funds in her will for the continuation of the race . 
 = = Background and early life = = 
 Born in Fallowfield , Manchester , Nagle was the daughter of Sir William George Watson , 1st Baronet of Sulhamstead ( 1861 – 1930 ) and his second wife Bessie ( née Atkinson ) ; she was also the elder sister of art connoisseur Peter Watson . Nagle was educated at Wycombe Abbey before studying domestic economy at Evendine Court , from which she was expelled after visiting Worcester Cathedral without permission . Accompanied by the daughter of a canon , Nagle had hired a car for the excursion – she was one of the first women in Berkshire to hold a driving licence , gaining it when she was fifteen years old . Her education was completed at a finishing school after which she spent some time in Paris , where she became friends with Megan Lloyd George . 
 Sulhamstead Abbots , Nagle 's family home in Berkshire , was used as a hospital during the First World War . There she met James Nagle , a native of Ireland who had emigrated to Canada but returned to serve with the King 's Royal Rifle Corps and then had been sent to Sulhamstead Abbots to recuperate . Against her parents ' wishes the couple were married on 1 July 1916 , resulting in them threatening to disinherit her . The early days of Nagle 's marriage were hard ; she was used to a wealthy lifestyle – her family money came from her father 's successful business , Maypole Dairies – but her parents offered the couple no financial assistance . Nagle always worked hard and subsidised their income by making cream teas , cleaning windows and scrubbing toilets . The couple had two children , a son , David , and a daughter , Patricia . The marriage was not a success , and her husband ran off with one of the kennel maids . Obtaining a divorce was not easy in the 1920s ; when asked in court for the reason James left , Nagle answered " He must have got bored with me . " The divorce took place in 1928 , five years before her husband 's death . At the time of the divorce she was living on a smallholding near Headley , but returned to Sulhamstead in 1932 after inheriting land and money from Sir William . Ten years later , in 1942 , she purchased Westerlands , a farm in Petworth , so she could personally oversee the stables . 
 Working in Folkestone during the Second World War , Nagle managed a canteen for the ARP . She also donated the full cost of £ 5 @,@ 000 to purchase a Spitfire named Sulhamstead for the Royal Air Force . 
 = = Dog breeding = = 
 As a child , Nagle had a Pomeranian and a Bulldog , but was promised she could have a larger dog once her schooling was completed . In 1913 her dream came to fruition with the purchase of her first Irish Wolfhound , <unk> Michael , for £ 5 . James Nagle subsequently registered the dog with the Kennel Club , before it was transferred to the ownership of Mr and Mrs Nagle , and its name changed to Sir Michael of Sheppey in May 1917 . Food shortages during the First World War resulted in an official prohibition on dog breeding , but Nagle ignored it and bred her first litter from a bitch called Lady Alma of Sheppey . 
 During her marriage , while residing in <unk> , Sulhamstead , near Reading , she began breeding dogs and served as a judge of Irish Wolfhounds and Setters ; Great Danes and Deerhounds were other breeds she judged at championship show level . Her dogs were exhibited at shows by her husband , who was also a judge of Wolfhounds , and they were entered in his name until the couple divorced . 
 A bitch puppy , the runt of the litter , was purchased for £ 48 in 1923 and she became Nagle 's first dog to gain the title of Champion . Named Sulhamstead Thelma , she was declared the best Irish Wolfhound bitch and awarded the Challenge Certificate at three consecutive Crufts , in 1925 , 1926 and 1927 . Her next Champion was Sulhamstead Conncara , a male dog , born in 1925 . Conncara was blind , possibly owing to an accident as a young puppy , but Nagle kept that secret until three years after his death , believing that his qualities would have been overlooked by other breeders if they had known . According to Nagle 's biographer , <unk> Somerfield , this dog was " one of the great sires of all time in the breed " and an " outstanding show dog " . A prepotent sire , he produced several Champions and other top @-@ class show specimens . 
 Nagle owned or bred forty @-@ five Wolfhounds who were awarded Challenge Certificates , twenty @-@ one of them Champions . She believed dogs should be capable of carrying out the work the breed was developed to do , and she promoted coursing . 
 Irish Wolfhounds bred by Nagle were also successful in America ; she began exporting dogs there in 1933 . Best of breed awards at the Irish Wolfhound Club of America speciality shows were secured by Champion Sulhamstead Matador of <unk> in 1960 and by Sulhamstead Mars of <unk> in 1963 . She also judged the national speciality there twice and judged Irish Setters and Irish Wolfhounds at Westminster in 1937 . Other countries she exported Wolfhounds to included Sweden , Italy and Uruguay . As late as 1960 , Sulhamstead Merman , a 150 @-@ pound Irish Wolfhound bred , owned and shown by Nagle at " London 's big dog show " , Crufts , won the Hound Group and went on to be declared Best in Show or " supreme champion " ; the judges were H. S. Lloyd and Fred Cross . She judged the breed twice at Crufts : in 1961 , the only time in a nine @-@ year period her dogs were not best of breed there ; and in 1970 . 
 Nagle acquired her first Irish Setter , whom she named Sulhamstead D 'Or , in 1924 to keep a wolfhound puppy company . In April 1930 she entered him into the All @-@ Aged Stakes at the Kennel Club field trials . In August 1932 she entered a dog named Sulhamstead Token D 'Or into the Scottish Field Trials in the same category . At the Kennel Club field trials of April 1933 , Nagle entered Sulhamstead Bob D 'Or into the All @-@ Aged Stakes and the judge awarded her the prize presented by the Irish Setter Association of England . In September 1934 , she entered her Irish Setter Sulhamstead Snip D 'Or into the Novice Stake of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society 's 12th working trials at <unk> , near Exeter . 
 In July 1935 Nagle entered the field trials of the Irish Setter Association near Ruabon in North Wales , competing in the Open Stake for Irish Setters and the Puppy Stake for Irish Setters , for puppies which were born the previous year . At the 35th International Gun Dog League trials held at Douglas Castle in August 1935 , she was awarded a diploma in the Champion Stakes for Pointers and Setters . The following month , Nagle took the silver perpetual challenge trophy in the Open Stake of the field trials of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society at Newlyn , near Newquay , competing with her Irish Setter Sulhamstead <unk> D 'Or . At the Kennel Club field trials for pointers and setters in April 1936 , she entered Sulhamstead Bluff D 'Or into the All @-@ Aged Stake and was awarded the <unk> Challenge Cup by Captain N. R. Colville for the " best <unk> dog or bitch , displaying the greatest game @-@ finding ability " . At the 18th annual Scottish Field Trial Association 's field trials for pointers and setters at Yester estate in Gifford , East Lothian , Scotland in August 1936 , Nagle won first prize in the Brace Stake with Sulhamstead Bluff D 'Or . The Kennel Club own a pastel painting by Cecil Aldin of two of Nagle 's Irish Setters , the Field Trial Champions Sulhamstead <unk> D 'Or and Sulhamstead Valla D 'Or . Field trials saw a general downturn in popularity of Irish Setters competing in the 1930s ; during the following decade the breed was principally represented by Nagle 's dogs . Nagle had eighteen Irish Setter field trial champions during the period she was active in the breed from the 1920s to the mid @-@ 1960s . The male dog Harlequin of <unk> was pivotal in the revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed in the 1970s ; he was a descendant of Nagle 's Irish Setter Sulhamstead Natty D 'Or , so the Sulhamstead bloodline is behind most modern day red and whites . Nagle withdrew from the field @-@ trial scene in the mid @-@ 1960s following the retirement of her handler , George Abbott . 
 Other breeds she owned included Golden Retrievers and Pointers . Nagle 's activities were not confined to dogs and horses . A Berkshire boar named <unk> Ugly Duckling was champion at the Royal Show in 1921 . Later he was exported to Argentina , after the purchaser paid what at the time was a record price of £ 750 . During the 1930s she owned Prince Everett of <unk> , a prize @-@ winning Aberdeen Angus . 
 = = Racehorse training and breeding = = 
 According to the Encyclopedia of British Horseracing , Nagle trained her first racehorse in 1920 , the Irish @-@ bred colt Fernley . Her fascination with the sport stemmed from a much earlier time pre @-@ dating her decision to concentrate on breeding dogs but it was particularly the breeding aspect of racehorses she was drawn to . Nagle owned the winner of the Newport Nursery Handicap in 1932 , a horse named Solano , and a reporter recorded that " While Solano is not Mrs Nagle 's first winner , it is some years since the ' rifle green , red cross @-@ belts ' caught the judge 's eye " . On 5 July 1935 , she entered her racehorse Comanche at Newmarket . 
 Nagle entered the Epsom Derby in 1937 ; that horse , Sandsprite , ridden by John Crouch at odds of 100 – 1 , finished second to Mid @-@ day Sun , owned by Mrs Lettice Miller , the first woman owner ever to win the Derby . This was the first horse Nagle bred herself and reactions from commentators were mixed . One report described the horse as a " commanding individual " , whereas another reporter 's opposing opinion was revealed by Nagle when after Sandsprite 's success at Epsom she stated " Not bad for a horse which one newspaper said was only good enough to give rides at the seaside " . Sandsprite 's dam was Wood Nymph , a mare purchased by Nagle for 240 guineas . She wanted to have her mated by the stallion Sansovino but had to settle for using his son , Sandwich , as she could not afford his stud fee . Sandsprite had several other outings in which he gained second or third placings , but was put down at the onset of his stud career after breaking a leg . 
 One of Nagle 's early equine purchases was 15 @-@ year @-@ old Rose of England , the winner of the 1930 Oaks , for 3 @,@ 500 guineas . The mare had already produced the 1937 St. Leger winner , <unk> , and the 1939 top winning two @-@ year @-@ old , British Empire . In Nagle 's ownership she foaled Westerlands Rose , by the stallion Colombo who produced several winners . These included Westerlands Chalice , by <unk> , who won three races in 1957 ; and Game Rose , by Big Game , another winner during the 1950s . Other winning progeny from Westerlands Rose were Westerlands Champagne , Westerlands Prince and Westerlands Rosebud . These five horses accounted for ten race wins between them . 
 At the December Newmarket sales in 1944 Nagle bought the two @-@ year old Carpatica , by the Epsom Derby winner , Hyperion out of Campanula , the 1 @,@ 000 Guineas Stakes winner , for a record 15 @,@ 000 guineas with the intention of looking after the filly 's training at her stables in Petworth . She also bought a five @-@ year @-@ old mare in foal , Hay Harvest , for 5 @,@ 500 guineas . When bred to Sayajirao , Carpatica produced the 1950s winner , <unk> . 
 One of the main winners in the Nagle stables in the early 1960s was Gelert , trained by Nagle and owned by Miss Newton Deakin . Sired by Owen Tudor out of Westerlands Rosebud , he won a race at Ascot . His dam had been successfully raced in the early 1950s and then proved herself as a useful brood . 
 In the first half of the 20th century women trainers were not unknown – Norah Wilmot was training horses for The Queen . But women trained in an unofficial capacity , and were forced to employ men to hold the training licence on their behalf , or to have licences in their husbands ' names . Thus , beginning in 1932 , the divorced Nagle employed Alfred Stickley , a licensed trainer , to work at her stables in the capacity of head lad . Mahwa , by Match III out of Media , was owned by Newton Deakin and was the first winning horse to be officially listed as trained by Nagle . As late as 1975 , she trained twelve horses and recommended feeding them some seaweed to provide iodine . She was also a great believer in the beneficial effects of fresh air , insisting that her horses ' top stable doors were permanently left open . She was vehemently opposed to the vaccination of horses against equine influenza , and challenged a Jockey Club decision to make vaccination compulsory . She thought the hardest part of animal breeding was " to breed for ' guts ' . You can produce lovely looking animals that go well – till they are on a race course with a stiff race to win . " 
 = = Activism = = 
 For twenty years Nagle worked to end the Jockey Club 's ban on licensing women as race horse trainers , which she saw as an injustice : eventually , frustrated by the Jockey Club 's persistent refusal to grant training licences to women , Nagle sought legal redress . It has been suggested that the club used its considerable influence within the Establishment to have her claim blocked twice . Her fight finally reached the Court of Appeal in 1966 . Following her third appearance in court , Nagle emerged victorious . The verdict of the three presiding judges , Lord Denning , Lord Justice <unk> and Lord Justice Salmon , was , in the words of Lord Denning , that " If she is to carry on her trade without stooping to subterfuge she has to have a licence . " Lord Denning went on to describe the refusal to grant Nagle a training licence as " arbitrary and capricious " , and Lord Justice Danckwerts called it " restrictive and nonsensical " . Of the Jockey Club itself , Lord Justice Danckwerts went on to pronounce that " The courts have the right to protect the right of a person to work when it is being prevented by the dictatorial powers of a body which holds a monopoly . " All three judges also referred to the Sex Disqualification ( Removal ) Act 1919 . Faced with the court 's damning and embarrassing decision , the Jockey Club capitulated , and on 3 August 1966 Florence Nagle and Norah Wilmot became the first women in Britain to receive licences to train racehorses . 
 Nagle credited herself with " dragging the Jockey Club into the twentieth century " . She said : " This was a matter of principle . I am a feminist . I believe in equal rights for women . Things should be decided by ability , not sex " . At odds with Nagle 's view , in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that " No doubt there are occupations , such as boxing , which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women " , and Lord Denning had gone on to say that " It is not as if the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for a woman , like that of a jockey or speedway @-@ rider " ; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972 . When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s if she thought women could ever match men on the racecourse , Nagle replied : " My dear man , it used to be said women couldn 't stand up to three @-@ day @-@ eventing . Now they 're beating the men regularly – and the same will happen in racing . Give them time . " Her endeavours led to her being described as " the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing " in Stud & Stable Magazine and " Racing 's Emily Pankhurst " . 
 At the age of 83 Nagle was still pursuing gender equality , accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male @-@ only membership and taking them to court over the matter . After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted , Nagle was proposed as a member of the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977 ; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club 's constitution restricted membership to men only . Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later . She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee , a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy , but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions . Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee . Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case , but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated . Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision . Leonard <unk> was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time , and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press , Dog World and Our Dogs , on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club 's General Committee was recommending that the club 's constitution be changed to allow women members . The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978 . The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979 . The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80 ; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle .

 In the 1980s , still dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for women jockeys , Nagle sponsored a race at Kempton Park , The Florence Nagle Girl Apprentices ' Handicap . The first event took place in 1986 ; after the race John Oaksey wrote in the Daily Telegraph that Nagle was no doubt looking down from her celestial cloud with approval . She subsequently wrote to inform him that she was still alive , but that when the time came she expected to end up in a hotter place – " and there to meet most of her racing friends " . Nagle left a bequest in her will to ensure the race 's survival . 
 Nagle died at her home , Little Mayfield in West Chiltington , Sussex , at the age of 94 . 
 = Hurricane Claudette ( 2003 ) = 
 Hurricane Claudette was the third tropical storm and first hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season . A fairly long @-@ lived July Atlantic hurricane , Claudette began as a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean . It moved quickly westward , brushing past the Yucatán Peninsula before moving northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico . Claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in Port O 'Connor , Texas , when it quickly strengthened to a strong Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . Forecasting of its path and intensity was uncertain throughout its lifetime , resulting in widespread and often unnecessary preparations along its path . 
 Claudette was the first hurricane to make landfall in July in the United States since Hurricane Danny in the 1997 season . The hurricane caused one death and moderate damage in Texas , mostly from strong winds , as well as extensive beach erosion . Because of the damage , President George W. Bush declared portions of South Texas a Federal Disaster Area , allowing the affected citizens to apply for aid . Claudette also caused significant rainfall and minor damage in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo as a tropical storm , as well as minor damage on Saint Lucia before developing into a tropical cyclone . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 1 . It steadily organized as it moved westward , and resembled a tropical depression by July 7 . However , surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics , and remained simply a low @-@ pressure system . The wave produced tropical storm @-@ force winds as it moved through the Lesser Antilles on July 8 , but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern Caribbean . Because it had tropical storm @-@ force winds , the system was upgraded immediately to Tropical Storm Claudette after it developed a low @-@ level circulation later on July 8 . 
 By early on July 9 , while south of Puerto Rico , Claudette quickly strengthened over the warm waters of the Caribbean , and its strongest winds were just shy of the threshold for hurricane intensity . Possibly due to its fast forward motion , the storm became disorganized and weakened . Conditions briefly became more favorable over the western Caribbean , and Claudette reached hurricane status for six hours on July 10 . Soon after , the storm encountered unfavorable upper @-@ level winds and weakened back into a tropical storm . In response to a break in the subtropical ridge — a high @-@ pressure ridge that often prevents tropical systems from moving northward — it turned to the west @-@ northwest . Claudette made its first landfall at Puerto Morelos on the Yucatán Peninsula on July 11 as a tropical storm with 60 mph ( 100 km / h ) winds . 
 Claudette wobbled to the northwest over the Gulf of Mexico and gradually restrengthened . Upper @-@ level winds steadily decreased , and Claudette again became a hurricane late on July 14 . Just prior to landfall , it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction , striking Port O 'Connor , Texas , on July 15 as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale with 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) winds . Residents along and inland of the central Texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival . The hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of July 15 , but instead came ashore before noon . Furthermore , some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category 2 status , with sustained winds of up to 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) ; these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data . 
 As slow as Claudette was to strengthen , it was also slow to dissipate over land . Inland hurricane warnings were issued for several counties away from the coastline and winds gusted to 83 mph ( 134 km / h ) at Victoria Regional Airport . It maintained tropical storm intensity for over 24 hours after landfall , a rarity for such a weak storm ; most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall , as they are separated from the warm waters that power them . The storm finally lost its low @-@ level circulation early on July 17 over Chihuahua , although its rainfall and upper @-@ level circulation continued into the Pacific Ocean . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Mexican officials issued a tropical storm warning 37 hours prior to the storm 's landfall between Chetumal and Cabo Catoche , Quintana Roo . The warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning about a day before landfall , but was downgraded when Claudette weakened just 13 hours prior to its landfall in the Yucatán Peninsula . The Mexican government declared a state of emergency in the projected path of the storm , and declared an evacuation order for 1 @,@ 500 citizens in Quintana Roo . There , residents remained calm during the evacuation . Tourists left nightclubs for supermarkets to stock up on , among other items , beer , which was banned at midnight . Schools were set up as shelters , while police forced tourists to remain in their hotels . 
 The consistent variation in the path of Claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall . On July 13 , two days prior to Claudette 's eventual landfall , the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch between Brownsville and Port O 'Connor , Texas . By the next day , a hurricane warning existed from Baffin Bay to High Island , Texas , while a tropical storm warning extended from High Island to Intracoastal City , Louisiana . When it became apparent that Louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm , the state 's tropical storm warnings were canceled . In Texas , Galveston County officials recommended evacuations for western Galveston Island and Jamaica Beach , 24 hours prior to Claudette 's projected landfall . The Emergency Phone Notification System notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night . Many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion , some of whom remembered the flooding from Tropical Storm Frances five years before . 
 Hurricane Claudette also affected the oil industry . ExxonMobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips , Shell Oil , Marathon Oil , Unocal Corporation , and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation all limited production and evacuated many of their workers . Chevron , which evacuated more than 1 @,@ 800 workers , returned many of its workers on the day when Claudette made landfall . Unocal closed 23 rigs and platforms in the region . The combined closures stopped the daily production of 225 @,@ 000 barrels ( 35 @,@ 800 m3 ) per day of oil and 2 billion cubic feet ( 57 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of natural gas , which accounted for 15 % of the total production in the Gulf of Mexico . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Outside of Texas , Hurricane Claudette caused little damage due to its low intensity . In total , damage estimates rose to $ 180 million ( 2003 USD , $ 198 million 2006 USD ) , and the storm caused one direct and two indirect deaths . One of the indirect deaths occurred from a man having a heart attack while surfing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico . 
 = = = Caribbean Sea = = = 
 As a tropical wave , Claudette dropped torrential rainfall and brought strong winds to the island of Saint Lucia . The George F. L. Charles Airport in Castries reported a wind gust of 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) , while other parts of the island experienced nearly horizontal rainfall from the gusts . On the northern and eastern portions of the island , the strong winds ripped off roofs and downed trees across roadways . Overall , damage was light , and amounted to $ 1 @.@ 1 million ( 2003 USD , $ 1 @.@ 41 million 2016 USD ) . 
 In the Dominican Republic , the outer bands of the storm caused moderate rainfall of up to 3 inches ( 76 mm ) in Santo Domingo . Winds gusted up to 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) , knocking down trees , sign posts , and iron roofs . Also , flooding in metropolitan areas blocked traffic for cars and pedestrians . Banana and other fruit plantations in the southwestern portion of the country experienced severe damage , although exact damage totals are unknown . 
 On Jamaica , the storm caused wind gusts of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) in Montego Bay . Forecasters predicted high tides , strong waves , and up to 6 inches ( 150 mm ) of rain on the island , although exact post @-@ storm totals are not known . Many fishermen moved their boats from the water to safety , while a cruise line diverted three ships away from Claudette 's path . 
 In the Cayman Islands , where the storm remained 165 miles ( 266 km ) away at its closest point , rainfall totals ranged from 1 to 3 inches ( 25 to 76 mm ) . On the south side of Grand Cayman , Claudette caused wave heights of around 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) , while the western side received little precipitation . Also on Grand Cayman , the storm caused winds of 35 – 40 mph ( 56 – 64 km / h ) , causing minor tree damage but little else . 
 On Mexico 's Yucatán Peninsula , Claudette lashed strong waves against the coastline at Cancún , but overall caused light damage . While crossing the peninsula , the storm dropped moderate rainfall , including a total of 3 @.@ 22 inches ( 82 mm ) in Cancún . Winds were moderate , causing the Cancún International Airport to delay several flights , though there were no cancellations . Overall , Claudette sank a few small boats and flooded a few streets in Cancún , though damage was minor in the Yucatán Peninsula . 
 = = = Texas = = = 
 Upon making landfall on the central Texas coast , Claudette 's storm surge reached a maximum height of 5 @.@ 3 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) in Galveston . Freeport reported a " storm tide " — the overall rise of water over the mean low tide — of 9 @.@ 15 feet ( 2 @.@ 79 m ) . Claudette produced moderate rainfall across southern Texas , peaking at 6 @.@ 5 inches ( 170 mm ) in Tilden . On Matagorda Island , the local weather station measured winds of 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) — the only official report of hurricane @-@ force winds along the coastline . However , several offshore oil rigs reported winds of up to 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) , and one unofficial reading in Seadrift indicated winds of 96 @.@ 6 mph ( 155 @.@ 5 km / h ) . This report would suggest the storm was a low @-@ end Category 2 hurricane , though this contradicted Hurricane Hunters ' data , which pointed to a storm of a lesser intensity . 
 Severe beach erosion occurred from High Island to Freeport , though large geo @-@ tubes reduced the erosion on Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula . The outer bands of the hurricane spawned two tornadoes . One was an F1 on the Fujita scale that caused damage to several buildings in Palacios , and the other damaged homes in Port Lavaca . 
 Widespread flooding and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast Texas coastline , most of which occurred in Matagorda County . In addition , the winds damaged 1 @,@ 407 homes , with 144 of them being severely damaged . The wind also affected 147 businesses , of which 64 were either destroyed or severely damaged . Strong winds downed numerous power lines , leaving around 74 @,@ 000 residents without power in the immediate aftermath . Overall , Claudette caused $ 180 million ( 2003 USD , $ 232 million 2016 USD ) in damage in Texas and one death from a fallen tree during the storm . Also , the storm was indirectly responsible for a death when a tree fell on a person in the aftermath of the storm . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On July 17 , President George W. Bush declared 18 south Texas counties as a federal disaster area . Within 2 months of the storm , over 15 @,@ 000 citizens registered for assistance . The government approved $ 34 @.@ 8 million ( 2003 USD , $ 44 @.@ 8 million 2016 USD ) in aid , of which nearly half went to basic house repairs . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) provided 75 % of the $ 1 @.@ 35 million ( 2003 USD , $ 1 @.@ 74 million 2016 USD ) debris removal cost , with the other 25 % being covered through local agencies . FEMA also provided $ 1 @.@ 26 million ( 2003 USD , $ 1 @.@ 62 million 2016 USD ) to repair geo @-@ tubes on the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County . The geo @-@ tubes , which protect buildings along coastal areas , were severely damaged by the hurricane . 
 In western Texas , heavy rainfall of up to 5 inches ( 130 mm ) temporarily sparked widespread growth of wildflowers in a normally arid landscape . The rainfall restored the flow of the Rio Grande at Big Bend National Park , which had ceased in the area due to lack of rainfall . In addition , the precipitation increased the water level in the Amistad Reservoir by more than 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) . 
 = Space Travel ( video game ) = 
 Space Travel is an early video game developed by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates travel in the solar system . The player flies their ship around a two @-@ dimensional scale model of the solar system with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons . The player can move and turn the ship , and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation . The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies . 
 The game was developed at Bell Labs before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games , and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer , and then to the PDP @-@ 7 computer . As a part of porting the game to the PDP @-@ 7 , Thompson developed his own operating system , which later formed the core of the Unix operating system . Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games , leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Space Travel is a spaceflight simulation video game , presented in a two @-@ dimensional top @-@ down view , with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines on a black background . In it , the player controls a spaceship as it flies through a representation of the solar system . The game has no specific objectives , other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system . The planets and most of the moons in the solar system are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other , though the orbits are simplified to be circles . To land on a body , the player 's ship must cross the line representing the surface while moving at a low enough speed . The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn . The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen , which the player can control ; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the solar system in seconds , though they risk overshooting their target and becoming unable to find the solar system again , and scaling down allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land . The ship is always in the center of the screen , facing the top ; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the solar system around the ship instead . 
 Each planet or moon has a mass , and therefore a gravitational pull , though they do not affect one another and only the single strongest pull affects the player 's ship . This sometimes results in odd behavior ; for example , the gravitational effect of Mars is much stronger than that of its moon Phobos . This means that a player attempting to land on Phobos needs to allow the ship to fall below the moon 's surface until it is close enough to Phobos 's center that Phobos 's pull becomes the dominant force , at which point the ship snaps back to be landed on the surface . The name of the planet or moon with the current strongest pull is displayed on the screen . Players are able to edit the program to change the conditions ; popular variations by the original players were increasing the gravity level and thus the difficulty , or an adjustment to the coordinate display system so that , rather than the ship staying in the center of the screen and the planets moving relative to it , the current dominant planet would always be at the bottom of the screen , with the ship moving relative to it . 
 = = Development = = 
 In 1969 , programmer Ken Thompson worked for Bell Labs on the Multics operating system . During his work , he developed Space Travel on a GE 635 computer . When Bell Labs pulled out of the Multics project , he adapted the code from Multics to a Fortran program so that it could run on the GECOS operating system already present on the GE 635 . Thompson and other Bell Labs employees , such as Ravi Sethi and Dennis Ritchie , played the game on the system . The computer , however , was run on an " interactive batch " model , meaning that several computer terminals were attached to the central computer and each terminal 's program jobs had to be submitted in a queue , resulting in long pauses in the game while the GE 635 worked on jobs for other terminals . The company tracked the computer usage internally with a cost system , meaning that each game cost US $ 50 to US $ 75 on the internal balance sheet to play . The game also did not run as well on the GECOS system as it had on the Multics . Additionally , the system required the user to type in commands rather than press buttons , resulting in the ship being difficult to control . Wanting to find a better solution , Thompson initially petitioned for Bell to purchase a DEC @-@ 10 computer , then US $ 120 @,@ 000 , for the purposes of writing a new operating system ; he was turned down , as Bell Labs was uninterested in spending money on an operating system project after just cancelling the previous one . Thompson , however , learned that a neighboring department had an older , little @-@ used PDP @-@ 7 minicomputer which he could re @-@ purpose . 
 As Thompson began porting the game to the new system , he decided not to base the code on any of the existing software for the computer , and instead write his own . As a result , he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use , including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems . These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled , then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP @-@ 7 . Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP @-@ 7 to avoid this laborious process . The game ran very slowly on the new machine , causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd <unk> , rooted in their experience with the Multics file system , with which he then ran Space Travel . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 By the time Space Travel was fully ported to the PDP @-@ 7 , Thompson had expanded his software suite to a full , basic operating system , in a way he had been unable to with the Multics project and the GE 635 . The operating system he designed spread to other users in the company , and formed the core of what would be named in 1970 the Unix operating system . Space Travel was one of the early mainframe games developed before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games , and was never distributed beyond its initial locations . As a result , it had no effect on future video games , and its primary legacy is that of sparking the creation of Unix . 
 = Mount Bailey ( Oregon ) = 
 Mount Bailey is a relatively young tephra cone and shield volcano in the Cascade Range , located on the opposite side of Diamond Lake from Mount Thielsen in southern Oregon , United States . Bailey consists of a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 610 m ) -high main cone on top of an old basaltic andesite shield volcano . With a volume of 8 to 9 km3 ( 1 @.@ 9 to 2 @.@ 2 cu mi ) , Mount Bailey is slightly smaller than neighboring Diamond Peak . Mount Bailey is a popular destination for recreational activities . Well known in the Pacific Northwest region as a haven for skiing in the winter months , the mountain 's transportation , instead of a conventional chairlift , is provided by snowcats — treaded , tractor @-@ like vehicles that can ascend Bailey 's steep , snow @-@ covered slopes and carry skiers to the higher reaches of the mountain . In the summer months , a 5 @-@ mile ( 8 km ) hiking trail gives foot access to Bailey 's summit . 
 Native Americans are credited with the first ascents of Bailey . Spiritual leaders held feasts and prayer vigils on the summit . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The origin of the mountain 's name is a matter of dispute . Older maps show its name as either " Old Baldy " or " Old Bailey " , " Bailey " possibly being a drafting error . The summit 's bald , burnt @-@ over appearance might indicate the origin of the designation " Baldy " . No record of a person named Bailey who was connected with the peak has been found . In 1992 the Oregon Geographic Names Board voted to name the mountain in honor of naturalists Vernon and Florence Bailey . According to William G. Steel , the Klamath name for the mountain was <unk> , which means " Medicine Mountain " . According to Klamath tradition , their medicine men and priests would feast on the mountain 's summit and commune with the upper world . 
 = = Geography and geology = = 
 Mount Bailey is part of the High Cascades in the western United States . The High Cascades have long been glaciated , by both Pacific @-@ bred storms and natural , elevation @-@ caused , glaciation . In fact , glaciation probably formed on them as early as the late Miocene . Over time , as the range built up , newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock . Creating lava plateaus , Pliocene activity , mostly basaltic and andesitic , was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey , Thielsen , and Union Peak . 
 Mount Bailey heads the Mount Bailey chain , which consists of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north . Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen , it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes , and the two are almost equal in appearance . Built around the same time as Rodley Butte , according to morphological study , the current volcano is no more than 100 @,@ 000 years old , and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak 's current cone . Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte , both in age and original composition , Bailey switched from erupting basaltic andesite to pure andesite ( silicon dioxide ) . 
 Bailey is comprised by a central tephra cone , upon which basaltic andesite eruptions streamed over , building up to create the current volcano . Eventually switching to andesite , it may have been built over several eruptions or even eruptive periods , judging from the silicic nature of its rock . It is currently inactive , having been since approximately the time Mount Mazama became active , sometime in the early Pleistocene epoch . 
 = = Ecology and recreation = = 
 Diverse flora exists on Mount Bailey . Starting at the lower slopes , the prominent tree type is standard pine , eventually changing to a landscape of mountain hemlock , western white pine , and Shasta fir . 
 Bailey is a popular hiking and skiing site , due to its steep climbs and views of Diamond Lake . It is accessible from Oregon Route 230 , starting at the Fox Spring trailhead . Following the Mount Bailey Trail , part of the Diamond Lake Recreational Area , hikers can see " panoramas to the northeast of Diamond Lake and Bailey 's dizzying avalanche bowl " . To skiers , the peak is known for its method of transportation , featuring snowcats . 
 = Alexandra of Denmark = 
 Alexandra of Denmark ( Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia ; 1 December 1844 – 20 November 1925 ) was Queen consort of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Empress consort of India as the wife of King @-@ Emperor Edward VII . 
 Her family had been relatively obscure until her father , Prince Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein @-@ Sonderburg @-@ Glücksburg , was chosen with the consent of the great powers to succeed his distant cousin , Frederick VII , to the Danish throne . At the age of sixteen , she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward , Prince of Wales , the heir apparent of Queen Victoria . They married eighteen months later in 1863 , the same year her father became king of Denmark as Christian IX and her brother was appointed to the vacant Greek throne as George I. She was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901 , the longest anyone has ever held that title , and became generally popular ; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion @-@ conscious women . Largely excluded from wielding any political power , she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband 's family to favour Greek and Danish interests . Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work . 
 On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 , Albert Edward became king @-@ emperor as Edward VII , with Alexandra as queen @-@ empress consort . She held the status until Edward 's death in 1910 . She greatly distrusted her nephew , German Emperor Wilhelm II , and supported her son during World War I , in which Britain and its allies fought Germany . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Princess Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia , or " Alix " , as her immediate family knew her , was born at the Yellow Palace , an 18th @-@ century town house at 18 <unk> , right next to the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen . Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein @-@ Sonderburg @-@ Glücksburg and her mother was Princess Louise of Hesse @-@ Kassel . Although she was of royal blood , her family lived a comparatively normal life . They did not possess great wealth ; her father 's income from an army commission was about £ 800 per year and their house was a rent @-@ free grace and favour property . Occasionally , Hans Christian Andersen was invited to call and tell the children stories before bedtime . 
 In 1848 , King Christian VIII of Denmark died and his only son , Frederick ascended the throne . Frederick was childless , had been through two unsuccessful marriages , and was assumed to be infertile . A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig @-@ Holstein , and the succession rules of each territory differed . In Holstein , the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line , whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark . Holstein , being predominantly German , proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia . In 1852 , the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession . An uneasy peace was agreed , which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein @-@ Sonderburg @-@ Glücksburg would be Frederick 's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others ( who included Christian 's own mother @-@ in @-@ law , brother @-@ in @-@ law and wife ) were surrendered . 
 Prince Christian was given the title Prince of Denmark and his family moved into a new official residence , Bernstorff Palace . Although the family 's status had risen , there was little or no increase in their income and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick 's third wife and former mistress , Louise Rasmussen , because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover . Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister , Dagmar ( later Empress of Russia ) , made her own clothes and waited at table along with her sisters . Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women 's swimming , Nancy Edberg . At Bernstorff , Alexandra grew into a young woman ; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace . She was devout throughout her life , and followed High Church practice . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 Queen Victoria and her husband , Prince Albert , were already concerned with finding a bride for their son and heir , Albert Edward , the Prince of Wales . They enlisted the aid of their daughter , Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia , in seeking a suitable candidate . Alexandra was not their first choice , since the Danes were at loggerheads with the Prussians over the Schleswig @-@ Holstein Question and most of the British royal family 's relations were German . Eventually , after rejecting other possibilities , they settled on her as " the only one to be chosen " . 
 On 24 September 1861 , Crown Princess Victoria introduced her brother Albert Edward to Alexandra at Speyer . Almost a year later on 9 September 1862 ( after his affair with Nellie Clifden and the death of his father ) Albert Edward proposed to Alexandra at the Royal Palace of Laeken , the home of his great @-@ uncle , King Leopold I of Belgium . 
 A few months later , Alexandra travelled from Denmark to Britain aboard the royal yacht Victoria and Albert II and arrived in Gravesend , Kent , on 7 March 1863 . Sir Arthur Sullivan composed music for her arrival and Poet Laureate Alfred , Lord Tennyson , wrote an ode in Alexandra 's honour : 
 Thomas Longley , the Archbishop of Canterbury , married the couple on 10 March 1863 at St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle . The choice of venue was criticised widely . As the ceremony took place outside London , the press complained that large public crowds would not be able to view the spectacle . Prospective guests thought it awkward to get to and , as the venue was small , some people who had expected invitations were disappointed . The Danes were dismayed because only Alexandra 's closest relations were invited . The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert , so ladies were restricted to wearing grey , lilac or mauve . As the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight , they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College , including Lord Randolph Churchill . 
 By the end of the following year , Alexandra 's father had ascended the throne of Denmark , her brother George had become King of the Hellenes , her sister Dagmar was engaged to the Tsesarevich of Russia , and Alexandra had given birth to her first child . Her father 's accession gave rise to further conflict over the fate of Schleswig @-@ Holstein . The German Confederation successfully invaded Denmark , reducing the area of Denmark by two @-@ fifths . To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia , Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war . The Prussian conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra 's profound dislike of the Germans , a feeling which stayed with her for the rest of her life . 
 Alexandra 's first child , Albert Victor , was born two months premature in early 1864 . Alexandra showed devotion to her children : " She was in her glory when she could run up to the nursery , put on a flannel apron , wash the children herself and see them asleep in their little beds . " Albert Edward and Alexandra had six children in total : Albert Victor , George , Louise , Victoria , Maud , and John . All of Alexandra 's children were apparently born prematurely ; biographer Richard Hough thought Alexandra deliberately misled Queen Victoria as to her probable delivery dates , as she did not want the queen to be present at their births . During the birth of her third child in 1867 , the added complication of a bout of rheumatic fever threatened Alexandra 's life , and left her with a permanent limp . 
 In public , Alexandra was dignified and charming ; in private , affectionate and jolly . She enjoyed many social activities , including dancing and ice @-@ skating , and was an expert horsewoman and tandem driver . She also enjoyed hunting , to the dismay of Queen Victoria , who asked her to stop , but without success . Even after the birth of her first child , she continued to socialise much as before , which led to some friction between the queen and the young couple , exacerbated by Alexandra 's loathing of Prussians and the queen 's partiality towards them . 
 = = Princess of Wales = = 
 Albert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868 . After her illness the previous year , she had only just begun to walk again without the aid of two walking sticks , and was already pregnant with her fourth child . The royal couple undertook a six @-@ month tour taking in Austria , Egypt and Greece over 1868 and 1869 , which included visits to her brother King George I of Greece , to the Crimean battlefields and ( for her only ) to the harem of the Khedive Ismail . In Turkey she became the first woman to sit down to dinner with the Sultan ( <unk> ) . 
 The <unk> made Sandringham House their preferred residence , with Marlborough House their London base . Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one ; however , some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged , until his attack of typhoid fever ( the disease which was believed to have killed his father ) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation . This is disputed by others , who point out Alexandra 's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift . Nevertheless , the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever . Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women , including the actress Lillie Langtry ; Daisy Greville , Countess of Warwick ; humanitarian Agnes Keyser ; and society matron Alice Keppel . Alexandra knew about most of these relationships , and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying . Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage . 
 An increasing degree of deafness , caused by hereditary otosclerosis , led to Alexandra 's social isolation ; she spent more time at home with her children and pets . Her sixth and final pregnancy ended tragically when her infant son died only a day after his birth . Despite Alexandra 's pleas for privacy , Queen Victoria insisted on announcing a period of court mourning , which led unsympathetic elements of the press to describe the birth as " a wretched abortion " and the funeral arrangements as " sickening <unk> " , even though the infant was not buried in state with other members of the royal family at Windsor , but in strict privacy in the churchyard at Sandringham , where he had lived out his brief life . 
 For eight months over 1875 – 76 , the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain on a tour of India , but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind . The prince had planned an all @-@ male group and intended to spend much of the time hunting and shooting . During the prince 's tour , one of his friends who was travelling with him , Lord Aylesford , was told by his wife that she was going to leave him for another man : Lord Blandford , who was himself married . Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce . Meanwhile , Lord Blandford 's brother , Lord Randolph Churchill , persuaded the lovers against an elopement . Now concerned by the threat of divorce , Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider . In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit , Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal . Distressed at their threats , and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck , Alexandra informed the queen , who then wrote to the Prince of Wales . The prince was incensed . Eventually , the <unk> and the <unk> both separated privately . Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised , for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him . 
 Alexandra spent the spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of the Hellenes . During the Russo @-@ Turkish War , Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia , where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch , and she lobbied for a revision of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks . Alexandra and her two sons spent the next three years largely parted from each other 's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education . The farewell was very tearful and , as shown by her regular letters , she missed them dreadfully . In 1881 , Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia , both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister , who was now the Tsarina . 
 Alexandra undertook many public duties ; in the words of Queen Victoria , " to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions . She opens bazaars , attends concerts , visits hospitals in my place ... she not only never complains , but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty . " She took a particular interest in the London Hospital , visiting it regularly . Joseph Merrick , the so @-@ called " Elephant Man " , was one of the patients whom she met . Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously , but during a visit to Ireland in 1885 , she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the City of Cork , a hotbed of Irish nationalism . She and her husband were booed by a crowd of two to three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags . She smiled her way through the ordeal , which the British press still portrayed in a positive light , describing the crowds as " enthusiastic " . As part of the same visit , she received a Doctorate in Music from Trinity College , Dublin . 
 The death of her eldest son , Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , in 1892 was a serious blow to Alexandra . His room and possessions were kept exactly as he had left them , much as those of Prince Albert were left after his death in 1861 . She said , " I have buried my angel and with him my happiness . " Surviving letters between Alexandra and her children indicate that they were mutually devoted . In 1894 , her brother @-@ in @-@ law Alexander III of Russia died and her nephew Nicholas II of Russia became Tsar . Alexandra 's widowed sister , the Dowager Empress , leant heavily on her for support ; Alexandra slept , prayed , and stayed beside her sister for the next two weeks until Alexander 's burial .

 With the death of her mother @-@ in @-@ law , Queen Victoria , in 1901 , Alexandra became queen @-@ empress consort to the new king . Just two months later , her surviving son George and daughter @-@ in @-@ law Mary left on an extensive tour of the empire , leaving their young children in the care of Alexandra and Edward , who doted on their grandchildren . On George 's return , preparations for Edward and Alexandra 's coronation were well in hand but just a few days before the scheduled coronation in June 1902 the king became seriously ill with appendicitis . Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade , and attended the Royal Ascot races without him , in an attempt to prevent public alarm . Eventually , the coronation had to be postponed and Edward had an operation performed by Frederick Treves of the London Hospital to drain the infected appendix . After his recovery , Alexandra and Edward were crowned together in August : he by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Frederick Temple , and she by the Archbishop of York , William Dalrymple Maclagan . 
 Despite being queen , Alexandra 's duties changed little , and she kept many of the same retainers . Alexandra 's Woman of the Bedchamber , Charlotte Knollys , the daughter of Sir William Knollys , served Alexandra loyally for many years . On 10 December 1903 , Knollys woke to find her bedroom full of smoke . She roused Alexandra and shepherded her to safety . In the words of Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg @-@ Strelitz , " We must give credit to old Charlotte for really saving [ Alexandra 's ] life . " 
 Alexandra again looked after her grandchildren when George and Mary went on a second tour , this time to British India , over the winter of 1905 – 06 . Her father , King Christian IX of Denmark , died that January . Eager to retain their family links , to each other and to Denmark , in 1907 Alexandra and her sister , the Dowager Empress of Russia , purchased a villa north of Copenhagen , Hvidøre , as a private getaway . 
 Biographers have asserted that Alexandra was denied access to the king 's briefing papers and excluded from some of his foreign tours to prevent her meddling in diplomatic matters . She was deeply distrustful of Germans , and invariably opposed anything that favoured German expansion or interests . For example , in 1890 Alexandra wrote a memorandum , distributed to senior British ministers and military personnel , warning against the planned exchange of the British North Sea island of Heligoland for the German colony of Zanzibar , pointing out Heligoland 's strategic significance and that it could be used either by Germany to launch an attack , or by Britain to contain German aggression . Despite this , the exchange went ahead anyway . The Germans fortified the island and , in the words of Robert <unk> and as Alexandra had predicted , it " became the keystone of Germany 's maritime position for offence as well as for defence " . The Frankfurter Zeitung was outspoken in its condemnation of Alexandra and her sister , the Dowager Empress of Russia , saying that the pair were " the centre of the international anti @-@ German conspiracy " . She despised and distrusted her nephew , Wilhelm II of Germany , calling him in 1900 " inwardly our enemy " . 
 In 1910 , Alexandra became the first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate . In a remarkable departure from precedent , for two hours she sat in the Ladies ' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill , a bill to remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation , was debated . Privately , Alexandra disagreed with the bill . Shortly afterward , she left to visit her brother , King George I of Greece , in Corfu . While there , she received news that King Edward was seriously ill . Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died . In his last hours , she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe . She told Frederick Ponsonby , " I feel as if I had been turned into stone , unable to cry , unable to grasp the meaning of it all . " Later that year , she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House , but she retained possession of Sandringham . The new king , Alexandra 's son George , soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill . Despite her personal views , Alexandra supported her son 's reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith 's request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation . 
 = = = Queen mother = = = 
 From Edward 's death , Alexandra was queen mother , being a dowager queen and the mother of the reigning monarch . She was styled " Her Majesty Queen Alexandra " . She did not attend her son 's coronation in 1911 since it was not customary for a crowned queen to attend the coronation of another king or queen , but otherwise continued the public side of her life , devoting time to her charitable causes . One such cause included Alexandra Rose Day , where artificial roses made by people with disabilities were sold in aid of hospitals by women volunteers . During the First World War , the custom of hanging the banners of foreign princes invested with Britain 's highest order of knighthood , the Order of the Garter , in St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , came under criticism , as the German members of the Order were fighting against Britain . Alexandra joined calls to " have down those hateful German banners " . Driven by public opinion , but against his own wishes , the king had the banners removed but to Alexandra 's dismay he had down not only " those vile Prussian banners " but also those of her Hessian relations who were , in her opinion , " simply soldiers or vassals under that brutal German Emperor 's orders " . On 17 September 1916 , she was at Sandringham during a Zeppelin air raid , but far worse was to befall other members of her family . In Russia , her nephew Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown and he , his wife and children were killed by revolutionaries . Her sister the Dowager Empress was rescued from Russia in 1919 by HMS Marlborough and brought to England , where she lived for some time with Alexandra . 
 Alexandra retained a youthful appearance into her senior years , but during the war her age caught up with her . She took to wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup , which was described by gossips as having her face " enamelled " . She made no more trips abroad , and suffered increasing ill health . In 1920 , a blood vessel in her eye burst , leaving her with temporary partial blindness . Towards the end of her life , her memory and speech became impaired . She died on 20 November 1925 at Sandringham after suffering a heart attack , and was buried in an elaborate tomb next to her husband in St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle .

 The Queen Alexandra Memorial by Alfred Gilbert was unveiled on Alexandra Rose Day 8 June 1932 at Marlborough Gate , London . An ode in her memory , " So many true princesses who have gone " , composed by the then Master of the King 's Musick Sir Edward Elgar to words by the Poet Laureate John Masefield , was sung at the unveiling and conducted by the composer . 
 Alexandra was highly popular with the British public . After she married the Prince of Wales in 1863 , a new park and " People 's Palace " , a public exhibition and arts centre under construction in north London , were renamed the Alexandra Palace and park to commemorate her . There are at least sixty @-@ seven roads and streets in the Greater London area alone called Alexandra Road , Alexandra Avenue , Alexandra Gardens , Alexandra Close or Alexandra Street , all named after her . Unlike her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law , she was not castigated by the press . Funds that she helped to collect were used to buy a river launch , called Alexandra , to ferry the wounded during the Sudan campaign , and to fit out a hospital ship , named The Princess of Wales , to bring back wounded from the Boer War . During the Boer War , Queen Alexandra 's Imperial Military Nursing Service , later renamed Queen Alexandra 's Royal Army Nursing Corps , was founded under Royal Warrant . 
 Alexandra had little understanding of money . The management of her finances was left in the hands of her loyal comptroller , Sir Dighton Probyn VC , who undertook a similar role for her husband . In the words of her grandson , Edward VIII ( later the Duke of Windsor ) , " Her generosity was a source of embarrassment to her financial advisers . Whenever she received a letter soliciting money , a cheque would be sent by the next post , regardless of the authenticity of the mendicant and without having the case investigated . " Though she was not always extravagant ( she had her old stockings darned for re @-@ use and her old dresses were recycled as furniture covers ) , she would dismiss protests about her heavy spending with a wave of a hand or by claiming that she had not heard . 
 She hid a small scar on her neck , which was likely the result of a childhood operation , by wearing choker necklaces and high necklines , setting fashions which were adopted for fifty years . Alexandra 's effect on fashion was so profound that society ladies even copied her limping gait , after her serious illness in 1867 left her with a stiff leg . This came to be known as the " Alexandra limp " . She used predominantly the London fashion houses ; her favourite was Redfern 's , but she shopped occasionally at Doucet and <unk> of Paris . 
 Queen Alexandra has been portrayed on television by Deborah Grant and Helen Ryan in Edward the Seventh , Ann Firbank in Lillie , Maggie Smith in All the King 's Men , and Bibi Andersson in The Lost Prince . She was portrayed in film by Helen Ryan again in the 1980 film The Elephant Man , Sara Stewart in the 1997 film Mrs Brown , and Julia Blake in the 1999 film Passion . In a 1980 stage play by Royce Ryton , <unk> , she was portrayed by Margaret Lockwood in her last acting role .

 = Stafford L. Warren = 
 Stafford Leak Warren ( July 19 , 1896 - July 26 , 1981 ) was an American physician and radiologist who was a pioneer in the field of nuclear medicine and best known for his invention of the mammogram . Warren developed the technique of producing stereoscopic images of the breast with X @-@ rays while working in the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine . 
 Warren was commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army Medical Corps in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Engineering District . He was responsible for the health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project . He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo , New Mexico where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world 's first nuclear weapon . He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the Joint Task Force for Operation Crossroads , the nuclear test at Bikini Atoll . 
 In 1947 Warren became the first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . Under his leadership , the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school . Warren became Vice Chancellor , Health Services in 1962 . From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation . Returning to UCLA in 1965 , he became professor emeritus , a position he held until his death in 1981 . In 1971 , he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to science and medicine .

 Stafford Leak Warren was born in Maxwell , New Mexico on June 19 , 1896 . He attended the University of California , Berkeley , where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918 . He married Viola Lockhart on May 22 , 1920 . Their marriage produced two sons and a daughter . He went to medical school at the University of California , San Francisco , graduating with his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1922 . He then did post @-@ doctoral work at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Harvard University . 
 = = University of Rochester = = 
 Warren joined the faculty of the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1926 , becoming an Assistant Professor of Medicine . The department was a new one that had only been founded in 1921 , based upon the ideals of medical education propounded by Abraham Flexner in his 1910 Flexner Report . The medical school had opened in 1925 and did not graduate its first class until 1929 . Warren was one of the original group that Dean George Whipple assembled to staff the new medical school . At Rochester , Warren investigated the effects of artificial fever , including its possible use for treating <unk> infections . He was also interested in radiography . 
 In 1930 , Warren became an Associate Professor of Medicine . That year he published " A <unk> Study of the Breast " . X @-@ ray imaging of the breast had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the University of Berlin in 1913 . He produced images of over 3 @,@ 000 mastectomy specimens , and observed different forms and stages of cancer . He was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst . However , Salomon apparently did not appreciate the life saving potential of his observations . Warren used radiology to track changes in breast tissue as a result of pregnancy and mastitis . He developed a stereoscopic technique , using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose X @-@ ray equipment to his needs . His method involved having the patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being X @-@ rayed . In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery , he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases . This represented a leap forward , as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery . It also sparked intense interest in the technique around the world . Today mammography saves thousands of lives . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 In February 1943 , Warren met with Dr Albert K. Chapman , the Vice President and General Manager of Eastman Kodak , Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , the director of the Manhattan Project and Colonel James C. Marshall , the commander of the Manhattan Engineer District ( MED ) . They asked him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED . In March 1943 , Warren met with Major <unk> L. Friedell at the MED 's New York City headquarters . Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California , Berkeley , where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone . Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation . Warren was unable to provide all the information , but agreed to initiate research at Rochester . 
 Friedell recommended that in view of the scope of the Manhattan Project , a more senior officer be placed in charge . In October , Groves penned a letter to the Surgeon General of the United States Army , Major General Norman T. Kirk , requesting that he cooperate with the Manhattan Project in furnishing medical supplies , providing funds for medical care of military personnel , and directly commissioning Warren and other doctors at specified ranks . This letter was signed by Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell and delivered in person by Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols , who had replaced Marshall as the district engineer . Kirk was furious at what he saw as usurpation of his statutory responsibilities as Surgeon General . When told that Warren was the man the district had in mind to commission as a colonel , and apparently familiar with Warren 's work only from his use of radiation to treat venereal disease asked " Why do you want that clap doctor ? " 
 Warren was duly commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army Medical Corps on November 3 , 1943 . He was appointed as chief of the MED 's medical section and medical advisor to the director of the Manhattan Project , with Friedell as his deputy . Warren 's office was initially located in New York City but moved to Oak Ridge , Tennessee soon after . Warren 's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge , Richland , Washington and Los Alamos , New Mexico . Warren 's section was responsible for medical research , but also for the MED 's health and safety programs . This presented an enormous challenge , because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals , using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures , working with high voltages used in novel ways , and performing experiments involving explosives , not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials . Yet in December 1945 , the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record . Between January 1943 and June 1945 , there were 62 fatalities and 3 @,@ 879 disabling injuries , which was about 62 percent below that of private industry . 
 Warren was personally responsible for the safety aspects of the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo , New Mexico . There was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud . Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours . Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren could get some rest . Fortunately , no problems arose with the test . 
 The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were carried out on 6 and 9 August 1945 . On 11 August , Groves phoned Warren and ordered him to organize a survey team and proceed to Guam , and thence to Japan to evaluate the effect of the atomic bombs and take measures to insure the safety of Allied troops occupying the cities . Initially the survey team was to accompany the assault troops of the III Amphibious Corps and the V Amphibious Corps in the invasion of Japan , but Japan surrendered on 14 August , the day the survey team departed San Francisco by air . The survey team arrived on Tinian on 17 August , where it was split into two parties , one under Warren and the other under Friedell . Warren 's party , equipped with portable geiger counters , arrived in Hiroshima by air on 8 September as part of a group headed by Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell that also included Brigadier General James B. Newman Jr and Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki , who acted as a translator . They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October . They were impressed by both the damage done by the atomic bombs and the extensive Japanese preparations for an American invasion . 
 The detonation of the two atomic bombs in Japan " raised as many military and <unk> questions as they answered " . A series of nuclear tests was planned , codenamed Operation Crossroads . Some 42 @,@ 000 personnel were deployed to Bikini Atoll as part of Admiral William H. P. Blandy 's Joint Task Force 1 to conduct the test . Their health and safety was Lyons 's responsibility , but the specialised job of radiological safety was handled by the Manhattan Project . Warren , as Chief of the Radiological Safety Section ( <unk> ) , planned and implemented measures to assess , limit and control the impact of radiation . Teams were given special training at Oak Ridge in the operation of instrumentation to measure radioactivity , and the interpretation of their readings . Training was also conducted aboard USS Haven en route to Bikini Atoll , where it arrived on 12 June 1946 . In all , some 3 @,@ 500 personnel were assigned to <unk> . Warren was appalled by the effects of radioactive contamination on the environment . " The deadly range of radioactive products from the atomic bomb has been clearly demonstrated under controlled conditions ... " he wrote , " the only defense against atomic bombs still lies outside the scope of science . It is the prevention of atomic war . " 
 Warren left the Army on 6 November 1946 . He temporarily became the Chief of the Medical Section of the Atomic Energy Commission , the civilian agency which succeeded the Manhattan Project . In February 1947 , he was replaced by Dr Shields Warren . For his services with the Manhattan Engineer District . Warren was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit . 
 = = University of California = = 
 Toward the end of World War II , a group of physicians proposed that the University of California should establish a medical school in Southern California . One of them was the urologist Elmer Belt , whose patients included the Governor of California , Earl Warren . The University of California Board of Regents voted to establish a medical school as part of the University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) on October 19 , 1945 . In 1946 the California State Legislature unanimously voted $ 7 million to establish the new school , and Earl Warren signed it into law . 
 In 1947 , Warren was appointed the new school 's first dean . Once again he found himself involved in creating a new medical school . His first appointments were three former associates in Rochester : Dr Charles Carpenter as the first professor of infectious disease ; Dr Andrew H. Dowdy as the first professor of radiology ; and Dr John S. Lawrence , who had pioneered the use of phosphorus @-@ 32 as a radioactive tracer , as professor of medicine . With Dr William P. Longmire Jr , a 34 @-@ year @-@ old plastic surgeon from Johns Hopkins University recruited by Lawrence as professor of surgery , they became the " Founding Five " of the new school . Initially , the new school was accommodated in wartime Quonset huts scattered about the UCLA campus . Warren was still wearing his army fatigues . Construction of permanent accommodation commenced in 1949 . By 1951 when the first students , 26 men and two women , arrived there were 15 faculty members . By the time the first class graduated in 1955 there were 43 faculty members . The UCLA Medical Center opened in 1955 . 
 Under Warren 's leadership , the school grew steadily , adding Schools of Dentistry , Nursing , and Public Health . Against some influential opposition , Warren established his medical school on the UCLA campus rather than in another part of the city . He strove to integrate not only the structures but the faculty with other departments of the university . He fostered the development of a major biomedical library as both a tangible and intellectual link between the life sciences and the health sciences . 
 Warren became Vice Chancellor , Health Services in 1962 . From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation . Returning to UCLA in 1965 , he became professor emeritus , a position he held until his death in 1981 . His first wife Viola died in 1963 and on July 18 , 1970 he married Gertrude Turner <unk> . In 1971 , Warren was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award . His citation read : 
 For the imaginative , prescient , and vigorous efforts which made possible the early development of atomic energy so as to assure the protection of man and the environment , and for the establishment of a biomedical research program which has resulted in many substantial applications of ionizing radiation to diagnosis and treatment of disease and to the general welfare . 
 He died on July 26 , 1981 in Pacific Palisades , California . He was survived by his wife and three children . His papers are in the UCLA Library , Department of Special Collections . 
 = Electron = 
 The electron is a subatomic particle , symbol e − or β − , with a negative elementary electric charge . Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family , and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure . The electron has a mass that is approximately 1 / 1836 that of the proton . Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) of a half @-@ integer value in units of ħ , which means that it is a fermion . Being fermions , no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state , in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle . Like all matter , electrons have properties of both particles and waves , and so can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light . The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a higher De Broglie wavelength for typical energies . 
 Many physical phenomena involve electrons in an essential role , such as electricity , magnetism , and thermal conductivity , and they also participate in gravitational , electromagnetic and weak interactions . An electron generates an electric field surrounding it . An electron moving relative to an observer generates a magnetic field . External electromagnetic fields affect an electron according to the Lorentz force law . Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when accelerated . Laboratory instruments are capable of containing and observing individual electrons as well as electron plasma using electromagnetic fields , whereas dedicated telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space . Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics , welding , cathode ray tubes , electron microscopes , radiation therapy , lasers , gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators . 
 Interactions involving electrons and other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics . The Coulomb force interaction between positive protons inside atomic nuclei and negative electrons composes atoms . Ionization or changes in the proportions of particles changes the binding energy of the system . The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding . British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms in 1838 ; Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge ' electron ' in 1891 , and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 . Electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions , such as nucleosynthesis in stars , where they are known as beta particles . Electrons may be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high @-@ energy collisions , for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere . The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron ; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign . When an electron collides with a positron , both particles may be totally annihilated , producing gamma ray photons .

 The ancient Greeks noticed that amber attracted small objects when rubbed with fur . Along with lightning , this phenomenon is one of humanity 's earliest recorded experiences with electricity . In his 1600 treatise De Magnete , the English scientist William Gilbert coined the New Latin term electricus , to refer to this property of attracting small objects after being rubbed . Both electric and electricity are derived from the Latin <unk> ( also the root of the alloy of the same name ) , which came from the Greek word for amber , <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 In the early 1700s , Francis <unk> and French chemist Charles François de Fay independently discovered what they believed were two kinds of frictional electricity — one generated from rubbing glass , the other from rubbing resin . From this , Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids , vitreous and resinous , that are separated by friction , and that neutralize each other when combined . A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid , but the same electrical fluid under different pressures . He gave them the modern charge nomenclature of positive and negative respectively . Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive , but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier , and which situation was a deficit . 
 Between 1838 and 1851 , British natural philosopher Richard Laming developed the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit electric charges . Beginning in 1846 , German physicist William Weber theorized that electricity was composed of positively and negatively charged fluids , and their interaction was governed by the inverse square law . After studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in 1874 , Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney suggested that there existed a " single definite quantity of electricity " , the charge of a monovalent ion . He was able to estimate the value of this elementary charge e by means of Faraday 's laws of electrolysis . However , Stoney believed these charges were permanently attached to atoms and could not be removed . In 1881 , German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz argued that both positive and negative charges were divided into elementary parts , each of which " behaves like atoms of electricity " . 
 Stoney initially coined the term <unk> in 1881 . Ten years later , he switched to electron to describe these elementary charges , writing in 1894 : " ... an estimate was made of the actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity , for which I have since ventured to suggest the name electron " . A 1906 proposal to change to <unk> failed because Hendrik Lorentz preferred to keep electron . The word electron is a combination of the words electric and ion . The suffix -on which is now used to designate other subatomic particles , such as a proton or neutron , is in turn derived from electron . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 The German physicist Johann Wilhelm <unk> studied electrical conductivity in rarefied gases : in 1869 , he discovered a glow emitted from the cathode that increased in size with decrease in gas pressure . In 1876 , the German physicist Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays from this glow cast a shadow , and he dubbed the rays cathode rays . During the 1870s , the English chemist and physicist Sir William Crookes developed the first cathode ray tube to have a high vacuum inside . He then showed that the luminescence rays appearing within the tube carried energy and moved from the cathode to the anode . Furthermore , by applying a magnetic field , he was able to deflect the rays , thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively charged . In 1879 , he proposed that these properties could be explained by what he termed ' radiant matter ' . He suggested that this was a fourth state of matter , consisting of negatively charged molecules that were being projected with high velocity from the cathode . 
 The German @-@ born British physicist Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes ' experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates . The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate , providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge . By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current , in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge @-@ to @-@ mass ratio of the ray components . However , this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected , so little credence was given to his calculations at the time . 
 In 1892 Hendrik Lorentz suggested that the mass of these particles ( electrons ) could be a consequence of their electric charge . 
 In 1896 , the British physicist J. J. Thomson , with his colleagues John S. Townsend and H. A. Wilson , performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were unique particles , rather than waves , atoms or molecules as was believed earlier . Thomson made good estimates of both the charge e and the mass m , finding that cathode ray particles , which he called " corpuscles , " had perhaps one thousandth of the mass of the least massive ion known : hydrogen . He showed that their charge to mass ratio , e / m , was independent of cathode material . He further showed that the negatively charged particles produced by radioactive materials , by heated materials and by illuminated materials were universal . The name electron was again proposed for these particles by the Irish physicist George F. Fitzgerald , and the name has since gained universal acceptance . 
 While studying naturally <unk> minerals in 1896 , the French physicist Henri Becquerel discovered that they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source . These radioactive materials became the subject of much interest by scientists , including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles . He designated these particles alpha and beta , on the basis of their ability to penetrate matter . In 1900 , Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field , and that their mass @-@ to @-@ charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays . This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms . 
 The electron 's charge was more carefully measured by the American physicists Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil @-@ drop experiment of 1909 , the results of which were published in 1911 . This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity . This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1 – 150 ions with an error margin of less than 0 @.@ 3 % . Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson 's team , using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis , and in 1911 by Abram Ioffe , who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals , then published his results in 1913 . However , oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower evaporation rate , and thus more suited to precise experimentation over longer periods of time . 
 Around the beginning of the twentieth century , it was found that under certain conditions a fast @-@ moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path . In 1911 , Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles , such as fast @-@ moving electrons .

 By 1914 , experiments by physicists Ernest Rutherford , Henry Moseley , James Franck and Gustav Hertz had largely established the structure of an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower @-@ mass electrons . In 1913 , Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states , with the energy determined by the angular momentum of the electron 's orbits about the nucleus . The electrons could move between these states , or orbits , by the emission or absorption of photons at specific frequencies . By means of these quantized orbits , he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom . However , Bohr 's model failed to account for the relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms . 
 Chemical bonds between atoms were explained by Gilbert Newton Lewis , who in 1916 proposed that a covalent bond between two atoms is maintained by a pair of electrons shared between them . Later , in 1927 , Walter Heitler and Fritz London gave the full explanation of the electron @-@ pair formation and chemical bonding in terms of quantum mechanics . In 1919 , the American chemist Irving Langmuir elaborated on the Lewis ' static model of the atom and suggested that all electrons were distributed in successive " concentric ( nearly ) spherical shells , all of equal thickness " . The shells were , in turn , divided by him in a number of cells each containing one pair of electrons . With this model Langmuir was able to qualitatively explain the chemical properties of all elements in the periodic table , which were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law . 
 In 1924 , Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli observed that the shell @-@ like structure of the atom could be explained by a set of four parameters that defined every quantum energy state , as long as each state was inhabited by no more than a single electron . ( This prohibition against more than one electron occupying the same quantum energy state became known as the Pauli exclusion principle . ) The physical mechanism to explain the fourth parameter , which had two distinct possible values , was provided by the Dutch physicists Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck . In 1925 , Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck suggested that an electron , in addition to the angular momentum of its orbit , possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment . The intrinsic angular momentum became known as spin , and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high @-@ resolution spectrograph ; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting . 
 = = = Quantum mechanics = = = 
 In his 1924 dissertation Recherches sur la théorie des quanta ( Research on Quantum Theory ) , French physicist Louis de Broglie hypothesized that all matter possesses a de Broglie wave similar to light . That is , under the appropriate conditions , electrons and other matter would show properties of either particles or waves . The corpuscular properties of a particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along its trajectory at any given moment . Wave @-@ like nature is observed , for example , when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits and creates interference patterns . In 1927 , the interference effect was found in a beam of electrons by English physicist George Paget Thomson with a thin metal film and by American physicists Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer using a crystal of nickel . 
 De Broglie 's prediction of a wave nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving under the influence of the nucleus in the atom . In 1926 , this equation , the Schrödinger equation , successfully described how electron waves propagated . Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time , this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position , especially a position near where the electron was bound in space , for which the electron wave equations did not change in time . This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics ( the first being by Heisenberg in 1925 ) , and solutions of Schrödinger 's equation , like Heisenberg 's , provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913 , and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum . Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were considered , quantum mechanics later made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with higher atomic numbers than hydrogen . 
 In 1928 , building on Wolfgang Pauli 's work , Paul Dirac produced a model of the electron – the Dirac equation , consistent with relativity theory , by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the <unk> formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro @-@ magnetic field . To resolve some problems within his relativistic equation , in 1930 Dirac developed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles having negative energy , which was dubbed the Dirac sea . This led him to predict the existence of a positron , the antimatter counterpart of the electron . This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson , who proposed calling standard electrons <unk> , and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants . 
 In 1947 Willis Lamb , working in collaboration with graduate student Robert Retherford , found that certain quantum states of hydrogen atom , which should have the same energy , were shifted in relation to each other , the difference being the Lamb shift . About the same time , Polykarp Kusch , working with Henry M. Foley , discovered the magnetic moment of the electron is slightly larger than predicted by Dirac 's theory . This small difference was later called anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron . This difference was later explained by the theory of quantum electrodynamics , developed by Sin @-@ Itiro Tomonaga , Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman in the late 1940s .

 With the development of the particle accelerator during the first half of the twentieth century , physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles . The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst . His initial betatron reached energies of 2 @.@ 3 MeV , while subsequent <unk> achieved 300 MeV . In 1947 , synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70 MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric . This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons , moving near the speed of light , through a magnetic field . 
 With a beam energy of 1 @.@ 5 GeV , the first high @-@ energy particle collider was <unk> , which began operations in 1968 . This device accelerated electrons and positrons in opposite directions , effectively doubling the energy of their collision when compared to striking a static target with an electron . The Large Electron – Positron Collider ( LEP ) at CERN , which was operational from 1989 to 2000 , achieved collision energies of 209 GeV and made important measurements for the Standard Model of particle physics .

 20 nm ) CMOS transistors operated at cryogenic temperature over a range of − 269 ° C ( 4 K ) to about − 258 ° C ( 15 K ) . The electron wavefunction spreads in a semiconductor lattice and negligibly interacts with the valence band electrons , so it can be treated in the single particle formalism , by replacing its mass with the effective mass tensor .

 In the Standard Model of particle physics , electrons belong to the group of subatomic particles called leptons , which are believed to be fundamental or elementary particles . Electrons have the lowest mass of any charged lepton ( or electrically charged particle of any type ) and belong to the first @-@ generation of fundamental particles . The second and third generation contain charged leptons , the muon and the tau , which are identical to the electron in charge , spin and interactions , but are more massive . <unk> differ from the other basic constituent of matter , the quarks , by their lack of strong interaction . All members of the lepton group are fermions , because they all have half @-@ odd integer spin ; the electron has spin 1 / 2 . 
 = = = Fundamental properties = = = 
 The invariant mass of an electron is approximately 9 @.@ 109 × 10 − 31 kilograms , or 5 @.@ 489 × 10 − 4 atomic mass units . On the basis of Einstein 's principle of mass – energy equivalence , this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0 @.@ 511 MeV . The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836 . Astronomical measurements show that the proton @-@ to @-@ electron mass ratio has held the same value for at least half the age of the universe , as is predicted by the Standard Model . 
 Electrons have an electric charge of − 1 @.@ 602 × 10 − 19 coulomb , which is used as a standard unit of charge for subatomic particles , and is also called the elementary charge . This elementary charge has a relative standard uncertainty of 2 @.@ 2 × 10 − 8 . Within the limits of experimental accuracy , the electron charge is identical to the charge of a proton , but with the opposite sign . As the symbol e is used for the elementary charge , the electron is commonly symbolized by e − , where the minus sign indicates the negative charge . The positron is symbolized by e + because it has the same properties as the electron but with a positive rather than negative charge . 
 The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum or spin of 1 / 2 . This property is usually stated by referring to the electron as a spin @-@ 1 / 2 particle . For such particles the spin magnitude is √ 3 / 2 <unk> while the result of the measurement of a projection of the spin on any axis can only be ± ħ / 2 . In addition to spin , the electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment along its spin axis . It is approximately equal to one Bohr magneton , which is a physical constant equal to 9 @.@ <unk> ( 23 ) × 10 − 24 joules per tesla . The orientation of the spin with respect to the momentum of the electron defines the property of elementary particles known as helicity . 
 The electron has no known <unk> and it is assumed to be a point particle with a point charge and no spatial extent . In classical physics , the angular momentum and magnetic moment of an object depend upon its physical dimensions . Hence , the concept of a dimensionless electron possessing these properties contrasts to experimental observations in Penning traps which point to finite non @-@ zero radius of the electron . A possible explanation of this paradoxical situation is given below in the " Virtual particles " subsection by taking into consideration the <unk> @-@ <unk> transformation . 
 The issue of the radius of the electron is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics . The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity . On the other hand , a point @-@ like electron ( zero radius ) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self @-@ energy of the electron tending to infinity . These aspects have been analyzed in detail by Dmitri <unk> and <unk> Sokolov . 
 Observation of a single electron in a Penning trap shows the upper limit of the particle 's radius is 10 − 22 meters . Also an upper bound of electron radius of 10 − 18 meters can be derived using the uncertainty relation in energy . 
 There is also a physical constant called the " classical electron radius " , with the much larger value of 2 @.@ <unk> × 10 − 15 m , greater than the radius of the proton . However , the terminology comes from a simplistic calculation that ignores the effects of quantum mechanics ; in reality , the so @-@ called classical electron radius has little to do with the true fundamental structure of the electron . 
 There are elementary particles that spontaneously decay into less massive particles . An example is the muon , which decays into an electron , a neutrino and an antineutrino , with a mean lifetime of 2 @.@ 2 × 10 − 6 seconds . However , the electron is thought to be stable on theoretical grounds : the electron is the least massive particle with non @-@ zero electric charge , so its decay would violate charge conservation . The experimental lower bound for the electron 's mean lifetime is 6 @.@ 6 × 1028 years , at a 90 % confidence level . 
 = = = Quantum properties = = = 
 As with all particles , electrons can act as waves . This is called the wave – particle duality and can be demonstrated using the double @-@ slit experiment . 
 The wave @-@ like nature of the electron allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously , rather than just one slit as would be the case for a classical particle . In quantum mechanics , the wave @-@ like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex @-@ valued function , the wave function , commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi ( ψ ) . When the absolute value of this function is squared , it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location — a probability density . 
 Electrons are identical particles because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties . In quantum mechanics , this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system . The wave function of fermions , including electrons , is antisymmetric , meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped ; that is , ψ ( r1 , r2 ) = − ψ ( r2 , r1 ) , where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons , respectively . Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap , this corresponds to equal probabilities . <unk> , such as the photon , have symmetric wave functions instead . 
 In the case of <unk> , solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state . This is responsible for the Pauli exclusion principle , which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state . This principle explains many of the properties of electrons . For example , it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom , rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit . 
 = = = Virtual particles = = = 
 In a simplified picture , every photon spends some time as a combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle , the virtual positron , which rapidly annihilate each other shortly thereafter . The combination of the energy variation needed to create these particles , and the time during which they exist , fall under the threshold of detectability expressed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation , ΔE · Δt ≥ ħ . In effect , the energy needed to create these virtual particles , ΔE , can be " borrowed " from the vacuum for a period of time , Δt , so that their product is no more than the reduced Planck constant , ħ ≈ 6 @.@ 6 × 10 − 16 eV · s . Thus , for a virtual electron , Δt is at most 1 @.@ 3 × 10 − 21 s . 
 While an electron – positron virtual pair is in existence , the coulomb force from the ambient electric field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to be attracted to the original electron , while a created electron experiences a repulsion . This causes what is called vacuum polarization . In effect , the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity . Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value , and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron . This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese <unk> particle accelerator . Virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for the mass of the electron . 
 The interaction with virtual particles also explains the small ( about 0 @.@ 1 % ) deviation of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron from the Bohr magneton ( the anomalous magnetic moment ) . The extraordinarily precise agreement of this predicted difference with the experimentally determined value is viewed as one of the great achievements of quantum electrodynamics . 
 The apparent paradox ( mentioned above in the properties subsection ) of a point particle electron having intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment can be explained by the formation of virtual photons in the electric field generated by the electron . These photons cause the electron to shift about in a jittery fashion ( known as <unk> ) , which results in a net circular motion with precession . This motion produces both the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron . In atoms , this creation of virtual photons explains the Lamb shift observed in spectral lines . 
 = = = Interaction = = = 
 An electron generates an electric field that exerts an attractive force on a particle with a positive charge , such as the proton , and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge . The strength of this force is determined by Coulomb 's inverse square law . When an electron is in motion , it generates a magnetic field . The Ampère @-@ Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons ( the current ) with respect to an observer . This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor . The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard – <unk> potentials , which are valid even when the particle 's speed is close to that of light ( relativistic ) . 
 When an electron is moving through a magnetic field , it is subject to the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity . This centripetal force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the <unk> . The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation . The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron , known as the Abraham – Lorentz – Dirac Force , which creates a friction that slows the electron . This force is caused by a back @-@ reaction of the electron 's own field upon itself . 
 Photons mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles in quantum electrodynamics . An isolated electron at a constant velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon ; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum . Instead , virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles . This exchange of virtual photons , for example , generates the Coulomb force . Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle , such as a proton . The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation . 
 An inelastic collision between a photon ( light ) and a solitary ( free ) electron is called Compton scattering . This collision results in a transfer of momentum and energy between the particles , which modifies the wavelength of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift . The maximum magnitude of this wavelength shift is h / <unk> , which is known as the Compton wavelength . For an electron , it has a value of 2 @.@ 43 × 10 − 12 m . When the wavelength of the light is long ( for instance , the wavelength of the visible light is 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 7 μm ) the wavelength shift becomes negligible . Such interaction between the light and free electrons is called Thomson scattering or Linear Thomson scattering . 
 The relative strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two charged particles , such as an electron and a proton , is given by the fine @-@ structure constant . This value is a dimensionless quantity formed by the ratio of two energies : the electrostatic energy of attraction ( or repulsion ) at a separation of one Compton wavelength , and the rest energy of the charge . It is given by α ≈ 7 @.@ <unk> × 10 − 3 , which is approximately equal to 1 / 137 . 
 When electrons and positrons collide , they annihilate each other , giving rise to two or more gamma ray photons . If the electron and positron have negligible momentum , a positronium atom can form before annihilation results in two or three gamma ray photons totalling 1 @.@ 022 MeV . On the other hand , high @-@ energy photons may transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production , but only in the presence of a nearby charged particle , such as a nucleus . 
 In the theory of electroweak interaction , the left @-@ handed component of electron 's wavefunction forms a weak isospin doublet with the electron neutrino . This means that during weak interactions , electron neutrinos behave like electrons . Either member of this doublet can undergo a charged current interaction by emitting or absorbing a W and be converted into the other member . Charge is conserved during this reaction because the W boson also carries a charge , canceling out any net change during the transmutation . Charged current interactions are responsible for the phenomenon of beta decay in a radioactive atom . Both the electron and electron neutrino can undergo a neutral current interaction via a Z0 exchange , and this is responsible for neutrino @-@ electron elastic scattering .

 An electron can be bound to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force . A system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom . If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus ' electrical charge , such an atom is called an ion . The wave @-@ like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital . Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy , angular momentum and projection of angular momentum , and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus . According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons , which must differ in their spin quantum number . 
 Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential . Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles , such as electrons , and the Auger effect . To escape the atom , the energy of the electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom . This occurs , for example , with the photoelectric effect , where an incident photon exceeding the atom 's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron . 
 The orbital angular momentum of electrons is quantized . Because the electron is charged , it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to the angular momentum . The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus . The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons . The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital ( so called , paired electrons ) cancel each other out . 
 The chemical bond between atoms occurs as a result of electromagnetic interactions , as described by the laws of quantum mechanics . The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms , allowing the formation of molecules . Within a molecule , electrons move under the influence of several nuclei , and occupy molecular orbitals ; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms . A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs . These are electrons with opposed spins , allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle ( much like in atoms ) . Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density . For instance , in bonded pairs ( i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together ) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei . On the contrary , in non @-@ bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei .

 If a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance the positive charge of the nuclei , then that object has a net electric charge . When there is an excess of electrons , the object is said to be negatively charged . When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei , the object is said to be positively charged . When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal , their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral . A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing , by the triboelectric effect . 
 Independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed free electrons . Electrons in metals also behave as if they were free . In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi @-@ electrons — quasiparticles , which have the same electrical charge , spin and magnetic moment as real electrons but may have a different mass . When free electrons — both in vacuum and metals — move , they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current , which generates a magnetic field . Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field . These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell 's equations . 
 At a given temperature , each material has an electrical conductivity that determines the value of electric current when an electric potential is applied . Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold , whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors . In any dielectric material , the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator . Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation . On the other hand , metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands . The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave as if they were free or delocalized electrons . These electrons are not associated with specific atoms , so when an electric field is applied , they are free to move like a gas ( called Fermi gas ) through the material much like free electrons . 
 Because of collisions between electrons and atoms , the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is on the order of millimeters per second . However , the speed at which a change of current at one point in the material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material , the velocity of propagation , is typically about 75 % of light speed . This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave , with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material . 
 Metals make relatively good conductors of heat , primarily because the delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms . However , unlike electrical conductivity , the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature . This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann – Franz law , which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature . The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material , producing a temperature dependence for electric current . 
 When cooled below a point called the critical temperature , materials can undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric current , in a process known as superconductivity . In BCS theory , this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a Bose – Einstein condensate . These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons , thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance . ( Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100 nm , so they can overlap each other . ) However , the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain . 
 Electrons inside conducting solids , which are quasi @-@ particles themselves , when tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero , behave as though they had split into three other quasiparticles : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The former carries spin and magnetic moment , the next carries its orbital location while the latter electrical charge . 
 = = = Motion and energy = = = 
 According to Einstein 's theory of special relativity , as an electron 's speed approaches the speed of light , from an observer 's point of view its relativistic mass increases , thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer 's frame of reference . The speed of an electron can approach , but never reach , the speed of light in a vacuum , c . However , when relativistic electrons — that is , electrons moving at a speed close to c — are injected into a dielectric medium such as water , where the local speed of light is significantly less than c , the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium . As they interact with the medium , they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation . 
 The effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the Lorentz factor , defined as <formula> where v is the speed of the particle . The kinetic energy Ke of an electron moving with velocity v is : 
 <formula> 
 where me is the mass of electron . For example , the Stanford linear accelerator can accelerate an electron to roughly 51 GeV . Since an electron behaves as a wave , at a given velocity it has a characteristic de Broglie wavelength . This is given by <unk> = h / p where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum . For the 51 GeV electron above , the wavelength is about 2 @.@ 4 × 10 − 17 m , small enough to explore structures well below the size of an atomic nucleus .

 The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory to explain the early stages in the evolution of the Universe . For the first millisecond of the Big Bang , the temperatures were over 10 billion Kelvin and photons had mean energies over a million electronvolts . These photons were sufficiently energetic that they could react with each other to form pairs of electrons and positrons . Likewise , positron @-@ electron pairs annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons : 
 γ + γ ↔ e + + e − 
 An equilibrium between electrons , positrons and photons was maintained during this phase of the evolution of the Universe . After 15 seconds had passed , however , the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron @-@ positron formation could occur . Most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other , releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe . 
 For reasons that remain uncertain , during the process of <unk> there was an excess in the number of electrons over positrons . Hence , about one electron in every billion survived the annihilation process . This excess matched the excess of protons over antiprotons , in a condition known as baryon asymmetry , resulting in a net charge of zero for the universe . The surviving protons and neutrons began to participate in reactions with each other — in the process known as nucleosynthesis , forming isotopes of hydrogen and helium , with trace amounts of lithium . This process peaked after about five minutes . Any leftover neutrons underwent negative beta decay with a half @-@ life of about a thousand seconds , releasing a proton and electron in the process , 
 n → p + e − + ν 
 e 
 For about the next 300000 – <unk> years , the excess electrons remained too energetic to bind with atomic nuclei . What followed is a period known as recombination , when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe became transparent to radiation . 
 Roughly one million years after the big bang , the first generation of stars began to form . Within a star , stellar nucleosynthesis results in the production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei . These antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons , releasing gamma rays . The net result is a steady reduction in the number of electrons , and a matching increase in the number of neutrons . However , the process of stellar evolution can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes . Selected isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay , emitting an electron and antineutrino from the nucleus . An example is the cobalt @-@ 60 ( 60Co ) isotope , which decays to form nickel @-@ 60 ( 60Ni ) . 
 At the end of its lifetime , a star with more than about 20 solar masses can undergo gravitational collapse to form a black hole . According to classical physics , these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything , even electromagnetic radiation , from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius . However , quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance . Electrons ( and positrons ) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants . 
 When pairs of virtual particles ( such as an electron and positron ) are created in the vicinity of the event horizon , the random spatial distribution of these particles may permit one of them to appear on the exterior ; this process is called quantum tunnelling . The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle , allowing it to radiate away into space . In exchange , the other member of the pair is given negative energy , which results in a net loss of mass @-@ energy by the black hole . The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass , eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until , finally , it explodes . 
 Cosmic rays are particles traveling through space with high energies . Energy events as high as 3 @.@ 0 × 1020 eV have been recorded . When these particles collide with nucleons in the Earth 's atmosphere , a shower of particles is generated , including pions . More than half of the cosmic radiation observed from the Earth 's surface consists of muons . The particle called a muon is a lepton produced in the upper atmosphere by the decay of a pion . 
 π − → μ − + ν 
 μ 
 A muon , in turn , can decay to form an electron or positron . 
 μ − → e − + ν

 Remote observation of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy . For example , in high @-@ energy environments such as the corona of a star , free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation . Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation , which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density , and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes . 
 The frequency of a photon is proportional to its energy . As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom , it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies . For instance , when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum , distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation . Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines , such as the hydrogen spectral series . Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined . 
 In laboratory conditions , the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors , which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy , spin and charge . The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations . This enables precise measurements of the particle properties . For example , in one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a single electron for a period of 10 months . The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits , which , in 1980 , was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant . 
 The first video images of an electron 's energy distribution were captured by a team at Lund University in Sweden , February 2008 . The scientists used extremely short flashes of light , called <unk> pulses , which allowed an electron 's motion to be observed for the first time . 
 The distribution of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by angle @-@ resolved <unk> spectroscopy ( <unk> ) . This technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space — a mathematical representation of periodic structures that is used to infer the original structure . <unk> can be used to determine the direction , speed and scattering of electrons within the material .

 = = = Particle beams = = = 
 Electron beams are used in welding . They allow energy densities up to 107 W · cm − 2 across a narrow focus diameter of 0 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 3 mm and usually require no filler material . This welding technique must be performed in a vacuum to prevent the electrons from interacting with the gas before reaching their target , and it can be used to join conductive materials that would otherwise be considered unsuitable for welding . 
 Electron @-@ beam lithography ( EBL ) is a method of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer . This technique is limited by high costs , slow performance , the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids . The last problem limits the resolution to about 10 nm . For this reason , EBL is primarily used for the production of small numbers of specialized integrated circuits . 
 Electron beam processing is used to irradiate materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products . Electron beams <unk> or quasi @-@ melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation : e.g. intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy . 
 Linear particle accelerators generate electron beams for treatment of superficial tumors in radiation therapy . Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal @-@ cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed , typically up to 5 cm for electron energies in the range 5 – 20 MeV . An electron beam can be used to supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X @-@ rays . 
 Particle accelerators use electric fields to propel electrons and their antiparticles to high energies . These particles emit synchrotron radiation as they pass through magnetic fields . The dependency of the intensity of this radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beam — a process known as the Sokolov – <unk> effect . <unk> electron beams can be useful for various experiments . Synchrotron radiation can also cool the electron beams to reduce the momentum spread of the particles . Electron and positron beams are collided upon the particles ' accelerating to the required energies ; particle detectors observe the resulting energy emissions , which particle physics studies .

 Low @-@ energy electron diffraction ( LEED ) is a method of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine the structure of the material . The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20 – 200 eV . The reflection high @-@ energy electron diffraction ( <unk> ) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials . The beam energy is typically in the range 8 – 20 keV and the angle of incidence is 1 – 4 ° . 
 The electron microscope directs a focused beam of electrons at a specimen . Some electrons change their properties , such as movement direction , angle , and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material . <unk> can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material . In blue light , conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction @-@ limited resolution of about 200 nm . By comparison , electron microscopes are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron . This wavelength , for example , is equal to 0 @.@ <unk> nm for electrons accelerated across a 100 @,@ 000 @-@ volt potential . The Transmission Electron <unk> @-@ Corrected Microscope is capable of sub @-@ 0 @.@ 05 nm resolution , which is more than enough to resolve individual atoms . This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging . However , electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain . 
 Two main types of electron microscopes exist : transmission and scanning . Transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors , with a beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge @-@ coupled device . Scanning electron microscopes <unk> a finely focused electron beam , as in a TV set , across the studied sample to produce the image . <unk> range from 100 × to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 × or higher for both microscope types . The scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface . 
 = = = Other applications = = = 
 In the free @-@ electron laser ( <unk> ) , a relativistic electron beam passes through a pair of <unk> that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions . The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency . <unk> can emit a coherent high @-@ brilliance electromagnetic radiation with a wide range of frequencies , from microwaves to soft X @-@ rays . These devices may find manufacturing , communication and various medical applications , such as soft tissue surgery . 
 Electrons are important in cathode ray tubes , which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments , computer monitors and television sets . In a photomultiplier tube , every photon striking the <unk> initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse . Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals , and they played a critical role in the development of electronics technology . However , they have been largely supplanted by solid @-@ state devices such as the transistor .

 A Weekend in the City is the second studio album by British indie rock band Bloc Party . It was recorded at Grouse Lodge Studios in Westmeath , Ireland , in mid @-@ 2006 and was produced by Jacknife Lee . The album was refined and mixed at several locations in London at the end of 2006 . It was released on 24 January 2007 in Japan and in the first week of February in the rest of the world , with Wichita Recordings as the primary label . The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and on the Irish Albums Chart . In the United States , it entered the Billboard 200 at number 12 . 
 Bloc Party worked to craft an album that distanced them from the conventional guitar band set @-@ up by incorporating more electronically processed beats and additional instrumentation . Computer programs were extensively used to enrich and amend recorded takes , while a string sextet was hired to perform on some of the tracks . The subject matter of frontman and chief lyricist Kele Okereke 's lyrics for A Weekend in the City covers issues such as drug use , sexuality , and terrorism . The album 's three original singles , " The Prayer " , " I Still Remember " , and " Hunting for Witches " , address these themes respectively . 
 Bloc Party 's new musical directions and more forthright lyrics either impressed or alienated critics . Reviewers generally treated A Weekend in the City as an important stepping stone for the band members in their quest for musical maturity , while The Guardian included it in its list of the " 1000 Albums To Hear Before You Die " . In November 2007 , the album was re @-@ released globally — with the final single , " Flux " , as a bonus track — to coincide with Bloc Party 's extensive touring schedule . 
 = = Origins = = 
 All band members of Bloc Party conceived A Weekend in the City during 2005 while on tour in support of their critically acclaimed debut album Silent Alarm . Despite missing their home city of London , the quartet became increasingly disillusioned with the culture in the area each time they sporadically returned . Band member Gordon Moakes has noted , " The contrast we saw between being away on tour and being home ... we would see that London wasn 't changing really and that the people we 'd grown up with were part of that . " Okereke wrote many songs in 2005 and early 2006 and used a concept he called " <unk> Relaxation " to expand upon the themes of life and leisure in the metropolis . The band recorded around 30 sound checks for the initial lyrics using a MiniDisc player . The rest of the tracks were written in April 2006 before they entered the studio recording process . 
 The band members drew up a shortlist of possible producers in early 2006 , which included dance music @-@ oriented staff such as Chemical Brothers sound engineer Steve Dub and high @-@ profile producers like Garret " Jacknife " Lee . At the time , Moakes told Rolling Stone that the album would hopefully include electronic , processed beats and a sound in the vein of alternative rock band Radiohead and indie rock ensemble TV on the Radio . Bloc Party wanted to expand their sonic palette without losing the musical " jerkiness " of Silent Alarm . They selected Lee — who had worked with world @-@ renowned act U2 and indie rock band Snow Patrol — based on the rapport that developed between the two parties while recording the demo song " I Still Remember " , which later appeared in A Weekend in the City . 
 Moakes has explained the choice of producer by stating that the band members were looking to work with someone who could help them craft an accomplished album , " although as much as anything it 's about finding someone who you 'd want to spend six weeks in an enclosed space with " . Before the studio sessions , Bloc Party listened to varied musical sources , from composers Philip Glass , György Ligeti , and Krzysztof Penderecki to urban artists Amerie and Missy Elliott . The band members were largely disillusioned with the evolution of contemporary guitar music and aimed to re @-@ create the highly stylised production values of R & B and hip @-@ hop records , while relying on an atmosphere similar to neo @-@ classical music . 
 = = Recording = = 
 In mid @-@ 2006 , Bloc Party travelled to Lee 's Grouse Lodge Studios in Westmeath , Ireland , to record A Weekend in the City . The band members initially worked by experimenting with their respective instruments and sound check arrangements . Moakes additionally focused on using different types of synthesiser . All parties soon moved to the main recording room , a large area with " a lot of natural ambience " according to sound engineer Tom McFall . A makeshift booth was built around the back of the drum kit to reduce any sonic interference , while a roof was sometimes used over drummer Matt Tong to isolate a pure sound . Different types of microphones were used for each component of the drum kit . The miking scheme was crucial to prepare the drum tracks for the looping and processing Lee planned using production program Logic . 
 The band worked by setting up all the instruments with only a single power amplifier . McFall has pointed out that distorted and heavily compressed mics were used to capture some of the room 's ambience " to add a bit of grit " to the instrumental tracks ; the recordings were often processed further using <unk> , special types of compressor noted for their distinctively aggressive sound . The production staff tried other unconventional effects once the basic tracks were recorded . The band sometimes performed while Tong 's kit was re @-@ amped and played sections live while a brick was placed on the sustain pedal of a piano to capture the vibrations during the performances . During the six weeks at Grouse Lodge , Bloc Party tried multiple versions of songs and , at times , attempted playing live alongside recorded versions of the same track . 
 Lee recorded everything using Digital Audio Workstation Pro Tools and treated the parts as individual stereo files in Logic . The drum and guitar tracks were processed using computers . Much of the synthesiser @-@ sounding parts of the album were generated by Russell Lissack 's lead guitar following his extensive use of pedal effects . Lee added the live string , synth , drum machine , sample , and ambient noise tracks to create an expansive , hyper @-@ stereophonic final product . After finishing the instrumental album , Bloc Party left Ireland to continue touring . Okereke later returned to Lee 's studio to add the vocal tracks to the album ; he has noted that he tried to " convey range and dynamics " rather than simply yelp the lyrics . Several track names were changed following the voice sessions : " Merge on the Freeway " became " Song for Clay ( Disappear Here ) " , " A Prayer to the Lord " was renamed " The Prayer " , " Wet " became " On " , and " Perfect Teens " was renamed " Where Is Home ? " .

 Bloc Party confirmed a preliminary track list of 13 songs in August 2006 ; this included future bonus tracks " England " and " We Were Lovers " . A low @-@ quality rip of A Weekend in the City was leaked in November and showed a track list of 11 songs . Wichita Recordings did not comment , but the band members were quoted as being worried about a reduction in the potential impact of the album 's content and sales . Bloc Party started a promotional tour of North America the same month with Panic ! at the Disco , but cut it short after three concerts when Tong suffered a collapsed lung . The focus was changed to interviews throughout the world to explain the album 's stylised lyrics and composition in the run @-@ up to its release . 
 Final tweaks on the album were completed in December 2006 in London . A high @-@ quality version was leaked in January 2007 and its contents were confirmed by Okereke . Journalists who obtained an official copy of the album 's final mix suggested that it featured electronically tampered rock soundscapes in the vein of Radiohead , New Order , and Björk . Bloc Party previewed A Weekend in the City in its entirety on 24 January 2007 at the Bournemouth Old <unk> , a performance which coincided with the Japanese release of the album . The first single , " The Prayer " , was released on 29 January . The band performed at a special BBC Radio 1 showcase at Maida Vale Studios on 30 January as a precursor to a February promotional tour of the UK . 
 The album was released in the rest of the world in the first week of February . The title comes as a tangent to the central theme of the album , " the living noise of a metropolis " . The cover art is part of A Modern Project by German photographer Rut <unk> Luxemburg , famous for her night cityscapes of London and for the cover art of The Streets ' Original Pirate Material . The photograph is an aerial image of London 's Westway , which shows the road and the adjacent sports pitches lit by the sodium glow of street lamps , and was chosen because the band believed " it was important we captured London breathing " . Luxemburg has explained that " in this picture you can see how intricately and optimistically public space in the city is shared " .

 = = = Lyrics = = = 
 Okereke 's lyrics attempt to juxtapose the monotonous events — nights out on club dancefloors and waiting for a train — with the seemingly epic experiences — terrorist attacks and racial angst — witnessed in a city environment . The direct narrative approach divided reviewers . BBC 's Tom Young concluded , " Some will appreciate Kele 's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives ... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as ... lines about sudoku to take Okereke 's grumbles into consideration . " Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm ; he used The Smiths as inspiration to try to make a personal album with " a real centre " . The lyricist has noted , " I wanted it to be a snapshot , a frozen moment in time . Like in a city , with thousands of stories going on at once , layered on top of each other ... Although I might be speaking through the voice of a character , I 'm still expressing , perhaps , my sentiments . " 
 The words to " Where Is Home ? " begin at the funeral of Christopher <unk> , a black teenager stabbed to death in Kent in April 2006 in a racially motivated attack . Okereke has described him as a " cousin " due to their Nigerian mothers ' close friendship . The track castigates right @-@ wing newspapers for perpetuating a hysterical fear of black youths in hoodies , an action which often leads to opportunities being denied to the Black British community at large . Populist media is also the target of " Hunting for Witches " ( with the right @-@ wing tabloid Daily Mail being singled out for criticism ) , whose subject matter is terrorism , namely the 7 July 2005 London bombings . Okereke has stated , " I guess the point about the song for me is post @-@ September 11th , the media has really traded on fear and the use of fear in controlling people . " Two songs , " Kreuzberg " and " I Still Remember " , explore sexuality and homosexuality ; the former is an account of promiscuity in the Berlin area of the same name , while the latter details an unrequited crush of a boy for his schoolmate . 
 The leading track , " Song for Clay ( Disappear Here ) " , was inspired by Less Than Zero , a novel by Bret Easton Ellis which depicts excessive hedonism and its effects on individuals . The song title references the protagonist Clay and a billboard in the book which displays the phrase " Disappear Here " , while the action is relocated to Les Trois Garçons restaurant in Shoreditch , East London . " Waiting for the 7 @.@ 18 " provides an escapist counterpoint by mentioning a trip to Brighton following disillusionment with working life in the capital . The fifth song on A Weekend in the City , " Uniform " , references London again and criticises the youth subculture in the area . It is directly inspired by Douglas <unk> 's Merchants of Cool documentary , which details the corporate exploitation of popular culture by advertisement companies . 
 Okereke read Guy Debord 's The Society of the Spectacle and Henri Lefebvre 's Critique of Everyday Life , works which analyse how people experience leisure in modern societies , and was inspired to pen several songs which detail the drug and drink culture present in a metropolis . " The Prayer " is based on drug use during nights out in clubs , while " On " specifies the effects and after @-@ effects of cocaine . Okereke tried to treat the tracks as explanations of people 's actions , rather than moralising tales ; he has stated , " In a time when so many people feel they can 't communicate or feel hemmed in , I can see the appeal of cocaine . " " Sunday " details the morning @-@ after hangover following a drunken and promiscuous night out , while " SRXT " takes the form of a suicide note following the loneliness and despair of hedonism in the metropolis . The album closer is named after <unk> , a trade name for the antidepressant paroxetine , and was crafted following the suicide attempts of two of Okereke 's friends after they left university in 2005 . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 A Weekend in the City is largely built around a mix of distorted and layered guitars , electronic elements , and multilayered vocals . The creation of compositions required a high level of technical proficiency and led to songs " tinged with discord " . The opening section of " Song for Clay ( Disappear Here ) " includes a bare falsetto , while " Hunting for Witches " starts with a John Cage @-@ like collage of spliced voices from random radio broadcasts as its main rhythm . The rest of the second track makes extensive use of guitar pedal effects and includes a heavily distorted riff . Moakes has pointed out that the original sound check of " Waiting for the 7 @.@ 18 " was a ballad with a simple rhythmic pattern on the glockenspiel before the band members added a drum and bass section to its second half . " Kreuzberg " , " I Still Remember " , and " Sunday " are the few songs to provide a counterpoint to the musical manipulation on the rest of the album by having more conventional indie rock arrangements ; Moakes has called the compositions " lush , without being too syrupy " . 
 In A Weekend in the City , layered vocals are often used to resemble choral sections , for example in the middle of " The Prayer " and throughout " Uniform " , which has over 100 stacked vocal tracks . " SRXT " is a chiming ballad directly inspired by Brian Eno 's " By This River " and incorporates double @-@ tracked lead and background vocals . Synthetic aspects — drum machines , synths , and computer glitches — were included as integral parts of compositions . " The Prayer " is built around a computer sample and includes MTV Base @-@ inspired urban contemporary beats and a prominent guitar solo towards the end . " On " is also a computer @-@ reworked live take . Half of the song was recorded as a series of loops of drum beats and bass guitar chords . The recorded take was split in two to make up the first and last quarters of the track , while the middle section was intentionally left blank for the band to improvise in . " On " is one of two songs , together with " Where Is Home ? " , to use a string sextet . The latter track includes erratic rhythms and clashing guitars .

 A Weekend in the City was a commercial success and entered the UK Albums Chart , the Irish Albums Chart , and the Australian Albums Chart at number two . The album was listed at number 56 on the end @-@ of @-@ year UK Albums Chart for 2007 and was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry . In the US , it sold 47 @,@ 726 copies in its first week of release and entered the Billboard 200 at number twelve , a marked improvement on predecessor Silent Alarm which had only made number 114 when it was released in 2005 . The album also topped the Billboard Top Independent Albums . According to Nielsen SoundScan , it had sold 148 @,@ 000 copies in the US by August 2008 . More than one million copies have been sold worldwide .

 Media response to A Weekend in the City was mixed , but generally positive ; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 65 % based on 30 critical reviews . Louis Pattison of NME described the album as " tender and reflective , edgy and embittered ; a difficult and emotional beast that jolts with nervous electricity " and pointed out that its notable achievement is that it finds moments of genuine contentment amidst " a maelstrom of anger and confusion " . Allmusic 's Heather Phares did not find the album as immediate as Bloc Party 's earlier work , but noted that " its gradual move from alienation to connection and hope is just as bold as Silent Alarm , and possibly even more resonant " . Drowned in Sound 's Mike Diver called it " dirty , dishevelled , unsure and paranoid ; fearful , easily distracted , boisterous and ashamed ; reckless , wild , nervous and terrified ; graceful , thought @-@ provoking , clumsy and contradictory ... and very nearly perfect . " Jeff Miller of the Chicago Tribune concluded , " For Bloc Party , Silent Alarm was a baby step and this is a giant leap . " 
 Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly was less receptive and stated , " Too often , the music on A Weekend in the City is less memorable than the ambitious subject matter . " Robert Christgau , reviewing for Rolling Stone , suggested that the album fails because it lacks " killer choruses " , while Sia Michel of The New York Times wrote that the multitracked vocals and baroque effects do not have " the wiry catchiness " of Bloc Party 's previous work . Mike Schiller of PopMatters commented that the sonic direction the band had moved to was unsuited to the members ' musical strengths . The Guardian included A Weekend in the City in its " 1000 Albums To Hear Before You Die " list compiled in November 2007 and praised the band 's " ambitious indie soundscapes packing a sizeable political punch " . The album was named by Los Angeles Times in its unnumbered shortlist of the best releases of 2007 . It figured in several other end @-@ of @-@ year best album lists , notably , at number eight by Gigwise , at number nine by Hot Press , and at number ten by The A.V. Club .

 = American Civil Liberties Union = 
 The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) is a nonpartisan , non @-@ profit organization whose stated mission is " to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States . " It works through litigation , lobbying , and community empowerment . Founded in 1920 by Roger Baldwin , Crystal Eastman , Walter Nelles , Morris Ernst , Albert <unk> , Arthur Garfield Hays , Jane Addams , Felix Frankfurter , and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , the ACLU has over 500 @,@ 000 members and has an annual budget of over $ 100 million . Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in all 50 states and Puerto Rico . The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers civil liberties to be at risk . Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation , or preparation of amicus curiae briefs expressing legal arguments ( when another law firm is already providing representation ) . 
 When the ACLU was founded in 1920 , its focus was on freedom of speech , primarily for anti @-@ war protesters . During the 1920s , the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers , and working with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) to decrease racism and discrimination . During the 1930s , the ACLU started to engage in work combating police misconduct and for Native American rights . Most of the ACLU 's cases came from the Communist party and Jehovah 's Witnesses . In 1940 , the ACLU leadership was caught up in the Red Scare , and voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions . During World War II , the ACLU defended Japanese @-@ American citizens , unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps . During the Cold War , the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti @-@ communists , but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party . 
 By 1964 , membership had risen to 80 @,@ 000 , and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties . In the 1960s , the ACLU continued its decades @-@ long effort to enforce separation of church and state . It defended several anti @-@ war activists during the Vietnam War . The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case , which addressed misconduct by police during interrogations ; and in the New York Times case , which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities . In the 1970s and 1980s , the ACLU ventured into new legal areas , defending homosexuals , students , prisoners , and the poor . In the twenty @-@ first century , the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti @-@ terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties . 
 In addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits , the ACLU lobbies for policies that have been established by its board of directors . Current positions of the ACLU include : opposing the death penalty ; supporting same @-@ sex marriage and the right of gays to adopt ; supporting birth control and abortion rights ; eliminating discrimination against women , minorities , and LGBT people ; supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture ; and opposing government preference for religion over non @-@ religion , or for particular faiths over others . 
 Legally , the ACLU consists of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations : the American Civil Liberties Union , a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) social welfare group , and the ACLU Foundation , a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) public charity . Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation , advocacy , and education , but only donations to the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) foundation are tax deductible , and only the 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) group can engage in unlimited political lobbying . The two organizations share office space and employees . 
 = = Organization = = 
 = = = Leadership = = = 
 The ACLU is led by a president and an executive director , Susan N. Herman and Anthony Romero , respectively , in 2015 . The president acts as chairman of the ACLU 's board of directors , leads fundraising , and facilitates policy @-@ setting . The executive director manages the day @-@ to @-@ day operations of the organization . The board of directors consists of 80 persons , including representatives from each state affiliate , as well as at @-@ large delegates . The organization has its headquarters in 125 Broad Street , a 40 @-@ story skyscraper located in Lower Manhattan , New York City . 
 The leadership of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions ; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates . In 1937 , an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford 's right to distribute anti @-@ union literature . In 1939 , a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles . During the early 1950s the board was divided on whether to defend communists persecuted under McCarthyism . In 1968 , a schism formed over whether to represent Dr. Spock 's anti @-@ war activism . In 1973 , there was internal conflict over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon . In 2005 , there was internal conflict about whether or not a gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes . 
 = = = Funding = = = 
 In the year ending March 31 , 2014 , the ACLU and the ACLU Foundation had a combined income from support and revenue of $ 100 @.@ 4 million , originating from grants ( 50 @.@ 0 % ) , membership donations ( 25 @.@ 4 % ) , donated legal services ( 7 @.@ 6 % ) , bequests ( 16 @.@ 2 % ) , and revenue ( .9 % ) . Membership dues are treated as donations ; members choose the amount they pay annually , averaging approximately $ 50 per member per year . In the year ending March 31 , 2014 , the combined expenses of the ACLU and ACLU Foundation were $ 133 @.@ 4 million , spent on programs ( 86 @.@ 2 % ) , management ( 7 @.@ 4 % ) , and fundraising ( 8 @.@ 2 % ) . ( After factoring in other changes in net assets of + $ 30 @.@ 9 million , from sources such as investment income , the organization had an overall decrease in net assets of $ 2 @.@ 1 million . ) Over the period from 2011 to 2014 the ACLU Foundation , on the average , has accounted for roughly 70 % of the combined budget , and the ACLU roughly 30 % . 
 The ACLU solicits donations to its charitable foundation . The ACLU is accredited by the Better Business Bureau , and the Charity Navigator has ranked the ACLU with a four @-@ star rating . The local affiliates solicit their own funding ; however , some also receive funds from the national ACLU , with the distribution and amount of such assistance varying from state to state . At its discretion , the national organization provides subsidies to smaller affiliates that lack sufficient resources to be self @-@ sustaining ; for example , the Wyoming ACLU chapter received such subsidies until April 2015 , when , as part of a round of layoffs at the national ACLU , the Wyoming office was closed . 
 In October 2004 , the ACLU rejected $ 1 @.@ 5 million from both the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation because the Foundations had adopted language from the USA PATRIOT Act in their donation agreements , including a clause stipulating that none of the money would go to " underwriting terrorism or other unacceptable activities . " The ACLU views this clause , both in Federal law and in the donors ' agreements , as a threat to civil liberties , saying it is overly broad and ambiguous . 
 Due to the nature of its legal work , the ACLU is often involved in litigation against governmental bodies , which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments ; a town , state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently , but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver . In some cases , the law permits plaintiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect money damages or other monetary relief . In particular , the Civil Rights Attorney 's Fees Award Act of 1976 leaves the government liable in some civil rights cases . Fee awards under this civil rights statute are considered " equitable relief " rather than damages , and government entities are not immune from equitable relief . Under laws such as this , the ACLU and its state affiliates sometimes share in monetary judgments against government agencies . In 2006 , the Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act sought to prevent monetary judgments in the particular case of violations of church @-@ state separation . 
 The ACLU has received court awarded fees from opponents , for example , the Georgia affiliate was awarded $ 150 @,@ 000 in fees after suing a county demanding the removal of a Ten Commandments display from its courthouse ; a second Ten Commandments case in the State , in a different county , led to a $ 74 @,@ 462 judgment . The State of Tennessee was required to pay $ 50 @,@ 000 , the State of Alabama $ 175 @,@ 000 , and the State of Kentucky $ 121 @,@ 500 , in similar Ten Commandments cases . 
 = = = State affiliates = = = 
 Most of the organization 's workload is performed by the 54 local affiliates . There is an affiliate in each state , in Washington , D.C. and in Puerto Rico . California has three affiliates . The affiliates operate autonomously from the national organization ; each affiliate has its own staff , executive director , board of directors , and budget . Each affiliate consists of two non @-@ profit corporations : a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) corporation that does not perform lobbying , and a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) corporation which is entitled to lobby . 
 ACLU affiliates are the basic unit of the ACLU 's organization and engage in litigation , lobbying , and public education . For example , in a twenty @-@ month period beginning January 2004 , the ACLU 's New Jersey chapter was involved in fifty @-@ one cases according to their annual report — thirty @-@ five cases in state courts , and sixteen in federal court . They provided legal representation in thirty @-@ three of those cases , and served as amicus in the remaining eighteen . They listed forty @-@ four volunteer attorneys who assisted them in those cases .

 = = = Support and opposition = = = 
 The ACLU is supported by a variety of persons and organizations . There were over 500 @,@ 000 members in 2011 , and the ACLU annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations . Allies of the ACLU in legal actions have included the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , the American Jewish Congress , People For the American Way , the National Rifle Association , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Americans United for Separation of Church and State , and the National Organization for Women . 
 The ACLU has been criticized by liberals , such as when it excluded communists from its leadership ranks , when it defended Neo @-@ Nazis , when it declined to defend Paul Robeson , or when it opposed the passage of the National Labor Relations Act . Conversely , it has been criticized by conservatives , such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools , or when it opposed the Patriot Act . The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as Rush Limbaugh , George Wallace , Henry Ford , and Oliver North ; and it has supported liberal figures such as Dick Gregory , H. L. Mencken , Rockwell Kent , and Dr. Benjamin Spock . 
 A major source of criticism are legal cases in which the ACLU represents an individual or organization that promotes offensive or unpopular viewpoints , such as the Ku Klux Klan , Neo @-@ Nazis , Nation of Islam , North American Man / Boy Love Association , or Westboro Baptist Church . The ACLU responded to these criticisms by stating " It is easy to defend freedom of speech when the message is something many people find at least reasonable . But the defense of freedom of speech is most critical when the message is one most people find repulsive . " 
 = = Early years = = 
 = = = CLB era = = = 
 The ACLU developed from the National Civil Liberties Bureau ( CLB ) , co @-@ founded in 1917 during the Great War by Crystal Eastman , an attorney activist , and Roger Nash Baldwin . The focus of the CLB was on freedom of speech , primarily anti @-@ war speech , and on supporting conscientious objectors who did not want to serve in World War I. 
 Three United States Supreme Court decisions in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against certain kinds of anti @-@ war speech . In 1919 , the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti @-@ war literature . In Debs v. United States , the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs . While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle : he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right , which should rarely be restricted . 
 In 1918 Crystal Eastman resigned from the organization due to health issues . After assuming sole leadership of the CLB , Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized . He wanted to change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education . 
 The CLB directors concurred , and on January 19 , 1920 , they formed an organization under a new name , the American Civil Liberties Union . Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights , such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) and Anti @-@ Defamation League ( ADL ) , the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons , or a single theme . Like the CLB , the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights , including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century . 
 During the first decades of the ACLU , Baldwin continued as its leader . His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks . Baldwin was ascetic , wearing hand @-@ me @-@ down clothes , pinching pennies , and living on a very small salary . The ACLU was directed by an executive committee , but it was not particularly democratic or egalitarian . The ACLU 's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state . Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies , such as the Garland Fund . 
 = = = Free speech era = = = 
 In the 1920s , government censorship was commonplace . Magazines were routinely confiscated under the anti @-@ obscenity Comstock laws ; permits for labor rallies were often denied ; and virtually all anti @-@ war or anti @-@ government literature was outlawed . Right @-@ wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power , and activists that promoted unionization , socialism , or government reform were often denounced as un @-@ American or unpatriotic . In one typical instance in 1923 , author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally . 
 ACLU leadership was divided on how to challenge the civil rights violations . One faction , including Baldwin , Arthur Garfield Hays and Norman Thomas , believed that direct , militant action was the best path . Hays was the first of many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU . Another group , including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change . Both groups worked in tandem , but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution . 
 During the 1920s , the ACLU 's primary focus was on freedom of speech in general , and speech within the labor movement particularly . Because most of the ACLU 's efforts were associated with the labor movement , the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups , such as the American Legion , the National Civic Federation , and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies . 
 In addition to labor , the ACLU also led efforts in non @-@ labor arenas , for example , promoting free speech in public schools . The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York public schools in 1921 . The ACLU , working with the NAACP , also supported racial discrimination cases . The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused . For example , the reactionary , anti @-@ Catholic , anti @-@ black Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts , but the ACLU defended the KKK 's right to hold meetings in 1923 . There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not make an effort to defend in the 1920s , including censorship of the arts , government search and seizure issues , right to privacy , or wiretapping . 
 The Communist party of the United States was routinely harassed and oppressed by government officials , leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU . The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics , often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct , and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU . Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU , particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives . This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades . 
 = = = Scopes trial = = = 
 When 1925 arrived – five years after the ACLU was formed – the organization had virtually no success to show for its efforts . That changed in 1925 , when the ACLU persuaded John T. Scopes to defy Tennessee 's anti @-@ evolution law in a court test . Clarence Darrow , a member of the ACLU National Committee , headed Scopes ' legal team . The prosecution , led by William Jennings Bryan , contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching creationism in school . The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $ 100 . The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality . 
 The Scopes trial was a phenomenal public relations success for the ACLU . The ACLU became well known across America , and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major U.S. newspaper . The ACLU continued to fight for the separation of church and state in schoolrooms , decade after decade , including the 1982 case McLean v. Arkansas and the 2005 case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District . 
 Baldwin himself was involved in an important free speech victory of the 1920s , after he was arrested for attempting to speak at a rally of striking mill workers in New Jersey . Although the decision was limited to the state of New Jersey , the appeals court 's judgement in 1928 declared that constitutional guarantees of free speech must be given " liberal and comprehensive construction " , and it marked a major turning point in the civil rights movement , signaling the shift of judicial opinion in favor of civil rights . 
 The most important ACLU case of the 1920s was Gitlow v. New York , in which Benjamin Gitlow was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence , when he distributed literature promoting communism . Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow 's conviction , it adopted the ACLU 's stance ( later termed the incorporation doctrine ) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws , as well as federal laws . 
 = = = First victories = = = 
 Leaders of the ACLU were divided on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties . Felix Frankfurter felt that legislation was the best long @-@ term solution , because the Supreme Court could not ( and – in his opinion – should not ) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights . But Walter Pollack , Morris Ernst , and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties . A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere ; anti @-@ radical emotions were diminishing , and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions . 
 = = = Free speech = = = 
 Censorship was commonplace in the early 20th century . State laws and city ordinances routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive , and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization . Starting in 1926 , the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature . In that year , H. L. Mencken deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned American Mercury magazine ; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal . The ACLU went on to win additional victories , including the landmark case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses in 1933 , which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book Ulysses by James Joyce . The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years , and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the Roth v. United States and Memoirs v. Massachusetts cases . 
 The Comstock laws banned distribution of sex education information , based on the premise that it was obscene and led to promiscuous behavior Mary Ware Dennett was fined $ 300 in 1928 , for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material . The ACLU , led by Morris Ernst , appealed her conviction and won a reversal , in which judge Learned Hand ruled that the pamphlet 's main purpose was to " promote understanding " . 
 The success prompted the ACLU to broaden their freedom of speech efforts beyond labor and political speech , to encompass movies , press , radio and literature . The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in 1931 to coordinate this effort . By the early 1930s , censorship in the United States was diminishing . 
 Two major victories in the 1930s cemented the <unk> campaign to promote free speech . In Stromberg v. California , decided in 1931 , the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed the right of a communist party member to salute a communist flag . The result was the first time the Supreme Court used the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment to subject states to the requirements of the First Amendment . In Near v. Minnesota , also decided in 1931 , the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise prior restraint and prevent a newspaper from publishing , simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous . 
 = = 1930s = = 
 The late 1930s saw the emergence of a new era of tolerance in the United States . National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights , particularly as it protected minorities , as the essence of democracy . The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause . Even conservative elements , such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties , which were long considered to be the domain of left @-@ leaning organizations . By 1940 , the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s , and many of its policies were the law of the land . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 In 1929 , after the Scopes and Dennett victories , Baldwin perceived that there was vast , untapped support for civil liberties in the United States . Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU , focusing on police brutality , Native American rights , African American rights , censorship in the arts , and international civil liberties . The board of directors approved Baldwin 's expansion plan , except for the international efforts . 
 The ACLU played a major role in passing the 1932 Norris – La Guardia Act , a federal law which prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions , and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes , unions , and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions . The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct ( such as extracting false confessions ) within police departments , by publishing the report <unk> in Law Enforcement in 1931 , under the auspices of Herbert Hoover 's Wickersham Commission . In 1934 , the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act , which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes , and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children . 
 Although the ACLU deferred to the NAACP for litigation promoting civil liberties for African Americans , the ACLU did engage in educational efforts , and published Black Justice in 1931 , a report which documented institutional racism throughout the South , including lack of voting rights , segregation , and discrimination in the justice system . Funded by the Garland Fund , the ACLU also participated in producing the influential <unk> Report , which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks . The ACLU 's plan was to demonstrate that the " separate but equal " policies governing the Southern discrimination were illegal because blacks were never , in fact , treated equally . 
 = = = Depression era and the New Deal = = = 
 In 1932 – twelve years after the ACLU was founded – it had achieved significant success ; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU , and the general public was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general . But the Great Depression brought new assaults on civil liberties ; the year 1930 saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions , a doubling of the number of lynchings , and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia . 
 The Franklin D. Roosevelt administration proposed the New Deal to combat the depression . ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal , since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs , and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti @-@ trust legislation . Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights , but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions , including Interior Secretary Harold Ickes , a member of the ACLU . 
 The economic policies of the New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals , but social goals were not . In particular , movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene . Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned ; as was Life magazine 's April 11 , 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process . The ACLU fought these bans , but did not prevail . 
 The Catholic Church attained increasing political influence in the 1930s , and used its influence to promote censorship of movies , and to discourage publication of birth control information . This conflict between the ACLU and the Catholic Church led to the resignation of the last Catholic priest from ACLU leadership in 1934 ; a Catholic priest would not be represented there again until the 1970s . 
 The ACLU took no official position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's 1937 court @-@ packing plan , which threatened to increase the number of Supreme Court justices , unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation . The Supreme Court responded by making a major shift in policy , and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs , and also began to take a more active role in protecting civil liberties . 
 The first decision that marked the court 's new direction was De Jonge v. Oregon , in which a communist labor organizer was arrested for calling a meeting to discuss unionization . The ACLU attorney Osmond Fraenkel , working with International Labor Defense , defended De Jonge in 1937 , and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that " peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime . " The De Jonge case marked the start of an era lasting for a dozen years , during which Roosevelt appointees ( led by Hugo Black , William O. Douglas , and Frank Murphy ) established a body of civil liberties law . In 1938 , Justice Harlan F. Stone wrote the famous " footnote four " in United States v. <unk> Products Co. in which he suggested that state laws which impede civil liberties would – henceforth – require compelling justification . 
 Senator Robert F. Wagner proposed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 , which empowered workers to unionize . Ironically , the ACLU , after 15 years of fighting for workers ' rights , initially opposed the act ( it later took no stand on the legislation ) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government . The newly formed National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) posed a dilemma for the ACLU , because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford , prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti @-@ union literature . Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor , and that faction supported the NLRB 's action . But part of the ACLU supported Ford 's right to free speech . ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise ( supporting the auto workers union , yet also endorsing Ford 's right to express personal opinions ) , but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent in the years to come . 
 The ACLU 's support of the NLRB was a major development for the ACLU , because it marked the first time it accepted that a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties . Until 1937 , the ACLU felt that civil rights were best upheld by citizens and private organizations . 
 Some factions in the ACLU proposed new directions for the organization . In the late 1930s , some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions , to becoming a legal aid society , centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods . The ACLU directors rejected that proposal . Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena , and to be more willing to compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians . This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership . 
 = = = Jehovah 's Witnesses = = = 
 The ACLU 's support of defendants with unpopular , sometimes extreme , viewpoints have produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties . One such defendant was the Jehovah 's Witnesses , who were involved in a large number of Supreme Court cases . Cases that the ACLU supported included Lovell v. City of Griffin ( which struck down a city ordinance that required a permit before a person could distribute " literature of any kind " ) ; Martin v. Struthers ( which struck down an ordinance prohibiting door @-@ to @-@ door canvassing ) ; and Cantwell v. Connecticut ( which reversed the conviction of a Witness who was reciting offensive speech on a street corner ) . 
 The most important cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes . The Jehovah 's Witnesses felt that saluting a flag was contrary to their religious beliefs . Two children were convicted in 1938 of not saluting the flag . The ACLU supported their appeal to the Supreme Court , but the court affirmed the conviction , in 1940 . But three years later , in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette , the Supreme court reversed itself and wrote " If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation , it is that no official , high or petty , can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein . " To underscore its decision , the Supreme Court announced it on Flag Day . 
 = = = Communism and totalitarianism = = = 
 The rise of totalitarianism in Germany , Russia , and Italy during World War II had a tremendous impact on the civil liberties movement . On the one hand , the oppression of the totalitarian states put into sharp relief the virtue of freedom of speech and association in the United States ; on the other hand , they prompted an anti @-@ communist hysteria in America which eroded many civil liberties . 
 The ACLU leadership was divided over whether or not to defend pro @-@ Nazi speech in the United States ; pro @-@ labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism , and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis . Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups . The first person arrested under New Jersey 's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah 's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti @-@ Catholic literature . The ACLU defended the Jehovah 's Witnesses , and the charges were dropped . The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro @-@ Nazi groups , defending their rights to free speech and free association . 
 In the late 1930s , the ACLU allied itself with the Popular Front , a coalition of liberal organizations coordinated by the United States Communist Party . The ACLU benefited because affiliates from the Popular Front could often fight local civil rights battles much more effectively than the New York @-@ based ACLU . The association with the Communist Party led to accusations that the ACLU was a " communist front " , particularly because Harry F. Ward was both chairman of the ACLU and chairman of the American League Against War and Fascism , a communist organization . 
 The House <unk> Activities Committee ( HUAC ) was created in 1938 to uncover sedition and treason within the United States . When witnesses testified at its hearings , the ACLU was mentioned several times , leading the HUAC to mention the ACLU prominently in its 1939 report . This damaged the ACLU 's reputation severely , even though the report said that it could not " definitely state whether or not " the ACLU was a communist organization . 
 While the ACLU rushed to defend its image against allegations of being a communist front , it also worked to protect witnesses who were being harassed by the HUAC . The ACLU was one of the few organizations to protest ( unsuccessfully ) against passage of the Smith Act in 1940 , which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism . The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act , including labor leader Harry Bridges . 
 ACLU leadership was split on whether to purge its leadership of communists . Norman Thomas , John Haynes Holmes , and Morris Ernst were anti @-@ communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from communism ; opposing them were Harry Ward , Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership . A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939 , and the anti @-@ communists prevailed in February 1940 , when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles . Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned , and – following a contentious six @-@ hour debate – Elizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU 's board . The 1940 resolution was a disaster for the ACLU , and considered by many to be a betrayal of its fundamental principles . The resolution was rescinded in 1968 , and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970 . 
 = = Mid @-@ century = = 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 When World War II engulfed the United States , the Bill of Rights was enshrined as a hallowed document , and numerous organizations defended civil liberties . Chicago and New York proclaimed " Civil Rights " weeks , and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced a national Bill of Rights day . Eleanor Roosevelt was the keynote speaker at the 1939 ACLU convention . In spite of this newfound respect for civil rights , Americans were becoming adamantly anti @-@ communist , and believed that excluding communists from American society was an essential step to preserve democracy . 
 Contrasted with World War I , there was relatively little violation of civil liberties during World War II . President Roosevelt was a strong supporter of civil liberties , but – more importantly – there were few anti @-@ war activists during World War II . The most significant exception was the internment of Japanese Americans . Two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Roosevelt authorized the creation of military " exclusion zones " with Executive Order 9066 , paving the way for the detention of all West Coast Japanese Americans in inland camps . In addition to the non @-@ citizen Issei ( prohibited from naturalization as members of an " <unk> " race ) , over two @-@ thirds of those swept up were American @-@ born citizens . The ACLU immediately protested to Roosevelt , comparing the evacuations to Nazi concentration camps . The ACLU was the only major organization to object to the internment plan , and their position was very unpopular , even within the organization . Not all ACLU leaders wanted to defend the Japanese Americans ; Roosevelt loyalists such as Morris Ernst wanted to support Roosevelt 's war effort , but pacifists such as Baldwin and Norman Thomas felt that Japanese Americans needed access to due process before they could be imprisoned . In a March 20 , 1942 letter to Roosevelt , Baldwin called on the administration to allow Japanese Americans to prove their loyalty at individual hearings , describing the constitutionality of the planned removal " open to grave question . " His suggestions went nowhere , and opinions within the organization became increasingly divided as the Army began the " evacuation " of the West Coast . In May , the two factions , one pushing to fight the exclusion orders then being issued , the other advocating support for the President 's policy of removing citizens whose " presence may endanger national security , " brought their opposing resolutions to a vote before the board and the ACLU 's national leaders . They decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens , and on June 22 instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so . 
 The ACLU offices on the West Coast had been more directly involved in addressing the tide of anti @-@ Japanese prejudice from the start , as they were geographically closer to the issue , and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time . The Seattle office , assisting in Gordon Hirabayashi 's lawsuit , created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started , while in Los Angeles , attorney A.L. Wirin continued to represent Ernest <unk> Wakayama but without addressing the case 's constitutional questions . ( Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans . ) However , the San Francisco branch , led by Ernest Besig , refused to discontinue its support for Fred Korematsu , whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive , and attorney Wayne Collins , with Besig 's full support , centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu 's exclusion . 
 The West Coast offices had wanted a test case to take to court , but had a difficult time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU 's desired criteria of a sympathetic , Americanized plaintiff . Of the 120 @,@ 000 Japanese Americans affected by the order , only 12 disobeyed , and Korematsu , Hirabayashi , and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court . Hirabayashi v. United States came before the Court in May 1943 , and the justices upheld the government 's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast ; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi , the ACLU donated $ 1 @,@ 000 to the case ( over a third of the legal team 's total budget ) and submitted an amicus brief . Besig , dissatisfied with Osmond Fraenkel 's tamer defense , filed an additional amicus brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi 's constitutional rights . In the meantime , A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in Yasui v. United States ( decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case , and with the same results ) , but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office . The only case to receive a favorable ruling , ex parte Endo , was also aided by two amicus briefs from the ACLU , one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins . 
 Korematsu v. United States proved to be the most controversial of these cases , as Besig and Collins refused to bow to national pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government 's right to remove citizens from their homes . The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch 's national affiliation , while Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case . Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside Charles <unk> , although their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based in the unconstitutionality of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed . The case was decided in December 1944 , when the Court once again upheld the government 's right to relocate Japanese Americans , although Korematsu 's , Hirabayashi 's and Yasui 's convictions were later overturned in coram nobis proceedings in the 1980s . 
 Although the ACLU ( somewhat unevenly ) defended the Japanese Americans , it was more reluctant to defend anti @-@ war protesters . A majority of the board passed a resolution in 1942 which declared the ACLU unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the United States ' war effort . Included in this group were the thousands of Nisei who renounced their U.S. citizenship during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for " repatriation . " ( A significant number of those slated to " go back " to Japan had never actually been to the country and were in fact being deported rather than repatriated . ) Ernest Besig had in 1944 visited the Tule Lake Segregation Center , where the majority of these " <unk> " were concentrated , and subsequently enlisted Wayne Collins ' help to file a lawsuit on their behalf , arguing the renunciations had been given under duress . The national organization prohibited local branches from representing the <unk> , forcing Collins to pursue the case on his own , although Besig and the Northern California office provided some support . 
 When the war ended in 1945 , the ACLU was 25 years old , and had accumulated an impressive set of legal victories . President Harry S. Truman sent a congratulatory telegram to the ACLU on the occasion of their 25th anniversary . American attitudes had changed since World War I , and dissent by minorities was tolerated with more willingness . The Bill of Rights was more respected , and minority rights were becoming more commonly championed . During their 1945 annual conference , the ACLU leaders composed a list of important civil rights issues to focus on in the future , and the list included racial discrimination and separation of church and state . 
 The ACLU supported the African @-@ American defendants in Shelley v. Kraemer , when they tried to occupy a house they had purchased in a neighborhood which had racially restrictive housing covenants . The African @-@ American purchasers won the case in 1945 . 
 = = = Cold War era = = = 
 Anti @-@ communist sentiment gripped the United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946 . Federal investigations caused many persons with communist or left @-@ leaning affiliations to lose their jobs , become blacklisted , or be jailed . During the Cold War , although the United States collectively ignored the civil rights of communists , other civil liberties — such as due process in law and separation of church and state — continued to be reinforced and even expanded . 
 The ACLU was internally divided when it purged communists from its leadership in 1940 , and that ambivalence continued as it decided whether to defend alleged communists during the late 1940s . Some ACLU leaders were anti @-@ communist , and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims . Some ACLU leaders felt that communists were entitled to free speech protections , and the ACLU should defend them . Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about the threat posed by communists , and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes . This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954 , when the civil liberties faction prevailed , leading to the resignation of most of the anti @-@ communist leaders . 
 In 1947 , President Truman issued Executive Order <unk> , which created the Federal Loyalty Program . This program authorized the Attorney General to create a list of organizations which were deemed to be subversive . Any association with these programs was ground for barring the person from employment . Listed organizations were not notified that they were being considered for the list , nor did they have an opportunity to present counterarguments ; nor did the government divulge any factual basis for inclusion in the list . Although ACLU leadership was divided on whether to challenge the Federal Loyalty Program , some challenges were successfully made . 
 Also in 1947 , the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) subpoenaed ten Hollywood directors and writers , the Hollywood Ten , intending to ask them to identify Communists , but the witnesses refused to testify . All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress . The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists , but lost on appeal . The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings , and created a blacklist which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working . The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist , but those challenges failed . The ACLU was more successful with an education effort ; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged , prepared at the ACLU 's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress Jean Muir , described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process , and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism . 
 The federal government took direct aim at the U.S. communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial . The case hinged on whether or not mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government . The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants , and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison . Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt , went to prison and were disbarred . When the government indicted additional party members , the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them . Communists protested outside the courthouse ; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress , and the ACLU supported the anti @-@ picketing law . 
 The ACLU , in a change of heart , supported the party leaders during their appeal process . The Supreme Court upheld the convictions in the Dennis v. United States decision by softening the free speech requirements from a " clear and present danger " test , to a " grave and probable " test . The ACLU issued a public condemnation of the Dennis decision , and resolved to fight it . One reason for the Supreme Court 's support of cold war legislation was the 1949 deaths of Supreme Court justices Frank Murphy and Wiley Rutledge , leaving Hugo Black and William O. Douglas as the only remaining civil libertarians on the Court . 
 The Dennis decision paved the way for the prosecution of hundreds of other communist party members . The ACLU supported many of the communists during their appeals ( although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates , not the national headquarters ) but most convictions were upheld . The two California affiliates , in particular , felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough , and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did . 
 The ACLU also challenged many loyalty oath requirements across the country , but the courts upheld most of the loyalty oath laws . California ACLU affiliates successfully challenged the California state loyalty oath . The Supreme Court , until 1957 , upheld nearly every law which restricted the liberties of communists . 
 The ACLU , even though it scaled back its defense of communists during the Cold War , still came under heavy criticism as a " front " for communism . Critics included the American Legion , Senator Joseph McCarthy , the HUAC , and the FBI . Several ACLU leaders were sympathetic to the FBI , and as a consequence , the ACLU rarely investigated any of the many complaints alleging abuse of power by the FBI during the Cold War . 
 = = = Organizational change = = = 
 In 1950 , the ACLU board of directors asked executive director Baldwin to resign , feeling that he lacked the organizational skills to lead the 9 @,@ 000 ( and growing ) member organization . Baldwin objected , but a majority of the board elected to remove him from the position , and he was replaced by Patrick Murphy Malin . Under Malin 's guidance , membership tripled to 30 @,@ 000 by 1955 – the start of a 24 @-@ year period of continual growth leading to 275 @,@ 000 members in 1974 . Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates . 
 The ACLU , which had been controlled by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers , became more democratic in the 1950s . In 1951 , the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions . A bi @-@ annual conference , open to the entire membership , was instituted in the same year , and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members , who suggested new directions for the ACLU , including abortion rights , death penalty , and rights of the poor .
