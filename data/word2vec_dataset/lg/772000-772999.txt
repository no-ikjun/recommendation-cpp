 After her defeat , Bondfield returned to her NUGMW post . The TUC , suspicious of her perceived closeness to MacDonald , was cool towards her and she was not re @-@ elected to the General Council . She remained Labour 's candidate at Wallsend ; in the general election of 1935 she was again defeated . She never returned to parliament ; she was adopted as the prospective Labour candidate for Reading , but when it became obvious that the election due for 1940 would be delayed indefinitely by war , she resigned her candidacy . 
 In 1938 , after retiring from her NUGMW post , Bondfield founded the Women 's Group on Public Welfare . She studied labour conditions in the United States and Mexico during 1938 , and toured the US and Canada after the outbreak of war in 1939 , as a lecturer for the British Information Services . Her attitude towards the war was different from her semi @-@ pacifist stance of 1914 ; she actively supported the government and , in 1941 , published a booklet , Why Labour Fights . Her main wartime activity was leading an investigation by the Hygiene Committee of the Women 's Group on Public Welfare , into the problems that arose from the large @-@ scale evacuation into the countryside of city children . The group 's findings were published in 1943 , as Our Towns : a Close @-@ up ; the report gave many people their first understanding of the extent of inner @-@ city poverty . Suggested solutions included nursery education , a minimum wage , child allowances and a national health service . The report was reprinted several times , and was instrumental in developing support for the social reforms introduced by the Labour government that took office in 1945 . Among Bondfield 's other wartime activities , in 1944 she helped to launch a national drive for the appointment of more women police officers . 
 = = Last years , retirement and death = = 
 Although not a candidate herself , Bondfield campaigned for Labour in the general election of July 1945 — a reporter found her instructing a meeting in Bury St Edmunds on the benefits of nationalisation . She was active in her local Labour Party , and continued to chair the Women 's Group of Public Welfare until 1948 . Her main task in these years was her autobiography , published in 1948 under the title A Life 's Work . The purpose of the book , she wrote , was not to celebrate her own achievements , instead she hoped that her experiences " may be of some service to the younger generation " . The book had an indifferent reception ; in The Observer , Harold Nicolson described it as " ill composed and badly proportioned " , with too much space devoted to inconsequential meetings while truly important events were hurried over . Nevertheless , he thought the book provided " a fine example of resolute and in the end triumphant energy " . The Manchester Guardian 's reviewer also criticised the work 's confused structure and unselective detail , but found it " a useful , direct and honest " account of Labour 's early years . 
 Apart from her autobiography , Bondfield contributed to a collection of essays entitled What Life Has Taught Me , in which 25 public figures pondered on the lessons of life . Bondfield wrote that her religious convictions gave her " strength to meet defeat with a smile , to face success with a sense of responsibility ; to be willing to do one 's best without hope of reward [ and ] to bear misrepresentation without giving way to futile bitterness " . In March 1948 Bondfield opened the Mary Macarthur Home at Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde , near Blackpool in Lancashire , which provided subsidised holidays for low @-@ paid women workers . In 1949 she made a six @-@ month speaking tour of the United States , her final visit to the country ; she left convinced that America would soon adopt a national health service . 
 Bondfield , who never married , maintained her good health and interest in life until her final illness in 1953 . She moved to a nursing home in <unk> , Surrey , where she died aged 80 on 16 June 1953 . At her cremation in Golders Green Crematorium the congregation sang the popular hymn " To Be a Pilgrim " . The Labour Party was fully represented ; Clement Attlee , the leader of the party and former prime minister , gave the address . 
 = = Appraisal and legacy = = 
 In his biographical sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography , Philip Williamson depicts Bondfield as " physically short and stout ... with sparkling eyes , a firm , brisk manner , and effective , sometimes inspired , public speaking " . She had the self @-@ confidence to exist and thrive in a male @-@ dominated world , deriving inspiration from a childhood that , though materially impoverished , her obituarist has described as " of great spiritual and mental wealth " . She inherited a strong nonconformist faith , which became a key element throughout her later career , and retained her links with the Congregational Church throughout her life . After her death The Times praised her " unusually wide human sympathies ... her generous nature and real sense of humour " . Skidelsky , however , describes her unsympathetically as " a humourless and somewhat priggish person , with long black skirts and a voice that emitted a harsh cascade of sound " . 
 Bondfield 's career was punctuated by " firsts " , in union , parliament and government spheres . Her own view of these achievements was modest : " Some woman was bound to be first . That I should be was the accident of dates and events " . Her appointment as Minister of Labour propelled her into what was , in 1929 , the hardest job in the cabinet , and in common with other ministers , her lack of experience in government left her heavily dependent on her official advisers . By temperament a realist , she based her actions in government on economic facts rather on party or sectional interests ; thus she became " caught between the opposition claims that she was soft on the unemployed , and her own backbenchers ' jibe that she had abandoned the workers " . Her stance , and her seemingly equivocal attitude towards MacDonald 's apostasy , reduced her standing in her own party for decades , so that when Barbara Castle was appointed as Minister of Labour by Harold Wilson in 1968 , she insisted that the ministry 's name be changed to " Department of Employment " , for fear of association with Bondfield 's term in office . Castle refused to contribute a preface to Fabian Society booklet celebrating Bondfield 's life , because she considered her predecessor 's actions close to political betrayal . In 2001 , a speech by Tony Blair celebrating the Labour Party 's 100 years in parliament paid tributes to many heroes of the movement 's early years ; Bondfield 's name was not mentioned . 
 Bondfield was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Bristol , and in 1930 received the freedom of the borough from her home town of Chard , where in 2011 a plaque in her honour was fixed to the Guildhall wall . In 1948 she was appointed a Companion of Honour ( CH ) . Many years after her death , streets and apartment buildings were named after her in the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Barking ; she was further commemorated in her old constituency of Northampton when a hall of residence in the University of Northampton was named the Margaret Bondfield Hall . In 2014 a campaign began for a plaque on the shop in Church Street , Hove , where in 1886 – 67 Bondfield had served her apprenticeship . 
 To mark Bondfield 's centenary in 1973 , Linda Christmas in The Guardian reviewed the progress of women in parliament since the 1930s . By 1973 , Christmas reported , only 93 women had sat in parliament ; their contributions had overall " not been stunning " . Their best numerical representation at that point had been in the 1966 general election , when 29 women ( out of 630 MPs ) had been elected . The 1979 election saw this number fall to 19 , but also saw Margaret Thatcher become Britain 's first woman prime minister . Cox and Hobley draw attention to Thatcher 's early life as a shopkeeper 's daughter , and contrast her account of those days with Bondfield 's experiences half a century earlier . Thatcher believed that the concept of service to the customer was absolute ; thus , Cox and Hobley assert , she would have had little sympathy for Bondfield 's campaigns to better shopworkers ' conditions . Despite the changes that have taken place in the retail industry since Bondfield 's day , Cox and Hobley believe that , were she alive , " she 'd still be <unk> at the bit , trying to coax shop assistants to join a union , and fiercely championing shopworkers ' rights to better pay and conditions " .

 = Strang School District No. 36 = 
 Strang School District No. 36 , or the Strang Public School , is a historic school located in Fillmore County , Nebraska , in the village of Strang . The school is one of the two sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the village of Strang . The school building is a small , two @-@ story , brick public schoolhouse , which was built to replace the schoolhouse that was previously located on that site . The schoolhouse was built between 1929 and 1930 , and replaced the previous schoolhouse , which burned down in 1928 . The schoolhouse still retains all original building materials . The school served high school students from 1930 to 1951 , and still functions as a school today , serving grades K – 8 . The NRHP listing also includes a flagpole located outside the schoolhouse , and five pieces of playground equipment . 
 = = History and education = = 
 In October 1928 a fire destroyed the small school that had previously been located in Strang . Classes were held in two local churches and the Belle Prairie Township Hall for the remainder of that year , while the townspeople held a series of meetings to discuss the construction of a new schoolhouse . Later in 1928 , plans for the new schoolhouse were drawn up and approved , and construction on the new Strang Public School began in 1929 . The majority of the people that worked on constructing the school were local townspeople . The first classes in the new school were held in February 1930 . The schoolhouse was constructed in a " fireproof " fashion , as to prevent another accident . The new schoolhouse was constructed to hold students from first through twelfth grades , from Strang and the surrounding communities . Primary students attending classes were located on the second floor and secondary students classes were held on the first floor . Since construction , there have been no projects undertaken to refurbish or restore the original building , as to protect its historical importance . In 1951 , due to a decline in enrollment , the school reduced to serving just students in grades K through 8 , and has remained this way since . In fall of 2001 , the school had an enrollment of just eight students . By the fall of 2004 ( the last published figures available ) , that number had fallen to just five . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Strang Public School is a near perfect example of what is considered a typical twentieth @-@ century " fireproof " schoolhouse in Nebraska , and is constructed somewhat symmetrically . The school was constructed in a simplified version of the Renaissance Revival style , consisting of two stories , with a flat roof . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The building is constructed in a rectangular shape , symmetrical on the exterior , and measures 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) by 66 feet ( 20 m ) . The approximate height measurements are not provided by the Register . Large , six over six paned windows are located in the front and the back of the building on both floors . Similar windows are also located on the south side of the building , but only on the top floor . There are no windows located on the north side . The entire exterior of the building is constructed from brick . The roof is flat and constructed of roofing cement , with a parapet located around it , with a section of a chimney that sticks out of the south end of the roof . The most prominent feature of the exterior of the building is the large , central pavilion , with a stepped gable parapet wall . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The first level of the building contains two classrooms , both of which have a cloakroom , a set of three swivel doors , and a large slate chalkboard that covers one of the walls . The first story also contains two bathrooms , four small storage closets , and a central hall , as well as a large stairwell leading up to the second floor . The second story contains three classrooms , with the same features as those downstairs , along with an office and three small storage rooms . A metal fire escape door is located in the center of the west wall of the second story . The schoolhouse also has a partial basement , which contains a large storage room , a coal room , and a disused coal furnace . 
 = = Geography and facilities = = 
 The Strang Public School is positioned at the intersection of Main Street and Sharon Street , on the southern edge of Strang , originally planned as a convenient location for the teachers and students coming from surrounding communities . The campus consists of the main schoolhouse , five historic pieces of playground equipment , a flagpole located in front of the building , a basketball / tennis court located north of the school building , and a large playing field west of the schoolhouse . The entire property is contained inside a 300 by 300 foot square plot of land . 
 A flagpole is located outside the main entrance to the school building , and is included in the NRHP listing as a contributing feature . A set of gym bars , a tether ball pole , a swing set , a " slippery slide " , and a merry @-@ go @-@ round are located on the south and west sides of the property , and are all listed as contributing features . A fenced tennis and basketball court is located on the north side of the property , and a large track and playing field are located on the west side of the property , but none of these features are included in the listing .

 Strang School District No. 36 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 25 , <unk> 1 On its nomination , Strang School District No. 36 was cited as being significant under criteria C , with the statement : " as a multi @-@ story , brick , " fireproof " school building , an example of a type , period , and method of construction representative of school buildings constructed in many communities in Nebraska , particularly in Fillmore County , during the first quarter of the twentieth century " . The school 's listed year of significance was 1930 , the year it was constructed . The school is considered significant to the surrounding community by Fillmore County , due to its importance to education an historic qualities , being one of the oldest buildings in the area . 
 = Kylfings = 
 The Kylfings ( Old Norse <unk> ; Finnic <unk> ; Hungarian Kölpények ; Old East Slavic <unk> , Kolbiagi ; Byzantine Greek <unk> , Koulpingoi ; Arabic al @-@ <unk> ) were a people of uncertain origin active in Northern Europe during the Viking Age , roughly from the late ninth century to the early twelfth century . They could be found in areas of Lapland , Russia , and the Byzantine Empire that were frequented by Scandinavian traders , raiders and mercenaries . Scholars differ on whether the Kylfings were ethnically Finnic or Norse . Also disputed is their geographic origin , with Denmark , Sweden and the Eastern Baltic all put forward as candidates . Whether the name Kylfing denotes a particular tribal , socio @-@ political , or economic grouping is also a matter of much debate . 
 They are mentioned in Old Norse runestone inscriptions , sagas ( most notably in Egil 's Saga ) , and poetry ( such as Thorbjorn Hornklofi 's poem Haraldskvæði ) , as well as Byzantine records and Rus ' law @-@ codes . According to the sagas , the Kylfings opposed the consolidation of Norway under Harald Fairhair and participated in the pivotal late ninth century Battle of Hafrsfjord . After Harald 's victory in that battle , they are described in the sagas as having raided in Finnmark and elsewhere in northern Norway and having fought against Harald 's lieutenants such as Thorolf <unk> . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The exact etymology of the word <unk> is disputed and many different theories have been put forward as to its ultimate origin . The general trend has been to trace <unk> to the Old Norse words kylfa and kolfr , but scholars disagree as to the meaning of these words as well . <unk> notes that in Old Norse , kylfa can mean a club or cudgel . Thus the national Icelandic antiquarian <unk> Guðmundsson translated Kylfing to mean " club @-@ wielders " . As Foote points out , it can also mean a smaller stick , such as a tally @-@ stick or wooden token used by merchants , and , according to Jesch , it can also mean the " highest and narrowest part " of a ship 's stem . Holm discussed the term kylfa in connection with the word <unk> which means " meeting " or " guild " ; according to Holm , the second element kolfr could refer to a symbolic arrow traditionally used as a device to summon people for a meeting . 
 These varied derivations have led to a number of interpretations . Holm offers two meanings : " archer " and " man armed with a cudgel " . A number of historians have asserted that Kylfing referred to a member of a " club in the social or Anglo @-@ American sense " , a " brotherhood " or a member of a Norse <unk> . In a number of minor Icelandic manuscripts on mathematics and geography , Kylfingaland is identified as Garðaríki , i.e. Kievan Rus ' , but the sources are unclear as to whether Kylfingaland is named for the Kylfings or vice versa , or whether , indeed , there is any connection at all . 
 The Russian cognate of Kylfing is <unk> , following the pattern of development * <unk> ( * <unk> ) > * <unk> > <unk> . The Kolbiagi were a group of foreign merchant @-@ <unk> and mercenaries mentioned in a number of Old Russian sources . They are often mentioned together with the Varangians , a term used in Eastern Europe to describe traders and pirates of the Baltic sea . In Byzantine Greek , they were named <unk> and they served as a unit of the Byzantine army listed alongside the Varangian Guard , which was of Scandinavian origin . 
 A very different derivation was put forward by the Russian scholar B. <unk> . He hypothesised that <unk> was a direct Norse translation of the Votic self @-@ designation <unk> and <unk> ( or <unk> and <unk> ) used by the Votes , a Finnic tribe residing in Ingria , Russia . A non @-@ Norse origin was also proposed by Julius <unk> , who argued that both Varangian and Kylfing derived from the Turkic languages , particularly the Bulgar and Khazar languages . <unk> asserted that Varangian came from the Turkic root <unk> ( " to walk , travel " ) while Kylfing was a Norse pronunciation of the Slavic <unk> , itself deriving from the Turkic phrase <unk> @-@ beg ( " sea @-@ king " ) ; under this interpretation the word Kylfing would be more or less synonymous with " Viking " . 
 = = Identity = = 
 According to Egil 's Saga , the Kylfings were trading and plundering in Finnmark around the year 900 . Thorolf <unk> , King Harald 's tax agent in northern Norway , engaged Saami scouts to monitor the Kylfings ' movements and report back to him . Countering their raids , he is reported to have killed over a hundred Kylfing marauders . 
 Some scholars see them as Scandinavians while others consider them to have been a Finnic tribe , and assert a connection between the word Kylfing and the Finnish , Saami , and Karelian myths of <unk> . Elsewhere they are described as a mixture of Norse and Finnish people who were employed as mercenaries and tax @-@ agents by Scandinavian rulers ; in this context <unk> interpreted the kylfa element to refer to a " club " in the sense of organization . <unk> argues that the Kolbiagi were a separate fur @-@ trading guild . Postan et al . , on the other hand , hypothesize that <unk> denoted a junior participant in a Varangian trade guild , rather than a separate group . 
 = = = Finnic peoples = = = 
 Holm ( 1992 ) considers Egil 's saga to equate the Kylfings with the Finnic Karelians . In the 14th century , when the Swedish kings began to direct their attention northwards and encourage Swedish colonization in Norrbotten , there were regulations that the <unk> and the Saami peoples were not to be interrupted in their traditional activities . A large part of the Karelians were under Novgorod which was included in what Icelandic sources called Kylfingaland , and thus the Kylfings could have been Baltic Finnish tribes under Novgorod . 
 Both East Slavs and Byzantines consistently made a clear distinction between Varangians and Kylfings , and Byzantines distinguished between them in the same manner as they separated Franks from Saracens . According to Holm such separations are indicative of clear ethnic differences between the two groups . Additionally , both East Slavic and Byzantine sources explicitly associate the Varangians with Baltic region , which they called <unk> , and in Arabic , the Baltic Sea was called Bahr <unk> , i.e. the " Varangian Sea " . There are no comparable connections when they mention the Kylfings . Another difference is the fact that the Byzantine sources connect the word varangoi with rhōs in order to make it clear that the rhōs @-@ varangoi and the varangoi originate in Baltic just like the rhōs , but do not establish the same associations for the <unk> . 
 The Kylfings have also been identified with the Votic people . Carl Christian Rafn , Edgar V. Saks , B. <unk> and Sigurður <unk> have proposed Kylfings to have been the Norse name for the Votes . The reason is that the ethnonym <unk> ( <unk> ) can be associated with the word <unk> ( modern Estonian <unk> ' ) which means " stake " , " wedge " or " staff " , which corresponds to Old Norse kolfr . <unk> would consequently be translated into Old East Norse as <unk> , which in Old West Norse ( Old Icelandic ) would be <unk> as <unk> . Whereas some native names were <unk> , as Rostov into <unk> , the Norse learned of the meaning of other names and translated them , which they did at Volkhov , and in the case of some of the Dniepr rapids . The theory that the Kylfings were Votes has been opposed by Max <unk> and Stender @-@ Petersen , whereas Holm finds it likely . Holm considers it apparent that the Varangians and the Finnic tribes were able to cooperate well , and he points to the relative ease and stability with which Finland was later integrated as a part of the Swedish kingdom . Jorma <unk> , a Finnish linguist , disagrees with the Vote theory and maintains that the Votic name or any other Finnic ethnonym is not etymologically connected with the name <unk> . 
 Estonians have also been identified as Kylfings . 
 = = = Scandinavians = = = 
 <unk> Guðmundsson identified the Kylfings as an East Scandinavian , possibly Swedish , tribe that infiltrated northern Norway during the late ninth century . Guðmundsson connects the Kylfings with the Germanic Heruli who were active throughout northern Europe and in Italy during the fifth and sixth centuries . According to Guðmundsson , many of these Kylfings may ultimately have emigrated to Iceland during the ninth and tenth centuries . Other scholars have assigned a Danish origin to this tribe . 
 Some scholars have considered the Kylfings of Egil 's Saga to be a " conquering Germanic people " , or the Swedish king 's tax collectors . Holm ( 1992 ) considers such suggestions to be anachronistic because the Swedish kings lacked any interest in northern Fenno @-@ Scandia during the ninth and tenth centuries , and not even the later law of Hälsingland mentions any Swedish settlement north of <unk> in southern Västerbotten . 
 Pritsak identified the Kylfings as a " professional trading and mercenary organization " that organized expeditions northward , into the Saami lands , as distinct from other Varangian and viking groups whose expeditions focussed on lands to the west and east of Scandinavia . This interpretation is supported by such historians as Stender @-@ Petersen . 
 A number of runestones in Sweden contain the personal name <unk> , which may or may not be connected to the Kylfings as a group . 
 = = = Other suggestions = = = 
 A few historians have hypothesized that the Kylfings were a West Slavic people related to the Pomeranians . Under this interpretation , the Slavic term <unk> may share common origins with such place @-@ names as Kołobrzeg ( formerly Kolberg ) , a town on the Pomeranian Baltic coast , and <unk> , a settlement near modern St. Petersburg .

 Eleventh @-@ century Byzantine sources refer to Kylfings ( <unk> , Koulpingoi ; often attested in the genitive plural <unk> , <unk> ) as being among the foreigners serving as mercenaries in Constantinople , but appear to distinguish between them and the Varangians . For instance , an imperial chrysobull , an edict bearing a golden seal , issued in 1073 exempts certain monasteries from being forced to billet soldiers of specific <unk> : Varangians , Rus ' , Saracens , Franks and Koulpingoi . In previous edicts issued in 1060 and 1068 the Koulpingoi had not been separately delineated . Similar edicts were issued in 1082 , 1086 , and 1088 . The edict issued by Alexios I Komnenos 1088 , for instance , reads : 
 The whole of the above @-@ mentioned island [ of Patmos ] , as well as the monastery with all its properties , is granted <unk> [ exemption ] from the <unk> [ <unk> ] of all commanders , both Roman [ <unk> ] and foreign allies , that is the Rus , Varangians , Koulpingoi , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Bulgarians , Saracens , Alans , <unk> , the Immortals , and all other Romans and foreigners . 
 = = = Russia and the eastern Baltic = = = 
 The Kylfings were also active in the eastern Baltic and northern Russia . Kylfingaland may have been used to refer to Karelia ; on some runestones it has been interpreted as a synonym for <unk> , the Old Norse name for Russia . The eleventh @-@ century <unk> Pravda , the law code of the Kievan Rus ' , grants certain privileges to Kylfings ( <unk> or " Kolbiagi " ) in addition to Varangians ( " <unk> " ) . For instance , Varangians and Kylfings were entitled to press charges with an oath without relying on any witnesses . In addition , in order to swear innocence , they needed only two witnesses , whereas a native Slav needed as many as seven . Moreover , the Varangians and the Kylfings were entitled to give shelter to a fugitive for as many as three days , whereas Slavs and others had to hand him over directly . 
 = = = Hungary = = = 
 A military organization called Kölpények is reported to have existed in Medieval Hungary during the tenth , eleventh and twelfth centuries . Hungarian scholars have proposed that the Kölpények were identical with the Kylfings / Kolbiagi . Hungarian sources regard the Kölpények as being of Scandinavian origin . They were hired by the early rulers of the House of Arpad , particularly Taksony of Hungary in the 950s , to serve as frontier guards . They fought with their Magyar employers alongside Sviatoslav I of Kiev against Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire . Alternatively , the Kölpények may have been of Pecheneg origin , as there was a Pecheneg tribal group called <unk> during roughly the same period . 
 = = Austkylfur = = 
 The skaldic poet Thorbjorn Hornklofi wrote about Austkylfur , or " East @-@ Kylfings " , in his epic poem Haraldskvæði . In some manuscripts the name was , probably erroneously , rendered <unk> or " rich men " . Some philologists , using the nautical meaning of the word kylfa , interpret the phrase as " eastern ships " . Others , such as F. Jonsson , interpreted Austkylfur to mean " eastern logs " , while <unk> believed that the phrase properly meant simply " men of the east " . Another interpretation of the term used in Haraldskvæði is the derogatory " eastern oafs " . 
 Guðmundsson specifically identified the Austkylfur of Hornklofi 's poem with the Kylfings mentioned elsewhere in Scandinavian and Eastern European sources , and interpreted the phrase Austkylfur to mean " eastern club @-@ wielding men " . 
 In Haraldskvæði as recorded by Snorri Sturluson in the Heimskringla , the <unk> were described as being opponents of Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord . As such they formed part of the force , led by <unk> the Rich of Agder and the kings and jarls of Hordaland , Rogaland , and Telemark , that came to Hafrsfjord to fight Harald 's encroaching hegemony . The exact relationship between the Austkylfur and the anti @-@ Harald coalition is unknown . Nora Chadwick identifies the Austkylfur as the part of the force opposing Harald that came from Agder and Telemark . These districts lie further east than the other kingdoms opposing Harald 's rule . After their defeat by Harald and his army , the Kylfings ' property was plundered and their womenfolk , described as " eastern maidens " , were distributed by the victorious king among his warriors .

 The Bloodbath of B @-@ R5RB or the Battle of B @-@ R5RB was a massive @-@ scale virtual battle fought in the MMORPG space game Eve Online , and was possibly the largest player versus player battle in history . <unk> the <unk> Coalition and Russian alliances ( CFC / Rus ) against N3 and Pandemic Legion ( N3 / PL ) , the 21 @-@ hour @-@ long conflict involved over 7 @,@ 548 player characters overall and a maximum of 2 @,@ 670 players in the B @-@ R5RB system at one time .

This theoretical value is derived from time cards which are purchasable for real currency and can be converted into a tradable item in @-@ game . 
 Part of a larger conflict known as the Halloween War , the fight started after a single player controlling a space station in the star system B @-@ R5RB accidentally failed to make a scheduled in @-@ game routine maintenance payment which made the system ( a key staging area used by N3 / PL in the war ) highly vulnerable to capture . The CFC and Russian coalitions began pouring players into the system in a swift offensive , and N3 / PL moved in a large fleet of players as a response as well . A massive battle erupted in the system and numerous smaller engagements occurred throughout the game universe as players attempted to block reinforcements from joining the battle . CFC / Rus gained a clear win by inflicting heavy losses on N3 / PL and successfully capturing B @-@ R5RB . The losses totalled 576 Capital @-@ class ships including 75 Titans ( the largest ships available to players ) , along with thousands of smaller vessels . 
 To commemorate the sheer size and cost of the battle , the game 's creators , CCP Games , erected a permanent monument in the system B @-@ R5RB named " The Titanomachy " , consisting of non @-@ salvageable capital ship wrecks . 
 = = Background = = 
 Eve Online is a MMORPG space game in which players engage in a variety of activities including mining , piracy , manufacturing , trading , exploration , and combat . A few dozen players form corporations ( called clans , guilds or alliances in other video games ) , and these corporations in turn can formally join in alliance with other corporations . Many of these alliances create informal coalitions to work toward common goals and fight competing alliances . The Halloween War was a conflict in the game universe which started around Halloween in late October 2013 and pitted the CFC and " Russian " coalition and their allies against the N3 and Pandemic Legion coalitions and their allies . B @-@ R5RB , located in the <unk> region , served as the staging ground for all Pandemic Legion fleets . A few days before the fighting in B @-@ R5RB , the CFC and Russian coalition suffered a decisive loss to N3 and Pandemic Legion forces in the Battle of HED @-@ GP in the Catch region , due to the N3 / PL 's " Wrecking Ball " formation of Titan and <unk> " <unk> " ships in the center of a huge sphere of mainly Archon carriers .

At around 14 : 00 UTC , with an hour remaining on the clock before Nulli Secunda could regain control , the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station . <unk> Alliance took the station , and the Russians destroyed the N3 / PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU in order to establish control . As capturing this system would enable them to trap Pandemic Legion assets , including hundreds of capital and sub @-@ capital ships , inside and prevent them from joining the war , CFC Alliance and Russian @-@ heavy coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system , with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets . Manfred <unk> of Pandemic Legion claimed that the missed payment resulted from a bug , as he had enough ISK in his holding corporation wallet and had <unk> checked .

 Pandemic Legion and N3 moved to retake the system , but the Russians destroyed all Territorial Control Units anchored in the system . N3 / PL then deployed their super @-@ carrier and carrier fleet in the " Wrecking Ball " formation just off the system 's space station , a formation which had previously defeated the CFC and Russian alliance . As the conflict was a surprise and occurred on a Monday workday , CFC and Rus decided to take advantage and gain field superiority before N3 and PL could respond and so deployed their entire capital fleet to the system . Meanwhile , they deployed their sub @-@ capital fleets to N3 staging systems , including I @-@ <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> , to delay any reinforcements . 
 Each side then attempted to rush all available pilots into the system , and the game 's time dilation software engaged . Time dilation is a game feature created by developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads on the game server without the game lagging or disconnecting players . In time dilation , the game slows to ten percent normal speed , with each second of game time displaying as ten seconds of real time . The two sides traded Titan kills every hour , when their Doomsday weapons could fire again , and the system became filled with warp disruption bubbles , making extraction difficult . For a while neither side gained any real advantage , though CFC / Rus managed to on @-@ line their Territorial Control Units and held a slight lead in the number of enemy Titans destroyed . Throughout the engagement , related battles played out across the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements , destroy fleeing capitals and super @-@ capitals , or trap pilots attempting to enter the fray . 
 The tide of the battle started to turn when Manfred <unk> , the initial N3 / PL fleet commander , handed control to Vince Draken , CEO of Northern Coalition . Vince Draken managed to concentrate fire on and destroy several CFC / Rus Titans , and forced some additional Russian Titans to leave the system with depleted shields and armor . However , N3 / PL overestimated their success and began to focus their attacks on the Titan belonging to Sort Dragon , the commander of all remaining Russian forces in the field . This Titan had very high damage resistance , and Sort Dragon drew upon his entire fleet to assist in repairing it , enabling it to hold out much longer than most other Titans up to that point . By the time his Titan fell , the CFC / Rus had managed to destroy five N3 / PL Titans , putting the alliance well ahead . James Carl , a member of the N3 / Pandemic Legion coalition , reported to the Associated Press that " It looks like CFC is winning , but we 're hoping now that all of our US players are online , we 'll turn the tide . " But when the US @-@ timezone players logged on and reinforcements became available , PL did not see the numbers they had expected , and the CFC blockaded adjacent systems to prevent them joining the battle . Eventually , N3 / PL could no longer destroy any Titans , and ordered a retreat . They switched their fire onto CFC / Rus 's Dreadnoughts in an attempt to take out as many ships as possible during retreat . Due to their spy network , CFC knew that N3 / PL had ordered a retreat and deployed <unk> and Heavy <unk> to prevent the withdrawal . N3 / PL lost several more Titans , Super Carriers , and Capitals in the extraction , with many trapped by the warp disruption bubbles strewn throughout the battle area .

 Over 7 @,@ 548 unique characters participated in the overall battle , of which 6 @,@ 058 participated directly in the B @-@ R5RB system with a maximum of 2 @,@ 670 in system at the same time . These numbers included 717 unique player corporations and involved 55 unique player alliances . Joystiq called the battle potentially the largest recorded PvP battle in any game to date . The 21 @-@ hour @-@ long conflict resulted in the loss of 75 Titans , 13 Super Carriers , 370 Dreadnoughts , and 123 Carriers , along with thousands of smaller ships and innumerable fighters and drones . N3 and Pandemic Legion lost 59 Titans while the CFC and Russian coalition lost only 16 . An estimated 11 trillion ISK in assets was lost during the battle , and media outlets reported the battle as the biggest and most expensive in EVE Online 's history , estimating that the battle cost $ 300 @,@ 000 – $ 330 @,@ 000 in real @-@ world money . This estimate comes from a figure listed in the official report by CCP Games , which the report based off a theoretical conversion of pilot license extensions , or PLEX , into real @-@ world USD . While direct conversion of real currency into ISK , or vice versa , is strictly prohibited , and PLEX units are purchasable in @-@ game , additional PLEX units can be purchased for $ 20 USD , and it is from this theoretical real @-@ world value that the estimated dollar amounts lost in the battle are drawn . However , this does not mean this amount of real @-@ world money was expended , as many ships were purchased through in @-@ game currency or corporation assets . Dr. <unk> Guðmundsson , an economist hired by CCP Games to oversee EVE Online 's economy , stated that " To me , as an economist , that doesn ’ t really matter . In both cases this is economical value that is created by people ’ s work , either in real life or in virtual life . They put their blood , sweat and tears into making stuff so they can have an advantage in a battle , because in this battle like in any other battle in meet worlds , in real life , it is the resources you have available . " 
 Alexander Gianturco , who goes by the in @-@ game character The <unk> , CEO of <unk> ( the largest corporation in the <unk> Federation alliance and hence the largest alliance in the CFC ) , reported to Polygon near the end of the battle that " As vengeance for [ the battle of ] Asakai goes , it 's somewhat ironic ; our forces lost three Titans and seven supercarriers last year in Asakai , and lost the battle . This year we 've killed 40 + hostile Titans and we have seven more hours of killing before downtime . " Also near the end of the battle , Ali Aras wrote on <unk> , an Eve Online @-@ devoted website , that " The kills made here decide not only this war , but the next , and the next after that . " Aras also noted some of the economic repercussions , stating that " the price of <unk> has been creeping upwards , anticipating the flurry of industrial production to come . " 
 Following the Battle of B @-@ R5RB , Pandemic Legion withdrew from the Southeast theater and formed an agreement with the CFC which allowed them to evacuate billions of assets from the B @-@ R5RB system . Other N3 forces retreated in from the south , and in the following few days CFC alliances managed to capture a total of twenty three systems in the regions <unk> , Catch , <unk> , and <unk> from N3 / Pandemic Legion alliances . The CFC then withdrew from the southeast theater . In the weeks after , the Russian bloc suffered internal troubles , allowing N3 to regain all of the territory lost after B @-@ R5RB and conquer most of the Russian bloc 's territory . In the longer term , B @-@ R5RB established CFC , later re @-@ branded as The Imperium , as the predominant superpower in Eve Online , with little serious resistance challenging the coalition for the next two years .

 Once the game went into downtime , developer CCP Games announced that it would create an in @-@ game monument in the B @-@ R5RB star system to commemorate the battle . " Titanomachy " was created using brand new Titan wreck models introduced with Eve Online : Rubicon 's 1 @.@ 1 release which came out immediately following the battle .

 R.C. Pro @-@ Am is a racing video game developed by Rare . It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) by Nintendo for North America in 1988 , and then in Europe on April 15 of the following year . Presented in an overhead isometric perspective , a single player races a radio @-@ controlled car around a series of tracks . The objective of each track is to qualify for the next race by placing in the top three racers . Players collect items to improve performance , and they must avoid a variety of hazards such as rain puddles and oil slicks . It is an example of a racing game which features vehicular combat , in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles . Originally titled Pro Am Racing , R.C. Pro @-@ Am was also ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992 as Championship Pro @-@ Am , an enhanced remake with enhanced graphics and additional features . R.C. Pro @-@ Am was followed by two sequels : Super R.C. Pro @-@ Am in 1991 , and R.C. Pro @-@ Am II in 1992 . 
 Listed by video game reviewers as one of Rare 's first successful NES titles , R.C. Pro @-@ Am was well @-@ received for its visuals , sound , gameplay , and enjoyability . The game distanced itself from earlier racing titles by using an overhead , instead of a first @-@ person , perspective . Reviews have cited it as inspiration for future games such as Super Off Road , Rock n ' Roll Racing , and the Mario Kart series . It has appeared in many " top games of all time " lists and is regarded as one of the best titles in the NES library .

 R.C. Pro @-@ Am is a racing video game in which a player controls a radio @-@ controlled car against three opponents around a track from an overhead isometric perspective . Players use the horizontal buttons on the control pad to steer their car left or right , and they use the other buttons to accelerate , fire weapons , and pause the game . Consisting of 24 tracks total , the goal for each racer is to qualify for the next race by finishing in the top three in the four @-@ car field . The game ends if players finish in fourth ; however , they have two continues in which they can restart the previous race , but they will lose all points accumulated up to that point . For each successful completion of a race , the player receives a trophy ; larger " High Score Trophies " , leading up to the " Super Trophy " , can also be obtained for achieving high scores . After the game ends , players can record their scores on " Top Pro @-@ Am Drivers " list , but the scores are erased when the console power is powered off . 
 Throughout the courses , there are items on the track that players can collect by driving over them . " Tune @-@ up items " help increase the car 's performance , such as turbo acceleration , " hotter engines " for higher top speed , and " super sticky tires " for increased traction and cornering ; these additional abilities are displayed on the " track conditions " screen between races . Players can also collect weapons that can temporarily disable other vehicles : missiles take out the opposing vehicles from the front , while bombs take them out from the rear . The number of missiles and bombs carry over to the next race , and players can collect extra ammunition , represented by stars , on the track . Roll cages , which opponents can also collect , help protect cars from crash damage , stationary " zippers " give cars an extra speed boost , and " bonus letters " give players large point bonuses and the ability to drive an upgraded car if they can spell " <unk> " ( " <unk> " in the Rare Replay version ) with them . Players can upgrade from a standard truck to a faster 4 @-@ Wheeler and then to the fastest Off Roader . There are also various hazards which must be avoided : oil slicks which cause cars to spin out of control , water puddles and " rain squalls " which slow them down , pop @-@ up barriers which crash cars , and skulls which decrease ammunition . Excessive use of projectile weaponry on opponents will result in the yellow car accelerating to 127 mph , which cannot be matched by the player . 
 The Sega Genesis port , Championship Pro @-@ Am , features some gameplay differences from the NES version of the game . In this port , players race against five other vehicles instead of three , but players must still place in the top three to move to the next track . Another feature is that race records are recorded ; players are prompted to enter their name before the game start to track high scores and race records . Finally , players try to successfully spell " <unk> " in order to upgrade to a new car .

 " Three Men and Adena " is the fifth episode of the first season of the American police drama television series Homicide : Life on the Street . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 3 , 1993 . The episode was written by executive producer Tom Fontana and directed by Martin Campbell . In the episode , Pembleton and Bayliss have a 12 @-@ hour limit to elicit a confession from Risley Tucker for the murder of 11 @-@ year @-@ old Adena Watson . The episode takes place almost entirely within the confines of the police interrogation room with the three actors . 
 Tucker was played by actor Moses Gunn , which was his final acting role before his death in December 1993 . " Three Men and Adena " was seen by 7 @.@ 08 million households in its original broadcast , which was among the lowest @-@ rated network shows from that evening . However , the episode received positive reviews ; it is considered one of the classic Homicide episodes , and ranked number 74 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 greatest television moments . Tom Fontana won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for the episode 's script . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) and Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) prepare to interview Risley Tucker ( Moses Gunn ) , an elderly arabber . Bayliss is convinced Tucker murdered 11 @-@ year @-@ old Adena Watson , but Pembleton is less confident . Since they have already interviewed Tucker multiple times , the court will not allow him to be bothered anymore if he does not confess after this interview , and the detectives have only 12 hours to elicit a confession before Tucker walks free . Pembleton starts off acting friendly while Bayliss , who has taken the Watson case very personally , is more aggressive . Adena used to work for Tucker , taking care of his horse . Pembleton brings up Tucker 's alcoholism , but Tucker said he gave up drinking because he used to black out , insisting he hasn 't had a drink in 16 months . Tucker also insists he hadn 't seen Adena for three days before she died , but Bayliss shows him she had soot on her skirt that matched soot from Tucker 's barn , indicating she was there the day she was killed . 
 During a moment of anger , Bayliss nearly presses Tucker 's face against a hot pipe on the wall , but Pembleton stops him . Tucker still angrily insists he did not kill her , and he agrees to submit to a polygraph test . When Bayliss leaves , Pembleton speaks to Tucker in a soft and comforting tone , trying to get Tucker to trust him . Pembleton suggests Tucker had a drink and blacked out the night he killed Adena , and he seems close to getting a confession before Tucker once again insists he is innocent . With four hours left before the deadline , Bayliss returns and says Tucker failed the polygraph test . Bayliss and Pembleton then aggressively team up on Tucker , talking quickly and intimidating him with repeated questions . They bring up a previously dropped statutory rape charge against Tucker involving a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl , then suggest he attempted to have sex with Adena and killed her because she resisted . They confront Tucker with gruesome crime scene photos of Adena and ask him if he is sure he didn 't kill her , to which a frightened and confused Tucker replies , " Not right now , I 'm not . " 
 With less than an hour left and still without a confession , the detectives are exhausted , and Tucker turns the table on them . He claims Pembleton has the attitude of a man trying to distance himself from his African American heritage because he is ashamed to be black . Tucker also accuses Bayliss of hiding a " dark side " inside him that he is afraid to embrace . Eventually , Tucker admits he harbored pedophilic feelings for Adena , and feels shame that the " one great love of my life was an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl " . He breaks down and cries , but still insists he did not kill her . The 12 @-@ hour time limit elapses and the detectives fail to get a confession . Tucker is released and Bayliss is miserable he was unable to close the case . Pembleton , who has a new respect for Bayliss , tries to comfort him by saying he is now convinced Tucker is the killer , but Bayliss is no longer so sure .

 " Three Men and Adena " was directed by Martin Campbell and written by Tom Fontana , executive producer of Homicide : Life on the Street . The interrogation room at the homicide division , colloquially referred to by detectives as " The Box " , is a setting that appears in almost every episode of Homicide : Life on the Street . While filming an interrogation scene there in " Gone for Goode " , the first episode of the first season , director Barry Levinson commented to Fontana that the acting from Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor was so effective , an entire episode could be filmed revolving strictly around an interrogation . The comments partially inspired Fontana to write " Three Men and Adena " . Fontana said , " I only had the courage to write that episode based on the fact that I had seen what ( Braugher and Secor ) could do in the pilot episode " . Almost the entire episode of " Three Men and Adena " takes place within the confines of the police interrogation room with Braugher , Secor and Moses Gunn , the actor who guest starred as Risley Tucker . It was Gunn 's final acting role before his death in December 1993 . Fontana acknowledged a certain amount of risk in producing such an unusual episode in only the fifth week of the show , but he said , " It was important for Barry Levinson and I to establish that we weren 't going to do the same old show every week . " 
 " Three Men and Adena " marked the conclusion of the Adena Watson murder case , a story arc which began at the start of the first season . The Watson case was based on the real @-@ life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace , which is chronicled in Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , the 1991 David Simon non @-@ fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series . Elements of the interview in " Three Men and Adena " were incorporated from real @-@ life police interrogations in that case . The Wallace case was never solved , and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well , despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion . Fontana said , " We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl , to have this fake TV solution . Because it 's not O.K. that she died , that no one took responsibility . " The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn 't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real @-@ life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research . Fontana said , " It was so chilling ( and ) I was like , ' Oh man , how do you get there ? ' " 
 Martin Campbell spent three days of preparation on the " Box " set , analyzing it from every angle to learn the feel of the room . Fontana comes from a playwriting background , and " Three Men and Adena " involves long lengths of dialogue in a single setting , much like a play . The actors shot about 14 pages of dialogue each day , and had a very small amount of rehearsal time before shooting . According to Fontana , Campbell never shot a scene from the same angle twice , " So the entire hour keeps changing the point of view of the camera , so that you never get tired of being in that room . " While filming the episode , Campbell would shoot single scenes with multiple pages of long dialogue , then film the scene again from another angle . Braugher said the experience felt more like staging a play than shooting a television episode , and allowed for a feeling of spontaneous human emotion in the performances . Although the dialogue in the final episode did not stray from the original script , Fontana said Campbell and the actors came up with the rhythm and pacing of the performances largely on their own , particularly during the fast @-@ paced questions when Pembleton and Bayliss team up on Tucker . 
 The fact that Tucker goes free upholds a common theme in Homicide : Life on the Street – that life is not always fair , and that criminals sometimes get away with their crimes , a conviction that often put the show 's producers at odds with NBC executives . Fontana deliberately wrote the script so that it would remain ambiguous whether Tucker committed the murder or not . He wanted the character to have a genuine feeling of love for Adena Watson , but the strong feelings do not specifically mean he killed the girl . Braugher praised Fontana for creating such a three @-@ dimensional character in Tucker , and said , " Fontana 's genius is that we are never quite certain as to what it is that we have on our hands . " Fontana also wanted Pembleton and Bayliss to have different interpretations of the same interrogation ; Bayliss begins the interview convinced of the man 's guilt and becomes uncertain by the end , and Pembleton has the opposite experience . Multiple police departments have requested copies of " Three Men and Adena " for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process . The interrogation included several police tactics not typically featured in television dramas , including the presentation of false evidence in an attempt to get a confession . 
 During the opening scene of the episode , Bayliss watches the music video for " Surround " , by the British band Bleach .

 " Three Men and Adena " received positive reviews and has been described as one of the " classic episodes " of Homicide : Life on the Street . " Three Men and Adena " ranked number 74 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 greatest television moments , and number 15 among the top television moments from the 1990s . It was also identified by The Baltimore Sun as one of the ten best episodes of the series . Sun writer David Zurawik said Fontana 's playwriting background was deeply infused in the episode , which he called a " landmark hour " that it " put ( three men ) and a few sticks of battle @-@ scarred , municipal @-@ green furniture and somehow managed to show us the human soul and the heart of darkness " . Additionally , " Three Men and Adena " was among a 1999 Court TV marathon of the top 15 Homicide episodes , as voted on by 20 @,@ 000 visitors to the channels website . David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode " remains one of TV 's best drama hours ever " , and he ranked it the second @-@ best television episode ever made , behind the Taxi episode where Reverend Jim gets his driver 's license . Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts said the episode was " one of the most powerful prime @-@ time hours ever " and called Andre Braugher 's performance a " tour de police force " . Alex Strachan of The Vancouver Sun described " Three Men and Adena " as " one of Homicide 's finest moments " . He called the episode " claustrophobic , cynical and ultimately painful " and particularly praised the performances of Braugher and Secor , and the fact that it was not a happy ending . David P. Kalat , writer of Homicide : Life on the Street : The Unofficial Companion , described the episode as " an astonishing tour de force of writing and acting that demonstrates all of Homicide 's best qualities " . He also praised the chemistry between Braugher and Secor , particularly when they found a common voice during the interrogation . 
 Rocky Mountain News critic Dusty Saunders said the episode was " as good as dramatic television gets " , and showed how the quality of Homicide is anchored in strong writing and acting rather than action . John Leonard , a literary and television critic , called it " the most extraordinary thing I 've ever seen in a television hour " . Leonard praised the tension , the setting and the writing , particularly when Tucker turned the tables on the detectives . He said the episode was better than such works as Ariel Dorfman 's Death and the Maiden and author Don DeLillo 's books about men in small rooms . Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times called it a " relentless masterpiece " . Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News considered " Three Men and Adena " one of the best Homicide episodes and particularly praised the performance of Moses Gunn . Mendoza also said , " The claustrophobia of The Box contributes to the palpable tension . The Baltimore Sun television critic David Zurawik said the episode established The Box as " the main stage for Pembleton and the moral center of the Homicide universe " . Zurawik also said , " Stark and minimalist , the episode was musical theater as much as television , a celebration and explosion of language ; an angry , urban opera with the voices of Bayliss and Pembleton coming together and then falling back as Tucker sings a final aria of rage and contempt . " Calgary Herald writer Bruce Weir said the episode " is Homicide at its finest : brilliantly written , intensely acted and continuously surprising . " Emily Nussbaum of The New York Times called " Three Men and Adena " the standout episode of the series , and described it as " a potent showcase for the series ' smartly mordant dialogue , and its willingness to explore the cliches of TV detectives instead of merely repeating them " . Los Angeles Times writer Howard Rosenberg described it as a " mesmerizing ( and ) complex character study " , and said Gunn delivered the best guest performance of the television season . Grant Tinker , former CEO of NBC , said of the episode , " I thought it was stunning . "

Because he was unable to find suitable running blades in Pretoria , Vanderwatt ordered some to be made by a local engineer at Hanger Orthopedic Group . These quickly broke , and Vanderwatt referred Pistorius to American prosthetist and Paralympic sprinter Brian Frasure to be fitted for carbon @-@ fibre blades by Icelandic company Össur . 
 Pistorius ' participation in able @-@ bodied international sprinting competitions in 2007 raised questions about his use of running blades , and the IAAF amended their rules to ban the use of " any technical device that incorporates springs , wheels or any other element that provides a user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device . " After initial studies , Pistorius was ruled ineligible for competitions under these IAAF rules . After further research was presented , the Court of Arbitration ( CAS ) ruled that his running prostheses were not shown to provide a net competitive advantage over biological legs . In 2012 Pistorius qualified for and competed in both the 2012 Olympic Games and the 2012 Paralympic Games using his running blades , becoming the first amputee sprinter to run in the Olympic Games .

 The blades are <unk> prostheses , meaning they replace legs and feet that are amputated below the knee ( BK ) . They were developed by medical engineer Van Phillips who incorporated Flex @-@ Foot , Inc . , in 1984 , and in 2000 sold the company to Össur which now ( in 2012 ) manufactures the blades . They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring , allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively . 
 Carbon fibre is actually a carbon @-@ fiber @-@ reinforced polymer , and is a strong , light @-@ weight material used in a number of applications , including sporting goods like baseball bats , car parts , helmets , sailboats , bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength @-@ to @-@ weight ratio is important . The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy , but other polymers are also used , depending on the application , and other reinforcing fibres may also be included . In the blade manufacturing process , sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape . From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered , depending on the expected weight of the athlete , and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate . This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks . Once the result is cooled , it is cut into the shape of the blades . The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius ' legs . These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost , along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses . Each limb costs between $ 15 – 18 @,@ 000 USD . 
 Pistorius has been using the same Össur blades since 2004 . He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet , and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear prosthetic legs . He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters , and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly . 
 Pistorius uses custom @-@ made spike pads on the blades . Before development of the pads , his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over @-@ the @-@ counter spikes by hand , but the results using this method were inconsistent . Research was conducted in Össur ’ s Iceland lab using a pressure @-@ sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike , and produced a spike pad which includes a <unk> of two machine @-@ molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact , with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom . The developers attached the pad with contact cement , which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed . 
 Because of the curved design , the blades have to be slightly longer than a runner 's biological leg and foot would be . The blades replace the hinge of an ankle with elastic compression that bends and releases the blade with every stride , so the uncompressed blade leaves the user standing on tiptoe . They are designed to move forward , so have no heel support in the back . According to Josh McHugh of Wired Magazine , " The Cheetahs seem to bounce of their own accord . It ’ s impossible to stand still on them , and difficult to move slowly . Once they get going , Cheetahs are extremely hard to control . " 
 = = How the blades work = = 
 In 2007 Pistorius applied to run in able @-@ bodied track meets . He was at first accepted , but questions quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage . After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage , the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete . Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) in 2008 , meaning that he can continue to run in able @-@ bodied meets as long as he uses the equipment that was studied in the research . 
 Pistorius ' performance in the early able @-@ bodied races raised questions because of two major concerns : his pattern of running the races and his leg @-@ swing times . Most sprinters spring out of the blocks with their fastest time and slow down as the race progresses , but Pistorius ran a " negative split , " starting slowly and building up speed in the last half of the race ( though he no longer uses this pattern ) . His average time was also less in the 400m race when compared to other runners than in the 200m . Controversy about the use of the blades persists , but the research provided considerable information on how they work in application , and other research is expected to follow . 
 Able @-@ bodied sprinters have calves and ankles that return and amplify the energy supplied by their hips and knees , while Pistorius compensates with additional work because he does not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles . An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades , Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would . Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing . His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees . This results in a gait that waddles slightly , as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades . The blades compress under his weight , then release as he moves forward , providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape . As they spring off , he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride . 
 Pistorius is always slow in starting a race because the flexible blades do not provide thrust out of the blocks . Pistorius must begin from an awkward position , swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running , when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force . For the first 30 meters of a race , he keeps his head down and takes short , quick strides . As he establishes a rhythm , he can raise his head and increase his speed . While some runners jog up and down , losing energy , Pistorius directs energy forward , looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels . He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns , breaking the curves into short , straight lines . According to his coach Ampie Louw , Pistorius may be able to use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster .

 = = = Brüggemann study = = = 
 To resolve questions about the blades , Pistorius was asked to take part in a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the German Sport University Cologne with Professor of Biomechanics Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli . After two days of tests , Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than able @-@ bodied athletes once he achieved a given speed . The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics , with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces , and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle . The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9 @.@ 3 percent , while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42 @.@ 4 percent , showing a difference of more than 30 percent . Brüggemann 's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed , and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed . In December of that year , Brüggemann stated to Die Welt newspaper that Pistorius " has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us . It was more than just a few percentage points . I did not expect it to be so clear . " The study was published in 2008 in Sports Technology , but later researchers stated that the analysis " did not take enough variables into consideration " . Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge . Second , the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius ’ s performance against appropriate controls . IAAF used five able @-@ bodied athletes , who run 400 @-@ meter races in similar times to Pistorius , as controls . However , because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running , he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted . In March 2007 , approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted , Pistorius ’ s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters . To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius ’ s performance , he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential . Consequently , the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius , who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times , against athletes at their peak . 
 = = = Weyand , et al. study = = = 
 In 2008 a team of seven researchers conducted tests at Rice University , including Peter Weyand , Hugh Herr , Rodger Kram , Matthew Bundle and Alena Grabowski . The team collected metabolic and mechanical data by indirect calorimetry and ground reaction force measurements on Pistorius ' performance during constant @-@ speed , level treadmill running , and found that the energy usage was 3 @.@ 8 percent lower than average values for elite able @-@ bodied distance runners , 6 @.@ 7 percent lower than for average distance runners and 17 percent lower than for able @-@ bodied 400m sprint runners . At sprinting speeds of 8 @.@ 0 , 9 @.@ 0 and 10 @.@ 0 m / s , Pistorius produced longer foot to ground contact times , shorter leg swing times , and lower average vertical forces than able bodied sprinters . The team concluded that running on the blades appears to be physiologically similar but mechanically different from running with biological legs . The study was published several months later in the Journal of Applied Physiology . The inconsistencies between the finding of this study and the Brüggemann study were attributed to differences in study methodology . 
 In the study , the blades were found to have an elastic energy return of about 92 percent , whereas biological legs provide between a 93 and 95 percent return . Grabowski also stated that the prostheses reduce the amount of force Pistorius can apply to the ground when he runs , reducing his ability to propel himself forward . The shape of the blade foot is a longer lever than the human foot , providing a contact point further away from the axis of rotation than a real foot . This would allow greater torque generation when an identical amount of force is applied , but because of the springy quality of the blades , Pistorius is unable to exert the same force as an able @-@ bodied runner during push off from the ground . Kram also stated that Pistorius ' " rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high @-@ caliber athletes . " 
 The lightness and rigidity of the blade compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than able @-@ bodied runners . In comments on the article , Peter Weyand and <unk> Matthew Bundle noted that the study found that Pistorius re @-@ positioned his legs 15 @.@ 7 percent faster than most world record sprinters , allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed . 
 = = = Grabowski , et al. study = = = 
 In 2008 a research team including Alena Grabowski , Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow @-@ up study of single amputees with running blades which was published in Biology Letters . Each of six amputees ' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg . The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high @-@ speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital , and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics . They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds , and recorded leg swing times similar to that of able @-@ bodied sprinters . They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent . Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed , the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters ' top speed . Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force .

 Discussion continues about the relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades . Researchers and analysts also point out that the research studies are done on level , stationary treadmills , and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks . They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non @-@ amputees , who have such factors as musculature , blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss . 
 = = 2012 Paralympics = = 
 A controversy over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games , as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades within a few months before the 2012 Paralympic Games . This led to marked improvement in their running times . Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides , which would be an infringement of the IPC rules , regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned . His complaint was supported by single @-@ leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift , who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events , as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses , and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade . 
 The improvement in running time and the wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance . Pistorius ' stride length was actually 9 percent longer ( <unk> vs <unk> ) , but Oliveira took more strides ( 99 vs 92 ) . The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades . Pistorius ' management issued a statement saying that Pistorius is always 1 @.@ 84 meters tall , regardless of what prostheses he wears , and that the decision to maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness . 
 = HMS Argus ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Argus was a British aircraft carrier that served in the Royal Navy from 1918 to 1944 . She was converted from an ocean liner that was under construction when the First World War began , and became the first example of what is now the standard pattern of aircraft carrier , with a full @-@ length flight deck that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land . After commissioning , the ship was heavily involved for several years in the development of the optimum design for other aircraft carriers . Argus also evaluated various types of arresting gear , general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert , and fleet tactics . The ship was too top @-@ heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid @-@ 1920s . She spent one brief deployment on the China Station in the late 1920s before being placed in reserve for budgetary reasons . 
 Argus was recommissioned and partially modernised shortly before the Second World War and served as a training ship for deck @-@ landing practice until June 1940 . The following month she made the first of her many ferry trips to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to Malta ; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years . The ship also delivered aircraft to Murmansk in Russia , Takoradi on the Gold Coast , and Reykjavík in Iceland . By 1942 , the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and Argus was pressed into front @-@ line service despite her lack of speed and armament . In June , she participated in Operation Harpoon , providing air cover for the Malta @-@ bound convoy . In November , the ship provided air cover during Operation Torch , the invasion of French North Africa , and was lightly damaged by a bomb . After returning to the UK for repairs , Argus was used again for deck @-@ landing practice until late September 1944 . In December , she became an accommodation ship and was listed for disposal in mid @-@ 1946 . Argus was sold in late 1946 and scrapped the following year . 
 = = Design , description and construction = = 
 Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty 's desire during the First World War for an aircraft carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard . Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft , but had no way to recover them as they lacked flight decks . In 1912 , the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty an aircraft carrier design with a continuous , full @-@ length flight deck , but it was not accepted . As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent , this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large , fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier . Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war , and both met the Admiralty 's criteria . Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916 , possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare , and the company began work on converting the ship . 
 The initial design had two islands with the flight deck running between them . Each island contained one funnel ; a large net could be strung between them to stop out @-@ of @-@ control aircraft . The islands were connected by braces and the bridge was mounted on top of the bracing , which left a clear height of 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) for the aircraft on the flight deck . Fairly early in the design process , the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck . The exhaust gases were , instead , ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans . They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck , but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans . 
 In November 1916 , the ship 's design was tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory to evaluate the turbulence caused by the twin islands and the bridge over them . They were found to cause problems , but no changes were made until the ship was nearly complete . In April 1918 , Argus was ordered to be modified to a flush @-@ decked configuration after the sea trials of the carrier Furious had revealed severe turbulence problems caused by her superstructure . The ship was given a bridge underneath her flight deck , extending from side to side , and she was fitted with a retractable pilot house in the middle of the flight deck for use when not operating aircraft . 
 Argus 's stability had been a concern from the beginning . Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling , most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight , raising her centre of gravity . Even the addition of 600 long tons ( 610 t ) of ballast still left the ship with a very low metacentric height of only 1 @.@ 6 feet ( 0 @.@ 49 m ) lightly loaded and 3 @.@ 8 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) at deep load . This meant that she was very steady , but heeled noticeably when turning . The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds , but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area . 
 Argus had an overall length of 565 feet ( 172 @.@ 2 m ) , a beam of 68 feet ( 20 @.@ 7 m ) , and a draught of 23 feet 3 inches ( 7 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load . She displaced 14 @,@ 450 long tons ( 14 @,@ 680 t ) at standard load and 15 @,@ 575 long tons ( 15 @,@ 825 t ) at deep load . Each of the ship 's four sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller shaft . Steam was supplied by 12 cylindrical Scotch boilers . The turbines were designed for a total of 20 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 15 @,@ 000 kW ) , but they produced 21 @,@ 376 shaft horsepower ( 15 @,@ 940 kW ) during her sea trials in September 1918 , and gave Argus a speed of 20 @.@ 506 knots ( 37 @.@ 977 km / h ; 23 @.@ 598 mph ) . The ship carried 2 @,@ 500 long tons ( 2 @,@ 500 t ) of fuel oil , which gave her a range of 3 @,@ 600 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 700 km ; 4 @,@ 100 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship 's flight deck was 549 feet ( 167 @.@ 3 m ) long and her hangar was 330 feet ( 100 @.@ 6 m ) long , 48 – 68 feet ( 14 @.@ 6 – 20 @.@ 7 m ) wide , and 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) high . Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts ( elevators ) ; the forward lift measured 30 by 36 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m × 11 @.@ 0 m ) and the rear 60 by 18 feet ( 18 @.@ 3 m × 5 @.@ 5 m ) . Argus was the only British carrier serving in the Second World War capable of striking down ( stowing away ) aircraft with non @-@ folding wings because of her wide lifts and tall hangar ceiling . Three fire curtains divided the hangar and another separated the hangar and the quarterdeck . She could accommodate between 15 and 18 aircraft . No arresting gear was fitted as completed . Two large cranes were positioned on the quarterdeck , beneath the rear of the flight deck . Petrol storage consisted of 8 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 36 @,@ 000 l ; 9 @,@ 600 US gal ) in 2 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 9 @.@ 1 l ; 2 @.@ 4 US gal ) tins stowed below the waterline . The ship 's crew totalled 495 officers and men . 
 The ship was armed with four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft guns , two on the quarterdeck and one on each side of the hull . She was also fitted with two low @-@ angle 4 @-@ inch guns , one also on each side of the hull . The rear magazine and the torpedo warhead storage magazine were protected by a total of 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of protective plating on all sides , but the forward magazine and bomb storage rooms only had a 2 @-@ inch thick deck to protect them . 
 Argus was laid down in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in Dalmuir , as the Conte Rosso . She was renamed after her purchase in September 1916 and was launched on 2 December 1917 , her building having been slowed by labour shortages . The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918 . Formally named after Argus of the 100 Eyes from Greek mythology , Argus was nicknamed the Hat Box or the Flatiron due to her flat @-@ topped appearance .

 After commissioning too late to participate in World War I , Argus was tasked to conduct deck @-@ landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious . The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter . The same month , the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations , with a canvas @-@ and @-@ wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases . By 19 December 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups . Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear . The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft , but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose . The after lift was therefore lowered 9 inches ( 229 mm ) , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest of the flight deck . Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October . Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters , four Sopwith Camel fighters , two Airco <unk> and two Fairey floatplanes . Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier , as happened three times during the cruise . 
 After the ship 's return from its cruise , a conference was convened aboard Argus on 19 May to consider revised landing arrangements . It was decided that a longer system of wires was needed , and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed . Powered palisades were also needed on the side of the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire . The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier Eagle later in the year and Argus ' arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise , during which the ship carried ten Parnall Panther spotter and reconnaissance aircraft and three Fairey IIIC reconnaissance aircraft . In addition , the ship 's after lift was permanently locked in the raised position and 150 long tons ( 150 t ) of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship . This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made , only two of which resulted in serious accidents , an accident rate comparable to those of land @-@ based units . The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise , primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start . 
 On September 1922 , Argus , equipped with Gloster <unk> fighters , was deployed to the Dardanelles as a response to the Chanak crisis . As well as operating her own aircraft , Argus was used to fly off Bristol Fighters that had been ferried to the Dardanelles aboard the seaplane carrier Ark Royal to an airfield at Kilia on the European side of the straits . ( The aircraft could not be flown off Ark Royal since it was a seaplane carrier with no flight deck . The Bristol Fighters were transferred to Argus by crane ) . 
 In July 1922 , Argus was inclined to evaluate her stability in light of the additional weights that had been added since her completion and it was discovered that her metacentric height had been reduced by 0 @.@ 83 feet ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) . The Director of Naval Construction proposed to fit her with a girdle at her waterline to increase her beam and thus her stability . He intended to do this under the 1923 – 1924 Naval Programme , but this was delayed several times as the ship was needed for training and when she was finally modified it was under the 1925 – 1926 Naval Programme . <unk> increased her deep displacement to 16 @,@ 750 long tons ( 17 @,@ 020 t ) and her beam to 74 feet ( 22 @.@ 6 m ) , and reduced her draught to 22 feet 10 inches ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) and her speed by a quarter of a knot . The ship was also fitted with bulk petrol storage , new four @-@ inch guns that used fixed ammunition , and new radio masts . 
 Argus usually operated about 15 aircraft during the 1920s . This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters ( Gloster Nightjars or Fairey Flycatchers ) , one of spotters ( Parnall Panthers or Avro Bisons ) , and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs . 
 The ship 's hull was surveyed in 1927 and anticipated to be sound for another 15 years , and she relieved Hermes on the China Station from 1 September to 20 March 1928 . Sometime after her return , Argus was laid up at Plymouth at 14 @-@ days readiness to save money . Since she was completed before 9 December 1921 , the Washington Naval Treaty classified her as an experimental aircraft carrier and thus she did not need to be scrapped to release treaty @-@ limited tonnage for new construction . The ship was reduced to Extended Reserve ( four months readiness ) at Rosyth in September 1932 . In February 1936 , it was decided to refit the ship as a tender for Queen Bee target drones . The opportunity was taken to widen her flight deck by 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) and replace her old boilers with six new destroyer @-@ type boilers which could generate more steam than her turbines could handle . The ship was intended to have one hydro @-@ pneumatic aircraft catapult , but this was instead diverted to Ark Royal . Since Argus was now classified as a naval auxiliary , her four @-@ inch guns were removed . Her refit was completed on 30 July 1938 and she underwent sea trials the following month .

 After recommissioning , Argus served as a training carrier to allow pilots to practice their deck @-@ landing skills . She was carrying out this duty in the Gulf of Lion when the Second World War began . By April 1940 , the ship had been rearmed with two QF Mk V 4 @-@ inch anti @-@ aircraft guns on her quarterdeck , as well as three quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mounts ; one of these was on each side of her hull and the third was on the centreline of the quarterdeck . Together with the battlecruiser Hood and six destroyers , Argus escorted Convoy US @-@ 3 , loaded with Australian and New Zealand troops , to the United Kingdom in mid @-@ June . A week later , she ferried Supermarine Walrus amphibians of 701 Squadron to Reykjavík , Iceland . Argus loaded a dozen Hawker Hurricane and two Blackburn Skua fighters of 418 Flight RAF in late July for delivery to Malta as part of Operation Hurry . Escorted by Ark Royal , three battleships , two cruisers and 10 destroyers , the ship flew them off without incident on 2 August 1940 from a point west of Sicily , although two of the Hurricanes crashed on landing . Accompanied by the battleship Valiant and escorted by two destroyers , she returned to Liverpool to load 30 Hurricanes with their wings removed . Argus sailed on 22 August and arrived at Takoradi on the Gold Coast on 5 September where her aircraft were off @-@ loaded . After her return to the United Kingdom , the ship was briefly refitted and she ferried 701 Squadron back to the United Kingdom in late October . 
 On 11 November , Argus sailed again from Liverpool with a deck @-@ load of a dozen Hurricanes and two Skuas for delivery to Malta ( Operation White ) . She rendezvoused with Force H four days later and launched the aircraft on the morning of 17 November . Eight of the Hurricanes ran out of fuel en route due to headwinds and one Skua was forced to crash land on Sicily after it had been damaged by Italian flak . In mid @-@ December , the ship embarked six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of <unk> Squadron for delivery to Gibraltar and another pair of Swordfish from 825 Squadron for self @-@ defence . The carrier rendezvoused with Furious and Convoy WS @-@ 5A before the combined force was discovered by the German cruiser Admiral Hipper on 25 December , but little damage was inflicted by Hipper before she was driven off by the escorts . No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in Argus with bombs that they could not carry and the torpedoes were aboard Furious . After Furious 's Skuas had flown off to search for Hipper , space was cleared to allow Argus 's Swordfish to load the torpedoes , but the Skuas could not locate Hipper because of the poor visibility . Argus delivered <unk> Squadron to Gibraltar and was back in the United Kingdom by 14 January 1941 . 
 In March , the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March , where they were loaded onto Ark Royal and flown off to Malta a few days later . She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of 812 Squadron for self @-@ defence . After a brief refit , Argus sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to Ark Royal . She arrived on 24 April and began a two @-@ week refit after the aircraft were transferred . The ship was back in the United Kingdom , loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar . Three Fulmars of <unk> Squadron were also embarked to protect the ship against the Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 Condors that patrolled the Bay of Biscay and the Eastern Atlantic . The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft , including <unk> Squadron . On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit . 
 In late August to early September , Argus transported 24 Hurricanes of No. 151 Wing RAF to Murmansk , Russia . She then ferried a dozen Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 828 Squadron to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta . She was to ferry the fighters of 804 Squadron on her return trip to England , but this was cancelled . Eventually , the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied Eagle back to the United Kingdom on 20 October . Argus loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from 818 Squadron and two Sea Hurricanes from <unk> Squadron for self @-@ defence . The ship arrived on 8 November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal . Two days later , the two carriers , in Operation Perpetual , sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes ; three of the fighters were lost en route . Ark Royal was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar , which forced Argus to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available . 
 Force H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and Argus loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection . Whilst in the United Kingdom , she loaded some Supermarine Spitfire fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February . There , the ship transferred the Spitfires to Eagle and embarked nine Fairey Fulmar fighters of 807 Squadron . The plan for Operation Spotter I was for Argus to provide fighter cover for Eagle as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta , but the operation had to be cancelled when the long @-@ range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective . The problems were not rectified until 7 March , when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off . During Operation Picket I , nine more Spitfires were flown off by Eagle on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane <unk> from 804 Squadron provided air cover from Argus . The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when Eagle flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from Argus . The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well , but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly @-@ off was cancelled . 
 Another attempt to deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during Operation LB . As usual , Argus provided the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and Eagle ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take @-@ off point for Malta on 19 May . The Spitfires were flown off successfully , but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and they were forced to return to the carrier . Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to " Winter " rather than " Summer " . One of the Fulmars was shot down by Vichy French Dewoitine D.520 fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat that had been shot down earlier . By this time the ship 's Vickers .50 @-@ calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 Oerlikon 20 mm light anti @-@ aircraft guns . 
 Afterwards , the ship returned to the UK to ferry 801 Squadron to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7 June . Together with Eagle , Argus was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June ( Operation Harpoon ) . The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron , nine Swordfish from 813 Squadron and four more Swordfish from 824 Squadron to protect the convoy from submarines while Eagle loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons . One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side . Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers , but they likely shot down one Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 and one CANT Z.1007 bomber . Eagle transferred her Fulmars to Argus over the course of the battle and two more were lost later in the day . The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect . 
 As part of the preparations for another resupply convoy for Malta ( Operation Pedestal ) , Argus returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft , including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron , for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the Clyde on 2 August for Gibraltar . The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5 August for a three @-@ day training exercise to work out coordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed not ready for combat . It was ordered to return to the UK aboard Argus . 
 In November 1942 , Argus was assigned to the Eastern Naval Task Force that invaded Algiers , Algeria , during the Allied landings in French North Africa with 18 Supermarine Seafire IICs of 880 Squadron aboard . The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that killed four men . She and the escort carrier Avenger joined a convoy returning to the United Kingdom on the evening of 14 / 15 November that was spotted by the Germans . The German submarine U @-@ 155 torpedoed Avenger , right behind Argus in the convoy , later that morning . The ship was under repair for a month after she reached the United Kingdom , but she required a more thorough refit that lasted from February to May 1943 . Reclassified as an escort carrier after the completion of her refit , she was relegated to deck @-@ landing training . She was ordered to be paid off on 27 January 1944 , but this order was apparently revoked as she continued training until 27 September 1944 when the last take @-@ off was made from her deck . In March , she was ordered to be converted to an aircraft freighter around the end of the year , but this plan was also apparently cancelled . Argus became an accommodation ship at Chatham in December and she was approved for scrapping on 6 May 1946 . She was sold to Thomas W. Ward on 5 December 1946 and arrived at Inverkeithing later that month to be broken up . 
 = Tapestry ( Star Trek : The Next Generation ) = 
 " Tapestry " is the 15th episode of the sixth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation , the 141st overall . It was originally released on February 15 , 1993 , in broadcast syndication . Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise . Ronald D. Moore was credited with writing the episode , but the basis of the story was a collaborative effort from the writing crew . " Tapestry " was directed by Les Landau , with the title coming from executive producer Michael Piller . 
 In this episode , Q ( John de Lancie ) allows a supposedly deceased Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) to re @-@ visit a pivotal event in his youth that he since regrets . Picard changes the past , but upon returning to the present he finds that it made him the man he became . He returns once more to the past and returns it to the way it originally took place . Picard wakes up in the present , unsure if the events took place or if it was as a result of his injury . 
 A number of previously screen used props were used , including some from the 1956 film The Ten Commandments , and from previous episodes . The white room scenes were problematic as there were concerns that the all @-@ white robe worn by de Lancie would make him appear to be a floating head on camera . While Moore was pleased with the episode , Piller was not and some fans complained that it glorified violence . " Tapestry " received Nielsen ratings of 13 @.@ 8 percent , and critics responded very positively with praise directed to the chemistry between Stewart and de Lancie . 
 = = Plot = = 
 During a diplomatic mission , Captain Picard is shot by terrorists and dies . He awakes to find himself in an <unk> realm , where he is greeted by Q. Q explains that the energy blast that hit Picard destroyed his artificial heart , and that a natural heart would have survived . Picard lost his original heart during his cadet years when he was stabbed through the chest during a bar brawl , an event that he regrets and led to him becoming the disciplined and restrained man he is today . When Picard remarks that he would do things differently if he could relive that moment , Q sends Picard back in time to two days before the brawl , where he meets with fellow cadets and friends Corey Zweller and Marta <unk> . They are surprised by the personality changes in Picard . 
 Zweller is cheated by a group of Nausicaans at a bar game , and he plans his revenge by rigging the next match . When the Nausicaans lose , they are enraged and goad Zweller . But instead of joining the fight as he did before , Picard holds Zweller back , averting tragedy but humiliating his friend . Picard then is returned to the present by Q. Instead of being the captain , Picard is now a junior lieutenant in the astrophysics department of the Enterprise . In this new life , he has led an unremarkable career doing routine work . Picard consults Commander Riker and Counselor Troi , who explain that his aversion to risk means he never distinguishes himself . 
 Picard confronts Q , who tells him that although the bout with the <unk> nearly cost him his life , it also gave him a sense of his mortality . It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe . Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore the consequences of his indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself . Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody . Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally , with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor . In the present , Picard awakens in sickbay , a Captain again . As Picard recovers from his injury , he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q 's tricks or merely a dream . Nevertheless , he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him .

 = = = Writing = = = 
 This was the first time that Ronald D. Moore wrote a Q @-@ based episode , and he was excited by the idea of giving Picard a near death experience and Q appearing to the Captain as if he were God . His plan for " Tapestry " was to follow a similar path to Charles Dickens ' A Christmas Carol , but with Q playing a similar role to the three ghosts in Dickens ' story . Moore envisaged three stages to the story , one where Picard is attacked and needs an artificial heart , another with Picard as a child and a third based on the USS Stargazer . He pitched the idea to executive producer Michael Piller , who wasn 't enthusiastic about the premise . The combination of that disapproval and the expected cost of filming because of the additional sets required meant that the episode had to be trimmed . 
 Moore discussed the idea with other members of the writing staff ; they focused on the incident which caused Picard to require an artificial heart . It had previously been mentioned in the episodes " Samaritan Snare " and " Final Mission " . They compared Picard to Captain James T. Kirk , describing them as opposites in terms of development . They saw Picard being a <unk> during his time at Starfleet Academy , only to become more serious later . The reverse for true for Kirk , with the staff describing him as a " bookworm " while at the Academy and only becoming " crazy " once posted to a starship . Together , they sought for a way to support Picard 's claim in " Samaritan Snare " that he laughed when he was stabbed . Story editor René Echevarria said that " It made us all think we had really come up with the right story for the premise and tying that together , I think it 's one of the finest efforts ever . " While Moore called the episode " A Q Carol " based on the original premise , but Piller was the one to suggest " Tapestry " as he said " you have to learn to set your part of the tapestry of your life " . 
 However the writers could not remember the source of the " white room " idea , and it was only after the episode aired that James Mooring contacted the staff . He had submitted a spec script featuring a similar idea . Producer Jeri Taylor admitted that the similarity was unintentional , and after both she and Moore spoke to Mooring , the matter was settled . Mooring was paid , and his contribution to the episode was acknowledged by the staff . There were several changes made to the script prior to filming , including the removal of Edward <unk> as the Captain of the Enterprise in Picard 's alternative future and clarification that the stabbing of Picard was not the major event in his life which Boothby described in " The First Duty " . 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 John de Lancie returned to the series in " Tapestry " as Q , having appeared on a regular basis since his first appearance in the pilot , " Encounter at Farpoint " . He had already appeared twice during the 1992 / 93 television series as the character , both earlier in the season in " True Q " as well as the Star Trek : Deep Space Nine episode " Q @-@ Less " . De Lancie thought that the script for " Tapestry " was " terrific " , and praised the speech he got to perform at the end of the episode . 
 Appearing for the first time in Star Trek was J.C. Brandy as Marta <unk> . She was nervous and intimidated to work with Patrick Stewart , but said that everyone on the cast and crew made her feel welcome . However , there were concerns when she first arrived on set for costume fitting as she looked quite young , and Stewart was worried about the age difference on screen . Director Les Landau requested that the hair and make @-@ up on Brandy should make her look older . Brandy said that this " worked nicely " , but they still " downplayed the sex " . She was pleased with her scenes with Stewart , as they managed to capture a " nervousness and innocence " in Picard and Marta 's relationship . The episode marked the first appearance of the Nausicaans on screen with Clint Carmichael playing the lead alien , although they had been mentioned earlier in the episode " Samaritan Snare " . The two non @-@ speaking members of the race were portrayed by stunt men Tom Morta and Dick Dimitri , they duo appeared on screen without make @-@ up in the episodes " A Fistful of Datas " and " Emergence " respectively . 
 A significant number of previously created costumes and make @-@ up were included in the bar room scenes in " Tapestry " . There were notes from the producers not to include any Ferengi , as at that point the Federation had not yet made first contact with them . The scene featured both Anticans and Selay close to one another , despite being at war at the time that this flashback scene was set and only making peace earlier in The Next Generation in the episode " Lonely Among Us " . Several of the glasses and other props in this scene were from a collection that Paramount had stored from the 1956 Charlton Heston film , The Ten Commandments . There were problems with the audio recordings of some scenes with Stewart and Brandy , as the camera dolly was noisy which required them to re @-@ record their lines later so that they could be dubbed over the originals . Brandy was " amazed " that there was no difference she could tell in Stewart 's performance , but felt that it took away an element from her performance . 
 The scenes with Q and Picard together on a white background were compared to those in the Warren Beatty and Buck Henry 1978 film Heaven Can Wait by producer Merri Howard and director of photography Jonathan West . These particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by the director of photography that Q 's white robes would not show up on camera well against the all @-@ white background . They were worried that he might appear simply as a floating head . With both de Lancie and Stewart anticipating re @-@ shoots for these scenes , they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances . However this was filmed late on the last day ; de Lancie said that it resulted in both of them looking quite tired . Some scenes were cut in order to reduce the episode down to the required length . This included a one @-@ page monologue by Marta which would have taken place on the morning after her liaison with Picard , a scene where Picard was to report to La Forge in engineering , audio mention of Dr. <unk> and a mention of Scobee Hall – a reference to Dick Scobee , the commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger at the time of the destruction of the vessel .

 Michele and Duncan Barrett describe in their book Star Trek : The Human Frontier , that " Tapestry " has " complex implications " as it demonstrates who a person is by the experiences they have had throughout their life as well as who that person truly is . They also wrote that Picard was not required to pay a price for his resurrection at the hands of Q due to " popular narrative being what it is " . In Atara Stein 's The Byronic Hero in Film , Fiction , and Television , the author describes " Tapestry " as showing a change in Q from his usual satanic stance and instead taking on the role of Picard 's guardian angel . Stein also references the alien 's increasing influence on the personal lives of the Enterprise crew , a path which Q began in the episode " Hide and Q " .

 While the majority of the staff were pleased with " Tapestry " , Piller felt that the premise was tired and was concerned that it was simply a take on the film It 's a Wonderful Life . He said that some scenes were " very talky " , and the direction and some performances were " flat " . Moore participated in an AOL chat in 1997 , where he described " Tapestry " as " one of the best things I wrote and one of TNG 's finest episodes " . Some fans wrote in to the staff to complain that the episode glorified violence , and was against the principles of Star Trek . Jeri Taylor admitted that the episode could be seen as violent , but it never crossed the mind of any of the staff during production . She went on to say that if they had realised that " Tapestry " could be considered to promote violence , then they would have corrected it to ensure that it wouldn 't be viewed as such .

 Reviewers responded positively to " Tapestry " . Zack Handlen , while writing for the A.V. Club , compared " Tapestry " to the television series Quantum Leap with the older Picard jumping into the younger man 's body . He also said it had the " feel " of A Christmas Carol , and that it was a " modest episode , with a modest goal : to remind us that the we are the sum of all our parts , even the ones we aren 't very proud of . " He gave the episode a rating of " A " . In DeCandido 's review of " Tapestry " for Tor.com , he compared the episode to It 's a Wonderful Life , and called it one of the " finest hours " of the series . He praised " Tapestry " for endorsing the Q / Picard chemistry at the heart of Q episodes , and said that Stewart and de Lancie " play off each other magnificently " . He gave it a rating of 9 out of 10 . 
 In their book The Unauthorized Trek : The Complete Next Generation , James Van Hise and Hal Schuster described the scene where Picard was stabbed through the chest as " particularly violent " , and overall said that " Tapestry " was a good story . They also described the view of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry towards religion , saying that in his world the Q Continuum aren 't gods but are instead an " evolutionary niche higher than mere mortals " . Mark Clark , in his book Star Trek FAQ 2 @.@ 0 , called Stewart 's performance " richly nuanced " and " soul searching " . Clark said that this episode was as important to Picard as the events in " The Best of Both Worlds " , " The Inner Light " and " Chain of Command " . He said that the events of " Tapestry " explored Picard 's soul . 
 The episode has been included in " best of " lists for both specifically The Next Generation and more generally for the entire franchise . It ranked fourth in Entertainment Weekly 's list of top 10 Star Trek : The Next Generation episodes , 22nd out of the top 100 of the entire franchise in Charlie Jane Anders ' list for io9 , and 7th out of the various Star Trek episodes involving time travel by James Hunt at Den of Geek . Witney Seibold , on the website Crave Online said that " Tapestry " was the best instalment of The Next Generation , describing it as " one of the more philosophical episodes " .

 " Tapestry " was released in the UK on a two @-@ episode VHS tape in 2003 , alongside the first part of " Birthright " . The first home media release of " Tapestry " in the United States was on the VHS box set entitled Star Trek – The Next Generation : The Q Continuum on June 18 , 1996 . It later received an individual release on August 4 , 1998 . Paramount deliberately delayed the individual release of Star Trek episodes on VHS within the United States in order to allow for the syndicated series to be shown once more in full . The inclusion of " Tapestry " in The Q Continuum boxed set ahead of the individual release of the episode was intended as an incentive to purchase the set . 
 The episode was released as part of the Star Trek : The Next Generation season six DVD box set in the United States on December 3 , 2002 . It received a further releases on DVD as part of compilation collections of episodes . This included the The Jean @-@ Luc Picard Collection , which was released in the United States on August 3 , 2004 , also the Star Trek : Q Fan Collective , which was released in the United States on June 6 , 2006 , and later that year in the UK on September 4 . A further DVD release came as part of The Best of Star Trek : The Next Generation – Volume 2 on November 17 , 2009 , in the United States . The most recent release was the first on Blu @-@ ray disc , which took place on June 24 , 2014 ; this also added an audio commentary track for the episode for the first time . 
 Keith DeCandido described Picard 's laugh at being stabbed in " Tapestry " as being " critical to the plot " of his non @-@ canon Star Trek novel Q & A. The novel also includes Q 's white room , and features a similar alternative universe where Picard followed a career in the sciences . A figure of Captain Picard based on " Tapestry " was released by Playmates Toys in 1996 , which was a limited edition release of 1 @,@ 701 . 
 = Scott Zolak = 
 Scott David Zolak ( born December 13 , 1967 ) is a broadcaster and retired American football quarterback who played in the National Football League ( NFL ) for nine seasons . Over the course of his career , he played in 55 games for the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins , completed 124 of 248 passes for 1 @,@ 314 yards , threw eight touchdowns and seven interceptions , and finished his career with a passer rating of 64 @.@ 8 . 
 A graduate of Ringgold High School and the University of Maryland , Zolak was selected 84th in the 1991 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots . He did not play in 1991 , but started a few games in 1992 and had his most productive season statistically . When Drew Bledsoe was drafted in 1993 , Zolak became his backup for the next six seasons . He appeared as a replacement for Bledsoe when he was hurt , but only started three games during this time . He was released at the end of the 1998 season , and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999 , playing in one game for Miami before retiring . After his retirement , he became a sportscaster and football analyst in the New England area .

 Zolak was born on December 13 , 1967 in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . As a child , he acted as the <unk> for the football team at Ringgold High School in Monongahela , Pennsylvania , where his father , Paul , worked as head coach and athletic director . Future NFL quarterback Joe Montana played for Ringgold during this time and gave Zolak a football , which he later rubbed for good luck before every game . When Zolak attended Ringgold High School himself , he was the team 's starting quarterback and punter , and lettered four times . Zolak also played on the Ringgold basketball team as a forward , and was a four @-@ time letterman in that sport as well . As a result of his football performance , he was invited to participate in the Big 33 Football Classic , which featured the top high school football players in Pennsylvania . 
 = = = College = = = 
 After graduating from high school , Zolak played college football at the University of Maryland . He sat out his freshmen year , and became the third @-@ string quarterback behind Dan Henning and Neil O 'Donnell after two quarterbacks transferred . By the end of his sophomore season , Zolak was challenging O 'Donnell for the starting job after Henning graduated . As his junior year began , in the summer of 1988 , offensive coordinator Bob <unk> said that Zolak was making tremendous strides as a quarterback , but O 'Donnell was the starting quarterback that year . Zolak 's first collegiate appearance came against West Virginia . He completed four of six passes for 28 yards , but had an interception returned for a touchdown by Bo Orlando in a 55 – 24 loss . He appeared in four games for Maryland that season . 
 Zolak was again the backup behind O 'Donnell in 1989 . He played in eight games , completing 33 of 69 passes for 407 yards and two touchdowns . In 1990 , after O 'Donnell graduated and began his NFL career , Zolak became the starter for Maryland , and head coach Joe Krivak had high hopes for him heading into the season . In his first start as a senior , Zolak completed a school record 28 passes in 46 attempts for 303 yards and two touchdowns , including a 51 @-@ yard pass to Gene Thomas with 61 seconds left that gave Maryland the win against Virginia Tech , 20 – 13 . The following week , he once more featured in a dramatic conclusion , throwing a 59 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Gene Thomas with 2 : 27 left to beat 25th ranked West Virginia , 14 – 10 . However , he was struggling in other aspects of his game . In an October game against Georgia Tech , Zolak was sacked 10 times . In four games , he had been sacked 23 times and had a pass intercepted 12 times . By the end of the season , as Maryland was preparing to face Louisiana Tech in the 1990 Independence Bowl , he had thrown 225 completed passes in 418 attempts for 2 @,@ 589 yards and 10 touchdowns . The teams tied , 34 – 34 , in Zolak 's final collegiate appearance . At the time of his graduation , he ranked fifth in school history with 270 pass completions , seventh with 3 @,@ 124 career passing yards , and second with 2 @,@ 589 passing yards in a season . He was also named Atlantic Coast Conference Offensive Player of the Week four times .

 With the 84th pick in the fourth round of the 1991 NFL Draft , Zolak was selected by the New England Patriots . Scouting reports noted that his size and arm strength were great for the NFL , though there were concerns about his accuracy . Upon drafting him , Patriots Vice President of Player Operations Joe Mendes agreed that his size and arm would translate to the NFL , and he was not worried about any accuracy issues . His drafting led to a shakeup with the Patriots ' current quarterbacks , as Marc Wilson announced his retirement and longtime starting quarterback Steve Grogan was released . Zolak agreed on a contract with the Patriots in July , and was the second @-@ to @-@ last person to hold out after Leonard Russell . Zolak spent the 1991 season as the third @-@ string quarterback , behind Hugh Millen and Tom Hodson , and did not take the field . 
 At the start of the 1992 season , Zolak also looked unlikely to appear , being behind Hodson and Millen on the depth chart . Millen started the first five games before being injured , and then Hodson became the starter . In early November , Zolak made his professional debut in the fourth quarter against the New Orleans Saints . Relieving Hodson , he completed five of nine passes and threw an interception as the Patriots lost , 31 – 14 . The next week , Zolak made his first career start when the still winless Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts . He completed 20 of 29 passes for 261 yards , two touchdowns , and an interception in the Patriots ' first win of the season , 37 – 34 . As a result of his performance , he was named the American Football Conference ( AFC ) Player of the Week . The next week , Zolak led his team to their second victory of the season against the New York Jets . He completed seven of 16 passes for 102 yards , getting help from Jon Vaughn who had 110 rushing yards , and the Patriots won , 24 – 3 . However , the following week 's performance against the Atlanta Falcons was less impressive . He completed nine of 16 passes for 58 yards and two interceptions in the Patriots ' losing effort , and he said it felt like he was " on a desert island by myself . " After Zolak 's performance against Atlanta , he lost the starting job , and Millen again filled that role . However , Millen suffered a shoulder injury against the Colts , and after Zolak played part of the game against Indianapolis , he again became the starter for the game against the Kansas City Chiefs . Zolak injured his ankle at the end of the third quarter , making the appearance against Kansas City his last for the season as Jeff Carlson took over quarterbacking duties . Zolak finished the season with 52 pass completions in 100 attempts , 561 yards , two touchdowns , four interceptions , and a quarterback rating of 58 @.@ 8 . 
 In 1993 , the Patriots and new head coach Bill Parcells were looking to improve the quarterback spot on their roster . They signed Scott Secules , and attempted to sign Steve <unk> , but the latter deal did not happen . They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade . In April , Millen was traded to the Dallas Cowboys , and the Patriots chose Drew Bledsoe with the first pick in the 1993 NFL Draft . During the offseason , Carlson was released , leaving Secules , Zolak , Bledsoe , and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster . By the end of the preseason , Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut , with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third @-@ string quarterback . Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993 , and threw two incomplete passes . He became a restricted free agent in the offseason , but re @-@ signed with the Patriots for three years . As Secules was released during preseason , Zolak was set as Bledsoe 's backup as the 1994 season began . As was the case in the 1993 season , he did not make a starting appearance , as Bledsoe played the full 16 games , however Zolak did see action in every game , primarily as the holder for extra point and field goal attempts . Over the course of the season , he completed five of eight passes for 28 yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback . The 1995 season was similar , with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up . In September , Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal , allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992 . On October 1 , 1995 , Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons , and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252 yards and a touchdown , though the Patriots lost the game , 30 – 17 . Although Bledsoe 's doctors wanted him to sit out another week , he refused and played the next week 's game against the Denver Broncos . This again relegated Zolak to the backup position , where he remained for the rest of the season . He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282 yards , a touchdown , and a quarterback rating of 80 @.@ 5 . 
 The 1996 season began well for Zolak , whose contract was extended through 1998 . However , to remain with the Patriots , Zolak took a $ 250 @,@ 000 pay cut to work around the salary cap . While he appeared set to keep his backup job heading into training camp , he faced tough competition from Jay Barker . While Zolak welcomed the challenge , his status as the backup quarterback began to seem uncertain a few weeks into training camp . By the end of training camp , Barker had been cut , and Zolak 's quarterback job was safe . He took the role of emergency quarterback throughout the 1996 season , with Bledsoe taking nearly all the snaps and Tom Tupa serving as the backup upon his signing . Zolak played in three games , completing one pass for five yards . He saw some playing time in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers , but did not play in Super Bowl XXXI . Parcells ordered Zolak to lose weight , which Zolak did throughout much of the season . The 1997 season was more of the same for Zolak , backing up Bledsoe , though the Patriots did have a new coach in Pete Carroll . As training camp ended , Zolak gained significantly more playing time during drills and the preseason matchups then he had under Parcells . As the regular season came and went , however , he had minimal playing time . Zolak saw action in four games , completing six of nine passes for 67 yards and two touchdowns , giving him a quarterback rating of 128 @.@ 2 . 
 With Zolak coming to the final year of his contract in 1998 , he sat in his usual spot on the depth chart , in between starter Bledsoe and third stringer Tupa . He saw playing time in three games during the first three months of the season in relief of Bledsoe . His most significant appearance during this time came against the Atlanta Falcons on November 8 , 1998 , where he completed three of ten passes for 33 yards and an interception in a 41 – 10 loss . Near the end of the month , Bledsoe was sidelined with an injury and was questionable for the final November game . Bledsoe played in three more games , but his injury kept him from playing in the final two , giving Zolak his first starting appearance since 1995 . Zolak 's first start came against the San Francisco 49ers on December 20 . He completed 14 of 30 passes for 205 yards , two touchdowns and two interceptions and won the game , 24 – 21 . He faced the New York Jets the following week , completing 14 of 31 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown , but lost the game 31 – 10 . Zolak finished the season with his most productive totals since 1992 . He played in six games and started two , completed 32 of 75 passes for 371 yards , three touchdowns , 3 interceptions , and had a passer rating of 61 @.@ 8 . Zolak 's last appearance for the Patriots occurred in the playoffs , as Bledsoe was still injured , against the Jacksonville Jaguars . He completed 21 of 44 passes as the Jaguars eliminated the Patriots from playoff contention in a 25 – 10 loss . He became an unrestricted free agent after the season ended , but was not asked back by the Patriots , ending his tenure there .

 After leaving the Patriots , Zolak was signed to a one @-@ year contract by the New York Jets . With Vinny Testaverde considered the starter , Zolak was competing against Ray Lucas for a backup job . He was the second @-@ string quarterback as training camp began , but his competition increased when the Jets signed Rick <unk> and left three quarterbacks to battle for two open spots on the team . Two days after acquiring <unk> from the Green Bay Packers , the Jets released Zolak . In October , Zolak was signed to a one @-@ year deal by the Miami Dolphins to serve as the backup quarterback behind Damon Huard and Jim Druckenmiller . He was later made the backup behind Huard , and made his only appearance of the season on November 21 , failing to complete a pass in four attempts against the Patriots . As the 1999 season wrapped up , the Dolphins signed Zolak to a contract extension , keeping him on the team for another year . Despite the retirement of Dan Marino , the Dolphins cut Zolak in May 2000 . Zolak trained for the Detroit Lions during the summer after they lost Mike Tomczak for the season , but instead he signed on as a host for Patriots Gameday alongside Bob Lobel in August , ending his professional football career . 
 His career ended after an unfortunate accident shagging fly balls at a charity softball event .

 = James McCune Smith = 
 James McCune Smith ( April 18 , 1813 – November 17 , 1865 ) was an American physician , apothecary , abolitionist , and author . He is the first African American to hold a medical degree and graduated at the top in his class at the University of Glasgow , Scotland . He was the first African American to run a pharmacy in the United States . 
 In addition to practicing as a doctor for nearly 20 years at the Colored Orphan Asylum in Manhattan , Smith was a public intellectual : he contributed articles to medical journals , participated in learned societies , and wrote numerous essays and articles drawing from his medical and statistical training . He used his training in medicine and statistics to refute common misconceptions about race , intelligence , medicine , and society in general . Invited as a founding member of the New York Statistics Society in 1852 , which promoted a new science , he was elected as a member in 1854 of the recently founded American Geographic Society . But , he was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local medical associations . 
 He has been most well known for his leadership as an abolitionist ; a member of the American Anti @-@ Slavery Society , with Frederick Douglass he helped start the National Council of Colored People in 1853 , the first permanent national organization for blacks . Douglass said that Smith was " the single most important influence on his life . " Smith was one of the Committee of Thirteen , who organized in 1850 in New York City to resist the newly passed Fugitive Slave Law by aiding fugitive slaves through the Underground Railroad . Other leading abolitionist activists were among his friends and colleagues . From the 1840s , he lectured on race and abolitionism and wrote numerous articles to refute racist ideas about black capacities . 
 Both Smith and his wife were of mixed @-@ race African and European ancestry . As he became economically successful , he built a house in a good neighborhood ; in the 1860 census he and his family were classified in that neighborhood as white , whereas in 1850 they were classified as mulatto . He served for nearly 20 years as the doctor at the Colored Orphan Asylum in New York but , after it was burned down in July 1863 by a mob in the New York Draft Riots , in which nearly 100 blacks were killed , Smith moved his family and practice out to Brooklyn for safety . The parents stressed education for their children . In the 1870 census , his widow and children continued to be classified as white . To escape racial discrimination , his children passed into white society : the four surviving sons married white spouses ; his unmarried daughter lived with a brother . They worked as teachers , a lawyer , and business people . 
 Smith 's unique achievements as a pioneering African @-@ American doctor were rediscovered by twentieth @-@ century historians . They were <unk> by his descendants in the twenty @-@ first century when a three @-@ times @-@ great @-@ granddaughter took a history class and found his name in her grandmother 's family bible . In 2010 , several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn . They gathered to honor him and their African @-@ American ancestry . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Smith was born free in 1813 in New York City ( New York state had passed gradual abolition in 1799 ; children of slave mothers were born free but had to serve an indenture until early adulthood . ) His mother , believed to be Lavinia Smith , achieved her freedom later in life ; she said she was a " self @-@ emancipated woman . " She was born into slavery South Carolina and had been brought to New York as a slave . His father was Samuel Smith , a white merchant and his mother 's master , who had brought her with him to New York from South Carolina . 
 The boy grew up only with his mother . As an adult , James Smith alluded to other white ancestry through his mother 's family , saying he had kin in the South , some of whom were slaveholders and others slaves . 
 Smith attended the African Free School ( AFS ) # 2 on Mulberry Street in Manhattan , where he was described as an " exceptionally bright student " . He was among numerous boys who went on to have brilliant careers , some of whom he worked with in the abolitionist cause . In the course of his studies , Smith was tutored by Rev. Peter Williams , Jr . , a graduate of the African Free School who had been ordained in 1826 as the second African @-@ American priest in the Episcopal Church . ( Williams had founded St. Philip 's African Church in New York City . ) Upon graduation , Smith applied to Columbia University and Geneva Medical College in New York State , but was denied admission due to racial discrimination . 
 Williams encouraged Smith to attend the University of Glasgow in Scotland . He and abolitionist benefactors of the AFS provided Smith with money for his trip overseas and his education . Smith kept a journal of his sea voyage that expressed his sense of mission . After arriving in Liverpool and walking along the waterfront , he thought , " I am free ! " Through abolitionist connections , he was welcomed there by members of the London Agency Anti @-@ Slavery Society . According to the historian Thomas M. Morgan , Smith enjoyed the relative racial tolerance in Scotland and England , which officially abolished slavery in 1833 . ( New York had finally abolished all slavery in 1826 . ) He studied and graduated at the top of his class . He obtained a bachelor 's degree in 1835 , a master 's degree in 1836 , and a medical degree in 1837 . He also completed an internship in Paris . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 After his return to New York and getting established , in the early 1840s Smith married Malvina Barnet ( <unk> - ) , a free woman of color who was a graduate of the Rutger Female Institute . They had eleven children and five survived to adulthood . The name of one of the children is unknown : 
 Frederick Douglass ( d . 1854 ) , not to be confused with Frederick Douglass 
 Peter Williams ( d . 1854 ) 
 Mary S. 
 James W. ( born 1845 ) became a teacher ; he married and had an independent household by 1870 . 
 Henry M. ( 1847 - d. before 1859 ) 
 Amy G. ( <unk> @-@ 1849 - d . December 1849 ) 
 Mary ( also called Maude ) , born <unk> @-@ 56 ; never married ; became a teacher and was living with her widowed brother Donald in 1900 in Queens . ( Note : In the 1900 census , her birth was reported as September 1842 , but this is not consistent with her age in the 1860 and 1870 censuses , and she did not appear in the 1850 census . ) 
 Donald ( born 1858 ) became a lawyer , married and was a widower by 1900 , living in Queens . His household included his older sister Maude and two siblings of his late wife : his widowed brother @-@ in @-@ law Edward , a physician born in England , and sister @-@ in @-@ law Emma Callaghan , an unmarried teacher . 
 John M. ( born February 1860 ) worked in Florida in an orange grove in the 1880s , per the Florida 1885 census . He married in 1888 , and their three children were born in Florida . By 1900 had returned with his family to Brooklyn , where he worked as a printer . 
 Guy B. , born 1862 , first worked as a seaman . By 1900 , he was married with several children and worked as a salesman . His youngest daughter was named Antoinette . 
 In 1850 , the senior Smith 's household included four older women : Lavinia Smith , age 67 ( his mother : b. <unk> - d. <unk> @-@ 1870 ) , born in South Carolina and listed first as head of household ; Sarah Williams , 57 ; Amelia Jones , 47 ; and Mary <unk> , 53 , who were likely relatives or friends . By then Smith and his wife Malvina had three children : James , Henry and Amy . Each member of the household was classified as mulatto ( or of mixed ancestry ) , and all but Lavinia Smith were born in New York . They lived in a mixed neighborhood in the Fifth Ward ; in the census , nearly all other neighbors on the page were classified as white ; many were immigrants from England , Ireland , and France . 
 By 1860 , Smith was doing very well ; he had moved to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen . His total real property was worth $ 25 @,@ 000 . His household included a live @-@ in servant , Catherine <unk> from Ireland . Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams , 57 , and Mary <unk> ( should be <unk> , as above ) , 50 . ( These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census , although their ages did not change . ) No one on this census page had a racial designation . By the conventions of the time , this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator ; totals of white persons only are given at the bottom of the page . 
 After the 1863 draft riots , Smith and his family were among prominent blacks who left New York and moved to Brooklyn , then still a separate city . He no longer felt safe in his old neighborhood . In the 1870 census , Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15 , Brooklyn . All were listed as white . James W. Smith , who had married a white woman , was living in a separate household and working as a teacher ; he was also classified as white . The Smith children still at home were Maud , 15 ; Donald , 12 ; John , 10 ; and Guy , 8 ; all were attending school . 
 Five Smith children survived to adulthood : James , Maud , Donald , John and Guy . The men married white spouses , but Maud never married . All were classified as white from 1860 on .

 When he returned to New York City in 1837 with his degrees , Smith was greeted as a hero by the black community . He said at a gathering , " I have striven to obtain education , at every sacrifice and every hazard , and to apply such education to the good of our common country . " He was the first university @-@ trained African @-@ American physician in the United States . During his practice of 25 years , he was also the first black to have articles published in American medical journals , but he was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local ones . 
 He established his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine , treating both black and white patients . He also started a school in the evenings , teaching children . He established what has been called the first black @-@ owned and operated pharmacy in the United States , located at 93 West Broadway ( near Foley Square today ) . His friends and activists gathered in the back room of the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism . 
 In 1846 , Smith was appointed as the only doctor of the Colored Orphan Asylum ( also known as the Free Negro Orphan Asylum ) , at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue . ( Before that time , the directors had depended on pro bono services of doctors . ) He worked there for nearly 20 years . The asylum was founded in 1836 by Anna and Hannah Shotwell and Mary Murray , Quaker philanthropists in New York . Trying to protect the children , Smith regularly gave vaccinations for smallpox . Leading causes of death were infectious diseases : measles ( for which there was no vaccine ) , smallpox and tuberculosis ( for which there was no antibiotic at the time ) . In addition to caring for orphans , the home sometimes boarded children temporarily when their parents were unable to support them , as jobs were scarce for free blacks in New York . Waves of immigration from Ireland and Germany in the 1840s and 1850s meant there were many new immigrants competing for work . 
 Smith was always working for the asylum . In July 1852 , he presented the trustees with 5 @,@ 000 acres provided by his friend Gerrit Smith , a wealthy white abolitionist . The land was to be held in trust and later sold for benefit of the orphans . 
 In July 1863 , during the three @-@ day New York Draft Riots , in which most participants were ethnic Irish , rioters attacked and burned down the orphan asylum . The children were saved by the staff and Union troops in the city . During its nearly 30 years , the orphan asylum had admitted 1310 children , and typically had about 200 in residence at a time . After the riots , Smith moved his family and business out of Manhattan , as did other prominent blacks . Numerous buildings were destroyed in their old neighborhoods , and estimates were that 100 blacks were killed in the rioting . No longer feeling safe in the lower Fourth Ward , the Smiths moved to Williamsburg , Brooklyn . 
 = = = Abolitionist movement = = = 
 While in Scotland , Smith joined the Glasgow Emancipation Society and met people in the Scottish and English abolitionist movement . In 1833 Great Britain abolished slavery . When Smith returned to New York , he quickly joined the American Anti @-@ Slavery Society and worked for the cause in the United States . He worked effectively with both black and white abolitionists , for instance maintaining a friendship and correspondence with Gerrit Smith that spanned the years from 1846 @-@ 1865 . 
 Publishing articles quickly brought him to the attention of the national abolitionist movement . His " Destiny of the People of Color " , " Freedom and Slavery for Africans " , and " A lecture on the <unk> Revolution ; with a note on Toussaint L 'Ouverture " , established him as a new force in the field . He directed the Colored People 's Educational Movement ( to the Memory of Abraham Lincoln ) . 
 In 1850 as a member of the Committee of Thirteen , Smith was one of the key organizers of resistance in New York City to the newly passed Fugitive Slave Act , which required states to aid federal law enforcement in capturing escaped slaves . As did similar groups in Boston , his committee aided fugitive slaves to escape capture and helped connect them to people of the Underground Railroad and other escape routes . 
 During the mid @-@ 1850s , Smith worked with Frederick Douglass to establish the National Council of Colored People , one of the first permanent black national organizations , beginning with a three @-@ day convention in Rochester , New York . At the Convention in Rochester , he and Frederick Douglass emphasized the importance of education for their race and urged the founding of more schools for black youth . Smith wanted choices available for both industrial and classical education . Douglass valued his rational approach and said that Smith was " the single most important influence on his life . " Smith tempered the more radical people in the abolitionist movement and insisted on arguing from facts and analysis . He wrote a regular column in Douglass ' paper , published under the pseudonym , ' <unk> 
 Opposing the emigration of American free blacks to other countries , Smith believed that native @-@ born Americans had the right to live in the United States and a claim by their labor and birth to their land . He gathered supporters to go to Albany and testify to the state legislature against proposed plans to support the American Colonization Society , which had supported sending free blacks to the colony of Liberia in Africa . Smith contributed money to revive the Weekly Anglo @-@ African in 1861 , as an anti @-@ <unk> newspaper . His own writings were important for refuting commonly held racist assumptions of the time , as noted below . 
 Smith was also a prominent leader in the battle for the civil rights of the northern black minority . In the mid @-@ 1850s , he joined James W.C. Pennington and other black leaders in establishing the Legal Rights Association ( LRA ) in New York City . A pioneering minority @-@ rights association , the LRA waged a nearly ten @-@ year campaign against segregated public transportation in New York City . This organization successfully defeated segregation in New York and served as a model for later rights organizations , including the National Equal Rights League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . 
 = = = Professional associations and writings = = = 
 Smith was a prolific writer and essayist . The historian John Stauffer of Harvard University says : " He was one of the leaders within the movement to abolish slavery , and he was one of the most original and innovative writers of his time . " 
 In 1840 he wrote the first case report by a black doctor , which his associate John Watson read at a meeting of the New York Medical and Surgical Society . ( It acknowledged Smith was qualified , but would not admit him because of racial discrimination . ) Soon after , Smith published an article in the New York Journal of Medicine , the first by a black doctor in the US . 
 He drew from his medical training to discredit popular ideas about differences among the races . In 1843 he gave a lecture series , Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races , to demonstrate the failings of phrenology , which was a so @-@ called scientific practice of the time that was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans . He rejected the practice of homeopathy , an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities . Although he had a successful medical career , he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination . 
 At Glasgow , Smith had been trained in the emerging science of statistics . He published numerous articles applying his statistical training . For example , he used statistics to refute the arguments of slave owners , who wrote that blacks were inferior and that slaves were better off than free blacks or white urban laborers . To do this , he drew up statistical tables of data from the census . 
 When John C. Calhoun , then US Secretary of State and former US Senator from South Carolina , claimed that freedom was bad for blacks , and that the 1840 U.S. Census showed that blacks in the North had high rates of insanity and mortality , Smith responded with a masterful paper . In " A Dissertation on the Influence of Climate on Longevity " ( 1846 ) , published in Hunt 's Merchants ' Magazine , Smith analyzed the census both to refute Calhoun 's conclusions and to show the correct way to analyze data . He showed that blacks in the North lived longer than slaves , attended church more , and were achieving scholastically at a rate similar to whites . 
 As Smith started publishing , his work was quickly accepted by newer scientific organizations : in 1852 Smith was invited to be a founding member of the New York Statistics Institute . In 1854 he was elected as a member by the American Geographical Society ( founded in New York in 1851 by top scientists as well as wealthy amateurs interested in exploration ) . The Society recognized him by giving him an award for one of his articles . He also joined the New @-@ York Historical Society . 
 Among numerous other works supporting abolitionism and dealing with issues related to race , Smith is well known for his introduction to Frederick Douglass ' second autobiography , My Bondage and My Freedom ( 1855 ) . It expressed the new independence in African @-@ American accounts of slavery , compared to earlier works , which had to seek approval for authentication from white abolitionists , as readers rejected some harsh accounts of conditions under slavery . Smith wrote : 
 ... the worst of our institutions , in its worst aspect , cannot keep down energy , truthfulness , and earnest struggle for the right . 
 In 1859 he published an article using scientific findings and analysis to refute the former president Thomas Jefferson 's theories of race , as expressed in his well @-@ known Notes on the State of Virginia ( 1785 ) . Dr. Vanessa Northington Gamble , a medical doctor and historian at George Washington University , in 2010 noted , " As early as 1859 , Dr. McCune Smith said that race was not biological but was a social category . " He also commented on the positive ways that ethnic Africans would influence US culture and society , in music , dance , food , and other elements . His collected essays , speeches and letters have been published as The Works of James McCune Smith : Black Intellectual and Abolitionist ( 2006 ) , edited by John Stauffer . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 In 1863 Smith was appointed as professor of anthropology at Wilberforce College , Ohio . It was founded in a collaboration between the African Methodist Episcopal Church ( AME Church ) and the Methodist Church of Cincinnati as a college for students of color before the American Civil War . By 1860 , it had numerous mixed @-@ race students from the South , whose tuition was paid by their wealthy white planter fathers . The war caused the withdrawal of most southern students , threatening survival of the school . In 1863 the college was purchased by the AME Church and established as the first African American @-@ owned and operated college in the United States . 
 At the time , Smith was too ill to take the position . He died two years later on November 17 , 1865 of congestive heart failure on Long Island , New York at the age of 52 . This was nineteen days before ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States , which abolished slavery throughout the country . He was buried at Cypress Hills Cemetery , in Brooklyn . Smith was survived by his widow , Malvina , and five children . 
 In 1870 the Smiths were again all classified as white on the census . James Smith Jr. had married a white woman and had children . His siblings also would marry white spouses and have families . Because of trying to escape racial prejudice , it appeared that they did not pass on the stories about their father 's achievements , as later generations did not learn of them . It was not until the twenty @-@ first century that a connection was made again , and his descendants learned of some of their African @-@ American ancestors .

 Gradually Smith 's achievements were forgotten within the family , as his sons worked to escape racial prejudice in New York and did not discuss their African @-@ American ancestry .

 St James ' Church , Stretham , is an active Anglican church in the village of Stretham , Cambridgeshire , England . Founded in the 12th century , it was heavily restored by the architect J. P. St Aubyn in 1876 . English Heritage , a body responsible for preserving historical sites in the United Kingdom , assessed the church a Grade II * listed building . The turret clock on the east face of the tower was also made in 1876 , by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch , Shropshire , and still keeps good time . The church has a ring of six bells hung for change ringing . Regular ringing resumed at the church in June 2011 after several years ' silence . St James ' is one of eight churches in the Ely Team Ministry .

 St James ' Church stands in the centre of the small village of Stretham , which has a population of 1 @,@ 685 . The village lies 6 kilometres ( 4 mi ) south @-@ south @-@ west of Ely in Cambridgeshire , England , about 119 kilometres ( 74 mi ) by road from London . The earliest written record of this still active church is in the Liber Eliensis , a 12th @-@ century history of the Isle of Ely . In 1137 , during Bishop Nigel 's ( c . 1100 – 1169 ) time , Anglo @-@ Saxon conspirators were said to have met in Stretham church . Fragments of the east chancel are known to be from about the 12th century , corroborating the record of the church 's existence in that period . 
 Lancelot Ridley ( d . 1576 ) , appointed one of the first Six Preachers of Canterbury Cathedral in 1541 and a rector of Stretham from 1560 , was buried in the parish . Mark Ridley ( 1560 – 1624 ) , one of Lancelot 's sons , became the physician to the Tsar of Russia . 
 In 1751 , Francis <unk> , in his Collectanea <unk> , recorded St James ' as having a square tower , with four bells and a clock . The north aisle was leaded and there was a chantry chapel at the east end with a screen . He concludes this to be the Chancel of the Resurrection . At this time , the south aisle , nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded . 
 The church was restored very heavily in 1876 by the architect J. P. St Aubyn at a cost of £ 4 @,@ 400 ( equivalent to £ 373 @,@ 274 in 2016 ) . The north and south transepts were added at this time as well as the whole south aisle of the nave , the chancel , a clerestory and a new porch . 
 St James ' Church , Stretham , is an historic building protected by Acts of Parliament . Originally , the church was listed Grade A in a publicly available register on 5 February 1952 until a resurvey and regrading by the English Heritage on 19 August 1988 . Since then , it is listed as a Grade II * building , which makes the church particularly important to the country 's heritage and warrants every effort to preserve it . The church records are kept in the County Records Office , Cambridge . Since 1990 , St James ' Church has had an ecumenical agreement with the Stretham Methodists . 
 St James ' is part of the Ely Team Ministry , a group of eight churches : St Mary 's , Ely ; St Peter 's , Ely ; St Leonard 's , Little Downham ; St Michael and All Angels , <unk> ; St George 's , Little Thetford ; St James , Stretham ; Holy Cross , <unk> ; St Peter 's , Prickwillow . The Prickwillow church was closed for worship in 2008 ; it is part of the parish of St Mary 's , Ely .

 The building is mainly 14th century although the east wall of the chancel contains remnants of 12th @-@ century material , including two clamped buttresses . The ashlar @-@ faced tower is 14th century with angled buttresses north and south . The west window has three lights with flowing tracery . The clock on the east face of the tower , dated 1876 , is by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch , Shropshire , the oldest firm of tower clockmakers in the world ; it is wound weekly by the churchwardens . 
 The east wall of the chancery has one window with five lights ( stained glass panels ) with tracery above in a Gothic style . The church floodlighting is supported by funds from the National Lottery church floodlighting trust

 There is a lowered sill on the southeast window of the chancel for a three @-@ seat ( sedilia ) ; a cabinet ( aumbry ) is along the east of the north wall with an arched tomb recess to the west of it with an inscribed tomb lid which commemorates Nicholas de <unk> , late 13th @-@ century rector . A 1440 oak screen to the chancel is very finely carved . Lying in the chancel is a black marble slab that dates back to 1667 ; it is a memorial , commemorating Anne <unk> , sister of Sir Christopher Wren and wife of the rector of the time . The pipe rack organ , built in 1886 by J W Walker and sons of London , is in a chamber built onto the south wall of the chancery . Paddy Benson of Norman & Beard , carried out a reconstruction and enlargement of the organ in 1907 at a cost of £ 350 ( equivalent to £ 33 @,@ 392 in 2016 ) ; it was converted to electric blowing sometime after 1937 . 
 = = Bells = = 
 Until 1952 , the church had a ring of five bells hung for change ringing ; and at this time , a sixth bell was added and one bell was recast , replacing a 1727 bell by Henry Penn of Peterborough . The oldest bell as of 2010 , is the 840 @-@ millimetre ( 33 in ) 360 @-@ kilogram ( 790 lb ) number four bell of 1796 by Joseph <unk> ; the newest are of 1951 by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough . This set of six bells are rung from a first @-@ floor ringing chamber above the recently constructed servery and toilets . 
 According to Canon K W H Felstead 's records , now maintained by the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , there have been 78 peals rung at St James ' Church , Stretham , since 1952 .

 = Ammonia fuming = 
 Ammonia fuming is a wood finishing process that darkens wood and brings out the grain pattern . It consists of exposing the wood to fumes from a strong aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide which reacts with the tannins in the wood . The process works best on white oak because of the high tannin content of this wood . <unk> oak is also called smoked oak . Other species may also be fumed but usually will not darken as much as white oak . The introduction of the process is usually associated with the American furniture maker Gustav Stickley at the beginning of the twentieth century , but fuming was certainly known in Europe some time before this . 
 = = Process = = 
 The wood to be fumed is placed in a sealed chamber with all the surfaces to be fumed exposed to freely circulating air . A large shallow container of ammonium hydroxide solution is placed on the floor of the chamber and the chamber is sealed . If the chamber is large or the fuming is to be done for a long time then more than one container may be provided or the ammonia may be replenished during the process . The fuming time depends on the amount of darkening required , the size of the chamber , and the strength of the ammonia used . It is usual to oil the wood after fuming to fully bring out the effect . 
 = = Advantages and disadvantages = = 
 Fuming has an advantage over staining in that it does not obscure the grain , it just darkens it . Unlike staining , there is no possibility of blotches or runs . Fuming is also <unk> . Fuming has the disadvantage that it is not a very precise process . Different batches of wood will react to fuming differently . For this reason wood that is to be fumed for a particular project is often taken from the same tree . Even so , boards from the same tree , and even different regions of the same board , can have a noticeably different colour . Where a consistent colour is important , staining or dyeing may be better options . 
 Fuming has some inconvenient safety issues . The solution of ammonium hydroxide used is much stronger ( 26 % to 30 % ) than in household ammonia and is corrosive . The fuming must be done in an enclosed sealed chamber . Ammonia splashes can burn skin and the fumes can cause burns to eyes and lungs . Operators need to wear gas masks , gloves and eye protection . 
 The darkening of the colour relies on the ammonia reacting with tannins in the wood . The process is most usually applied to white oak as this wood has a high tannin content . Red oak may turn greenish rather than deep brown . Other species may not darken so noticeably as white oak , or at all , depending on the tannin content . The effect of fuming can be enhanced in non @-@ tannic woods by applying a coat of tannic acid to the surface before fuming . 
 = = History = = 
 Fuming was an accidental discovery in England after it was noticed that oak boards stored in a stable had darkened . This was caused by the ammonia fumes from the horse urine reacting with the wood . At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries fuming became popular with furniture makers in the Arts and Crafts movement . The technique was introduced to the US by Gustav Stickley in 1901 and a manufacturing technique was perfected in the mission style furniture line of the Stickley family business . Stickley also described a method of fuming the wooden architecture of an entire room by setting down bowls of ammonia within the room and completely sealing it . This method was not very practical and quite dangerous for the person placing the ammonia without the personal protective equipment available to modern workers . Stickley was quickly followed by other American Arts and Crafts furniture makers such as Charles Limbert and the Roycroft community . 
 = Castleshaw Roman fort = 
 Castleshaw Roman fort was a castellum in the Roman province of Britannia . Although there is no evidence to substantiate the claim , it has been suggested that Castleshaw Roman fort is the site of Rigodunum , a Brigantian settlement . The remains of the fort are located on Castle Hill on the eastern side of Castleshaw Valley at the foot of Standedge but overlooking the valley . The hill is on the edge of Castleshaw in Greater Manchester . The fort was constructed in c . AD 79 , but fell out of use at some time during the 90s . It was replaced by a smaller fortlet , built in c . 105 , around which a civilian settlement grew . It may have served as a logistical and administrative centre , although it was abandoned in the 120s . 
 The site has been the subject of antiquarian and archaeological investigation since the 18th century , but the civilian settlement lay undiscovered until the 1990s . The fort , fortlet , and civilian settlement are all protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument , recognising its importance as a " nationally important " archaeological site or historic building , and protecting it against unauthorised change . 
 = = Location = = 
 The fort and fortlet at Castleshaw are situated on a step of <unk> shale on the eastern side of Castleshaw Valley below Standedge , part of the Pennine ridge in northern England . From the site there are clear views up and down the valley , although it is overshadowed by higher ground on all sides . It is remote and exposed and lies along the Deva Victrix ( Chester ) to Eboracum ( York ) Roman road . The road crosses the Pennines at Standedge where the area dips and narrows , creating a traversable pass which would have been guarded by the Castleshaw fort . The nearest forts are Mamucium ( Manchester ) 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the west and one at Slack 8 miles ( 13 km ) to the east , both on the line of the Roman road . There was also possibly a fortlet or signal station at <unk> , between Slack and Castleshaw . The later fortlet is on the same site as the fort ( grid reference <unk> ) . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Roman = = = 
 The fort at Castleshaw , constructed from turf and timber , was built around 79 and guarded the York to Chester Roman road . Due to the site 's protected status as a Scheduled Ancient Monument it has not been possible to excavate the fort , however previous trenches have demonstrated that the fort had two phases to its construction . The location of the fort 's granary , stables , the principia ( headquarters ) , the praetorium ( commander 's tent ) , and six long narrow buildings which are possibly workshops or storerooms are all known . The fort was small , would probably have been home to around 500 soldiers of an auxiliary cohort , and fell out of use during the mid AD 90s . Rather than allow the defences to fall into potentially hostile hands or be used against Rome , the fort was slighted . 
 The fort was replaced by a fortlet , also built using turf and timber , in AD 105 . Although the fortlet was built on the same site as the fort , it did not use the same foundation trenches . There were two construction phases of the fortlet , the second – dating to c . 120 – featured gates , an oven , a well , a granary , a hypocaust a workshop , barracks , a commanders house , a courtyard building , and possibly a latrine . The barracks were built to accommodate 48 soldiers and even with administrative staff and officers , the garrison of the fortlet would have numbered less than 100 . The first phase was laid out along the same lines as the second phase . The fortlet defences – as with most other fortlets – were designed to withstand attacks from brigands or hold off an enemy until reinforcements from the main army could arrive rather than withstand a determined attack . A civilian settlement or vicus grew around the fortlet in the early 2nd century . It probably would have been home to those who benefited from trade with the garrison or hangers on of the soldiers . Since it is unlikely that a garrison of under 100 could have supported a vicus , it has been suggested that the fortlet was a commissary fortlet , one which was the administrative and logistical centre of part of the Roman army . With soldiers regularly arriving to collect pay and orders , a vicus could have been supported . The fortlet fell out of use in the mid 120s . The fort and fortlet of Castleshaw were superseded by the neighbouring forts at Manchester and Slack . The vicus was abandoned around the same time as the fortlet fell out of use . 
 According to Ptolemy , there was a polis called Rigodunum belonging to the Brigantes near the position of Castleshaw . Rigodunum means " royal fort " . Although it has been suggested that Castleshaw is the location of the Brigantine settlement , there is no evidence to support this . Stamps on two tegulae , produced at the Roman <unk> at <unk> Wood near Huddersfield , suggest the fortlet was supplied by the Cohors III <unk> from Pannonia , maybe even garrisoned by them at one stage . Similar stamps have been found in the forts at Manchester , Slack , and <unk> , indicating these forts were linked .

 After being abandoned by the Romans , Castleshaw was rediscovered by antiquarian Thomas Percival in 1752 . The remains were in good enough condition for him to draw a plan and he commented that he was " pleased to find a double Roman camp " . He also remarked that the Roman road from Manchester running east to the Pennines was " the finest remain of a Roman road in England that I ever saw " . The site has suffered damage from ploughing in the 18th and 19th centuries as it is situated in one of the best draining areas of the valley . In 1897 , a local antiquarian and poet , Ammon Wrigley , dug several trenches on the site . He did not record the results of his digging and unrecorded digs continued on and off until 1907 . In 1907 , the site was bought for the purpose of organised excavation and survey which continued from 1907 to 1908 under the supervision of Francis Bruton who had recently been involved with the excavation of Mamucium . The spoil heaps from the 1907 – 08 dig were never levelled , leaving a series of misleading modern earthworks on the interior of the site . 
 Under the supervision of the University of Manchester , further excavation was undertaken on the site in 1957 – 61 and 1963 – 64 . Between 1984 and 1988 , Greater Manchester Archaeological Unit undertook excavations and restoration of the site . A group led by Professor Barri Jones – an expert on Roman Britain – was set up to co @-@ ordinate the work . North West Water , then the owners of the site , ensured the area would not be used for agriculture . In an attempt to make the site accessible to the public , the outline of the fort and fortlet was marked out in low mounds and an education centre was set up nearby . The area beyond the fort was investigated for the first time in 1995 – 96 ; archaeologists were searching for a civilian settlement or vicus associated with the fort . Surveys revealed a settlement triangular in shape and to the south of the fort . The vicus is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument with the fort and fortlet . 
 = = Layout = = 
 The fort was rectangular in shape and had sides of 115 metres ( 377 ft ) and 100 metres ( 330 ft ) , covering an area of approximately 1 @.@ 2 hectares ( 3 @.@ 0 acres ) . The fortlet was built over the south of the fort , making it difficult to discover what lay beneath . It has been possible to however to ascertain that barrack buildings lay on the east side of the fort , a granary on the north , and the principia and praetorium to the south west . 
 The fortlet was rectangular , with sides of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) by 40 metres ( 130 ft ) , and covered 1 @,@ 950 square metres ( 0 @.@ 48 acres ) . It was originally thought to be surrounded by a single Punic ditch but investigation revealed there to be two Punic ditches separated by a 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) wide berm . The inner ditch was 3 @.@ 9 metres ( 13 ft ) wide and 1 @.@ 3 metres ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) deep while the outer ditch was 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) wide and 0 @.@ 9 metres ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) deep . A Punic ditch is a defensive v @-@ shaped ditch with one side much steeper than the other ; the ditches surrounding the fortlet had an outer face at 27 degrees and the inner face at 69 degrees . The rampart behind the ditches only survives to 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) at its highest point . It was built from turf on top of sandy clay with a rubble foundation . The fortlet ramparts to the south lay on top of the slighted fort ramparts . Whether corner towers were a feature of the fortlet is unknown , no evidence remains aside from a single <unk> , although only the north and east corners survive in good condition . There were two gateways , one to the north and one to the south . 
 A civilian settlement is located to the south of the fortlet 's defences . The extent of the vicus is uncertain , however , test pits have indicated that it probably extends 12 metres ( 39 ft ) west to east and between 25 metres ( 82 ft ) and 35 metres ( 115 ft ) to south .

 Nicholas Cole " Nick " Mitchell ( born November 9 , 1982 ) is an American retired professional wrestler who is best known for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) as Mitch of the Spirit Squad on the Raw brand . Before starting a wrestling career , Mitchell played football for the Beaumont Drillers while at Blinn College . After not being accepted for a National Football League combine , Mitchell focused on a career in wrestling . 
 Mitchell took part of the fourth season of the reality series Tough Enough , a televised competition that would award the winner a WWE contract . Despite not winning , he signed a developmental contract with WWE , and was assigned to their developmental territory , Deep South Wrestling , where he wrestled as " Big Time " Nick Mitchell . He was later moved Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) where he joined the Spirit Squad faction . 
 After the Spirit Squad were called up to the Raw roster , they debuted in January 2006 , and won the World Tag Team Championship three months later . Following the split of the team , Mitchell was released from his WWE contract in May 2007 . Following his release , Mitchell began a career in mixed martial arts .

 Mitchell took part in the fourth season of World Wrestling Entertainment 's reality series Tough Enough in 2004 . He was the first to be eliminated . Despite not winning , he was still signed to a WWE developmental contract and assigned to the company 's developmental territory , Deep South Wrestling . Several other competitors from Tough Enough were also signed , including Daniel Puder , Mike Mizanin , and Marty Wright , but near the end of 2006 , Mitchell and Mizanin were the only two left on the main WWE roster . He began wrestling under the name " Big Time " Nick Mitchell , and competed against wrestlers including Kid Kash and Johnny Parisi . He later suffered a knee injury , and although it was feared that he had torn his ACL , he was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) where he joined The Spirit Squad . Within days of his debut , the Squad was called up to the main WWE roster .

 As part of The Spirit Squad , a group consisting of five wrestlers who used the in @-@ ring personas of male cheerleaders , he adopted the name Mitch . As a result of his ACL injury , his ability to wrestle was curtailed and Mitch spent the first few months of his time in the Spirit Squad in a non @-@ wrestling role . On January 23 , 2006 , they had their WWE television debut as a group , appearing on Raw and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry " The King " Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler . They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels . The villainous McMahon brought in the Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions , including placing them in multiple handicap matches . 
 They also wrestled in the tag team division , and on April 3 , on Raw , won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey defeated Big Show and Kane , with outside help from the other three Squad members as they attacked The Big Show in order to gain the advantage . After winning the championship , all five members of the team were recognized as the champions , allowing any combination of them to defend the championship . 
 Three weeks later , McMahon scheduled another handicap match , with The Spirit Squad facing Michaels . The match never started , however ; instead The Spirit Squad attacked Michaels , ripping apart his ring attire and , as part of the storyline , shattering his knee with a steel chair . McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer ; however , Kenny snatched the sledgehammer away , disrespecting Triple H , which led to him attacking the group . Triple H and Michaels revived D @-@ Generation X ( DX ) , since their teased reunion in 2002 , and as a team began a feud with the Spirit Squad . DX played various sophomoric pranks on the team and the McMahons ( Vince and Shane ) , as well as defeating The Spirit Squad in handicap matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night 's Main Event . 
 During their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon , the team also wrestled other teams in Raw 's tag division over their World Tag Team Championship . The group successfully defended the tag team championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene , Charlie Haas and Viscera , and Snitsky and Val Venis . They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders , whom they eventually defeated to retain the title at Unforgiven . 
 The Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of Raw . After two consecutive losses to the debuting Cryme Tyme , Kenny attacked Mikey on the October 23 episode of Raw and announced that he was going to defeat Flair . Kenny was successful , despite Flair attempting to even the odds by bringing other WWE Legends , Dusty Rhodes , Sgt. Slaughter , and " Rowdy " Roddy Piper , to the ring with him . It was then announced that Flair and a legend , selected by interactive voting , would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay @-@ per @-@ view in early November . The fans chose Piper , and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship . 
 The group was " killed off " on the November 27 Raw after they were defeated in a five @-@ on @-@ three match by Flair and DX . Later that night , in a backstage segment , DX placed all members into a crate stamped " OVW , Louisville , Kentucky " , a reference to the developmental territory from which the Squad had come .

 = Kala ( album ) = 
 Kala is the second studio album by English @-@ Sri Lankan recording artist M.I.A. , released on 8 August 2007 by XL Recordings . The album features musical styles including dance music and makes extensive use of South Asian music such as that of the urumee , a drum used in <unk> music native to Tamil Nadu , India . It was mainly written and produced by M.I.A. and Switch , and features contributions from Timbaland , Diplo , Afrikan Boy and The Wilcannia Mob . 
 M.I.A. named the album after her mother , in contrast to her first album Arular , which was named after her father , and stated that her mother 's struggles in life are a major theme of the recording . She began recording the album in early 2006 and worked on the tracks in various locations around the world , including India , Jamaica , Australia , Liberia and Trinidad . Planned sessions in the United States failed to occur , after M.I.A. was refused a long @-@ term work visa to enter the country . 
 Kala was ranked as one of the best albums of the year by several publications . It reached number eighteen on the Billboard 200 chart and topped the magazine 's Top Electronic Albums chart . In the United Kingdom it reached number thirty @-@ nine on the UK Albums Chart . Kala spawned the singles " Bird Flu " , " Boyz " , " Jimmy " and " Paper Planes " . As of 2013 the album had sold over 500 @,@ 000 copies in the US . 
 = = Composition and recording = = 
 M.I.A. ( Mathangi " Maya " Arulpragasam ) had released her debut album Arular in 2005 , which achieved critical acclaim and sold 130 @,@ 000 copies . Plans for a second album were first revealed when she spoke later that year of her intention to work with American producer Timbaland . At one point it was anticipated that he would produce the bulk of the album . However , she was unable to gain a long @-@ term work visa to enter the US , reportedly due to her family 's connections with guerrillas in Sri Lanka . This led to conflicts between the two artists ' schedules and meant that Timbaland 's involvement was restricted to a poorly received guest verse on the track " Come Around " . M.I.A. instead opted to record the album at a variety of locations around the world , beginning by travelling to India following the last date of her Arular Tour in Japan in February 2006 . 
 She initially travelled to India to meet A. R. Rahman , but found it hard to communicate her ideas to him and the planned musical collaboration did not take place . Rahman did , however , provide M.I.A. with a number of contacts and allow her to use his studio , where 22 members of drumming group The Tapes were recorded for Kala . Producer Switch , who had initially travelled to India purely to engineer the planned sessions , ultimately became involved in the composition of several tracks for the album . A visit to Angola to work with DJ <unk> was cancelled after <unk> was involved in a car accident , but M.I.A. was able to record in Trinidad , Liberia , Jamaica and Australia . She and Switch relied heavily on Logic Pro , a digital audio workstation produced by Apple , and were able to capture vocals and background sounds outside the traditional studio environment , using a microphone and a Macbook Pro . The album features guest vocals from Afrikan Boy , The Wilcannia Mob , and Timbaland , and further collaborations with Switch , Blaqstarr , <unk> and Diplo . She likened the process of recording the album to " making a big old marble cake with lots of different countries and influences . Then you slice it up and call each slice a song " . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Kala is named after M.I.A. ' s mother , in contrast to her previous album , Arular , which was named after her father . She contends that Arular was a " masculine " album , but that Kala " is about my mum and her struggle – how do you work , feed your children , nurture them and give them the power of information ? " She further summed the album up as " shapes , colours , Africa , street , power , bitch , nu world , and brave . " According to Dominic Horner of The Independent , the album 's music may not be appropriately described exclusively as either dance or world music , but it is a mixture of the two . Music critic Robert Christgau characterised its music as an " eclectic world @-@ underclass dance amalgam " , and Jonathan Brown of the Irish Independent cited Kala as a proper introduction to " world fusion " , a genre that " blends sounds from across the globe which wouldn 't – and some say shouldn 't – be put together . " By contrast , NPR 's Oliver Wang argued that , rather than a " so @-@ called world music fusion " attempt , Kala is " agitated , propulsive pop " informed by international sounds . Music journalist Jody Rosen called it " an agitprop dance record " that reappropriates hip hop in an international setting with beatbox riddims , " playground " rhymes , unconventional samples , and gunshot sounds . 
 The tracks " Boyz " and " Bird Flu " use urumee drums , a signature instrument of <unk> , a Tamil genre of music , with which M.I.A. was familiar from her time spent living in Sri Lanka . She later worked on these tracks in Trinidad , where she absorbed influences from the country 's love of soca music . The lyrics of " Boyz " deal with the artist 's time in Jamaica , and reference Jamaican dance moves . The song " <unk> " began as an image in M.I.A. ' s head of refugees being smuggled in boats , which she expressed musically by imagining how " if they banged that beat on the side of a boat , what would it sound like ? That 's why it 's all echo @-@ y and submarine @-@ y " . The sounds on the intro were recorded from <unk> [ sic ] fishermen chanting as they pull their fishing boats into the water . " World Town " used instrumentation from the temple music she recalled waking up to as a child in Sri Lanka . After playing the track to children in Liberia , she expressed a desire to record a video for the song there . M.I.A. ' s " flat , unaffected vocals and delivery of lyrics " on some songs drew comparisons to British post @-@ punk bands such as Delta 5 and The Slits . She says it " was just what was happening to me naturally ... I wanted it to be difficult and raw and not get into it so much " . 
 Afrikan Boy , an exponent of grime , a UK @-@ based genre of urban music , provided vocals on the song " <unk> " . M.I.A. opted to work with him because she felt that he seemed comfortable with his identity as a " real immigrant " and because his background was different to that of most MCs in the genre . She had originally planned to include " Mango Pickle Down River " — her remix of The Wilcannia Mob 's song " Down River " — on a mix @-@ tape , but chose to include it on the album because she felt it was rare to hear the " aboriginal voice " in recorded music , and described opening track " Bamboo Banga " as having a " bamboo @-@ stick beat , house @-@ y feel " . The song " Jimmy " was included as a tribute to her mother and is M.I.A. ' s version of an old Bollywood film track to which she used to dance at parties as a child . Despite the involvement of Baltimore club musician Blaqstarr , " The Turn " turned out to be the album 's only ballad , and the track has been described as the least like club music . " 20 Dollar " was written about the relative ease of buying AK @-@ 47s in war @-@ torn Liberia . " <unk> " recalls part of the artist 's life growing up with rave music in early 1990s London , while the song " Paper Planes " jokingly plays on M.I.A. ' s problems with visas and certain perceptions of immigrants .

 In April 2007 Rolling Stone reported that Kala would be released on 26 June of that year . After being delayed for unknown reasons , the album was eventually released by XL Recordings on 8 August 2007 in Japan and on 20 August in the UK , and by Interscope Records on 21 August in the United States . The Japanese edition featured three extra tracks not included on the versions released in other countries . Following the unexpected commercial success of " Paper Planes " , Kala was re @-@ issued in the United Kingdom in October 2008 . A 4 November 2008 US re @-@ release was announced , but as of late 2009 the album had not been re @-@ issued in the United States . 
 The album 's packaging includes photographs taken by M.I.A. and others in Liberia and Jamaica . The cover artwork to Kala , designed by Steve Loveridge , features neon fractal patterns and repeated slogans , including " Fight On ! Fight On ! Fight On ! " , which surrounds her image on the front cover . The cover was considered garish , prompting The Village Voice to comment " Maybe one day [ she 'll ] make an album cover that it doesn 't hurt to look at " . Additional graphics for the album were provided by English fashion designer <unk> Mundane ( also known as Cassette Playa ) and Steve Loveridge . The album 's artwork was inspired by African art , " from dictator fashion to old stickers on the back of cars , " which M.I.A hoped , like her artwork extended " Okley Run " clothing range , would capture " a 3 @-@ D sense , the shapes , the prints , the sound , film , technology , politics , economics " of a certain time .

 M.I.A. began her promotion of the new album with a live appearance at Radio 1 's Big Weekend in Preston in May 2007 , where she performed six songs from Kala . In July she began the full <unk> Tour with dates in the United States before going on to play a number of festivals in Europe and America . After dates in Asia , she returned to America for a series of shows in October and November , before ending the year with concerts in the UK . The tour continued during the first half of 2008 under the banner of the People Vs . Money Tour with further dates in North America , although the planned European leg of the tour was eventually cancelled . 
 The first track from the album to be made available to the public was " Bird Flu " , which was made available as a downloadable promotional single on 13 November 2006 . The first official single to be lifted from the album , " Boyz " , was released on 11 June 2007 . The second single was " Jimmy " , which was released on 1 October 2007 . The EP Paper Planes - Homeland Security Remixes EP , featuring various mixes of " Paper Planes " , was released digitally on 11 February 2008 and physically three weeks later . A new physical single version was released in the UK on 13 October 2008 . Also in October 2008 , How Many Votes Fix Mix EP was released , containing a remix of " Boyz " with Jay @-@ Z and the tracks " Shells " and " Far Far " .

 Kala received widespread acclaim from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 87 , based on 37 reviews . In the Los Angeles Times , Ann Powers wrote that Kala succeeded at embodying disenfranchised characters in the dissonant Third World with " truly multi @-@ vocal " music whose " every sound signified something different , driving the music 's meaning into some new corner " . Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club said the music ventured far enough where it served as both a party album and a progressive aural assault , while AllMusic 's Andy Kellman felt that Kala was better for intensifying Arular 's qualities and " mixing cultures with respectful irreverence " . Barry Walters of Spin credited M.I.A. with evoking both the social demands and percussive sounds of the Third World , while finding the album relevant at a time when " more Americans than ever feel like outsiders in their own country " . Writing for MSN Music , Robert Christgau said although the lyrics were " cannier politically " than Arular , the music was more decisive in embodying the imagination and recreation of " an <unk> international underclass that proves how smart it is just by stating its business , which includes taking your money " . He later said that he had " pressed " the editors of Rolling Stone to let him give Kala four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars in his review for the magazine , wishing he " had the foresight to fight for five " because the album " kept growing on me till I even dug the Timbaland remnant [ ' Come Around ' ] " . 
 In a less enthusiastic review , Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine believed Kala was less successful than Arular because it lacked its predecessor 's immediate hooks and clever pop sensibility . Pitchfork Media critic Mark Pytlik said because most of M.I.A. ' s lyrics gave the impression they were written " in the service of the rhythms " , her allusions sounded more " rewarding " than what she literally wrote . Andy Gill of The Independent found her lyrics unfocused in their arguments on money and social concerns , remarking that the gun references on " World Town " and " Paper Planes " blemished " an otherwise fine album " . In The Guardian , Alexis Petridis wrote that Kala was still a " unique " listen in spite of occasionally tuneless songs . Writing for NME , Alex Miller acknowledged that the record 's music polarised opinion , claiming that some members of the magazine 's staff had " fed several copies [ of the album ] into the shredder claiming aural abuse " , although others went on to praise the album for its innovation and referred to it as M.I.A.

 The music video for " About a Girl " was directed by Martin Weisz . Inspired by a Kill Bill theme , the video was filmed at Vasquez Rocks , near Los Angeles , California on 22 September 2009 , one day following the announcement that Buchanan was replaced by Ewen . Ewen had not met the remaining members of the Sugababes until two days before the video shoot for " About a Girl " . Stunt doubles were used to portray the Sugababes members as they were unsure if the band would be together by the time of the song 's release . 
 The video begins with two businessmen in a caravan discussing a job . After the conversation has ended , a vehicle driven by the stunt doubles arrives in the desert . They leave the vehicle while group member Heidi Range sings her verse as she dances around it . All three members of the group begin dancing during the chorus while a stunt double enters the caravan with a red briefcase . Following this , Berrabah sings her verse of the song while her stunt double is talking to the businessman . Sugababes begin dancing again while the stunt double attacks the businessman , who is drop @-@ kicked out of the caravan . Another businessman begins attacking her , although he too loses the fight . Ewen 's stunt double begins fighting with another man outside of the caravan , and he also is defeated . Later in the video , the businessmen are seen tied together on the ground and the stunt double throws the briefcase , which turns out to be a jack in the box . At the end of the video , the stunt doubles re @-@ enter the vehicle and drive out of the desert . 
 David Balls of Digital Spy commended the video , describing it as an " action @-@ packed affair that 's nearly as dramatic as the group 's own history " and praising its " plenty of slick dance moves and provocative pouting thrown in for good measure " . Chris Johnson of Daily Mail noted the group 's " sexy studded leather outfits " .

 Following Buchanan 's departure from the group , promotion for " About a Girl " was halted when Berrabah was admitted to a private health clinic in Europe citing " nervous exhaustion " ; this led to the cancellation of a scheduled appearance on German TV . The Sugababes were scheduled to headline the Scottish Royal Variety Performance , although this was cancelled due to " a number of legal issues to be finalised " . Following Berrabah 's return from the clinic , " About a Girl " was performed live for the first time by the new line @-@ up on GMTV . An acoustic version of the song was performed live on 11 November 2009 on Radio 1 from Maida Vale Studios .

 = <unk> Meksi = 
 <unk> Meksi ( 1770 – 1821 ) was an Albanian physician , writer , and translator . One @-@ time personal physician to Ali Pasha , the 19th @-@ century Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina , Meksi produced the first translation of the New Testament into Albanian with the help and sponsorship of the British and Foreign Bible Society ( BFBS ) . Meksi did not live to see his work 's publication however , which was supervised by Gregory IV of Athens . As a member of Filiki Etaireia , a secret society whose purpose was to establish an independent Greek state , Meksi joined the Greeks in the Siege of Tripolitsa during their war of independence against the Ottoman Empire and died shortly afterwards . 
 As well as its value to Albanian Christians , who could for the first time read the Gospels in their own language , Meksi 's work advanced the study of written Albanian , and in particular informed the work of 19th @-@ century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander , August Schleicher , and Johann Georg von Hahn . Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi 's Bible translation . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Meksi was born in 1770 in <unk> , a village near Gjirokastër , a member of Meksi family and pursued secondary studies in Ioannina , then an important Ottoman provincial center ( now in Greece ) . His first employment was as a folk physician to the court of Ali Pasha , the Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina , a position he held until 1803 . Armed with a letter of recommendation from Ali Pasha , Meksi was admitted to the University of Naples in Italy , where he studied medicine under Dr. Nicola <unk> and practiced in a hospital administered by the parish of San Giovanni a Carbonara . After completing his studies in 1808 , Meksi returned to Yanina and once again served in Ali Pasha 's court , this time as one of his four physicians . His colleagues were Dr. <unk> , ( degree in medicine from the University of Paris ) , Dr. <unk> ( degree in medicine from the University of Vienna ) , and Dr. Loukas <unk> , ( brother of <unk> <unk> , with a degree in medicine from Leipzig University ) . 
 = = Philological activity = = 
 After falling out of favor with Ali Pasha , for reasons unknown , Meksi left the court in 1810 to travel around Europe . During a brief stay in Venice he began to develop an interest in the Albanian alphabet and grammar . He published two translations into Albanian during 1814 , both now lost , one of which was a religious work by Abbé Claude Fleury ( 1640 – 1723 ) . 
 Meksi also wrote a grammar of the Albanian language in Albanian . It too has been lost , but it is mentioned in many letters reporting Meksi 's work as an Albanian philologist written by Robert Pinkerton to his superiors at the British and Foreign Bible Society ( BFBS ) , which subsequently sponsored the translation of the New Testament into Albanian . The work must have been written before 1819 and may be either the first Albanian grammar or the second , after that of Jani <unk> <unk> ; it is not known which was published first . 
 In this period Meksi also created a new Albanian alphabet , rationalizing and consolidating the many different pre @-@ existing alphabets , employing a mix of Greek and Latin characters . Using his new alphabet , he wrote a book called Orthography of the Albanian language , ( Albanian : <unk> i <unk> <unk> ) . 
 = = Translation of the New Testament = = 
 Pinkerton , who in 1816 was the BFBS 's representative in Moscow , had met that year with a community of Albanians in Vienna , then capital of the Austrian Empire . They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible . In a letter to his superiors at the BFBS , dated August 28 , 1816 , Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied a large part of the ancient Illyria , that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic , Turkish , Greek , or Latin , and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek , a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand . According to Pinkerton , the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop . 
 In 1819 , apparently with the blessing of his superiors at the BFBS , Pinkerton met with Meksi ( referring him as Evangelos Mexicos ) in Istanbul . Meksi , who was then a teacher in Serres , had been recommended to Pinkerton because of his Albanian grammar book . Pinkerton also relates in one of his letters to the BFBS that Meksi was well regarded by the Albanian community , the Greek Orthodox Church , and by Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople . Gregory , according to Pinkerton , also offered to find two suitable clergymen to assist Meksi in his endeavor . Lastly , Pinkerton recommended that the Greek alphabet be used as the most suitable for the Albanian language . On October 19 , 1819 , Pinkerton and Meksi concluded a contract to translate the New Testament into Albanian on behalf of the society . It was agreed that the Bible would have to be translated into the Albanian dialect of Yanina . Meksi completed the work in two years , ten months earlier than the contract 's deadline . 
 Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to supervise the translation . On February 8 , 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed , and that the only outstanding task was a final review by a competent person , who had already been assigned to the task . In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed , and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian . Meanwhile , the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea , Grigor Gjirokastriti , an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens . Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns , one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek , because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine . 
 On March 16 , 1824 Mr. Lowndes , the BFBS 's secretary in Corfu , sent a letter to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6 @,@ 000 <unk> and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns . On September 5 , 1824 the Saint Matthew 's Gospel was published in Albanian . According to Lowndes ' letters , the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew , as since its translation they had been impatient to hear it in Albanian . In July 1827 the form in which the first 500 copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London . The entire edition amounted to 2 @,@ 000 copies . 
 Although Gjirokastriti 's edition of the New Testament was written in Albanian , it used the Greek alphabet . It is not known which alphabet Meksi used in his own manuscript . 
 The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople was not against the work of Meksi or the Bible Society at that time . On the contrary , for the translation the British missionaries successfully appealed to Gregory V and enlisted the help of an Orthodox bishop , Gjirokastriti , for the final edition of the New Testament in Albanian . 
 = = Greek War of Independence = = 
 Meksi was a member of the Filiki Etaireia , a secret society whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule over the Balkans and to establish an independent Greek state . When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821 , after his translation had been completed , Meksi joined the Greeks in the Siege of Tripolitsa . Despite suffering from a serious bout of pneumonia , he continued to work as a physician during the war . He is also said to have taken part in the negotiations leading to an agreement proposed by Theodoros Kolokotronis that permitted the Albanians who were defending Tripolitsa to leave unharmed , an arrangement that helped the Greeks to capture the town from the Turks . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Meksi did not live to see the 1827 publication of his translation of the New Testament ; he had died a bachelor six years earlier , at the age of about 51 . The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern <unk> language , it ran to 2 @,@ 000 copies , a huge number for the time . It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty . A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens , but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors . 
 Meksi 's work was important for the development of written Albanian , and his endeavors strengthened the conviction that a stable Albanian alphabet had to be created . His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander 's studies of the Albanian language , which definitively refuted the thesis that the language had a Tatar origin . Von Xylander concluded that Albanian had an Indo @-@ European root . 
 Two other international scholars also studied the Albanian language mainly based on Meksi 's translation of the New Testament : August Schleicher , who stated that his knowledge of the conjugation of Albanian verbs was based on Meksi 's work , and Johann Georg von Hahn an Austrian diplomat , philologist , and specialist in Albanian history , language , and culture , who translated the Bible into <unk> Albanian with the help of <unk> <unk> .

During Des Jardien 's three years as Chicago 's center , the Maroons compiled a record of 17 – 3 – 1 , including an undefeated 7 – 0 record and Western Conference championship in 1913 . 
 After his sophomore year in 1912 , Des Jardien was selected as a first @-@ team All @-@ Western player . Stagg praised Des Jardien as a " spectacular " player and " as flashy a center as I have seen in many years . " In naming Des Jardien to his All @-@ Western team in 1912 , E.C.

 The New York Times reported in January 1915 that Des Jardien had agreed to play professional baseball for the Chicago Cubs upon graduating from the University of Chicago in June 1915 . According to the report , Des Jardien declined to sign a contract with the Cubs to avoid endangering his amateur status . The report described Des Jardien as one of the best pitchers in the Western Conference , a right @-@ hander with a good curve ball . 
 Instead of playing Major League Baseball in the summer of 1915 , Des Jardien traveled to Asia with the University of Chicago baseball team . The team played 15 games , winning 12 , while traveling to the West Coast of the United States . It sailed from San Francisco on the SS Mongolia and arrived in Honolulu , Hawaii in early September 1915 , spending ten days there and playing games against teams from the U.S. Army and the St. Louis Athletic Club and teams made up of Chinese and Portuguese players . The team next sailed to Japan . On September 24 , 1915 , the Chicago squad played a double header in front of a crowd of 20 @,@ 000 people in Tokyo . Des Jardien pitched both games , defeating Waseda 5 – 3 and the Keio University 4 – 1 . Des Jardien hit a home run and struck out 11 batters in the game against the Keio . Des Jardien served as an assistant coach for the University of Chicago 's basketball , baseball and track teams upon returning from Japan in January 1916 . 
 In early May 1916 Des Jardien signed to play Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Indians . Indians manager Lee Fohl said at the time , " I think I will make him a good pitcher . He already has learned to put more on his fast ball while his control is almost perfect . " He made his debut on May 20 , 1916 , pitching one inning and allowing one hit , one base on balls , and two earned runs . Des Jardien did not pitch another game in Major League Baseball .

 = Forest raven = 
 The forest raven ( Corvus tasmanicus , also commonly known as the Tasmanian raven ) is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae native to Tasmania and parts of southern Victoria , such as Wilsons Promontory and Portland . Populations are also found in parts of New South Wales , including Dorrigo and Armidale . Measuring 50 – 53 cm ( 20 – 21 in ) in length , it has all @-@ black plumage , beak and legs . As with the other two species of raven in Australia , its black feathers have grey bases . Adults have white irises ; younger birds have dark brown and then hazel irises with an inner blue rim . New South Wales populations are recognised as a separate subspecies C. tasmanicus boreus , but appear to be nested within the Tasmanian subspecies genetically . 
 The forest raven lives in a wide variety of habitats in Tasmania but is restricted to more closed forest on mainland Australia . Breeding takes place in spring and summer , occurring later in Tasmania than in New South Wales . The nest is a bowl @-@ shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree . An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder , it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material , as well as food waste from urban areas and roadkill . It has been blamed for killing lambs and poultry and raiding orchards in Tasmania , and is unprotected under Tasmanian legislation . The forest raven is sedentary , with pairs generally bonding for life and establishing permanent territories . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 John Latham described the " South @-@ Seas raven " in 1781 , with loose throat feathers and found in " the Friendly Isles " in the South Seas , but did not give a binomial name . Although " the Friendly Isles " refers to Tonga , the specimen resembles what is now known as the forest raven and was collected by ships ' surgeon William Anderson on the third voyage of James Cook in January 1777 . Tasked as the expedition 's naturalist , Anderson collected many bird specimens but had died of tuberculosis in 1778 before the return home . Many collection localities were incorrect , and notes were lost or pieced together many years later . German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin gave the species the name Corvus australis in the 13th edition of Systema naturae in 1788 . 
 Since Australia was settled by Europeans , all species of crows and ravens have been colloquially known as crows by the general population and are difficult to distinguish . In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia , John Gould noted a single species of corvid in Australia , Corvus australis , which he called the white @-@ eyed crow . He used Gmelin 's 1788 name , which took precedence by virtue of its age over Vigors and Horsfield 's description . In 1912 Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie @-@ Grant clarified the species as C. coronoides ( raven , and incorporating little and Australian ravens ) and C. cecilae ( Torresian crow ) . Subsequently , French @-@ American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First Revisor under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) Code and discarded C. australis as a junior homonym — in 1788 , Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black <unk> — to preserve the stability of the name . This has been followed by later authors . 
 Gregory Mathews described the forest raven as a distinct subspecies — Corvus marianae tasmanicus — of the Australian raven in 1912 , its species name derived from Tasmania , the type locality . Rowley raised the forest raven to species rank in 1970 , noting there were no intermediate forms between it and the little raven ( its closest relative ) and that it was clearly larger with a much more massive bill . He described a second subspecies — Corvus tasmanicus boreus — the same year , observing that C. tasmanicus from Tasmania and southern Victoria has a very short tail compared with individuals from the northern New South Wales population . Rowley gave the species name forest raven in 1970 . The term " crow " is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid . 
 Preliminary genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another , and that the two lineages are not closely related . The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the forest raven may be conspecific with the Australian raven . Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by <unk> and colleagues in 2012 clarified that the forest and little raven are each other 's closest relative . The northern subspecies boreus turned out to be nested in the Tasmanian tasmanicus , indicating the populations separated very recently . It is still recognised as a distinct subspecies by the International Ornithological Committee . 
 Ian Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north . The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west . As the climate was cooler and dryer , the aridity of central Australia split them entirely as the habitat between became inhospitable . Furthermore , the eastern diverged into nomadic little ravens and , in forested refuges , forest ravens . As the climate eventually became warmer , the western ravens spread eastwards and outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia , as evidenced by the forest raven being only found in closed forest refuges on the mainland but in a wider variety of habitats in Tasmania . 
 = = Description = = 
 The largest of the Australian corvids , the adult forest raven is 50 – 53 cm ( 20 – 21 in ) in length with a wingspan between 91 – 113 cm ( 36 – 44 in ) and weight of approximately 650 g ( 1 @.@ 43 lb ) . There is no seasonal variation in plumage , which is entirely glossy black with a blue or green sheen visible on the upperparts . The wings are long and broad , with the largest of its ten primary feathers ( usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth ) almost reaching the end of the tail when at rest . The tail is rounded or wedge @-@ shaped . It is quite short in Tasmanian populations but longer in northern New South Wales . The beak is a similar shape to that of the little raven , though more massive and heavy @-@ set . The upper mandible , including the nares and nasal groove , is covered with bristles . The mouth and tongue are black , as are the powerful legs and feet . The tibia is fully feathered and the tarsus is long . 
 Sexes have identical plumage ; the male is generally larger , but there is considerable overlap in size between individuals . The forest raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers , which is white in the latter species . The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows . Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field , but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled . The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species , with the forest raven the <unk> of all . Relative size is only useful when two species can be seen side by side , as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small . In Tasmania , the forest raven could be confused with the black currawong , though the latter species has more slender wings with white markings , a longer tail and a very different call . 
 Juveniles ( birds up to a year old ) have a shorter , shallower bill , which is dark grey with some pink at the base . The gape is pink . The plumage is softer and fluffier and often has a brown tint . It generally lacks the glossy sheen of adult birds , though a blue @-@ purple sheen can be seen sometimes on mantle and shoulders plumage . Birds between one and two years old closely resemble adults but retain juvenile feathers on wings and tail and have smaller bills . Birds between two and three years have adult plumage but lack the adult eye colour . Eye colour varies with age : nestlings up to four months old have blue @-@ grey eyes , juveniles aged from four to fourteen months have brown eyes , and immature birds have hazel eyes with blue <unk> around the pupil until age two years and ten months . 
 = = = Vocalization = = = 
 The call is considered the most reliable means of identification in areas where the forest raven 's range overlaps with other corvids . It is a deep and husky " korr @-@ korr @-@ korr @-@ korr " with a similarly drawn out last note to the Australian raven . It can also utter a barking alarm call . The calls of juveniles have a higher pitch than those of adult birds . Mated pairs greet each other with a specific return @-@ home call ; a long extended descending call , and characteristic flapping flight with reduced @-@ amplitude wingbeats . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The only member of the corvid family that has a permanent population in Tasmania , the forest raven is the most widely distributed bird species in the state . There are three populations in southern Victoria : from the vicinity of Lakes Entrance west across Gippsland to Wilsons Promontory , the Otway Ranges from 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) west of Torquay to Port Campbell , and lastly in the Grampians and Millicent Plain extending into south @-@ east South Australia . Isolated records suggest the latter two populations may actually be continuous . There are two disjunct populations in northern New South Wales . A coastal population is found from Tea Gardens north to <unk> National Park , while a more montane population is found along the Great Dividing Range and New England Tableland from Tenterfield and Glen Innes in the north to Gloucester Tops in the south . The gap between the two populations is around 70 km ( 43 mi ) , shrinking to 30 km ( 19 mi ) at Dorrigo . 
 The forest raven inhabits a wide range of habitat within Tasmania such as woods , open interrupted forest , mountains , coastal areas , farmland and town and city fringes . A survey of Mount Wellington found it to be one of the few birds that remained in open and marshland habitat at higher elevations over the winter . On mainland Australia it appears to be more confined to forests : wet and dry sclerophyll forest and cool temperate rainforest , as well as pine plantations in Victoria . Populations in Victoria and New South Wales are possibly expanding , with the species more evident in towns such as Forster @-@ <unk> and Port Macquarie , and along segments of the Oxley Highway between Wauchope and Walcha , and Thunderbolts Way between Gloucester and <unk> , most likely due to roadkill from increased vehicular traffic . It is unclear whether records since the 1970s in areas where the forest raven was unknown are the result of range expansion or improved field observations and identification . 
 Forest ravens fly from Tasmania and the mainland to islands well offshore in Bass Strait and may even traverse the strait entirely . First recorded on King Island in Bass Strait in 1979 , the forest raven has become more numerous and flocks of several hundred birds were recorded by 1997 . The island was previously inhabited by little ravens . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Its large range and abundance means the bird is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List ; some decrease has been noted but it is of insufficient size or duration to change classification . The populations of northern New South Wales have been classified as Near Threatened in 2000 by Garnett and Crowley and were estimated at the time to number about 10 @,@ 000 breeding pairs . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Sedentary and territorial , the forest raven is similar in breeding and feeding habits to the Australian raven . A single breeding pair and their brood occupy a territory of variable size — areas of 40 to 400 ha ( 99 to 988 acres ) have been recorded — and remains there year @-@ round , though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage . In northern New South Wales , forest ravens have been recorded nesting near Australian ravens and Torresian crows . They were observed warding off the Australian ravens but to a degree permitting the crows to pass through their territories . Forest ravens will defend their territory by chasing and mobbing intruding birds of prey as large as wedge @-@ tailed eagles and white @-@ bellied sea eagles . Agonistic displays to ward off potential intruders include flying to a high perch and calling loudly with head extended and hackles raised . Forest ravens will give their wings a flick on the upward wingbeat when flying to the perch and may continue flicking their wings after landing . Subadult and nonbreeding forest ravens form flocks that move around , though they may use the same roosting site for a few months at a time . Forest ravens generally walk when moving around on the ground , though do hop when hurrying , such as when trying to avoid an oncoming car on a road . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The forest raven is an omnivore , though it eats more meat than smaller corvids . Its diet includes a wide range of foods such as insects , carrion , fruit , grain and earthworms . It has been known to attack and eat birds as large as the little penguin , though many birds and mammals are already dead when encountered . In general , a significant proportion of its food appears to come from habitats in or near water . Forest ravens observed on the beach at Wilson 's Promontory would glean the sand and turn over or disturb pieces of seaweed and debris for insect prey . They have also been reported taking crabs from sandbars and raiding seabird colonies for eggs and young . 
 Forest ravens forage in pairs or groups of up to ten birds , though they may gather in much larger numbers if there is an abundant food source , such as a large carcass , rubbish or insect swarm . The species is attracted to areas where people have discarded excess food , such as rubbish tips , picnic grounds , parks , gardens and roads . Forest ravens sometimes forage in mixed @-@ species flocks with Torresian crows , little and Australian ravens . In these situations , the more abundant species may exclude the less abundant . In Tasmania , forest ravens have been recorded foraging with Pacific and silver gulls , and black currawongs . Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon ; birds rest in the hotter part of the day . Food is taken mainly from the ground , birds either finding objects while walking along and looking , and turning over objects with their bills as they go . Forest ravens often fly 1 – 2 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 6 @.@ 6 ft ) above the ground over marshland , heath or beaches looking for food . Nests of various birds , including domestic chickens and burrowing seabirds have been raided for eggs and young . Forest ravens have been observed attempting to raid the nest of ospreys on the New South Wales north coast . 
 Forest ravens cache food items for later consumption , generally using trees to evade other scavengers . Field observations in <unk> showed that they built stick @-@ like platforms 30 – 40 cm ( 12 – 16 in ) in diameter high in the canopies of trees as places to store and eat food . They were recorded storing food in tree forks 10 – 20 m ( 33 – 66 ft ) above the ground and within the folds of the bark of paperbark trees . In another field study , a forest raven stole a cape barren goose egg and hid it in a grassy tussock to consume later . 
 Alongside Australian ravens , forest ravens have been blamed for damaging orchards and killing lambs and poultry . This is not supported by fieldwork . They most often scavenge for afterbirth and newborn lamb faeces , which are highly nutritious . They are thought to have a beneficial role in cleaning up carcasses and consuming insect pests . Forest ravens prey on the larvae of the pasture beetle <unk> <unk> . The beetle can damage pastures and is an agricultural pest ; the raven may uproot plants when digging out the grubs . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Forest ravens breed after at least three years , and form monogamous pairs . Birds breed later in Tasmania than mainland Australia , though the species has been little @-@ studied . Eggs have been recorded from July to September and nestlings in September and October in New South Wales , while nestlings have been noted from September to December in Victoria . In Tasmania , the breeding season appears to take place from August to January . Forest ravens generally nest in forks in tall trees , usually eucalypts , below the canopy line . They have been recorded nesting on the ground on some Bass Strait Islands . Breeding success rates were impacted severely by droughts in New South Wales . 
 The nest is a bowl @-@ shaped structure of twigs lined with available materials such as leaves , wool , grass , bark , feathers , or occasionally horse manure or hair from cattle . The sticks are generally 4 – 14 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 55 in ) thick . Nests are sometimes renovated from previous years . A clutch can comprise up to six eggs , though usually four or five are laid . Measuring 45 by 31 mm ( 1 3 ⁄ 4 × 1 1 ⁄ 4 in ) , eggs are green @-@ cream and splotched with brown and grey markings . Eggs are laid every one to two days . Eggs are quite variable , and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified . Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female . The chicks are altricial and nidicolous ; that is , they are born helpless , naked and blind , and remain in the nest for an extended period . Both parents feed the young . 
 = = = Parasites = = = 
 The mite <unk> intermedius has been isolated from the forest raven . Infestation results in crusty ( hyperkeratotic ) grey lesions around their <unk> joints , the mites living in tunnels under the skin . The channel @-@ billed cuckoo ( Scythrops novaehollandiae ) has been recorded as a brood parasite . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 Like the Australian raven on mainland Australia , the Forest raven in Tasmania has a history of being shot or poisoned — generally by farmers as it is perceived to be a threat to livestock and orchard crops . It is not protected under Tasmania 's Nature Conservation Act 2002 and no permit is required if landowners seek to kill them . Larger numbers of forest ravens ( alongside swamp harriers and brown falcons ) were killed in 1958 as rabbit populations dwindled due to myxomatosis and predatory birds were thought to have turned their attention to poultry and livestock . Studies on corvids elsewhere in Australia showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare , but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked , and hence their poor reputation was unjustified . Forest ravens may do more good than harm by preying on insects and removing carrion . Despite their fondness for roadkill , forest ravens are rarely hit by vehicles . 
 = ToeJam & Earl III : Mission to Earth = 
 ToeJam & Earl III : Mission to Earth is an action video game released for the Xbox on October 23 , 2002 . Developed by ToeJam & Earl Productions and Visual Concepts , and published by Sega and Microsoft , it is the third installment in the ToeJam & Earl series . Players assume the role of one of three extraterrestrial protagonists : ToeJam and Earl , who starred in the series ' first two games , and Latisha , a new character . While using power @-@ ups to combat enemies , players seek to collect the twelve " Sacred Albums of Funk " and defeat the antagonistic " Anti @-@ Funk " . 
 The original two ToeJam & Earl games were a key Sega Genesis franchise , but development of a third game was prevented by the poor North American commercial performance of the console 's successor , the Sega Saturn . Versions of ToeJam & Earl III developed at different times for the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast were canceled , but the latter was completed for the Xbox . On release , the game met with poor sales and mixed reviews ; while certain critics found its gameplay innovative , its humor , soundtrack and graphics were variously praised and derided . Opinions of the game 's overall enjoyability and longevity were also mixed . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 ToeJam & Earl III follows the extraterrestrial protagonists ToeJam and Earl , who starred in the series ' previous games , and a new female character named Latisha . ToeJam is three @-@ legged and red ; Earl is overweight and orange . Both characters have been considered parodies of American hip @-@ hop and urban culture . Latisha has been variously described as " feisty " and " brimming with attitude " by critics . 
 The three characters journey to Earth , in order to retrieve the stolen twelve Sacred Albums of Funk and return them to Lamont the <unk> . Levels take place on terrains that represent Earth 's ecosystems . The game 's ultimate antagonist is the Anti @-@ Funk , whose defeat will " save the world from all that is <unk> " . The " funk " has been described as a parody of Star Wars ' the Force , with the Anti @-@ Funk being the dark side . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game has been called both a platform game and an action @-@ adventure game . GameSpot asserts that it combines elements of ToeJam & Earl and its platformer sequel , ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron , while GameNOW and Electronic Gaming Monthly liken it to the former game . The game features both single- and two @-@ player modes ; in both , players control one of the three protagonists . ToeJam moves quickly and jumps high , but has weak attacks ; Earl is tougher and has more powerful attacks , but is slow and jumps lower than ToeJam ; Latisha ranks between the two in terms of athleticism , and gains additional power @-@ ups later in the game . In the game 's two @-@ player mode , the camera moves between single and split @-@ screen as players maneuver their characters away from each other . Characters can share power @-@ ups when in close proximity . 
 The game 's randomly generated levels are connected together by hubs . Additional levels can be downloaded from Xbox Live . Level exploration is based around collecting items : the player searches for the Sacred Albums of Funk , and for keys that grant access to more levels . Enemies include rabbit ninja , a " demented chicken " , and " psycho cheerleaders " , which the player combats with Funk @-@ Fu and Funk Notes . Funk Notes are projectiles that render enemies " funkified " , or harmless ; more powerful than Funk @-@ Fu , they require the player to gather ammunition . The player may also find wrapped presents , which contain power @-@ ups such as rocket skates , spring shoes and food ; these variously grant greater defensive abilities , access to certain areas , and additional health . Another power @-@ up involves a simple rhythm game , and leaves nearby enemies " funkified " if the player successfully copies on @-@ screen rhythms . 
 = = Development = = 
 ToeJam & Earl and its sequel ToeJam & Earl in Panic on <unk> together formed one of the Mega Drive 's main series . However , creator Greg Johnson said that installments for the console 's Mega @-@ CD or 32X add @-@ ons were never planned , and though rumors of a new game persisted throughout the commercial life of the Sega Saturn console , that system 's poor performance in North America prevented development of a sequel . Johnson and programmer Mark Voorsanger regained the rights to ToeJam and Earl in 1995 , and in November 1998 made an agreement with GT Interactive to publish a new game in the franchise for the Nintendo 64 . Johnson and Voorsanger conducted research to determine whether series fans preferred the original ToeJam & Earl or its sequel ; the former emerged as the clear favorite . In April 1999 , however , it was reported that the deal with GT Interactive had fallen through ; the publisher had decided that the series ' previous game was not an encouraging success commercially , particularly in Europe . GT Interactive 's restructuring and the Nintendo 64 's declining commercial performance were also believed to be factors by commentators . 
 It was reported the following month that the developer was planning to create the game for Sony 's PlayStation 2 , perhaps to coincide with the console 's release . Ultimately , however , the developer became involved with Sega 's Dreamcast through Visual Concepts — a Sega developer in charge of third @-@ party game development . Johnson and Voorsanger began development of the third game with the intention to re @-@ make ToeJam & Earl ; according to Johnson , the game would include the same elements as the first game , but with improved graphics . However , this notion was curtailed by Visual Concepts , who felt that the result would be too old @-@ fashioned , and too niche in appeal . Johnson later said that he was unsure , at the time , whether to cater to fans who wanted a remake of the original or attempt to capture a new audience . 
 Visual Concepts assisted with the development process , as ToeJam & Earl Productions was struggling with the game 's technical demands . Johnson and Voorsanger indicated the development of a new character with the game 's working title , " ToeJam , Earl , and Latisha " . Lisa Lopes was nearly signed to provide Latisha 's voice acting , but disagreements over fees caused the deal to fail . Actress Sherrie Jackson provided the character 's voice instead . The game was previewed at E3 in 2001 , but Sega subsequently ceased its support of the Dreamcast due to poor commercial performance . Once again , Johnson 's preferred format was the PlayStation 2 or Nintendo GameCube , but the developer ultimately ported the game to Microsoft 's Xbox because of its technical simplicity , as well as free advertising offered to Sega by Microsoft . Promotional copies of the game portrayed the Anti @-@ Funk as a disembodied head reminiscent of a Ku Klux Klan mask — an anti @-@ racism statement , according to Johnson . Sega vetoed this , however , and the character was changed to a skull design for the game 's retail release . 
 In September 2013 an unreleased Dreamcast version of ToeJam & Earl III : Mission to Earth was found on a Katana Development Kit . Sega was asked to approve its release , but no response was ever received . The creators of this series , Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger , agreed to a community release . The prototype is now available for downloading online .

 According to GamaSutra , ToeJam & Earl III was met with mixed to positive reviews , while IGN asserts that the game was " thrashed soundly by critics " . Computer and Video Games lauded its " superb sense of humour and the kind of offbeat gameplay that shows up every other identikit shooter , stealth ' em up and extreme sports title as imagination @-@ devoid <unk> . " PC World praised the game 's " laugh out loud " humor , and acclaimed the two @-@ player mode as " damned good fun " . 
 GameNOW and Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the game 's power @-@ ups , whose strategic element the former enjoyed , and two @-@ player mode . However , GameNOW derided the game 's hip @-@ hop dialogue , and Electronic Gaming Monthly found it repetitive ; the latter also believed that Latisha was an unnecessary addition . Game Informer found the hip @-@ hop theme to be embarrassingly dated , and likened the game to In Living Color and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air . The reviewer also believed that its randomly generated levels necessitated " simple and arbitrary " mission goals . 
 EuroGamer praised the game 's graphics , camera angles and mini @-@ games , but complained about unfair enemies , annoying character accents and an arbitrary mix of musical genres . The reviewer believed that " [ the game , ] in the final analysis [ , ] is just not good enough to warrant spending £ 40 . " IGN gave it a " passable " verdict : the reviewer felt that the game 's brief initial appeal quickly gave way to repetition . He had a mixed opinion of its graphics , with praise given to the character animations , but criticism to perceived poor draw distance . GameSpot deemed the game " mediocre " . The reviewer noted that " the humor almost always falls flat " , and that " ToeJam 's speech [ ... ] is filled with stupid double entendres " . The website found the soundtrack to be dated , and called the game 's audio " a serious disappointment " . 
 The Guardian praised the originality of the characters , and the " crisply defined textures and realistic lighting " ; the paper deemed the game " a treat for the eyes " . However , the reviewers decided that the game was merely average overall , and noted its limited longevity . The Las Vegas Review @-@ Journal wrote of the game : " It 's all right , but probably most useful for certain parents to force on kids . " The Sydney Morning Herald described the game as " an average platform game that masks its conventional gameplay with over @-@ stimulating graphics " . The Daily Mirror called it " anarchic , fun , hilarious and very cool " . Entertainment Weekly wrote that " TJ & E is fun -- but forgettable fun . Still , its promise of downloadable content , and sheer silliness , brings some whimsy to the funk @-@ starved Xbox . " 
 = Hymns for the Amusement of Children = 
 Hymns for the Amusement of Children ( 1771 ) was the final work completed by English poet Christopher Smart . It was completed while Smart was imprisoned for outstanding debt at the King 's Bench Prison , and the work is his final exploration of religion . Although Smart spent a large portion of his life in and out of debt , he was unable to survive his time in the prison and died soon after completing the Hymns . 
 Smart 's Hymns are one of the first works of hymns dedicated to children , and they are intended to teach Christian virtues . Unlike some of the other works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum , such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs , this work was a success and went into many immediate editions . Part of the success of this work lies in the simplicity and accessibility of the text . However , Smart died before he ever saw the proceeds of the work and never learned of the book 's success . 
 = = Background = = 
 Smart was released from asylum in 1763 and published two religious works , A Song to David and Hymn and Spiritual Songs , soon after . These were quickly attacked by critics that declared Smart was still " mad " and subsequently failed to become popular . Smart continued to work on religious works as he struggled to publish and support himself . However , he quickly fell into debt and , on 20 April 1770 , he was arrested and sent to Debtors ' prison . 
 On January 11 , 1771 , he was recommended to the King 's Bench Prison . Although he was in prison , Charles Burney purchased the " Rules " ( allowing him some freedom ) in order to help make Smart 's final weeks peaceful although pathetic . In his final letter , written to Rev. Mr. Jackson , Smart begged for three shillings in order to purchase food . Soon after , Smart died , May 20 , 1771 , from either liver failure or pneumonia , after completing his final work , Hymns , for the Amusement of Children . 
 It is unknown how many poems published in the Hymns were written before Smart was imprisoned or during his final days , but at least one , titled " Against Despair " was produced during this time . A different version of the poem was published after his death in the Gentleman 's Magazine . This version included a note claiming , " <unk> by the late C. Smart , in the King 's @-@ Bench , " which verifies that he was writing hymns throughout this time , or , at least , editing them to create a better version . 
 Although five editions of the Hymns were published in the 18th century , only one edition was published before Smart died . This edition was published by his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Thomas Carnan , and was announced in the Public Advertiser 27 December 1770 . However , this edition did not list Smart as the author . It is possible that there was a sixth edition of the Hymns , but that has since " disappeared " ; there is also a possible pirated edition produced by Thomas Walker . Although the work made it as far as Boston , Massachusetts , as shown by an advertisement for selling the work in 1795 , no Boston editions have been found , but such editions could exist in addition to the Philadelphia , Pennsylvania edition . 
 Smart 's first children 's hymn was " A Morning Hymn , for all the little good boys and girls " in the Lilliputian Magazine in 1751 . During this time , there were only two models for him to base his children 's hymns on : the works of Isaac Watts and of Charles Wesley . Watts 's work attempted to amuse children while Wesley 's attempted to simplify morality for them . It is possible that Smart 's Hymns were not modelled on Watts 's or Wesley 's actual hymns or songs , but instead after a note in Watts 's work the Divine Songs which says : 
 A Slight Specimen of Moral Songs , such as I wish some happy and condescending genius would undertake for the use of children , and perform much better ... The sense and subjects might be borrow 'd plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon , from all the common appearances of nature , from all the occurrences in the civil life , both in city and country : ( which would also afford matter for other Divine Songs . ) Here the language and measures should be easy and flowing with <unk> , and without the solemnities of religion , or the sacred names of God and holy things ; that children might find delight and profit together . 
 The work was dedicated " to his Royal Highness Prince Frederick , Bishop of <unk> , these hymns , composed for his amusement , are , with all due Submission and Respect , humbly inscribed to him , as the best of Bishops , by his Royal Highness 's Most Obedient and Devoted Servant , Christopher Smart . " Although the prince , the second son of King George III , was only seven at the time , Smart was given special permission to dedicate the work to the boy through the intervention with the royal family by either Richard Dalton or the King 's Chaplain , William Mason . 
 = = Hymns for the Amusement of Children = = 
 In essence , the Hymns for the Amusement of Children is intended to teach children the specific virtues that make up the subject matter of the work . While trying to accomplish this goal , Smart emphasizes the joy of creation and Christ 's sacrifice that allowed for future salvation . However , he didn 't just try to spread joy , but structured his poems to treat valuable lessons about morality ; his subjects begin with the three Theological Virtues ( Faith , Hope , and Charity ) , then the four Cardinal Virtues ( Prudence , Justice , Temperance , and Fortitude ) and adds Mercy . The next six hymns deal with Christian duties and are followed by ten hymns on the Gospels . The final works introduce the miscellaneous Christian virtues that were necessary to complete Christopher 's original self @-@ proclaimed " plan to make good girls and boys . " 
 All but three of the hymns were provided with a corresponding woodblock illustration . The original illustrations either represented the scene of the hymn or a symbolic representation of the hymn . However , later editions of the work sometimes included illustrations that did not match the corresponding hymn , which was the fault of " a general deterioration of standards in book production " . With such possibilities , it is hard to justify an exact relationship between any particular hymn and illustration . 
 There are thirty @-@ nine hymns included in Hymns for the Amusement of Children : 
 = = = Mirth = = = 
 Besides the hymns that are " expected " in a book of hymns , Arthur Sherbo points out that the collection contains hymns " on learning and on ' good @-@ nature to animals ' . " In particular , he emphasizes Hymn XXV " Mirth " as " showing anew the love for flowers that is a recurring characteristic of his poetry " as it reads : 
 If you are merry sing away , 
 And touch the organs sweet ; 
 This is the Lord 's triumphant day , 
 Ye children in the gall <unk> gay , 
 Shout from each goodly seat . 
 It shall be May to @-@ morrow 's morn , 
 A field then let us run , 
 And deck us in the blooming thorn , 
 Soon as the cock begins to warn , 
 And long before the sun . 
 I give the praise to Christ alone , 
 My pinks already shew ; 
 And my streak 'd roses fully blown , 
 The sweetness of the Lord make known , 
 And to his glory grow . 
 To Sherbo , this poem is " a good example of the artless quality " of the whole collection of Hymns . 
 = = = Long @-@ Suffering of God = = = 
 According to Moira Dearnley , Hymn XXIX " Long @-@ Suffering of God " is " one of the more pathetic poems in Hymns for the Amusement of Children . " As a poem , it " restates Smart 's certainty that the long @-@ suffering God will eventually bestow his grace upon the barren human soul " as it reads : 
 Thus man goes on from year to year , 
 And bears no fruit at all ; 
 But gracious God , still <unk> , 
 Bids show 'rs of blessing fall . 
 The beams of mercy , dews of grace , 
 Our Saviour still <unk> 
 Ha ! ha ! the soul regains her place , 
 And sweetens all the skies . 
 This final poem fittingly ends in " manic exultation " and shows " that for Smart , <unk> of the grace and mercy of God were inseparable from madness . " 
 = = = The Conclusion of the Matter = = = 
 Smart 's final poem of the work , XXXIX " The Conclusion of the Matter " , demonstrates to Neil Curry that the " joy and optimism of [ Smart ] are unwavering . " Smart " does not look back , he looks forward and the sequence ends on a note of triumph " as it reads : 
 Fear God - obey his just decrees , 
 And do it hand , and heart , and knees ; 
 For after all our utmost care 
 There 's nought like penitence and prayer . 
 Then weigh the balance in your mind , 
 Look forward , not one glance behind ; 
 Let no foul fiend retard your pace , 
 Hosanna ! Thou hast won the race . 
 However , as Curry claims , " in this world Smart himself had won nothing . " Instead , Curry believes what Christopher Hunter stated about his uncle : " I trust he is now at peace ; it was not his portion here . " 
 = = Critical response = = 
 Although he wrote his second set of hymns , Hymns for the Amusement of Children , for a younger audience , Smart cares more about emphasizing the need for children to be moral instead of " innocent " . These works have been seen as possibly too complicated for " amusement " because they employ ambiguities and complicated theological concepts . In particular , Mark Booth questions " why , in this carefully polished writing .... are the lines sometimes relatively hard to read for their <unk> sense ? " Arthur Sherbo disagreed with this sentiment strongly and claims the Hymns " are more than mere hack work , tossed off with speed and indifference . They were written when Smart was in prison and despairing of rescue . Into these poems , some of them of a bare simplicity and naiveté that have few equals in literature of merit anywhere ... " However , he does admit some of the argument when he claims that " Generosity " , along with a handful other hymns , was " not so simple and surely proved too much for the children for whom they were bought . " 
 Not all critics agree that the work is too complex for children , and some , like Marcus Walsh and Karina Williamson , view that the works would have fit the appropriate level for children in the 18th century , especially with the short length of each hymn and a small illustration of the scene proceeding each one . This is not to say that the works are " simple " , because many words are complex , but , as Donald Davie explains , there is a " naiveté " in the work that allow them to be understood . In particular , Moira Dearnley claims that the hymns contain a " high @-@ spirited delight in the day @-@ to @-@ day life of children , the joy that characterizes the best the Hymns for the Amusement of Children .

 = Armament of the Iowa @-@ class battleship = 
 The armament of the Iowa @-@ class battleships underwent a massive development since the first Iowa @-@ class ship was laid down in June 1940 . Owing to the continual development of the weaponry aboard these battleships they remain the most heavily armed gunships the United States has ever put to sea . In their World War II configuration , each of the Iowa @-@ class battleships had a main battery of 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns that could hit targets nearly 20 statute miles ( 32 km ) away with a variety of artillery shells designed for anti @-@ ship or bombardment work . The secondary battery of 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) guns could hit targets nearly 9 statute miles ( 14 km ) away with solid projectiles or proximity fuzed shells , and were equally adept in an anti @-@ aircraft role and for damaging smaller ships . Each of the four battleships carried a wide array of 20 mm and 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns for defense against enemy aircraft . 
 When reactivated and modernized in the 1980s each battleship retained the original battery of nine 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns , but the secondary battery on each battleship was reduced from ten twin @-@ gun mounts and twenty guns to six twin @-@ gun mounts with 12 guns to allow for the installation of two platforms for the Tomahawk missiles . Each battleship also received four Harpoon missile magazines , Phalanx anti @-@ aircraft / anti @-@ missile Gatling gun systems , and electronic warfare suites . When required ( duty in the Persian Gulf in particular ) up to twelve single mount M2 Browning 50 caliber machine guns and four 35 mm Bushmaster cannon were installed to provide close range defense against small surface craft .

 The primary armament of an Iowa @-@ class battleship consisted of nine breech @-@ loading 16 inch ( 406 mm ) / 50 @-@ caliber Mark 7 naval guns , which were housed in three 3 @-@ gun turrets : two forward and one aft in a configuration known as " 2 @-@ A @-@ 1 " . The guns were 66 feet ( 20 m ) long ( 50 times their 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) bore , or 50 calibers , from breechface to muzzle ) . About 43 feet ( 13 m ) protruded from the gun house . Each gun weighed about 239 @,@ 000 pounds ( 108 000 kg ) without the breech , or 267 @,@ 900 pounds with the breech . They fired projectiles weighing from 1 @,@ 900 to 2 @,@ 700 pounds ( 860 to 1 @,@ 220 kg ) at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 690 ft / s ( 820 m / s ) ( 1834 @.@ 1 mph ) to a maximum range of 42 @,@ 345 yards ( 38 @,@ 720 m ) ( 24 @.@ 06 mi ) using an armor @-@ piercing shell . 
 Each gun rested within an armored turret , but only the top of the turret protruded above the main deck . The turret extended either four decks ( Turrets 1 and 3 ) or five decks ( Turret 2 ) down . The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret . At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them . All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by <unk> bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret . Each turret required a crew of 77 — 94 men to operate . The turrets were not actually attached to the ship , but sat on rollers , which meant that if the ship were to capsize the turrets would fall out . Each turret cost US $ 1 @.@ 4 million , but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves . 
 The turrets were " three @-@ gun , " not " triple , " because each barrel could be elevated and fired independently . The ship could fire any combination of its guns , including a broadside of all nine . 
 The guns could be elevated from − 5 ° to + 45 ° , moving at up to 12 ° per second . The turrets could be rotated about 300 ° at a rate of about four degrees per second and can even be fired back beyond the beam , which is sometimes called " over the shoulder . " The guns were never fired horizontally forward ( in the 1980s refit , a satellite up @-@ link antenna was mounted at the bow ) . To distinguish between the rounds fired from different battleships the Iowa class used dye bags which allowed artillery observers to determine which rounds had been fired by which ship . Iowa , New Jersey , Missouri , and Wisconsin were assigned the colors orange , blue , red and green , respectively . 
 Within each turret , a red stripe on the interior wall , inches from the railing , marked the boundary of the barrel 's recoil , warning the crew to keep back . 
 When brought into service during World War II the guns had a barrel life of roughly 290 rounds , limited in large part by the <unk> @-@ Cellulose ( NC ) propellant . After World War II the Navy switched to smokeless Powder <unk> ( SPD ) , a cooler @-@ burning propellant , which increased the barrel life from 290 to about 350 rounds . This was increased further by the introduction of a titanium dioxide and wax compound known as " Swedish Additive " on New Jersey for her tour in Vietnam , and later used on all four Iowa 's when they were reactivated in the 1980s . These measures were further augmented by the addition of polyurethane jackets , which were placed over the powder bags to reduce gaseous erosion during the firing of the guns . These measures greatly prolonged barrel life , and ultimately resulted in a shift from measuring barrel life in Equivalent Service Rounds ( ESR ) to measuring barrel life in Fatigue Equivalent Rounds ( <unk> ) . 
 After the guns were fired , each rifle barrel had to be cleaned . Unlike small caliber guns which can be field @-@ stripped , the guns aboard an Iowa @-@ class battleship could not be disassembled , so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more to ensure that the barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned . To clean the rifles , a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel , where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells . Within the turret , crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated , while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot , and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16 @-@ inch shells from the gun barrels .

 The early main battery fire control consisted of the Fire Control Tower , two Mark 38 Gun Fire Control Systems ( GFCS ) , and fire control equipment located in two of the three turrets . As modernized in the 1980s , each turret carried a DR @-@ 810 radar that measured the muzzle velocity of each gun , which made it easier to predict the velocity of succeeding shots . Together with the Mark 160 FCS and better propellant consistency , the improvements created the most accurate battleship @-@ caliber guns ever made .

 The fire control tower ( pictured ) was the Gunnery Officer 's heavily armored battle station , and it was accessible to the Captain 's heavily armored battle station , the Battle Bridge . It was equipped with periscopes poking through the armor , and control consoles showing the status of the ship 's weapons ( director bearings , turret bearings , gun 's loaded status , Fire Control ( FC ) Radar displays , ... ) . With the radar 's displays , the Gunnery Officer could determine what Spots ( aim corrections ) were needed by watching the fall of shot around the target .

 The major components of the Mk38 Gun Fire Control System ( GFCS ) were the Director , Plotting Room , and interconnecting data transmission equipment . Two systems , forward and aft , were each complete and independent . Their plotting rooms were isolated to protect against battle damage propagating from one to the other .
