 Mesoscale convective systems , which can evolve into tropical cyclones , form along areas such as tropical waves or easterly waves which progress westward along monsoon troughs and the Intertropical Convergence Zone in regions of ample low level moisture , convergent surface winds , and divergent winds aloft . This typically occurs north of the equator from Africa across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans , as well as across the northwest and southwest Pacific oceans , from Australia eastward into Oceania , the Indian ocean , Indonesia , and from southeast Brazil into the southern Atlantic ocean . It is also noted on occasion in the southeast Pacific ocean mild to cool ENSO years , outside of El Niño . More intense systems form over land than water . 
 = = = Lee of warm water bodies in the winter = = = 
 In the cases of Lake @-@ effect snow and polar lows , the convective systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads to an increase in moisture and significant vertical motion . This vertical motion leads to the development of showers and thunderstorms in areas of cyclonic flow on the backside of extratropical cyclones .

 A mesoscale convective <unk> ( MCV ) <unk> a mid @-@ level low @-@ pressure center within an MCS that pulls winds into a circling pattern , or vortex . Once the parent MCS dies , this vortex can persist and lead to future convective development . With a core only 30 miles ( 48 km ) to 60 miles ( 97 km ) and up to 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) deep , an MCV can occasionally spawn a mesoscale surface low pressure area which appears on mesoscale surface weather analyses . But an MCV can take on a life of its own , persisting for up to several days after its parent MCS has dissipated . The orphaned MCV will sometimes then become the seed of the next thunderstorm outbreak . An MCV that moves into tropical waters , such as the Gulf of Mexico , can serve as the nucleus for a tropical storm or hurricane . 
 = Porpoise = 
 Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals that are sometimes referred to as <unk> , all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae , parvorder Odontoceti ( toothed whales ) . There are six extant species of porpoise . They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins . The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened , spade @-@ shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins . Porpoises , and other cetaceans , belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even @-@ toed ungulates , and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses , having diverged from them about 40 million years ago . 
 Porpoises range in size from the 1 @.@ 4 metres ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) and 54 kilograms ( 119 lb ) vaquita , the smallest cetacean to be discovered , to the 2 @.@ 3 metres ( 7 @.@ 5 ft ) and 220 kilograms ( 490 lb ) Dall 's porpoise . Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism in that the females are larger than males . They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers . Dall 's porpoise is one of the fastest cetaceans discovered , with the ability to travel at 41 knots . Porpoises have the ability to produce biosonar and it is their primary sensory system . Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths . They have a layer of fat , or blubber , under the skin to keep them warm in cold water . 
 Porpoises are not very widespread , with many specialising near the polar regions , usually near the coast . Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid , much like the rest of the odontocetes . Males typically mate with multiple females every year , but females only mate every two to three years . Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them . Some porpoises produce a variety of clicks and whistles , which are thought to be primarily for social purposes . A few species , like the harbour porpoise , are highly sociable , but pods generally do not exceed ten individuals for most species . 
 Porpoises were , and still are , hunted by some countries by means of drive hunting . Some species are attributed with high levels of intelligence . At the 2012 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights , listing cetaceans as non @-@ human persons . The vaquita nearly became extinct in the twentieth century , with a predicted population of fewer than 100 individuals , and , since the extinction of the baiji , is considered the most endangered cetacean . Besides drive hunting , they also face threats from bycatch , competition ( from humans ) , and marine pollution . Porpoises are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks , but breeding success has been poor . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 Porpoises , along with whales and dolphins , are descendants of land @-@ living ungulates ( hoofed animals ) that first entered the oceans around 50 million years ago ( Mya ) . During the Miocene ( 23 to 5 Mya ) , mammals were fairly modern , meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time . The cetaceans diversified , and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya . The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific , with animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later , during the Pliocene .

 Recently discovered hybrids between male harbour porpoises and female Dall 's porpoises indicate the two species may actually be members of the same genus . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Anatomy = = = 
 Porpoises have a bulbous head , no external ear flaps , a non @-@ flexible neck , a torpedo shaped body , limbs modified into flippers , and a tail fin . Their skull has small eye orbits , small , blunt snouts , and eyes placed on the sides of the head . Porpoises range in size from the 1 @.@ 4 metres ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) and 54 kilograms ( 119 lb ) Vaquita to the 2 @.@ 3 metres ( 7 @.@ 5 ft ) and 220 kilograms ( 490 lb ) Dall 's porpoise . Overall , they tend to be dwarfed by other cetaceans . Almost all species have female @-@ biased sexual dimorphism , with the females being larger than the males , although those physical differences are generally small ; one exception is Dall 's porpoise . 
 Odontocetes possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells . Unlike human teeth , which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum , whale teeth have cementum outside the gum . Porpoises , like other odontocetes , possess only one blowhole . Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole , forming an upward , steamy spout , followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs . All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber . This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate , protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat , and energy for leaner times . Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber , but some species compensate for this with lanugos . 
 Porpoises have a two @-@ chambered stomach that is similar in structure to those of terrestrial carnivores . They have fundic and pyloric chambers . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 Porpoises have two flippers on the front , and a tail fin . Although porpoises do not possess fully developed hind limbs , they possess discrete rudimentary appendages , which may contain feet and digits . Their flippers , for example , contain four digits . Porpoises are fast swimmers in comparison to seals , which typically cruise at 5 – 15 kn , or 9 – 28 kilometres per hour ( 5 @.@ 6 – 17 @.@ 4 mph ) ; Dall 's porpoise , in comparison , can travel at speeds up to 74 kilometres per hour ( 46 mph ) . The fusing of the neck vertebrae , while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds , decreases flexibility , making it impossible for them to turn their head . When swimming , they move their tail fin and lower body up and down , propelling themselves through vertical movement , while their flippers are mainly used for steering . Flipper movement is continuous . Some species log out of the water , which may allow then to travel faster , and sometimes they porpoise out of the water , meaning jump out of the water . Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers . They have a very well defined and triangular dorsal fin , allowing them to steer better in the water . Unlike their dolphin counterparts , they are adapted for coastal shores , bays , and estuaries . 
 = = = Senses = = = 
 The porpoise ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment . In humans , the middle ear works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air 's low impedance and the cochlear fluid 's high impedance . In whales , and other marine mammals , there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments . Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear , porpoises receive sound through the throat , from which it passes through a low @-@ impedance fat @-@ filled cavity to the inner ear . The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air @-@ filled sinus pockets , which allow for greater directional hearing underwater . Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon . This melon consists of fat , and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression . The large bulge on top of the porpoises head is caused by the melon 
 The porpoise eye is relatively small for its size , yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight . As well as this , the eyes of a porpoise are placed on the sides of its head , so their vision consists of two fields , rather than a binocular view like humans have . When porpoises surface , their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light ; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells , meaning they can see in both dim and bright light . Porpoises do , however , lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals . Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs , enlarged pupils ( which shrink as they surface to prevent damage ) , slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum ; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and , therefore , they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area . 
 The olfactory lobes are absent in porpoises , suggesting that they have no sense of smell . 
 Porpoises are not thought to have a good sense of taste , as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether . However , some have preferences between different kinds of fish , indicating some sort of attachment to taste . 
 = = = Sleep = = = 
 Unlike most animals , porpoises are conscious breathers . All mammals sleep , but porpoises cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown . While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited , porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time , so that they may swim , breathe consciously , and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 Porpoises are fully aquatic creatures , which means that courtship and birth behaviours are very different from those of terrestrial and semi @-@ aquatic creatures . Since they are unable to go onto land to calve , they deliver the baby with the foetus positioned for tail @-@ first delivery . This prevents the baby from drowning either upon or during delivery . Being mammals , the females have mammary glands used for nursing calves ; to feed the new @-@ born calf , the mother must squirt the milk into its mouth . This milk contains high amounts of fat , which aids in the development of blubber ; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste . The calves are weaned at about 11 months of age . Females , referred to as " cows " , carry the responsibility of childcare as males , referred to as " bulls " , play no part in raising calves . Females deliver a single calf after a gestation period lasting about a year , the calf is dependent for one to two years , and maturity occurs after seven to ten years , all varying between the species . This mode of reproduction produces few offspring , but increases the probability of each one surviving . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Porpoises eat a wide variety of creatures . The stomach contents of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish , and sometimes pelagic fish . They may also eat benthic invertebrates . In rare cases , algae , such as Ulva lactuca , is consumed . Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish , like herring , and their diet varies between seasons . The stomach contents of Dall 's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish , like capelin and sardines . Their stomachs also contained some deep @-@ sea benthic organisms . 
 The finless porpoise is known to also follow seasonal migrations . It is known that populations in the mouth of the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns . In Japan , sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year @-@ round . 
 Little is known about the diets of other species of porpoises . A dissection of three Burmeister 's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids . A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts . Nothing is known about the diet of the spectacled porpoise .

 = = = Research history = = = 
 In Aristotle 's time , the 4th century BCE , porpoises were regarded as fish due to their superficial similarity . Aristotle , however , could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates , such as blood ( circulation ) , lungs , uterus and fin anatomy . His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans , but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins , as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “ Natural history ” . In the art of this and subsequent periods , porpoises are portrayed with a long snout ( typical of dolphins ) and a high @-@ arched head . The harbour porpoise was one of the most accessible species for early <unk> , because it could be seen very close to land , inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe . Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises . One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray . It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish . 
 = = = In captivity = = = 
 Porpoises , as opposed to their dolphin counterparts , don 't thrive in captivity , and it is very difficult to maintain a porpoise . Currently , there are five porpoises in captivity , two in Vancouver , and three in Hiroshima . Among their collection , the reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima houses many sea creatures , among them are three finless porpoises . In the Vancouver Aquarium , there are two harbour porpoises on display : Jack , who beached himself in 2011 onto Horseshoe Bay , and Daisy , who beached herself into Horseshoe Bay in 2008 . 
 Harbour porpoises have historically been kept in captivity , under the assumption that they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow @-@ water habitats . Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide , nearly 100 were kept in Denmark . Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured , or damage sustained during capture and transit . Almost all died within 14 months . Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises , and there are only six recorded births ( of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises ) . Lack of births in captivity is mainly due the fact that there were few breeding attempts , many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature . 
 Finless porpoises have commonly been kept in Japan , as well as China and Indonesia . Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan , eleven in China , and at least two in Indonesia . Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them , and there have been five recorded births . Three calves died moments after their birth , but two survived for several years . This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity , and this could open up new conservation options . 
 Dall 's porpoises have been kept in captivity , but not in great numbers . Nine were captured in the U.S. and nine more in Japan , a total of eighteen , but none were successfully kept in captivity . There were considerable difficulties dealing with these animals , most of them rammed their heads at the walls and the bottom . They sometimes refused to feed . The skin was sloughed at an early stage due to speed limitation in their confining tanks . A male showed irritable behaviour . None of the Dall 's porpoises survived for long . 
 = = = Threats = = = 
 = = = = Drive hunting = = = = 
 Porpoises and other smaller cetaceans , mainly dolphins , are hunted in an activity known as drive hunting . This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach . Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets . Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world , including the Solomon Islands , the Faroe Islands , Peru , and Japan , the most well @-@ known practitioner of this method . By numbers , porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat , though some end up in dolphinariums . Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism , and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose , thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year . 
 = = = = Fishing = = = = 
 Porpoises are highly affected by bycatch . Many porpoises , mainly the vaquita , are subject to great mortality due to gillnetting . Although it is the world 's most endangered marine cetacean , the vaquita continues to be caught in small @-@ mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range . Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year , which is over 17 % of the population size . Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting , but on a less threatening scale due to their high population ; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5 % due to this . 
 The fishing market , historically has always had a porpoise bycatch . In 1981 , it was legal to kill 22 @,@ 500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna . This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises , and when fishermen find these tuna , more often than not , a porpoise is also entangled in a net . Sometimes , a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna , and when fishermen cast a seine , the porpoises are trapped in the net , and drown because they can 't surface . Today , the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch . 
 = = = = Environmental hazards = = = = 
 Porpoises are very sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances , and are keystone species , which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment . Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction , ship traffic , fishing , and military exercises . Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals . Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable , and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials , mistaking them for food items . As a result , the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring . Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals . 
 The military and geologists employ strong sonar and produce an increases in noise in the oceans . Marine mammals that make use of biosonar for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise , but may race to the surface in panic . This may lead to a bubbling out of blood gases , and the animal then dies because the blood vessels become blocked , so @-@ called decompression sickness . This effect , of course , only occurs in porpoises that dive to great depths , such as Dall 's porpoise . 
 Additionally , civilian vessels produce sonar waves in order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are . Similar to the navy , some boats produce waves that attract porpoises , while others may repel them . The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 The Harbour porpoise , spectacled porpoise , Burmeister 's porpoise , and Dall 's porpoise are all listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( CMS ) . In addition , the Harbour porpoise is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic , North East Atlantic , Irish and North Seas ( <unk> ) , the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea , Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area ( ACCOBAMS ) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia . Their conservation statuses are either at least concern or data deficient . 
 As of 2014 , only five hundred and five Yangtze finless porpoises remained in the main section of the Yangtze , with an alarming population density in Ezhou and Zhenjiang . While many threatened species decline rate slows after their classification , population decline rates of the porpoise are actually accelerating . While population decline tracked from 1994 to 2008 has been pegged at a rate of 6 @.@ 06 % annually , from 2006 to 2012 , the porpoise population decreased by more than half . Finless porpoise population decrease of 69 @.@ 8 % in just a 22 @-@ year span from 1976 to 2000 . 5 @.@ 3 % . A majority of factors of this population decline are being driven by the massive growth in Chinese industry since 1990 which caused increased shipping and pollution and ultimately environmental degradation . Some of these can be seen in damming of the river as well as illegal fishing activity . To protect the species , China 's Ministry of Agriculture classified the species as being National First Grade Key Protected Wild Animal , the strictest classification by law , meaning it is illegal to bring harm to a porpoise . Protective measures in the Tian @-@ e @-@ Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve has increased its population of porpoises from five to forty in twenty five years . The Chinese Academy of Science 's Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology has been working with the World Wildlife Fund to ensure the future for this subspecies , and have placed five porpoises in another well @-@ protected area , the He @-@ wang @-@ <unk> oxbow . Five protected natural reserves have been established in areas of the highest population density and mortality rates with measures being taken to ban patrolling and harmful fishing gear in those areas . There have also been efforts to study porpoise biology to help specialize conservation through captivation breeding . The Baiji Dolphinarium , was established in 1992 at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan which allowing the study of behavioral and biological factors affecting the finless porpoise , specifically breeding biology like seasonal changes in reproductive hormones and breeding behavior . 
 Because vaquitas are indigenous to the Gulf of California , Mexico is leading conservation efforts with the creation of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita ( CIRVA ) , which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita 's habitat . CIRVA has worked together with the CITES , the Endangered Species Act , and the Marine Mammal Protection Act ( MMPA ) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves . CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets . In order to try to prevent extinction , the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering the upper part of the Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta . They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing , with compensation to those affected , that may pose a threat to the vaquita . 
 = Russula densifolia = 
 Russula densifolia , commonly known as the crowded russula or the reddening russula , is a species of agaric fungus in the family Russulaceae . It was first described in 1833 and given its current name in 1876 . A widespread species , it is found in Asia , Europe , and North America , where it fruits on the ground in mixed and deciduous forests . Fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) are robust and squat , with caps up to 14 @.@ 5 cm ( 5 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter , and stems that are 2 – 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) long by 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The mushrooms are characterized by the red and then black color changes that occur in the flesh when it is bruised , and a relatively thick cap cuticle . Although the mushroom is sold as an edible species in some areas of Asia , it is mild to moderately toxic , and may cause gastrointestinal upset if consumed . Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the mushroom . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described by Louis Secretan in 1833 as Agaricus adustus var. <unk> . In 1876 , Claude @-@ Casimir Gillet transferred it to the genus Russula . Russula densifolia is classified in the section <unk> of Russula subgenus <unk> , which consists of species with robust , squat fruit bodies that discolor to brown or black . 
 Robert Shaffer defined four forms of R. densifolia in a 1962 monograph on section <unk> , differentiating them by spore print color , fruiting pattern , odor , gill spacing , and the intensity of the color change with bruising . Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America : form <unk> has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray ; form <unk> has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills ; form <unk> produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two @-@ layered cap cuticle . Form <unk> , found in the eastern United States , grows gregariously in jack pine and Scotch pine forests . The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms , as well as f. <unk> , published by Patrick <unk> in 1996 , together into synonymy . Other synonyms include Rolf Singer 's 1931 variety <unk> , Roger Heim 's 1938 variety <unk> , and C. <unk> 's 1999 variety <unk> . 
 The specific epithet <unk> derives from the Latin words <unk> ( meaning " compact " or " placed close together " ) and <unk> meaning " leaf " , and refers to the closely spaced gills . The mushroom is commonly known as the " dense @-@ gilled brittlegill " or the " reddening russula " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap , initially convex when young , becomes almost flattened , depressed , or funnel @-@ shaped in maturity , and reaches a diameter of 4 @.@ 5 – 14 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 7 in ) . The smooth cap surface is sticky in moist , young specimens , but develops a polished look when dry . It is initially white before turning brownish gray and eventually blackish in age . The cap margin is curved inward throughout most of the life of the fruit body . The cap cuticle can be peeled up to one @-@ half the radius of the cap . The flesh is white , but slowly stains reddish then grayish @-@ black after being exposed to air . This characteristic staining reaction can be slow to develop , or may not develop at all , especially in old fruit bodies where the underlying tissue has already darkened . The flesh has no distinctive odor , and a hot , bitter taste . 
 Gills are adnate ( squarely fused ) to slightly decurrent ( extending a short way down the length of the stem ) , and interspersed with many tiers of lamellulae ( short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem ) . They are very crowded , with about 7 – 12 gills per centimeter . Initially creamy white in color , they will stain reddish then blackish where they have been injured , or sometimes develop dirty reddish stains with age . The stem measures 2 – 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) long by 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 0 in ) thick , and is nearly equal in width throughout its length . It is solid ( i.e. , not hollow ) and hard , initially white before aging to brownish @-@ black , and has a smooth to slightly scaly , dry surface . 
 Russula densifolia produces a white to pale yellow spore print . Spores are oval to elliptical to roughly spherical , hyaline ( translucent ) , amyloid , and measure 7 @.@ 6 – 9 @.@ 5 by 6 @.@ 7 – 7 @.@ 5 µm . They have a rough , reticulate surface marked by ridges and low , isolated warts that are 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 5 μm high . The cystidia in the hymenium are thin @-@ walled and hyaline , with shapes ranging from club @-@ shaped with broad tips to somewhat fuse @-@ shaped with short and narrow appendages at the tip ; cystidia have dimensions of 30 – 80 by 5 – 10 µm . Under the hymenium , the subhymenium is starkly differentiated . There are abundant sphaerocysts ( fragile , spherical cells common in the Russulaceae ) present in the gill tissue , and the cap tissue has clusters of these cells . The cap cuticle , typically 125 – 200 µm thick , is embedded in a gelatinous layer , and is differentiated into two layers : the epicutis , which consists of interwoven hyphae , and the underlying <unk> . Shaffer attempted to differentiated several forms of the mushroom by differences in cap cuticle thickness and morphology , although these forms are now not considered to have taxonomic significance .

 The mushroom is mild to moderately toxic , and may cause gastrointestinal upset if consumed . David Arora has noted that much of the bitter taste can be removed with cooking , but " the end product is insipid at best and indigestible or even poisonous at worst . " Despite this , however , the mushroom is sold as an edible species in <unk> Province and Chiang Mai Province in northern Thailand . It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported <unk> activity .

 Another similarly colored Russula is R. nigricans , which can be distinguished from R. densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills . Another lookalike , R. <unk> , has a dry cap surface , and a mild taste . R. <unk> stains directly to black when injured , and has a taste reminiscent of menthol . R. densifolia is often confused with R. <unk> , but the latter 's gills do not change color when bruised . R. <unk> , found with conifers , has a less acrid taste , and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red .

 Russula densifolia is a mycorrhizal species . Descriptions have been published of the morphology of the ectomycorrhizae that it forms with European beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) , and Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) . Its mushrooms grow on the ground singly , scattered , or in groups in both mixed and deciduous forests , and tend to appear in the summer and autumn . In Spain , it is common in dune pine forests . Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the fungus Asterophora lycoperdoides . Widely distributed , Russula densifolia is known from Asia ( including China , India , Japan , and Thailand ) , Europe and North America . 
 In a study of the chronological sequence of ectomycorrhizal fungi communities of Pinus densiflora forests of eastern China , R. densifolia was shown to reach its peak abundance in 30 @-@ year @-@ old stands . In another Chinese study , the species was found to be one of the six most common Russula species associated with 1 – 2 year @-@ old seedlings of Pinus yunnanensis . In Mexico , they have been found with oak .

This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia , where it is known as the tree sparrow , and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States , where it is known as the Eurasian tree sparrow or German sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated American tree sparrow . Although several subspecies are recognised , the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range . 
 The Eurasian tree sparrow 's untidy nest is built in a natural cavity , a hole in a building or the large nest of a European magpie or white stork . The typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks . This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds , but invertebrates are also consumed , particularly during the breeding season . As with other small birds , infection by parasites and diseases , and predation by birds of prey take their toll , and the typical life span is about two years . 
 The Eurasian tree sparrow is widespread in the towns and cities of eastern Asia , but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside , with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas . The Eurasian tree sparrow 's extensive range and large population ensure that it is not endangered globally , but there have been large declines in western European populations , in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields . In eastern Asia and western Australia , this species is sometimes viewed as a pest , although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Eurasian tree sparrow is 12 @.@ 5 – 14 cm ( 5 – 5 1 ⁄ 2 in ) long , with a wingspan of about 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) and a weight of 24 g ( 0 @.@ 85 oz ) , making it roughly 10 % smaller than the house sparrow . The adult 's crown and nape are rich chestnut , and there is a kidney @-@ shaped black ear patch on each pure white cheek ; the chin , throat , and the area between the bill and throat are black . The upperparts are light brown , streaked with black , and the brown wings have two distinct narrow white bars . The legs are pale brown , and the bill is lead @-@ blue in summer , becoming almost black in winter . 
 This sparrow is distinctive even within its genus in that it has no plumage differences between the sexes ; the juvenile also resembles the adult , although the colours tend to be duller . Its contrasting face pattern makes this species easily identifiable in all plumages ; the smaller size and brown , not grey , crown are additional differences from the male house sparrow . Adult and juvenile Eurasian tree sparrows undergo a slow complete moult in the autumn , and show an increase in body mass despite a reduction in stored fat . The change in mass is due to an increase in blood volume to support active feather growth , and a generally higher water content in the body . 
 The Eurasian tree sparrow has no true song , but its vocalisations include an excited series of <unk> calls given by unpaired or courting males . Other monosyllabic chirps are used in social contacts , and the flight call is a harsh <unk> . A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types ( memes ) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows . This may have resulted from the small size of the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Old World sparrow genus Passer is a group of small passerine birds that is believed to have originated in Africa , and which contains 15 – 25 species depending on the authority . Its members are typically found in open , lightly wooded , habitats , although several species , notably the house sparrow ( P. domesticus ) have adapted to human habitations . Most species in the genus are typically 10 – 20 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 7 @.@ 9 in ) long , predominantly brown or greyish birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks . They are primarily ground @-@ feeding seed @-@ eaters , although they also consume invertebrates , especially when breeding . Genetic studies show that the Eurasian tree sparrow diverged from the other Eurasian members of its genus relatively early , before the speciation of the house , plain @-@ backed and Spanish sparrows . The Eurasian species is not closely related to the American tree sparrow ( <unk> arborea ) , which is an American sparrow . 
 The Eurasian tree sparrow 's binomial name is derived from two Latin words : passer , " sparrow " , and montanus , " of the mountains " ( from mons " mountain " ) . The Eurasian tree sparrow was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 Systema Naturae as Fringilla montana , but , along with the house sparrow , it was soon moved from the finches ( family <unk> ) into the new genus Passer created by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 . The Eurasian tree sparrow 's common name is given because of its preference of tree holes for nesting . This name , and the scientific name montanus , do not appropriately describe this species 's habitat preferences : the German name <unk> ( " field sparrow " ) comes closer to doing so . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 This species varies little in appearance across its large range , and the differences between the seven extant subspecies recognised by Clement are slight . At least 15 other subspecies have been proposed , but are considered to be intermediates of the listed races . 
 P. m. montanus , the nominate subspecies , ranges across Europe except southwestern Iberia , southern Greece , and the former Yugoslavia . It also breeds in Asia east to the Lena River and south to the northern regions of Turkey , the Caucasus , Kazakhstan , Mongolia and Korea . 
 P. m. <unk> , described by Sergei Aleksandrovich Buturlin in 1906 , breeds from the southern Caucasus east to northern Iran . It is duller and greyer than the nominate race . 
 P. m. dilutus , described by Charles Wallace Richmond in 1856 , is resident in the extreme northeast of Iran , northern Pakistan and northwest India . It also occurs further north , from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan east to China . Compared to P. m. montanus , it is paler , with sandy @-@ brown upperparts . 
 P. m. <unk> , the largest race by size , was described by Stuart Baker in 1925 . It is found in the northern Himalayas , from Nepal east through Tibet to northwest China . It resembles P. m. dilutus , but is darker . 
 P. m. saturatus , described by Leonhard Hess Stejneger in 1885 , breeds in Sakhalin , the Kuril Islands , Japan , Taiwan and South Korea . It is deeper brown than the nominate subspecies and has a larger bill . 
 P. m. <unk> , described by Alphonse Dubois in 1885 , is found from the southern Himalayas east to Hainan and Indonesia . It is a dark race , like P. m. saturatus , but is smaller and more heavily streaked on its upperparts . 
 P. m. hepaticus , described by Sidney Dillon Ripley in 1948 , breeds from northeast Assam to northwest Burma . It is similar to P. m. saturatus , but redder on its head and upperparts . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Eurasian tree sparrow 's natural breeding range comprises most of temperate Europe and Asia south of about latitude 68 ° N ( north of this the summers are too cold , with July average temperatures below 12 ° C ) and through Southeast Asia to Java and Bali . It formerly bred in the Faroes , Malta and Gozo . In South Asia it is found mainly in the temperate zone . It is sedentary over most of its extensive range , but northernmost breeding populations migrate south for the winter , and small numbers leave southern Europe for North Africa and the Middle East . The eastern subspecies P. m. dilutus reaches coastal Pakistan in winter and thousands of birds of this race move through eastern China in autumn . 
 The Eurasian tree sparrow has been introduced outside its native range , but has not always become established , possibly due to competition with the house sparrow . It was introduced successfully to Sardinia , eastern Indonesia , the Philippines and Micronesia , but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root . Ship @-@ carried birds colonised Borneo . This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar , Tunisia , Algeria , Egypt , Israel , and Dubai . 
 In North America , a population of about 15 @,@ 000 birds has become established around St. Louis and neighbouring parts of Illinois and southeastern Iowa . These sparrows are descended from 12 birds imported from Germany and released in late April 1870 as part of a project to enhance the native North American avifauna . Within its limited US range , the Eurasian tree sparrow has to compete with the house sparrow in urban centres , and is therefore mainly found in parks , farms and rural woods . The American population is sometimes referred to as the " German sparrow " , to distinguish it from both the native American tree sparrow species and the much more widespread " English " house sparrow . 
 In Australia , the Eurasian tree sparrow is present in Melbourne , towns in central and northern Victoria and some centres in the Riverina region of New South Wales . It is a prohibited species in Western Australia , where it often arrives on ships from Southeast Asia . 
 Despite its scientific name , Passer montanus , this is not typically a mountain species , and reaches only 700 m ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) in Switzerland , although it has bred at 1 @,@ 700 m ( 5 @,@ 600 ft ) in the northern Caucasus and as high as 4 @,@ 270 m ( 14 @,@ 010 ft ) in Nepal . In Europe , it is frequently found on coasts with cliffs , in empty buildings , in pollarded willows along slow water courses , or in open countryside with small isolated patches of woodland . The Eurasian tree sparrow shows a strong preference for nest @-@ sites near wetland habitats , and avoids breeding on intensively managed mixed farmland . 
 When the Eurasian tree sparrow and the larger house sparrow occur in the same area , the house sparrow generally breeds in urban areas while the smaller Eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside . Where trees are in short supply , as in Mongolia , both species may utilise man @-@ made structures as nest sites . The Eurasian tree sparrow is rural in Europe , but is an urban bird in eastern Asia ; in southern and central Asia , both Passer species may be found around towns and villages . In parts of the Mediterranean , such as Italy , both the tree and the Italian or Spanish sparrows may be found in settlements . In Australia , the Eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird , and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The Eurasian tree sparrow reaches breeding maturity within a year from hatching , and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face . Some nests are not in holes as such , but are built among roots of overhanging gorse or similar bush . Roof cavities in houses may be used , and in the tropics , the crown of a palm tree or the ceiling of a verandah can serve as a nest site . This species will breed in the disused domed nest of a European magpie , or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as the white stork , white @-@ tailed eagle , osprey , black kite or grey heron . It will sometimes attempt to take over the nest of other birds that breed in holes or enclosed spaces , such as the barn swallow , house martin , sand martin or European bee @-@ eater . 
 Pairs may breed in isolation or in loose colonies , and will readily use nest boxes . In a Spanish study , boxes made from a mixture of wood and concrete ( woodcrete ) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes ( 76 @.@ 5 % versus 33 @.@ 5 % ) , and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches , a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season . Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types , but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete , perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1 @.@ 5 ° C warmer than their wooden counterparts . 
 The male calls from near the nest site in spring to proclaim ownership and attract a mate . He may also carry nest material into the nest hole . The display and nest building is repeated in autumn . The preferred locations for the autumn display are old Eurasian tree sparrow nests , particularly those where nestlings had hatched . Empty nest boxes , and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds , such as tits , pied flycatchers or common redstarts , are rarely used for the autumn display . 
 The untidy nest is composed of hay , grass , wool or other material and lined with feathers , which improve the thermal insulation . A complete nest consists of three layers ; base , lining and dome . The typical clutch is five or six eggs ( rarely more than four in Malaysia ) , white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots , small blotches , or speckling ; they are 20 mm × 14 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in × 0 @.@ 55 in ) in size and weigh 2 @.@ 1 g ( 0 @.@ 074 oz ) , of which 7 % is shell . The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12 – 13 days before the altricial , naked chicks hatch , and a further 15 – 18 days elapse before they fledge . Two or three broods may be raised each year ; birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs , but the reverse is true for second and third clutches . Females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time , so within @-@ pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs ' reproductive ability . There is a significant level of promiscuity ; in a Hungarian study , more than 9 % of chicks were sired by extra @-@ pair males , and 20 % of the broods contained at least one extra @-@ pair young . 
 Hybridisation between the Eurasian tree sparrow and the house sparrow has been recorded in many parts of the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow . A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India , said to be introduced , may also hybridise with house sparrows . On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young . A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta , which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow ( P. <unk> ) and Italian sparrows ( P. <unk> ) , was recorded in Malta in 1975 . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The tree sparrow is a predominantly seed and grain eating bird which feeds on the ground in flocks , often with house sparrows , finches , or buntings . It eats weed seeds , such as <unk> and goosefoot , spilled grain , and it may also visit feeding stations , especially for peanuts . It will also feed on invertebrates , especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly on animal food ; it takes insects , woodlice , millipedes , centipedes , spiders and harvestmen . 
 Adults use a variety of wetlands when foraging for invertebrate prey to feed nestlings , and aquatic sites play a key role in providing adequate diversity and availability of suitable invertebrate prey to allow successful chick rearing throughout the long breeding season of this multi @-@ brooded species . Large areas of formerly occupied farmland no longer provide these invertebrate resources due to the effects of intensive farming , and the availability of supplementary seed food within 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) of the nest @-@ site does not influence nest @-@ site choice , or affect the number of young raised . 
 In winter , seed resources are most likely to be a key limiting factor . At this time of year , individuals in a flock form linear dominance hierarchies , but there is no strong relation between the size of the throat patch and position in that hierarchy . This is in contrast to the house sparrow ; in that species , fights to establish dominance are reduced by the display of the throat patch , the size of which acts as a signalling " badge " of fitness . 
 The risk of predation affects feeding strategies . A study showed increased distance between shelter and a food supply meant that birds visited a feeder in smaller flocks , spent less time on it and were more vigilant when far from shelter . Sparrows can feed as " producers " , searching for food directly , or " scroungers " , just joining other flock members who have already discovered food . <unk> was 30 % more likely at exposed feeding sites , although this is not due to increased anti @-@ predator vigilance . A possible explanation is that riskier places are used by individuals with lower fat reserves . 
 = = = Survival = = = 
 Predators of the tree sparrow include a variety of accipiters , falcons and owls , such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk , common kestrel , little owl , and sometimes long @-@ eared owl and white stork . It does not appear to be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult , despite having fewer flight feathers at that time . Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies , jays , least weasels , rats , cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake . 
 Many species of birdlice are present on the birds and in their nests , and mites of the genus <unk> have been known to infest populations , resulting in lesions on the legs and toes . <unk> of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow @-@ fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality . Egg size does not influence nestling mortality , but chicks from large eggs grow faster . 
 Tree sparrows are also subject to bacterial and viral infections . Bacteria have been shown to be an important factor in the failure of eggs to hatch and in nestling mortality , and mass deaths due to Salmonella infection have been noted in Japan . Avian malaria parasites have been found in the blood of many populations , and birds in China were found to harbour a strain of H5N1 that was highly virulent to chickens . 
 The immune response of tree sparrows is less robust than that of the house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter . The house sparrow and tree sparrow are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of Central , Eastern and Southern Europe . The maximum recorded age is 13 @.@ 1 years , but three years is a typical lifespan . 
 = = Status = = 
 The tree sparrow has a large , currently unquantified range ; its world population is also unknown , but includes an estimated 52 – 96 million individuals in Europe . Although population trends have not been evaluated , the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List ( that is , declining more than 30 % in ten years or three generations ) . For these reasons , the species ' conservation status is evaluated at the global level as being of least concern . 
 Although the tree sparrow has been expanding its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe , populations have been declining in much of western Europe , a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark , corn bunting and northern lapwing . From 1980 to 2003 , common farmland bird numbers fell by 28 % . The collapse in populations seems to have been particularly severe in Great Britain , where there was a 95 % decline between 1970 and 1998 , and Ireland , which had only 1 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 500 pairs in the late 1990s . In the British Isles , such declines may be due to natural fluctuations , to which tree sparrows are known to be prone . Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased , suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor . The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation , particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn @-@ sown crops ( at the expense of spring @-@ sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter ) . The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings . 
 = = Relationships with humans = = 
 The tree sparrow is seen as a pest in some areas . In Australia , it damages many cereal and fruit crops and spoils cereal crops , animal feed and stored grain with its droppings . Quarantine rules prohibit the transport of this species into Western Australia . 
 Chairman Mao Zedong of China attempted in April 1958 to reduce crop damage by tree sparrows , estimated at 4 @.@ 5 kg ( 9 @.@ 9 lb ) of grain per bird each year , by mobilising three million people and many scarecrows to drive the birds to death by exhaustion . Although initially successful , the " great sparrow campaign " had overlooked the numbers of locusts and other insect pests consumed by the birds , and crop yields fell , exacerbating a famine which led to the deaths of 30 million people between 1959 and 1961 . The tree sparrow 's consumption of insects has led to its use in agriculture to control fruit tree pests and the common asparagus beetle , <unk> <unk> . 
 The tree sparrow has long been depicted in Chinese and Japanese art , often on a plant spray or in a flying flock , and representations by oriental artists including Hiroshige have featured on the postage stamps of Antigua and Barbuda , Central African Republic , China and the Gambia . More straightforward illustrations were used on the stamps of Belarus , Belgium , Cambodia , Estonia and Taiwan . The fluttering of the bird gave rise to a traditional Japanese dance , the Suzume <unk> , which was depicted by artists such as Hokusai . 
 In the Philippines , where it is one of several species referred to as maya , and is sometimes specifically referred to as the " <unk> <unk> " ( " church maya " or " church sparrow " ) , the tree sparrow is the most common bird in the cities . Many urban Filipinos confuse it with the former national bird of the Philippines , the black @-@ headed munia - also called a maya , but specifically differentiated in folk taxa as the " <unk> pula " ( " red maya " ) . 
 = Uranium = 
 Uranium is a chemical element with symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery @-@ white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable ( with half @-@ lives of the six naturally known isotopes , uranium @-@ 233 to uranium @-@ 238 , varying between 69 years and 4 @.@ 5 billion years ) . The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium @-@ 238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99 % ) and uranium @-@ 235 ( which has 143 neutrons ) . Uranium has the second highest atomic weight of the <unk> occurring elements , lighter only than plutonium . Its density is about 70 % higher than that of lead , and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium @-@ bearing minerals such as uraninite . 
 In nature , uranium is found as uranium @-@ 238 ( 99 @.@ <unk> – 99 @.@ <unk> % ) , uranium @-@ 235 ( 0 @.@ <unk> – 0 @.@ <unk> % ) , and a very small amount of uranium @-@ 234 ( 0 @.@ <unk> – 0 @.@ 0059 % ) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle . The half @-@ life of uranium @-@ 238 is about 4 @.@ 47 billion years and that of uranium @-@ 235 is 704 million years , making them useful in dating the age of the Earth . 
 Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties . Uranium @-@ 235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope . Uranium @-@ 238 is fissionable by fast neutrons , and is fertile , meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium @-@ 239 in a nuclear reactor . Another fissile isotope , uranium @-@ 233 , can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology . Uranium @-@ 238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons ; uranium @-@ 235 and to a lesser degree uranium @-@ 233 have a much higher fission cross @-@ section for slow neutrons . In sufficient concentration , these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction . This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors , and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons . Depleted uranium ( 238U ) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating . Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass , producing lemon yellow to green colors . Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light . It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography . 
 The 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth , who named the new element after the planet Uranus . Eugène @-@ Melchior Péligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel . Research by Otto Hahn , Lise Meitner , Enrico Fermi and others , such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy , the first nuclear weapon used in war . An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium @-@ derived plutonium @-@ 239 . The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety . See Nuclear proliferation . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 When refined , uranium is a silvery white , weakly radioactive metal . It has a Mohs hardness of 6 , sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of titanium , rhodium , manganese and niobium . It is malleable , ductile , slightly paramagnetic , strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor . Uranium metal has a very high density of 19 @.@ 1 g / cm3 , denser than lead ( 11 @.@ 3 g / cm3 ) , but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold ( 19 @.@ 3 g / cm3 ) . 
 Uranium metal reacts with almost all non @-@ metal elements ( with an exception of the noble gases ) and their compounds , with reactivity increasing with temperature . Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium , but non @-@ oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly . When finely divided , it can react with cold water ; in air , uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide . Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry . 
 Uranium @-@ 235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile . Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable , but not fissile . On bombardment with slow neutrons , its uranium @-@ 235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei , releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons . If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium @-@ 235 nuclei , a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or ( in special circumstances ) an explosion . In a nuclear reactor , such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison , absorbing some of the free neutrons . Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods ( see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control ) . 
 As little as 15 lb ( 7 kg ) of uranium @-@ 235 can be used to make an atomic bomb . The first nuclear bomb used in war , Little Boy , relied on uranium fission , but the very first nuclear explosive ( the Gadget used at Trinity ) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki ( Fat Man ) were both plutonium bombs .

 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Military = = = 
 The major application of uranium in the military sector is in high @-@ density penetrators . This ammunition consists of depleted uranium ( DU ) alloyed with 1 – 2 % other elements , such as titanium or molybdenum . At high impact speed , the density , hardness , and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets . Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates . The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the US , UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil ( see Gulf War Syndrome ) . 
 Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials . While the metal itself is radioactive , its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium . Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces , as ballast for missile re @-@ entry vehicles and as a shielding material . Due to its high density , this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses . Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost . The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity ( uranium being only a weak alpha emitter ) . 
 During the later stages of World War II , the entire Cold War , and to a lesser extent afterwards , uranium @-@ 235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons . Initially , two major types of fission bombs were built : a relatively simple device that uses uranium @-@ 235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium @-@ 239 derived from uranium @-@ 238 . Later , a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission / fusion bomb ( thermonuclear weapon ) was built , that uses a plutonium @-@ based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion . Such bombs are jacketed in a non @-@ fissile ( unenriched ) uranium case , and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process . 
 = = = Civilian = = = 
 The main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power plants . One kilogram of uranium @-@ 235 can theoretically produce about 20 terajoules of energy ( 2 × 1013 joules ) , assuming complete fission ; as much energy as 1500 tonnes of coal . 
 Commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3 % uranium @-@ 235 . The <unk> and Magnox designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel . Fuel used for United States Navy reactors is typically highly enriched in uranium @-@ 235 ( the exact values are classified ) . In a breeder reactor , uranium @-@ 238 can also be converted into plutonium through the following reaction : 
 238 
 92U + n → 239 
 92U + γ β- → 239 
 <unk> β- → 239 
 94Pu 
 Before ( and , occasionally , after ) the discovery of radioactivity , uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes , such as uranium glass and in <unk> . 
 The discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore ( pitchblende ) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium , which was used to make glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark paints for clock and aircraft dials . This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product , since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium . This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry , making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant . Besides the pottery glazes , uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use , including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green , yellow , mauve , black , blue , red and other colors . 
 Uranium was also used in photographic chemicals ( especially uranium nitrate as a toner ) , in lamp filaments for stage lighting bulbs , to improve the appearance of dentures , and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes . Uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool . <unk> acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron @-@ dense " stains " in transmission electron microscopy , to increase the contrast of biological specimens in <unk> sections and in negative staining of viruses , isolated cell organelles and macromolecules . 
 The discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element . The long half @-@ life of the isotope uranium @-@ 238 ( 4 @.@ 51 × 109 years ) makes it well @-@ suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating , including uranium @-@ thorium dating , uranium @-@ lead dating and uranium @-@ uranium dating . Uranium metal is used for X @-@ ray targets in the making of high @-@ energy X @-@ rays .

 The use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE , when it was used to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes . Yellow glass with 1 % uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples , Italy , by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912 . Starting in the late Middle Ages , pitchblende was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal , Bohemia ( now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic ) , and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry . In the early 19th century , the world 's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 The discovery of the element is credited to the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth . While he was working in his experimental laboratory in Berlin in 1789 , Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound ( likely sodium diuranate ) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide . Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet @-@ undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder , which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself ( in fact , that powder was an oxide of uranium ) . He named the newly discovered element after the planet Uranus , ( named after the primordial Greek god of the sky ) , which had been discovered eight years earlier by William Herschel . 
 In 1841 , Eugène @-@ Melchior Péligot , Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers ( Central School of Arts and Manufactures ) in Paris , isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium . 
 Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity by using uranium in 1896 . Becquerel made the discovery in Paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt , <unk> ( SO4 ) 2 ( potassium uranyl sulfate ) , on top of an unexposed photographic plate in a drawer and noting that the plate had become " fogged " . He determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate . 
 = = = Fission research = = = 
 A team led by Enrico Fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays ( electrons or positrons from the elements produced ; see beta particle ) . The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94 , which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome , Orso Mario Corbino , christened ausonium and hesperium , respectively . The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium 's ability to fission ( break apart ) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn 's laboratory in Berlin . Lise Meitner and her nephew , the physicist Otto Robert Frisch , published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process " nuclear fission " . Soon after , Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction . Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 , and later work found that on average about 2 @.@ 5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium @-@ 235 . Further work found that the far more common uranium @-@ 238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium , which , like uranium @-@ 235 , is also fissile by thermal neutrons . These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power . 
 On 2 December 1942 , as part of the Manhattan Project , another team led by Enrico Fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self @-@ sustained nuclear chain reaction , Chicago Pile @-@ 1 . Working in a lab below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago , the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400 short tons ( 360 metric tons ) of graphite , 58 short tons ( 53 metric tons ) of uranium oxide , and six short tons ( 5 @.@ 5 metric tons ) of uranium metal , a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process .

 Two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the United States during World War II : a uranium @-@ based device ( codenamed " Little Boy " ) whose fissile material was highly enriched uranium , and a plutonium @-@ based device ( see Trinity test and " Fat Man " ) whose plutonium was derived from uranium @-@ 238 . The uranium @-@ based Little Boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 . Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12 @,@ 500 tonnes of TNT , the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50 @,@ 000 buildings and killed approximately 75 @,@ 000 people ( see Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) . Initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare , and that nuclear proliferation could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks , but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world . 
 = = = Reactors = = = 
 The X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) in Oak Ridge , Tennessee , formerly known as the Clinton Pile and X @-@ 10 Pile , was the world 's second artificial nuclear reactor ( after Enrico Fermi 's Chicago Pile ) and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation . Argonne National Laboratory 's Experimental Breeder Reactor I , located at the Atomic Energy Commission 's National Reactor Testing Station near Arco , Idaho , became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 December 1951 . Initially , four 150 @-@ watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor , but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility ( later , the town of Arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by BORAX @-@ III , another reactor designed and operated by Argonne National Laboratory ) . The world 's first commercial scale nuclear power station , <unk> in the Soviet Union , began generation with its reactor AM @-@ 1 on 27 June 1954 . Other early nuclear power plants were Calder Hall in England , which began generation on 17 October 1956 , and the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania , which began on 26 May 1958 . Nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine , the USS Nautilus , in 1954 .

 In 1972 , the French physicist Francis Perrin discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo mine in Gabon , West Africa , collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors . The ore deposit is 1 @.@ 7 billion years old ; then , uranium @-@ 235 constituted about 3 % of the total uranium on Earth . This is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur , provided other supporting conditions exist . The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository . 
 = = = Contamination and the Cold War legacy = = = 
 Above @-@ ground nuclear tests by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s and by France into the 1970s and 1980s spread a significant amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world . Additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents . 
 Uranium miners have a higher incidence of cancer . An excess risk of lung cancer among Navajo uranium miners , for example , has been documented and linked to their occupation . The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act , a 1990 law in the USA , required $ 100 @,@ 000 in " compassion payments " to uranium miners diagnosed with cancer or other respiratory ailments . 
 During the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium . Since the break @-@ up of the Soviet Union in 1991 , an estimated 600 short tons ( 540 metric tons ) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium ( enough to make 40 @,@ 000 nuclear warheads ) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states . Police in Asia , Europe , and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb @-@ grade uranium or plutonium , most of which was from ex @-@ Soviet sources . From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection , Control , and Accounting Program , operated by the federal government of the United States , spent approximately US $ 550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia . This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities . Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair . According to an interview from the article , one facility had been storing samples of enriched ( weapons grade ) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project ; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box .

 Uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock , soil , and water . Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth 's crust . Uranium is also the highest @-@ numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements . Along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron , it is only naturally formed in supernovae . The decay of uranium , thorium , and potassium @-@ 40 in the Earth 's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection , which in turn drives plate tectonics . 
 Uranium 's average concentration in the Earth 's crust is ( depending on the reference ) 2 to 4 parts per million , or about 40 times as abundant as silver . The Earth 's crust from the surface to 25 km ( 15 mi ) down is calculated to contain 1017 kg ( 2 × 1017 lb ) of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013 kg ( 2 × 1013 lb ) . The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0 @.@ 7 to 11 parts per million ( up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers ) , and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion . 
 Uranium is more plentiful than antimony , tin , cadmium , mercury , or silver , and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum . Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals , including uraninite ( the most common uranium ore ) , carnotite , <unk> , <unk> , torbernite , and <unk> . Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits , and minerals such as lignite , and monazite sands in uranium @-@ rich ores ( it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0 @.@ 1 % uranium ) . 
 Some bacteria , such as <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and some strains of Burkholderia fungorum , use uranium for their growth and convert U ( VI ) to U ( IV ) . 
 Some organisms , such as the lichen <unk> involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium Citrobacter , can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of their environment . Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate ( or other similar organic phosphates ) . After one day , one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals ; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium @-@ polluted water . The <unk> <unk> has also been shown to <unk> uranium in ground water . The mycorrhizal fungus <unk> <unk> increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant . 
 In nature , uranium ( VI ) forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH . This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards . However , it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH . A <unk> sp. strain <unk> @-@ 1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase ( <unk> ) that has been applied for <unk> of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions . The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing <unk> protein in E. coli . 
 Plants absorb some uranium from soil . Dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion , and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million . Dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat . 
 = = = Production and mining = = = 
 Worldwide production of U3O8 ( yellowcake ) in 2013 amounted to 70 @,@ 015 tonnes , of which 22 @,@ 451 t ( 32 % ) was mined in Kazakhstan . Other important uranium mining countries are Canada ( 9 @,@ 331 t ) , Australia ( 6 @,@ 350 t ) , Niger ( 4 @,@ 518 t ) , Namibia ( 4 @,@ 323 t ) and Russia ( 3 @,@ 135 t ) . 
 Uranium ore is mined in several ways : by open pit , underground , in @-@ situ leaching , and borehole mining ( see uranium mining ) . Low @-@ grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0 @.@ 01 to 0 @.@ 25 % uranium oxides . Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore . High @-@ grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan , Canada can contain up to 23 % uranium oxides on average . Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali . The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation , solvent extraction , and ion exchange . The resulting mixture , called yellowcake , contains at least 75 % uranium oxides U3O8 . <unk> is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion . 
 Commercial @-@ grade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals . Uranium metal can also be prepared through electrolysis of <unk> 
 5 or UF 
 4 , dissolved in molten calcium chloride ( <unk> 
 2 ) and sodium chloride ( NaCl ) solution . Very pure uranium is produced through the thermal decomposition of uranium halides on a hot filament . 
 = = = Resources and reserves = = = 
 It is estimated that 5 @.@ 5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US $ 59 per lb of uranium , while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources ( reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction ) . Prices went from about $ 10 / lb in May 2003 to $ 138 / lb in July 2007 . This has caused a big increase in spending on exploration , with US $ 200 million being spent worldwide in 2005 , a 54 % increase on the previous year . This trend continued through 2006 , when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $ 774 million , an increase of over 250 % compared to 2004 . The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency said exploration figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006 . 
 Australia has 31 % of the world 's known uranium ore reserves and the world 's largest single uranium deposit , located at the Olympic Dam Mine in South Australia . There is a significant reserve of uranium in <unk> a sub @-@ prefecture in the prefecture of <unk> in Central African Republic . 
 Some nuclear fuel comes from nuclear weapons being dismantled , such as from the Megatons to Megawatts Program . 
 An additional 4 @.@ 6 billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be in sea water ( Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible ) . There have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water , but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water . In 2012 , ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed <unk> which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules , atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water , according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory . 
 = = = Supplies = = = 
 In 2005 , seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides , with Canada ( 27 @.@ 9 % of world production ) and Australia ( 22 @.@ 8 % ) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan ( 10 @.@ 5 % ) , Russia ( 8 @.@ 0 % ) , Namibia ( 7 @.@ 5 % ) , Niger ( 7 @.@ 4 % ) , Uzbekistan ( 5 @.@ 5 % ) , the United States ( 2 @.@ 5 % ) , Argentina ( 2 @.@ 1 % ) , Ukraine ( 1 @.@ 9 % ) and China ( 1 @.@ 7 % ) also producing significant amounts . Kazakhstan continues to increase production and may have become the world 's largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12 @,@ 826 tonnes , compared to Canada with 11 @,@ 100 t and Australia with 9 @,@ 430 t . In the late 1960s , UN geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia . The find was the largest of its kind , with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25 % of the world 's then known uranium reserves of 800 @,@ 000 tons . 
 The ultimate available supply is believed to be sufficient for at least the next 85 years , although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century . Uranium deposits seem to be log @-@ normal distributed . There is a 300 @-@ fold increase in the amount of uranium recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade . In other words , there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available .

 = = = = Oxides = = = = 
 <unk> uranium yellowcake , as produced in many large mills , contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized . Particles with short residence times in a <unk> will generally be less oxidized than those with long retention times or particles recovered in the stack scrubber . Uranium content is usually referenced to U 
 3O 
 8 , which dates to the days of the Manhattan project when U 
 3O 
 8 was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard . 
 Phase relationships in the uranium @-@ oxygen system are complex . The most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium ( IV ) and uranium ( VI ) , and their two corresponding oxides are , respectively , uranium dioxide ( UO 
 2 ) and uranium trioxide ( UO 
 3 ) . Other uranium oxides such as uranium monoxide ( UO ) , diuranium pentoxide ( U 
 2O 
 5 ) , and uranium peroxide ( UO 
 4 · 2H 
 2O ) also exist . 
 The most common forms of uranium oxide are <unk> octoxide ( U 
 3O 
 8 ) and UO 
 2 . Both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions . <unk> octoxide is ( depending on conditions ) the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature . Uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel . At ambient temperatures , UO 
 2 will gradually convert to U 
 3O 
 8 . Because of their stability , uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal . 
 = = = = Aqueous chemistry = = = = 
 Salts of many oxidation states of uranium are water @-@ soluble and may be studied in aqueous solutions . The most common ionic forms are U3 + ( brown @-@ red ) , U4 + ( green ) , UO + 
 2 ( unstable ) , and UO2 + 
 2 ( yellow ) , for U ( III ) , U ( IV ) , U ( V ) , and U ( VI ) , respectively . A few solid and semi @-@ metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium ( II ) , but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state . Ions of U3 + liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable . The UO2 + 
 2 ion represents the uranium ( VI ) state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate , uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate . UO2 + 
 2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents , the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate . 
 Unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and polyatomic ion uranium @-@ oxide cationic forms , the <unk> , salts containing a polyatomic uranium @-@ oxide anion , are generally not water @-@ soluble . 
 = = = = Carbonates = = = = 
 The interactions of carbonate anions with uranium ( VI ) cause the Pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution . While the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water ( students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water ) , uranium carbonates are often soluble in water . This is because a U ( VI ) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes . 
 = = = = Effects of pH = = = = 
 The uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further : when the pH of a uranium ( VI ) solution increases , the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex . 
 When carbonate is added , uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the pH is increased . One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8 , a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels . 
 = = = Hydrides , carbides and nitrides = = = 
 Uranium metal heated to 250 to 300 ° C ( 482 to 572 ° F ) reacts with hydrogen to form uranium hydride . Even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen . This property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide , nitride , and halide compounds . Two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist : an α form that is obtained at low temperatures and a β form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250 ° C. 
 Uranium carbides and uranium nitrides are both relatively inert semimetallic compounds that are minimally soluble in acids , react with water , and can ignite in air to form U 
 3O 
 8 . <unk> of uranium include uranium <unk> ( UC ) , uranium <unk> ( UC 
 2 ) , and diuranium <unk> ( U 
 2C 
 3 ) . Both UC and UC 
 2 are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to carbon monoxide at high temperatures . Stable below 1800 ° C , U 
 2C 
 3 is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of UC and UC 
 2 to mechanical stress . Uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to nitrogen include uranium mononitride ( UN ) , uranium <unk> ( UN 
 2 ) , and diuranium <unk> ( U 
 2N 
 3 ) .

 All uranium fluorides are created using uranium tetrafluoride ( UF 
 4 ) ; UF 
 4 itself is prepared by <unk> of uranium dioxide . Reduction of UF 
 4 with hydrogen at 1000 ° C produces uranium trifluoride ( UF 
 3 ) . Under the right conditions of temperature and pressure , the reaction of solid UF 
 4 with gaseous uranium hexafluoride ( UF 
 6 ) can form the intermediate fluorides of U 
 2F 
 9 , U 
 4F 
 17 , and UF 
 5 . 
 At room temperatures , UF 
 6 has a high vapor pressure , making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process to separate the rare uranium @-@ 235 from the common uranium @-@ 238 isotope . This compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process : 
 UO 
 2 + 4 HF → UF 
 4 + 2 H 
 2O ( 500 ° C , endothermic ) 
 UF 
 4 + F 
 2 → UF 
 6 ( 350 ° C , endothermic ) 
 The resulting UF 
 6 , a white solid , is highly reactive ( by fluorination ) , easily sublimes ( emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas ) , and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist . 
 One method of preparing uranium tetrachloride ( UCl 
 4 ) is to directly combine chlorine with either uranium metal or uranium hydride . The reduction of UCl 
 4 by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride ( UCl 
 3 ) while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine . All uranium chlorides react with water and air . 
 <unk> and iodides of uranium are formed by direct reaction of , respectively , bromine and iodine with uranium or by adding UH 
 3 to those element 's acids . Known examples include : <unk> 
 3 , <unk> 
 4 , UI 
 3 , and UI 
 4 . Uranium oxyhalides are water @-@ soluble and include UO 
 2F

 Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes : uranium @-@ 238 ( 99 @.@ 28 % natural abundance ) , uranium @-@ 235 ( 0 @.@ 71 % ) , and uranium @-@ 234 ( 0 @.@ 0054 % ) . All three are radioactive , emitting alpha particles , with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission , rather than alpha emission . There are also five other trace isotopes : uranium @-@ 239 , which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission , releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom ; uranium @-@ 237 , which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more , which then decays to neptunium @-@ 237 ; uranium @-@ 233 , which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium @-@ 237 ; and finally , uranium @-@ 236 and -240 , which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium @-@ 244 . It is also expected that thorium @-@ 232 should be able to undergo double beta decay , which would produce uranium @-@ 232 , but this has not yet been observed experimentally . 
 Uranium @-@ 238 is the most stable isotope of uranium , with a half @-@ life of about 4 @.@ 468 × 109 years , roughly the age of the Earth . Uranium @-@ 235 has a half @-@ life of about 7 @.@ 13 × 108 years , and uranium @-@ 234 has a half @-@ life of about 2 @.@ 48 × 105 years . For natural uranium , about 49 % of its alpha rays are emitted by each of 238U atom , and also 49 % by 234U ( since the latter is formed from the former ) and about 2 @.@ 0 % of them by the 235U . When the Earth was young , probably about one @-@ fifth of its uranium was uranium @-@ 235 , but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this . 
 Uranium @-@ 238 is usually an α emitter ( occasionally , it undergoes spontaneous fission ) , decaying through the " Uranium Series " of nuclear decay , which has 18 members , into lead @-@ 206 , by a variety of different decay paths . 
 The decay series of 235U , which is called the actinium series , has 15 members and eventually decays into lead @-@ 207 . The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in radiometric dating . 
 Uranium @-@ 234 , which is a member of the " Uranium Series " , decays to lead @-@ 206 through a series of relatively short @-@ lived isotopes . 
 Uranium @-@ 233 is made from thorium @-@ 232 by neutron bombardment , usually in a nuclear reactor , and 233U is also fissile . Its decay series ends at bismuth @-@ 209 and thallium @-@ 205 . 
 Uranium @-@ 235 is important for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons , because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is fissile . This means that it can be split into two or three fragments ( fission products ) by thermal neutrons . 
 Uranium @-@ 238 is not fissile , but is a fertile isotope , because after neutron activation it can produce plutonium @-@ 239 , another fissile isotope . Indeed , the 238U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope uranium @-@ 239 . 239U decays by beta emission to neptunium @-@ 239 , also a beta @-@ emitter , that decays in its turn , within a few days into plutonium @-@ 239 . 239Pu was used as fissile material in the first atomic bomb detonated in the " Trinity test " on 15 July 1945 in New Mexico . 
 = = = Enrichment = = = 
 In nature , uranium is found as uranium @-@ 238 ( 99 @.@ 2742 % ) and uranium @-@ 235 ( 0 @.@ <unk> % ) . Isotope separation concentrates ( enriches ) the fissionable uranium @-@ 235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants , except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors . Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium @-@ 235 must impact other uranium @-@ 235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction . The concentration and amount of uranium @-@ 235 needed to achieve this is called a ' critical mass ' . 
 To be considered ' enriched ' , the uranium @-@ 235 fraction should be between 3 % and 5 % . This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium @-@ 235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium @-@ 238 , called depleted uranium or ' DU ' . To be considered ' depleted ' , the uranium @-@ 235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0 @.@ 3 % . The price of uranium has risen since 2001 , so enrichment tailings containing more than 0 @.@ 35 % uranium @-@ 235 are being considered for re @-@ enrichment , driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $ 130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $ 5 in 2001 . 
 The gas centrifuge process , where gaseous uranium hexafluoride ( UF 
 6 ) is separated by the difference in molecular weight between <unk> and <unk> using high @-@ speed centrifuges , is the cheapest and leading enrichment process . The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the Manhattan Project . In this process , uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver @-@ zinc membrane , and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate ( since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium @-@ 235 ) . The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium @-@ 235 and fluorine . This leaves uranium @-@ 238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium @-@ 235 metal to precipitate from the solution . An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation ( <unk> ) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers . Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion . 
 = = Human exposure = = 
 A person can be exposed to uranium ( or its radioactive daughters , such as radon ) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food . The amount of uranium in air is usually very small ; however , people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers , live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons , live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used , or live or work near a coal @-@ fired power plant , facilities that mine or process uranium ore , or enrich uranium for reactor fuel , may have increased exposure to uranium . Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits ( either natural or man @-@ made slag deposits ) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0 @.@ 25 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( REL ) of 0 @.@ 2 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday and a short @-@ term limit of 0 @.@ 6 mg / m3 . At levels of 10 mg / m3 , uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health . 
 Most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion . Only 0 @.@ 5 % is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium , such as its oxide , are ingested , whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5 % . However , soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body , whereas insoluble uranium compounds , especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs , pose a more serious exposure hazard . After entering the bloodstream , the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium 's affinity for phosphates . Uranium is not absorbed through the skin , and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin . 
 Incorporated uranium becomes uranyl ions , which accumulate in bone , liver , kidney , and reproductive tissues . Uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces and aquifers . 
 = = = Effects and precautions = = = 
 Normal functioning of the kidney , brain , liver , heart , and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure , because , besides being weakly radioactive , uranium is a toxic metal . Uranium is also a reproductive <unk> . Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation , the primary form of 238U decay , has a very short range , and will not penetrate skin . <unk> ( UO2 + 
 2 ) ions , such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds , have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals . While the CDC has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium , exposure to uranium and its decay products , especially radon , are widely known and significant health threats . Exposure to strontium @-@ 90 , iodine @-@ 131 , and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure , but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons . Although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities , those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself . Finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric ; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature . 
 Uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution . Uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it . 
 = Operation Ferdinand = 
 Operation Ferdinand was a military deception employed by the Allies during the Second World War . It formed part of Operation Bodyguard , a major strategic deception intended to misdirect and confuse German high command about Allied invasion plans during 1944 . Ferdinand consisted of strategic and tactical deceptions intended to draw attention away from the Operation Dragoon landing areas in southern France by threatening an invasion of Genoa in Italy . Planned by Eugene Sweeney in June and July 1944 and operated until early September , it has been described as " quite the most successful of ' A ' Force 's strategic deceptions " . It helped the Allies achieve complete tactical surprise in their landings and pinned down German troops in the Genoa region until late July .

 Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard , a broad strategic military deception intended to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead @-@ up to the Normandy landings . During early 1944 the main thrust of deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin ( including its sub @-@ plan Vendetta ) , which developed threats against Greece and Southern France , and Operation Royal Flush , which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey . On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France , codenamed Operation Dragoon ( formerly Anvil ) . Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back , to tone down the threat to France , and it was decided a new plan ( Ferdinand ) was required to cover the intended invasion . 
 The Allied nations invaded Italy in September 1943 and by mid @-@ 1944 had pushed the Germans back to the Gothic Line in the North of the country . Ferdinand was intended to develop a threat against Genoa , as part of an expected Allied assault on the Gothic Line in August / September 1944 . German forces in the French Riviera ( originally threatened by Vendetta ) were to be put at relative ease , but not left feeling too secure lest they be moved to re @-@ <unk> Normandy . Planning for the operation was handled by ' A ' Force ; the department in charge of deception in the Middle East . A large part of the operation planning was handed to Major Eugene J Sweeney , an Irish @-@ American career officer who had joined the department in late 1943 with the express task of learning the arts of deception before the war ended . Working out of Algiers , at Advanced HQ ( West ) , Sweeney helped implement several deceptions . The most notable of these was Operation Oakfield , the cover plan for Operation Shingle and the Battle of Anzio . 
 John Bevan , head of the London Controlling Section , met with Colonel Dudley Clarke ( head of ' A ' Force ) in Algiers in early June to decide on the outline for Ferdinand . After four days he returned to London leaving ' A ' Force to work on the draft . On 4 July the draft was approved by Field Marshall Henry Wilson , Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean theatre . In July , Seventh Army HQ ( the army group due to be used for Dragoon ) moved from Algeria to Naples . Sweeney moved with them , as the head of the newly formed No. 2 Tac HQ , and tasked by Colonel Clarke to focus entirely on planning for Ferdinand . Sweeney worked on the plan until its final form on 28 July . Despite not being completed until the end of the month Ferdinand went into effect as soon as the first draft was approved . 
 = = Operation = = 
 Ferdinand was a complex plan , involving misinformation and extensive physical deception . The underlying plot was the Allied forces had been surprised to find the Germans had not moved forces from the Mediterranean to re @-@ <unk> Normandy . Therefore , plans to invade southern France and the Balkans were looking less appealing . Instead the Allied commanders had decided to focus all of their resources on the Italian campaign . The real force assigned to Dragoon , the US VI Corps , would land in Genoa . Meanwhile , notional formations , such as the Seventh Army and the British 5th Airborne Division would support pushes along the Italian front and threaten targets in the Balkans . Ferdinand also recycled some of Zeppelin 's threats against Turkey with the fictional British Ninth and Twelfth Armies . 
 The key to Ferdinand was the threat to Genoa . Intelligence intercepts showed that the Abwehr ( German military intelligence ) listed it as one of the main areas they expected an Allied attack . It was not possible to hide the buildup of naval and amphibious forces in the region , which were easily accessible to German aerial reconnaissance . German commanders identified both Genoa and southern France as the only logical targets , so the task for Allied double agents was to convince them that the former was the true goal . The deception was maintained on the invasion date itself , with a tactical deception . The Dragoon fleet travelled on a course toward Genoa until late at night on 14 August , when they turned west toward their real target . 
 The Ferdinand threat was continued until 8 September , to support the Allied efforts in France and Italy . It was ' A ' Force 's last major operation , a brief follow up called Braintree was designed but never implemented because the overall Bodyguard strategy had been mothballed in late August .

 At the same time as Ferdinand , Tac HQ ran Otterington . This deception built a threat against Rimini in the east of Italy , in support of Alexander 's proposed assault on the centre of the Gothic Line . It developed a pincer movement , in tandem with Ferdinand 's threat to the west . However , once Otterington had gotten underway , with a major buildup of dummy armour , Alexander changed his plans and decided to push against Rimini . Clarke hastily implemented Ulster , a double bluff in which Otterington was revealed as a sham in the hope it would distract attention from that sector . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Ferdinand successfully led <unk> Heere West ( German military intelligence for the Western Front , also referred to as <unk> ) to expect a landing in Genoa . In late July and early August the buildup of forces in Italy made it clear that a seaborne invasion was imminent , and the deception was successful in creating this as a realistic threat to Genoa . As a result , the Dragoon landings achieved complete tactical surprise . In his history of British wartime intelligence , historian Michael Howard calls it the " most successful of ' A ' Force 's strategic operations " . However , Howard states that the overwhelming force used for Operation Dragoon meant that the element of surprise was less important than on D @-@ Day . 
 = Matthew Boulton = 
 Matthew Boulton FRS ( / <unk> / ; 3 September 1728 – 17 August 1809 ) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt . In the final quarter of the 18th century , the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines , which were a great advance on the state of the art , making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills . Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins , striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries , and supplying the Royal Mint with up @-@ to @-@ date equipment . 
 Born in Birmingham , he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31 . By then Boulton had managed the business for several years , and thereafter expanded it considerably , consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory , built by him near Birmingham . At Soho , he adopted the latest techniques , branching into silver plate , ormolu and other decorative arts . He became associated with James Watt when Watt 's business partner , John Roebuck , was unable to pay a debt to Boulton , who accepted Roebuck 's share of Watt 's patent as settlement . He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt 's patent for an additional 17 years , enabling the firm to market Watt 's steam engine . The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad , initially in mines and then in factories . 
 Boulton was a key member of the Lunar Society , a group of Birmingham @-@ area men prominent in the arts , sciences , and theology . Members included Watt , Erasmus Darwin , Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley . The Society met each month near the full moon . Members of the Society have been given credit for developing concepts and techniques in science , agriculture , manufacturing , mining , and transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution . 
 Boulton founded the Soho Mint , to which he soon adapted steam power . He sought to improve the poor state of Britain 's coinage , and after several years of effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage in a quarter century . His " cartwheel " pieces were well @-@ designed and difficult to counterfeit , and included the first striking of the large copper British penny , which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971 . He retired in 1800 , though continuing to run his mint , and died in 1809 . His image appears alongside James Watt on the Bank of England 's new Series F £ 50 note . 
 = = Background = = 
 Birmingham had long been a centre of the ironworking industry . In the early 18th century the town entered a period of expansion as iron working became easier and cheaper with the transition ( beginning in 1709 ) from charcoal to coke as a means of smelting iron . Scarcity of wood in increasingly deforested England and discoveries of large quantities of coal in Birmingham 's county of Warwickshire and the adjacent county of Staffordshire speeded the transition . Much of the iron was forged in small foundries near Birmingham , especially in the Black Country , including nearby towns such as Smethwick and West Bromwich . The resultant thin iron sheets were transported to factories in and around Birmingham . With the town far from the sea and great rivers and with canals not yet built , metalworkers concentrated on producing small , relatively valuable pieces , especially buttons and buckles . Frenchman Alexander <unk> wrote that while he had seen excellent cane heads , snuff boxes and other metal objects in Milan , " the same can be had cheaper and better in Birmingham " . These small objects came to be known as " toys " , and their manufacturers as " <unk> " . 
 Boulton was a descendant of families from around Lichfield , his great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ great grandfather , Rev. Zachary Babington , having been Chancellor of Lichfield . Boulton 's father , also named Matthew and born in 1700 , moved to Birmingham from Lichfield to serve an apprenticeship , and in 1723 he married Christiana Piers . The elder Boulton was a <unk> with a small workshop specialising in buckles . Matthew Boulton was born in 1728 , their third child and the second of that name , the first Matthew having died at the age of two in 1726 . 
 = = Early and family life = = 
 The elder Boulton 's business prospered after young Matthew 's birth , and the family moved to the Snow Hill area of Birmingham , then a well @-@ to @-@ do neighbourhood of new houses . As the local grammar school was in disrepair Boulton was sent to an academy in <unk> , on the other side of Birmingham . At the age of 15 he left school , and by 17 he had invented a technique for inlaying enamels in buckles that proved so popular that the buckles were exported to France , then <unk> to Britain and billed as the latest French developments . 
 On 3 March 1749 Boulton married Mary Robinson , a distant cousin and the daughter of a successful mercer , and wealthy in her own right . They lived briefly with the bride 's mother in Lichfield , and then moved to Birmingham where the elder Matthew Boulton made his son a partner at the age of 21 . Though the son signed business letters " from father and self " , by the mid @-@ 1750s he was effectively running the business . The elder Boulton retired in 1757 and died in 1759 . 
 The <unk> had three daughters in the early 1750s , but all died in infancy . Mary Boulton 's health deteriorated , and she died in August 1759 . Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne . Marriage with a deceased wife 's sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law , though permitted by common law . Nonetheless , they married on 25 June 1760 at St. Mary 's Church , Rotherhithe . Eric <unk> , who wrote a book on Boulton 's silver , with a biographical sketch , suggests that the marriage celebrant , Rev. James Penfold , an impoverished curate , was probably bribed . Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife 's sister : " I advise you to say nothing of your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London , suppose Wapping , and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner . When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled , live and be happy ... I recommend silence , secrecy , and Scotland . " 
 The union was opposed by Anne 's brother Luke , who feared Boulton would control ( and possibly dissipate ) much of the Robinson family fortune . In 1764 Luke Robinson died , and his estate passed to his sister Anne and thus into Matthew Boulton 's control . 
 The <unk> had two children , Matthew Robinson Boulton and Anne Boulton . Matthew Robinson in turn had six children with two wives . His eldest son Matthew Piers Watt Boulton , broadly educated and also a man of science , gained some fame posthumously for his invention of the important aeronautical flight control , the aileron . As his father before him , he also had two wives and six children . 
 = = Innovator = = 
 = = = Expansion of the business = = = 
 After the death of his father in 1759 , Boulton took full control of the family <unk> business . He spent much of his time in London and elsewhere , promoting his wares . He arranged for a friend to present a sword to Prince Edward , and the gift so interested the Prince 's older brother , George , Prince of Wales , the future King George III , that he ordered one for himself . 
 With capital accumulated from his two marriages and his inheritance from his father , Boulton sought a larger site to expand his business . In 1761 he leased 13 acres ( 5 @.@ 3 ha ) at Soho , then just in Staffordshire , with a residence , Soho House , and a rolling mill . Soho House was at first occupied by Boulton relatives , and then by his first partner , John Fothergill . In 1766 Boulton required Fothergill to vacate Soho House , and lived there himself with his family . Both husband and wife died there , Anne Boulton of an apparent stroke in 1783 and her husband after a long illness in 1809 . 
 The 13 acres ( 5 ha ) at Soho included common land that Boulton enclosed , later decrying what he saw as the " idle beggarly " condition of the people who had used it . By 1765 his Soho Manufactory had been erected . The warehouse , or " principal building " , had a Palladian front and 19 bays for loading and unloading , and had quarters for clerks and managers on the upper storeys . The structure was designed by local architect William Wyatt at a time when industrial buildings were commonly designed by engineers . Other buildings contained workshops . Boulton and Fothergill invested in the most advanced metalworking equipment , and the complex was admired as a modern industrial marvel . Although the cost of the principal building alone had been estimated at £ 2 @,@ 000 ( about £ 276 @,@ 000 today ) ; the final cost was five times that amount . The partnership spent over £ 20 @,@ 000 in building and equipping the premises . The partners ' means were not equal to the total costs , which were met only by heavy borrowing and by artful management of creditors . 
 Among the products Boulton sought to make in his new facility were sterling silver plate for those able to afford it , and Sheffield plate , silver @-@ plated copper , for those less well off . Boulton and his father had long made small silver items , but there is no record of large items in either silver or Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before Boulton did so . To make items such as candlesticks more cheaply than the London competition , the firm made many items out of thin , die @-@ stamped sections , which were shaped and joined together . One impediment to Boulton 's work was the lack of an assay office in Birmingham . The silver toys long made by the family firm were generally too light to require assaying , but silver plate had to be sent over 70 miles ( 110 km ) to the nearest assay office , at Chester , to be assayed and <unk> , with the attendant risks of damage and loss . Alternatively they could be sent to London , but this exposed them to the risk of being copied by competitors . Boulton wrote in 1771 , " I am very desirous of becoming a great silversmith , yet I am determined not to take up that branch in the large way I intended , unless powers can be obtained to have a marking hall [ assay office ] at Birmingham . " Boulton petitioned Parliament for the establishment of an assay office in Birmingham . Though the petition was bitterly opposed by London goldsmiths , he was successful in getting Parliament to pass an act establishing assay offices in Birmingham and Sheffield , whose silversmiths had faced similar difficulties in transporting their wares . The silver business proved not to be profitable due to the opportunity cost of keeping a large amount of capital tied up in the inventory of silver . The firm continued to make large quantities of Sheffield plate , but Boulton delegated responsibility for this enterprise to trusted subordinates , involving himself little in it . 
 As part of Boulton 's efforts to market to the wealthy , he started to sell vases decorated with ormolu , previously a French speciality . Ormolu was milled gold ( from the French or <unk> ) amalgamated with mercury , and applied to the item , which was then heated to drive off the mercury , leaving the gold decoration . In the late 1760s and early 1770s there was a fashion among the wealthy for decorated vases , and he sought to cater to this craze . He initially ordered ceramic vases from his friend and fellow Lunar Society member Josiah Wedgwood , but ceramic proved unable to bear the weight of the decorations and Boulton chose marble and other decorative stone as the material for his vases . Boulton copied vase designs from classical Greek works and borrowed works of art from collectors , merchants , and sculptors . 
 Fothergill and others searched Europe for designs for these creations . In March 1770 Boulton visited the Royal Family and sold several vases to Queen Charlotte , George III 's wife . He ran annual sales at Christie 's in 1771 and 1772 . The Christie 's exhibition succeeded in publicising Boulton and his products , which were highly praised , but the sales were not financially successful with many works left unsold or sold below cost . When the craze for vases ended in the early 1770s , the partnership was left with a large stock on its hands , and disposed of much of it in a single massive sale to Catherine the Great of Russia — the Empress described the vases as superior to French ormolu , and cheaper as well . Boulton continued to solicit orders , though " ormolu " was dropped from the firm 's business description from 1779 , and when the Boulton @-@ Fothergill partnership was dissolved by the latter 's 1782 death there were only 14 items of ormolu in the " toy room " . 
 Among Boulton 's most successful products were mounts for small Wedgwood products such as plaques , cameo brooches and buttons in the distinctive ceramics , notably jasper ware , for which Wedgwood 's firm remains well known . The mounts of these articles , many of which have survived , were made of ormolu or cut steel , which had a jewel @-@ like gleam . Boulton and Wedgwood were friends , alternately co @-@ operating and competing , and Wedgwood wrote of Boulton , " It doubles my courage to have the first Manufacturer in England to encounter with — The match likes me well — I like the Man , I like his spirit . " 
 In the 1770s Boulton introduced an insurance system for his workers that served as the model for later schemes , allowing his workers compensation in the event of injury or illness . The first of its kind in any large establishment , employees paid one @-@ sixtieth of their wages into the Soho Friendly Society , membership in which was mandatory . The firm 's apprentices were poor or orphaned boys , trainable into skilled workmen ; he declined to hire the sons of gentlemen as apprentices , stating that they would be " out of place " among the poorer boys . 
 Not all of Boulton 's innovations proved successful . Together with painter Francis Eginton , he created a process for the mechanical reproduction of paintings for middle @-@ class homes , but eventually abandoned the procedure . Boulton and James Keir produced an alloy called " Eldorado metal " that they claimed would not corrode in water and could be used for sheathing wooden ships . After sea trials the Admiralty rejected their claims , and the metal was used for fanlights and sash windows at Soho House . Boulton feared that construction of a nearby canal would damage his water supply , but this did not prove to be the case , and in 1779 he wrote , " Our navigation goes on <unk> ; the junction with the Wolverhampton Canal is complete , and we already sail to Bristol and to Hull . " 
 Products of Boulton 's manufactory 
 = = = Partnership with Watt = = = 
 Boulton 's Soho site proved to have insufficient hydropower for his needs , especially in the summer when the millstream 's flow was greatly reduced . He realised that using a steam engine either to pump water back up to the millpond or to drive equipment directly would help to provide the necessary power . He began to correspond with Watt in 1766 , and first met him two years later . In 1769 Watt patented an engine with the innovation of a separate condenser , making it far more efficient than earlier engines . Boulton realised not only that this engine could power his manufactory , but also that its production might be a profitable business venture . 
 After receiving the patent , Watt did little to develop the engine into a marketable invention , turning to other work . In 1772 , Watt 's partner , Dr. John Roebuck , ran into financial difficulties , and Boulton , to whom he owed £ 1 @,@ 200 , accepted his two @-@ thirds share in Watt 's patent as satisfaction of the debt . Boulton 's partner Fothergill refused to have any part in the speculation , and accepted cash for his share . Boulton 's share was worth little without Watt 's efforts to improve his invention . At the time , the principal use of steam engines was to pump water out of mines . The engine commonly in use was the Newcomen steam engine , which consumed large amounts of coal and , as mines became deeper , proved incapable of keeping them clear of water . Watt 's work was well known , and a number of mines that needed engines put off purchasing them in the hope that Watt would soon market his invention . 
 Boulton boasted about Watt 's talents , leading to an employment offer from the Russian government , which Boulton had to persuade Watt to turn down . In 1774 he was able to convince Watt to move to Birmingham , and they entered into a partnership the following year . By 1775 six of the 14 years of Watt 's original patent had elapsed , but thanks to Boulton 's lobbying Parliament passed an act extending Watt 's patent until 1800 . Boulton and Watt began work improving the engine . With the assistance of iron master John Wilkinson ( brother @-@ in @-@ law of Lunar Society member Joseph Priestley ) , they succeeded in making the engine commercially viable . 
 In 1776 the partnership erected two engines , one for Wilkinson and one at a mine in Tipton in the Black Country . Both engines were successfully installed , leading to favourable publicity for the partnership . Boulton and Watt began to install engines elsewhere . The firm rarely produced the engine itself : it had the purchaser buy parts from a number of suppliers and then assembled the engine on @-@ site under the supervision of a Soho engineer . The company made its profit by comparing the amount of coal used by the machine with that used by an earlier , less efficient Newcomen engine , and required payments of one @-@ third of the savings annually for the next 25 years . This pricing scheme led to disputes , as many mines fuelled the engines using coal of unmarketable quality that cost the mine owners only the expense of extraction . Mine owners were also reluctant to make the annual payments , viewing the engines as theirs once erected , and threatened to petition Parliament to repeal Watt 's patent . 
 The county of Cornwall was a major market for the firm 's engines . It was mineral @-@ rich and had many mines . However , the special problems for mining there , including local rivalries and high prices for coal , which had to be imported from Wales , forced Watt and later Boulton to spend several months a year in Cornwall overseeing installations and resolving problems with the mineowners . In 1779 the firm hired engineer William Murdoch , who was able to take over the management of most of the on @-@ site installation problems , allowing Watt and Boulton to remain in Birmingham . 
 The pumping engine for use in mines was a great success . In 1782 the firm sought to modify Watt 's invention so that the engine had a rotary motion , making it suitable for use in mills and factories . On a 1781 visit to Wales Boulton had seen a powerful copper @-@ rolling mill driven by water , and when told it was often inoperable in the summer due to drought suggested that a steam engine would remedy that defect . Boulton wrote to Watt urging the modification of the engine , warning that they were reaching the limits of the pumping engine market : " There is no other Cornwall to be found , and the most likely line for increasing the consumption of our engines is the application of them to mills , which is certainly an extensive field . " Watt spent much of 1782 on the modification project , and though he was concerned that few orders would result , completed it at the end of the year . One order was received in 1782 , and several others from mills and breweries soon after . George III toured the Whitbread brewery in London , and was impressed by the engine . As a demonstration , Boulton used two engines to grind wheat at the rate of 150 bushels per hour in his new Albion Mill in London . While the mill was not financially successful , according to historian Jenny Uglow it served as a " publicity stunt par excellence " for the firm 's latest innovation . Before its 1791 destruction by fire , the mill 's fame , according to early historian Samuel Smiles , " spread far and wide " , and orders for rotative engines poured in not only from Britain but from the United States and the West Indies . 
 Between 1775 and 1800 the firm produced approximately 450 engines . It did not let other manufacturers produce engines with separate condensers , and approximately 1 @,@ 000 Newcomen engines , less efficient but cheaper and not subject to the restrictions of Watt 's patent , were produced in Britain during that time . Boulton boasted to James Boswell when the diarist toured Soho , " I sell here , sir , what all the world desires to have — POWER . " The development of an efficient steam engine allowed large @-@ scale industry to be developed , and the industrial city , such as Manchester became , to exist . 
 = = = Involvement with coinage = = = 
 By 1786 , two @-@ thirds of the coins in circulation in Britain were counterfeit , and the Royal Mint responded by shutting itself down , worsening the situation . Few of the silver coins being passed were genuine . Even the copper coins were melted down and replaced with lightweight fakes . The Royal Mint struck no copper coins for 48 years , from 1773 until 1821 . The resultant gap was filled with copper tokens that approximated the size of the halfpenny , struck on behalf of merchants . Boulton struck millions of these merchant pieces . On the rare occasions when the Royal Mint did strike coins , they were relatively crude , with quality control nonexistent . 
 Boulton had turned his attention to coinage in the mid @-@ 1780s ; they were just another small metal product like those he manufactured . He also had shares in several Cornish copper mines , and had a large personal stock of copper , purchased when the mines were unable to dispose of it elsewhere . However , when orders for counterfeit money were sent to him , he refused them : " I will do anything , short of being a common informer against particular persons , to stop the malpractices of the Birmingham coiners . " In 1788 he established the Soho Mint as part of his industrial plant . The mint included eight steam @-@ driven presses , each striking between 70 and 84 coins per minute . The firm had little immediate success getting a licence to strike British coins , but was soon engaged in striking coins for the British East India Company for use in India . 
 The coin crisis in Britain continued . In a letter to the Master of the Mint , Lord Hawkesbury ( whose son would become Prime Minister as Earl of Liverpool ) on 14 April 1789 , Boulton wrote : 
 In the course of my journeys , I observe that I receive upon an average two @-@ thirds counterfeit halfpence for change at toll @-@ gates , etc. and I believe the evil is daily increasing , as the spurious money is carried into circulation by the lowest class of manufacturers , who pay with it the principal part of the wages of the poor people they employ . They purchase from the <unk> coiners 36 shillings ' <unk> of copper ( in nominal value ) for 20 shillings , so that the profit derived from the cheating is very large . 
 Boulton offered to strike new coins at a cost " not exceeding half the expense which the common copper coin hath always cost at his Majesty 's Mint " . He wrote to his friend , Sir Joseph Banks , describing the advantages of his coinage presses : 
 It will coin much faster , with greater ease , with fewer persons , for less expense , and more beautiful than any other machinery ever used for coining ... Can lay the pieces or blanks upon the die quite true and without care or practice and as fast as wanted . Can work night and day without fatigue by two setts of boys . The machine keeps an account of the number of pieces struck which cannot be altered from the truth by any of the persons employed . The apparatus strikes an inscription upon the edge with the same blow that strikes the two faces . It strikes the [ back ] ground of the pieces brighter than any other coining press can do . It strikes the pieces perfectly round , all of equal diameter , and exactly concentric with the edge , which cannot be done by any other machinery now in use . 
 Boulton spent much time in London lobbying for a contract to strike British coins , but in June 1790 the Pitt Government postponed a decision on recoinage indefinitely . Meanwhile , the Soho Mint struck coins for the East India Company , Sierra Leone and Russia , while producing high @-@ quality planchets , or blank coins , to be struck by national mints elsewhere . The firm sent over 20 million blanks to Philadelphia , to be struck into cents and half @-@ cents by the United States Mint — Mint Director Elias Boudinot found them to be " perfect and beautifully polished " . The high @-@ technology Soho Mint gained increasing and somewhat unwelcome attention : rivals attempted industrial espionage , while lobbying for Boulton 's mint to be shut down . 
 The national financial crisis reached its nadir in February 1797 , when the Bank of England stopped redeeming its bills for gold . In an effort to get more money into circulation , the Government adopted a plan to issue large quantities of copper coins , and Lord Hawkesbury summoned Boulton to London on 3 March 1797 , informing him of the Government 's plan . Four days later , Boulton attended a meeting of the Privy Council , and was awarded a contract at the end of the month . According to a proclamation dated 26 July 1797 , King George III was " graciously pleased to give directions that measures might be taken for an immediate supply of such copper coinage as might be best adapted to the payment of the laborious poor in the present exigency ... which should go and pass for one penny and two pennies " . The proclamation required that the coins weigh one and two ounces respectively , bringing the intrinsic value of the coins close to their face value . Boulton made efforts to frustrate counterfeiters . Designed by Heinrich Küchler , the coins featured a raised rim with <unk> or sunken letters and numbers , features difficult for counterfeiters to match . The twopenny coins measured exactly an inch and a half across ; 16 pennies lined up would reach two feet . The exact measurements and weights made it easy to detect lightweight counterfeits . Küchler also designed proportionate <unk> and farthings ; these were not authorised by the proclamation , and though pattern pieces were struck , they never officially entered circulation . The halfpenny measured ten to a foot , the farthing 12 to a foot . The coins were nicknamed " cartwheels " , both because of the size of the twopenny coin and in reference to the broad rims of both denominations . The penny was the first of its denomination to be struck in copper . 
 The cartwheel twopenny coin was not struck again ; much of the mintage was melted down in 1800 when the price of copper increased and it had proved too heavy for commerce and was difficult to strike . Much to Boulton 's chagrin , the new coins were being counterfeited in copper @-@ covered lead within a month of issuance . Boulton was awarded additional contracts in 1799 and 1806 , each for the lower three copper denominations . Though the cartwheel design was used again for the 1799 penny ( struck with the date 1797 ) , all other strikings used lighter planchets to reflect the rise in the price of copper , and featured more conventional designs . Boulton greatly reduced the counterfeiting problem by adding lines to the coin edges , and striking slightly concave planchets . <unk> turned their sights to easier targets , the pre @-@ Soho pieces , which were not withdrawn , due to the expense , until a gradual withdrawal took place between 1814 and 1817 . 
 Watt , in his eulogy after Boulton 's death in 1809 , stated : 
 In short , had Mr. Boulton done nothing more in the world than he has accomplished in improving the coinage , his name would deserve to be immortalised ; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations , and at enormous expense , — for which , at the time , he could have had no certainty of an adequate return , — we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity , his perseverance , or his munificence . He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer ; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain . Yet it is to be hoped that , even in the latter point of view , the enterprise answered its purpose .

 = = = Scientific studies and the Lunar Society = = = 
 Boulton never had any formal schooling in science . His associate and fellow Lunar Society member James Keir eulogised him after his death : 
 Mr. [ Boulton ] is proof of how much scientific knowledge may be acquired without much regular study , by means of a quick & just apprehension , much practical application , and nice mechanical feelings . He had very correct notions of the several branches of natural philosophy , was master of every metallic art & possessed all the chemistry that had any relations to the object of his various manufactures . Electricity and astronomy were at one time among his favourite amusements . 
 From an early age , Boulton had interested himself in the scientific advances of his times . He discarded theories that electricity was a manifestation of the human soul , writing " we know tis matter & tis wrong to call it Spirit " . He called such theories " <unk> [ chimeras ] of each others Brain " . His interest brought him into contact with other enthusiasts such as John Whitehurst , who also became a member of the Lunar Society . In 1758 the Pennsylvania printer Benjamin Franklin , the leading experimenter in electricity , journeyed to Birmingham during one of his lengthy stays in Britain ; Boulton met him , and introduced him to his friends . Boulton worked with Franklin in efforts to contain electricity within a Leyden jar , and when the printer needed new glass for his " <unk> " ( a mechanised version of musical glasses ) he obtained it from Boulton . 
 Despite time constraints imposed on him by the expansion of his business , Boulton continued his " philosophical " work ( as scientific experimentation was then called ) . He wrote in his notebooks observations on the freezing and boiling point of mercury , on people 's pulse rates at different ages , on the movements of the planets , and on how to make sealing wax and disappearing ink . However , Erasmus Darwin , another fellow enthusiast who became a member of the Lunar Society , wrote to him in 1763 , " As you are now become a sober plodding Man of Business , I scarcely dare trouble you to do me a favour in the ... philosophical way . " 
 The Birmingham enthusiasts , including Boulton , Whitehurst , Keir , Darwin , Watt ( after his move to Birmingham ) , potter Josiah Wedgwood and clergyman and chemist Joseph Priestley began to meet informally in the late 1750s . This evolved into a monthly meeting near the full moon , providing light to journey home afterwards , a pattern common for clubs in Britain at the time . The group eventually dubbed itself the " Lunar Society " , and following the death of member Dr William Small in 1775 , who had informally coordinated communication between the members , Boulton took steps to put the Society on a formal footing . They met on Sundays , beginning with dinner at 2 p.m. , and continuing with discussions until at least 8 . 
 While not a formal member of the Lunar Society , Sir Joseph Banks was active in it . In 1768 Banks sailed with Captain James Cook to the South Pacific , and took with him green glass earrings made at Soho to give to the natives . In 1776 Captain Cook ordered an instrument from Boulton , most likely for use in navigation . Boulton generally preferred not to take on lengthy projects , and he warned Cook that its completion might take years . In June 1776 Cook left on the voyage on which he was killed almost three years later , and Boulton 's records show no further mention of the instrument . 
 In addition to the scientific discussions and experiments conducted by the group , Boulton had a business relationship with some of the members . Watt and Boulton were partners for a quarter century . Boulton purchased vases from Wedgwood 's pottery to be decorated with ormolu , and contemplated a partnership with him . Keir was a long @-@ time supplier and associate of Boulton , though Keir never became his partner as he hoped . 
 In 1785 both Boulton and Watt were elected as Fellows of the Royal Society . According to Whitehurst , who wrote to congratulate Boulton , not a single vote was cast against him . 
 Though Boulton hoped his activities for the Lunar Society would " prevent the decline of a Society which I hope will be lasting " , as members died or moved away they were not replaced . In 1813 , four years after his death , the Society was dissolved and a lottery was held to dispose of its assets . Since there were no minutes of meetings , few details of the gatherings remain . Historian Jenny Uglow wrote of the lasting impact of the Society : 
 The Lunar Society [ ' s ] ... members have been called the fathers of the Industrial Revolution ... [ T ] he importance of this particular Society stems from its pioneering work in experimental chemistry , physics , engineering , and medicine , combined with leadership in manufacturing and commerce , and with political and social ideals . Its members were brilliant representatives of the informal scientific web which cut across class , blending the inherited skills of craftsmen with the theoretical advances of scholars , a key factor in Britain 's leap ahead of the rest of Europe . 
 = = = Community work = = = 
 Boulton was widely involved in civic activities in Birmingham . His friend Dr John Ash had long sought to build a hospital in the town . A great fan of the music of Handel , Boulton conceived of the idea to hold a music festival in Birmingham to raise funds for the hospital . The festival took place in September 1768 , the first of a series stretching well into the twentieth century . The hospital opened in 1779 . Boulton also helped build the General Dispensary , where outpatient treatment could be obtained . A firm supporter of the Dispensary , he served as treasurer , and wrote , " If the funds of the institution are not sufficient for its support , I will make up the deficiency . " The Dispensary soon outgrew its original quarters , and a new building in Temple Row was opened in 1808 , shortly before Boulton 's death . 
 Boulton helped found the New Street Theatre in 1774 , and later wrote that having a theatre encouraged well @-@ to @-@ do visitors to come to Birmingham , and to spend more money than they would have otherwise . Boulton attempted to have the theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent , entitled to present serious drama ; he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807 . He also supported Birmingham 's Oratorio Choral Society , and collaborated with button maker and amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore to put on a series of private concerts in 1799 . He maintained a pew at St Paul 's Church , Birmingham , a centre of musical excellence . When performances of the Messiah were organised at Westminster Abbey in 1784 in the ( incorrect ) belief it was the centennial of Handel 's birth and the ( correct ) belief that it was the 25th anniversary of his death , Boulton attended and wrote , " I scarcely know which was grandest , the sounds or the scene . Both was <unk> fine that it is not in my power of words to describe . In the grand Halleluja my soul almost ascended from my body . " 
 Concerned about the level of crime in Birmingham , Boulton complained , " The streets are infested from Noon Day to midnight with prostitutes . " In an era prior to the establishment of the police , Boulton served on a committee to organise volunteers to patrol the streets at night and reduce crime . He supported the local militia , providing money for weapons . In 1794 he was elected High Sheriff of Staffordshire , his county of residence . 
 Besides seeking to improve local life , Boulton took an interest in world affairs . Initially sympathetic to the cause of the rebellious American colonists , Boulton changed his view once he realised that an independent America might be a threat to British trade , and in 1775 organised a petition urging the government to take a hard line with the Americans — though when the revolution proved successful , he resumed trade with the former colonies . He was more sympathetic to the cause of the French Revolution , believing it justified , though he expressed his horror at the bloody excesses of the Revolutionary government . When war with France broke out , he paid for weapons for a company of volunteers , sworn to resist any French invasion . 
 = = Family and later life , death , and memorials = = 
 When Boulton was widowed in 1783 he was left with the care of his two teenage children . Neither his son Matthew Robinson Boulton nor his daughter Anne enjoyed robust health ; the younger Matthew was often ill and was a poor student who was shuttled from school to school until he joined his father 's business in 1790 ; Anne suffered from a diseased leg that prevented her from enjoying a full life . Despite his lengthy absences on business , Boulton cared deeply for his family . He wrote to his wife in January 1780 @,@ 
 Nothing could in the least palliate this long , this cold , this very distant separation from my dearest wife and children but the certain knowledge that I am preparing for their ease , happiness and prosperity , and when that is the prise , I know no hardships that I would not encounter with , to obtain it . 
 With the expiry of the patent in 1800 both Boulton and Watt retired from the partnership , each turning over his role to his namesake son . The two sons made changes , quickly ending public tours of the Soho Manufactory in which the elder Boulton had taken pride throughout his time in Soho . In retirement Boulton remained active , continuing to run the Soho Mint . When a new Royal Mint was built on Tower Hill in 1805 , Boulton was awarded the contract to equip it with modern machinery . His continued activity distressed Watt , who had entirely retired from Soho , and who wrote to Boulton in 1804 , " [ Y ] our friends fear much that your necessary attention to the operation of the coinage may injure your health " . 
 Boulton helped deal with the shortage of silver , persuading the Government to let him <unk> the Bank of England 's large stock of Spanish dollars with an English design . The Bank had attempted to circulate the dollars by <unk> the coins on the side showing the Spanish king with a small image of George III , but the public was reluctant to accept them , in part due to counterfeiting . This attempt inspired the couplet , " The Bank to make their Spanish Dollars pass / Stamped the head of a fool on the neck of an ass . " Boulton obliterated the old design in his restriking . Though Boulton was not as successful in defeating counterfeiters as he hoped ( high quality fakes arrived at the Bank 's offices within days of the issuance ) , these coins circulated until the Royal Mint again struck large quantities of silver coin in 1816 , when Boulton 's were withdrawn . He oversaw the final issue of his coppers for Britain in 1806 , and a major issue of coppers to circulate only in Ireland . Even as his health failed , he had his servants carry him from Soho House to the Soho Mint , and he sat and watched the machinery , which was kept exceptionally busy in 1808 by the striking of almost 90 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 pieces for the East India Company . He wrote , " Of all the mechanical subjects I ever entered upon , there is none in which I ever engaged with so much ardour as that of bringing to perfection the art of coining . " 
 By early 1809 he was seriously ill . He had long suffered from kidney stones , which also lodged in the bladder , causing him great pain . He died at Soho House on 17 August 1809 . He was buried in the graveyard of St. Mary 's Church , Handsworth , in Birmingham – the church was later extended over the site of his grave . Inside the church , on the north wall of the sanctuary , is a large marble monument to him , commissioned by his son , sculpted by the sculptor John Flaxman . It includes a marble bust of Boulton , set in a circular opening above two putti , one holding an engraving of the Soho Manufactory . 
 Boulton is recognised by several memorials and other commemorations in and around Birmingham . Soho House , his home from 1766 until his death , is now a museum , as is his first workshop , Sarehole Mill . The Soho archives are at the Birmingham City Archives . He is recognised by blue plaques at his <unk> Lane birthplace and at Soho House . A gilded bronze statue of Boulton , Watt and Murdoch ( 1956 ) by William Bloye stands outside the old Register Office on Broad Street in central Birmingham . Matthew Boulton College was named in his honour in 1957 . The two @-@ hundredth anniversary of his death , in 2009 , resulted in a number of tributes . Birmingham City Council promoted " a year long festival celebrating the life , work and legacy of Matthew Boulton " . 
 On 29 May 2009 the Bank of England announced that Boulton and Watt would appear on a new £ 50 note . The design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a Bank of England note , and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of a steam engine and Boulton 's Soho Manufactory . Quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note : " I sell here , sir , what all the world desires to have — POWER " ( Boulton ) and " I can think of nothing else but this machine " ( Watt ) . In September 2011 it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on 2 November . 
 In March 2009 , Boulton was honoured with the issue of a Royal Mail postage stamp . 
 On 17 October 2014 a memorial to him was unveiled in Westminster Abbey beside that of his business partner James Watt . 
 = Tropical Storm Arlene ( 1981 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Arlene was a rare off @-@ season tropical cyclone that hit Cuba and the Bahamas in May 1981 . Its formation was unusual , originating from a tropical disturbance that crossed from the eastern Pacific Ocean into the Caribbean Sea ; few Atlantic hurricanes develop in this manner . On May 6 , a tropical depression developed , and the next day it became Tropical Storm Arlene near the Cayman Islands , three weeks before the start of the hurricane season . This marked the first Atlantic tropical storm in May since 1970 's Hurricane Alma . Arlene moved northeastward throughout its life , bringing rainfall and locally gusty winds as it crossed Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas . On May 9 , the storm dissipated when a large non @-@ tropical storm absorbed Arlene . There were no reports of deaths or significant damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Arlene were from a cloud mass that developed in the eastern Pacific Ocean in early May 1981 . The system crossed Central America , and by the afternoon of May 5 , a low @-@ level circulation was evident near Roatán , off the coast of Honduras . Convection was initially disorganized , preventing classification as a tropical cyclone . It was not until late on May 6 that Dvorak satellite intensity estimates began on the system . Around that time , it is estimated it became a tropical depression , while located near the Cayman Island . It was a rare example of an Atlantic depression forming from a disturbance that originated in the eastern Pacific . 
 After becoming a tropical depression , the system evolved rapidly as a spiral band formed around the circulation . Based on satellite imagery , the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Arlene on May 7 . Shortly thereafter , Hurricane Hunters confirmed the intensity , while reporting a pressure of 1 @,@ 000 @.@ 0 hectopascals ( 29 @.@ 53 inHg ) . By then and through much of its lifetime , the circulation was located along the western edge of the deep convection . Arlene strengthened slightly further to winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , before it moved ashore in eastern Cuba early on May 8 . As it approached land , the convection was weakening , although its center maintained a steady northeast path , due to a high pressure system to its north . 
 While crossing eastern Cuba , the circulation of Arlene became ill @-@ defined , although re @-@ strengthening over water was considered possible . When it reached open waters , Arlene was already a depression , and there was considered little likelihood of redevelopment , with strong shear pushing the convection far east of the center . Nevertheless , a NOAA reconnaissance mission found that winds briefly increased to 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , or tropical storm strength , located over the southeastern Bahamas in a large convective band extending of the center . When the thunderstorms dissipated , the winds again dropped , and Arlene returned to tropical depression status . Early on May 9 , the depression was absorbed by an advancing trough . Late the next day , the combined systems reorganized and resembled having some subtropical characteristics , although it weakened further by May 11 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 As Arlene was approaching its first landfall , the National Hurricane Center noted the potential for heavy rainfall in Jamaica , Cuba , and the Bahamas ; small boats in those regions were advised to remain at harbor . Meanwhile , the government of the Bahamas issued storm warnings for the central and southeastern portion of its country . There were no reports of damage or casualties from Cuba or the Bahamas , and therefore storm affects were judged to have been minimal . Early in the duration of Arlene , Cayman Brac reported 46 miles per hour ( 74 km / h ) winds ; later , peak winds in the Bahamas reached around 35 miles per hour ( 56 km / h ) . Arlene was the only May tropical storm on record to affect the Cuban province of Camagüey , although its passage was mostly noticed in its disruption of sugar cane production . 
 = Kepler @-@ 40b = 
 Kepler @-@ 40b , formerly known as KOI @-@ <unk> , is a hot Jupiter discovered in orbit around the star Kepler @-@ 40 , which is about to become a red giant . The planet was first noted as a transit event by NASA 's Kepler spacecraft . The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available , including data on Kepler @-@ 40 ; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to collect all the data needed to show that a planet was producing the periodic dimming of Kepler @-@ 40 . The planet , Kepler @-@ 40b , is twice the mass of Jupiter and slightly larger than it in size , making it as dense as Neptune . The planet is also nearly thirteen times hotter than Jupiter and orbits five times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun .

 Kepler @-@ 40 was first observed by the Kepler spacecraft , a NASA satellite that searches for planets in transit ( crossing in front of and dimming ) their host stars , from May 13 , 2009 , to June 15 , 2009 in its first days of operation . The resulting light curve was made available to the public by the Kepler science team , revealing four transit events over 33 @.@ 5 days . 
 A team composed of astronomers from France and Switzerland used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute @-@ Provence Observatory in southern France to examine Kepler @-@ 40 . SOPHIE uses radial velocity measurements to examine stars for exoplanets . After background light was removed and alternative causes for radial velocity variations were disproved ( for example , that Kepler @-@ 40 was actually a close binary star ) , the team used SOPHIE to analyze the properties of the actual star . The astronomers observing the star found that it is nearing the main sequence turn @-@ off ( the star fuses the last of its hydrogen and becomes a red giant ) . The establishment of stellar parameters helped the astronomers extrapolate the exoplanet 's parameters and prove the existence of Kepler @-@ 40b . The discovered planet was the sixth transiting planet to have been discovered in orbit around stars with a radius of more than 1 @.@ 8 times that of the Sun , after planets including Kepler @-@ 5 and Kepler @-@ 7 . 
 The discovery of Kepler @-@ 40b demonstrated that smaller telescopes , such as SOPHIE , are effective when used as follow @-@ ups to space missions like Kepler . The team of astronomers spent what amounted roughly to one night on a <unk> @-@ meter telescope and gathered all the data needed to establish Kepler @-@ 40b 's existence and parameters . Kepler @-@ 40b was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on January 4 , 2011 , after it was sent to the journal on September 15 , 2010 .

 = Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak = 
 Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome ( SCSFLS ) is a medical condition in which the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) held in and around a human brain and spinal cord leaks out of the surrounding protective sac , the dura , for no apparent reason . The dura , a tough , inflexible tissue , is the outermost of the three layers of the meninges , the system of meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord . 
 A spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak is one of several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura . A spontaneous CSF leak , as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks , arises <unk> . A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension . A CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down . Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness , nausea , vomiting , dizziness , fatigue , and a metallic taste in the mouth ( indicative of a cranial leak ) , among others . A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage . Once identified , the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch , an injection of the patient 's own blood at the site of the leak , fibrin glue injection or surgery . 
 SCSFLS afflicts 5 out of every 100 @,@ 000 people . On average , the condition is developed at the age of 42 , and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition . Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching , leading to long @-@ term disability due to pain . SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg <unk> in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s . 
 = = Classification = = 
 SCSFLS is classified into two main types , cranial leaks and spinal leaks . The vast majority of leaks are spinal . Cranial leaks occur in the head . In some of these cases , CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose , or ear . Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord . Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension , diminished volume and pressure of the cranium . While referred to as intracranial hypotension , the intracranial pressure may be normal , with the underlying issue instead being low @-@ volume CSF . For this reason SCSFLS is referred to as CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Most people who develop SCSFLS feel a sudden onset of a severe and acute headache . It is a headache usually but not necessarily orthostatic ( worse when standing ) , typically becoming prominent throughout the day , in which usually the pain is worse when the person is vertical and less severe when horizontal . Orthostatic headaches can be incapacitating ; these ailments often become chronic and can be sufficiently disabling to make those afflicted unable to work . Some patients with CSF leak will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon . This is known as second @-@ half @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day headache . This may be an initial presentation of CSF leak or appear after treatment and likely indicates a slow CSF leak . 
 Apart from headache , about 50 % of patients experience neck pain or stiffness , nausea , and vomiting . Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo , facial numbness or weakness , unusually blurry or double vision , neuralgia , fatigue , or a metallic taste in the mouth . Leaking CSF can sometimes be felt or observed as discharge through the nose or ear . 
 Lack of CSF pressure and volume allows the brain to descend through the foramen magnum , or occipital bone , the large opening at the base of the skull . The lower portion of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes , thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms . Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right . 
 = = Causes = = 
 The two main theories as to the underlying cause of SCSFLS are as a result of a connective tissue disorder or spinal drainage problems . 
 = = = Connective tissue theory = = = 
 A spontaneous CSF leak is idiopathic , meaning the cause in unknown . Various scientists and physicians have suggested that this condition may be the result of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura . It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility . Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder . Marfan syndrome , Ehlers @-@ Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS . 
 Roughly 20 % of patients with SCSFLS exhibit features of Marfan syndrome , including tall stature , chest divot ( pectus <unk> ) , joint hypermobility and arched palate . However these patients do not exhibit any other Marfan syndrome presentations . 
 = = = Spinal drainage theory = = = 
 Some other studies have proposed that issues with the spinal venous drainage system may cause a CSF leak . According to this theory , dural holes and intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low pressure in the epidural space due to outflow to the heart through the inferior vena cava vein . 
 = = = Other causes = = = 
 Patients with a nude ( absent ) nerve root are at increased risk for developing recurrent CSF leaks . Cranial CSF leaks are as a result of intracranial hypertension in a vast majority of cases . The increased pressure causes a rupture of the cranial dura mater , leading to CSF leak and intracranial hypotension . Lumbar disc herniation has been reported to cause CSF leak in at least one case . Degenerative spinal disc diseases cause a disc to pierce the dura mater , leading to a CSF leak . 
 Another view of the cause of orthostatic headaches proposes a malformed distribution of <unk> elasticity as a result of the collapse of the lower spine 's CSF space resulting in the collapse of the dura sac . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the brain and contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges . The brain floats in CSF , which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord . As holes form in the spinal dura mater , CSF leaks out into the surrounding space . The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine . Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 The primary place of first complaint to a physician is a hospital emergency room . Up to 94 % of those suffering from SCSFLS are initially misdiagnosed . Incorrect diagnoses include migraines , meningitis , Chiari malformation and psychiatric disorders . The average time from onset of symptoms until definitive diagnosis is 13 months . A study found a 0 % success rate for proper diagnosis in the emergency department . 
 Diagnosis of CSF leak can be done through various imaging techniques , chemical tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice , or clinical exam . The use of CT , MRI , and assays are the most common types of CSF leak instrumental tests . Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays , thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks . A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose , for example : discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over , the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators . 
 Clinical exam is often used means to diagnose CSF leaks . Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis . The lack of clinician awareness of the signs <unk> and <unk> of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment , in particular : the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF <unk> will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition , and diagnosis of , a CSF leak . 
 = = = CT = = = 
 Diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leak is performed through a combination of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography <unk> ( <unk> ) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks . The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture , also known as a spinal tap . Once the pressure is measured , <unk> contrast material is injected into the spinal fluid . The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes . This allows for a <unk> with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery . 
 = = = MRI = = = 
 Magnetic resonance imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak . MRI studies may show <unk> enhancement ( when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed ) , sagging of the brain , pituitary enlargement , subdural <unk> , engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses , and other abnormalities . For 20 % of patients , MRIs present as completely normal . There is disagreement over whether MRI should be the study of choice . MRIs performed with the patient seated upright ( vs. laying supine ) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks , but are more than twice as effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia , aka Chiari malformation . Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak , but originates either congenitally or from trauma , including whiplash strain to the dura . 
 An alternate method of locating the site of a CSF leak is to use heavily T2 @-@ weighted MR <unk> . This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak without the need for a CT scan , lumbar puncture , and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling . Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR <unk> . 
 = = = Assay = = = 
 When cranial CSF leak is suspected because of discharge from the nose or ear that is potentially CSF , the fluid can be collected and tested with a beta @-@ 2 transferrin assay . This test can positively identify if the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid . 
 = = = CSF analysis = = = 
 Patients with CSF leak have been noted to have very low or even negative opening pressures . However , patients with confirmed CSF leaks may also demonstrate completely normal opening pressures . In 18 – 46 % of cases , the CSF pressure is measured within the normal range . Analysis of spinal fluid may demonstrate lymphocytic <unk> and elevated protein content or xanthochromia . This is hypothesized to be due to increased permeability of dilated meningeal blood vessels and a decrease of CSF flow in the lumbar subarachnoid space . 
 = = = Clinical presentation = = = 
 The diagnostic criteria for SCSFLS is based on the 2004 International Classification of Headache Disorders , 2nd edn ( <unk> @-@ II ) ( Table 1 ) ( 50 ) criteria . However , the presentation of patients with confirmed diagnosis may be very different from that of the clinical diagnostic criteria and cannot be considered authoritative . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Initial measures can include rest , caffeine intake ( via coffee or intravenous infusion ) , and hydration . Corticosteroids may provide transient relief for some patients . An abdominal binder — a type of garment that increases intracranial pressure by compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people . 
 = = = Epidural blood patch = = = 
 The treatment of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches , which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration . Through the injection of a person 's own blood into the area of the hole in the dura , an epidural blood patch uses blood 's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes . The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable . One @-@ quarter to one @-@ third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching . 
 = = = <unk> glue sealant = = = 
 If blood patches alone do not succeed in closing the dural tears , placement of percutaneous fibrin glue can be used in place of blood patching , raising the effectiveness of forming a clot and arresting CSF leakage . 
 = = = Surgical drain technique = = = 
 In extreme cases of intractable CSF leak , a surgical lumbar drain has been used . This procedure is believed to decrease spinal CSF volume while increasing intracranial CSF pressure and volume . This procedure restores normal intracranial CSF volume and pressure while promoting the healing of dural tears by lowering the pressure and volume in the dura . This procedure has led to positive results leading to relief of symptoms for up to one year . 
 = = = <unk> repair = = = 
 For patients that do not respond to either epidural blood patching or fibrin glue , neurosurgery is available to directly repair leaking meningeal diverticula . The areas of dura leak can be tied together in a process called ligation and then a metal clip can be placed in order to hold the ligation closed . Alternatively , a small compress called a muscle <unk> can be placed over the dura leak and then sealed with gel foam and fibrin glue . Primary suturing is rarely able to repair a CSF leak , and in some patients exploration of the dura may be required to properly locate all sites of CSF leak . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Final outcomes for people with SCSFLS remain poorly studied . Symptoms may resolve in as little as two weeks , or persist for months . Less commonly , patients may suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years . People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled and unable to work . Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common . 
 = = = Complications = = = 
 Several complications can occur as a result of SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure , brain herniation , infection , blood pressure problems , transient paralysis , and coma . The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension , where pressure in the brain is severely decreased . This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches . 
 People with cranial CSF leaks , the rarer form , have a 10 % risk of developing meningitis per year . If cranial leaks last more than seven days , the chances of developing meningitis are significantly higher . Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of the leak site . When a CSF leak occurs at the temporal bone surgery becomes necessary in order to prevent infection and repair the leak . Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly . The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem , which controls breathing and circulation . 
 Low CSF volume can cause the cerebellar tonsil position to descend , which can be mistaken for Chiari malformation ; however when the CSF leak is repaired the tonsil position often returns to normal ( as seen in upright MRI ) in this " pseudo @-@ Chiari " condition . A further , albeit rare , complication of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia due to a sudden and significant loss of CSF . This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord . The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine . An extremely rare complication of SCSFLS is third nerve palsy , where the ability to move one 's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve . 
 There are documented cases of reversible frontotemporal dementia and coma . Coma due to a CSF leak has been successfully treated by using blood patches and / or fibrin glue and placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position . Empty sella syndrome , a <unk> structure that surround the pituitary gland , occurs in CSF leak patients . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 A 1994 community @-@ based study indicated that two out of every 100 @,@ 000 people suffered from SCSFLS , while a 2004 emergency room @-@ based study indicated five per 100 @,@ 000 . SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged ; the average age for onset is 42 @.@ 3 years , but onset can range from ages 22 to 61 . In an 11 @-@ year study women were found to be twice as likely to be affected as men . 
 Studies have shown that SCSFLS runs in families and it is suspected that genetic similarity in families includes weakness in the dura mater , which leads to SCSFLS . Large scale population @-@ based studies have not yet been conducted . While a majority of SCSFLS cases continue to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed , an actual increase in occurrence is unlikely . 
 = = History = = 
 Spontaneous CSF leaks have been described by notable physicians and reported in medical journals dating back to the early 1900s . German neurologist Georg <unk> reported in 1938 and 1953 what he termed " <unk> " , a condition marked by very low , unobtainable , or even negative CSF pressures . The symptoms included orthostatic headaches and other features that are now recognized as spontaneous intracranial hypotension . A few decades earlier , the same syndrome had been described in French literature as " hypotension of spinal fluid " and " ventricular collapse " . In 1940 , Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic wrote about " headaches associated with decreased intracranial pressure " . The full clinical manifestations of intracranial hypotension and CSF leaks were described in several publications reported between the 1960s and early 1990s . Modern reports of spontaneous CSF leak have been reported to medical journals since the late 1980s . 
 = = Research = = 
 IV <unk> , a corticosteroid that causes the brain to produce additional spinal fluid to replace the volume of the lost CSF and alleviate symptoms , has been used to treat CSF leaks . 
 In two small studies of two patients and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms , the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion . The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume necessary for a patient to avoid <unk> until the leak can be repaired properly . <unk> saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness . 
 The gene <unk> has been implicated in several connective tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome , arterial <unk> , and thoracic aortic aneurysm . A study of patients with SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene . Minor features of Marfan syndrome has been found in 20 % of CSF leak patients . Abnormal findings of fibrillin @-@ 1 has been documented in these CSF @-@ leak patients , but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin @-@ 1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome . 
 = Ip Man ( film ) = 
 Ip Man is a 2008 Hong Kong martial arts film based on the life of Yip Man , a grandmaster of the martial art Wing Chun and teacher of Bruce Lee . The film focuses on events in Ip 's life that supposedly took place in the city of Foshan during the Sino @-@ Japanese War . The film was directed by Wilson Yip , and stars Donnie Yen as Ip Man , with martial arts choreography by Sammo Hung . The supporting cast includes Simon Yam , Lynn Hung , Lam Ka @-@ tung , Xing Yu and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi . 
 The idea of an Ip Man biopic originated in 1998 when Jeffrey Lau and Corey Yuen discussed the idea of making a film based on Bruce Lee 's martial arts teacher . However , the studio producing that proposed film closed , and the project was abandoned . Producer Raymond Wong decided to develop his own Ip Man film with full consent from Ip 's sons , and had filmmakers head to Foshan to research Ip 's life . Ip Chun , Ip Man 's eldest son , along with martial arts master Leo Au @-@ yeung and several other Wing Chun practitioners served as technical consultants for the film . Principal photography for Ip Man began in March 2008 and ended in August ; filming took place in Shanghai , which was used to architecturally recreate Foshan . During filming , conflicts arose between the producers of Ip Man and filmmaker Wong Kar @-@ wai over the film 's working title . Wong , who had been developing his own Ip Man biopic , clashed with the producers after learning that their film would be titled Grandmaster Ip Man ( Chinese : <unk> ) , which was too similar to the title of the other film . The producers of Ip Man agreed to change the film title , despite Wong 's film being in development hell . Kar @-@ wai 's film , titled The Grandmaster , was released on 10 January 2013 . 
 Ip Man is the first film in the Ip Man film series . It premiered in Beijing on 10 December 2008 , and was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 19 December 2008 , receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences . Before the film 's release , Raymond Wong announced that there would be a sequel ; a second installment titled Ip Man 2 , was released in April 2010 , and a third installment titled Ip Man 3 was released in 2015 . Ip Man grossed over US $ 21 million worldwide , despite not being released in North America and most of Europe . Following its success , the film was nominated for 12 Hong Kong Film Awards , winning awards for Best Film and Best Action Choreography . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the 1930s , Foshan is a hub of Southern Chinese martial arts , where various schools actively recruit disciples and compete against each other . Although the Wing Chun master Ip Man is the most skilled martial artist in Foshan , he is unassuming and keeps a low profile . As an independent wealthy man , he feels no need to accept any disciples and instead spends his days training , meeting with friends , and spending time with his family . However , his wife is often resentful of the time he spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues . Though not a professional martial artist , Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly , closed @-@ door competitions with local masters . Ip 's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive , rude , highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master , Jin Shanzhao , thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan . 
 The Japanese invasion in 1937 adversely affects the life of everyone in Foshan . Ip 's house is claimed by the Japanese and used as their Foshan headquarters . Ip and his family lose their wealth and are forced to move into a decrepit house . Desperate to support his family , Ip accepts work at a coal mine . The Japanese General Miura , who is a Karate master , establishes an arena where Chinese martial artists compete with his military trainees . The Chinese earn a bag of rice for every match they win . Li Zhao , a former police officer and Ip 's acquaintance , is now working as a translator for the Japanese and is making the offer to the martial artists working at the coal mine . Ip at first declines to participate in the matches . However , when his friend Lin goes missing , he agrees to take part in order to investigate . Ip arrives to see Lin executed by Miura 's lieutenant , Sato , for picking up a bag of rice from a prior victory after conceding in a second match against three karateka . He also comes to understand that Lin was killed in an earlier fight . Barely able to contain his rage , Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once . Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the invasion began ( in order to conserve what little food his family had to survive ) , he proceeds to mercilessly crush each of them with a brutal barrage of his martial art mastery , showing none of the restraint he exhibited in previous engagements . His skill arouses the interest of Miura , who seeks to learn more about Ip and see him fight again . 
 When Ip does not return to the arena , Miura grows impatient and sends Sato along with several soldiers to find him . The lieutenant then gestures at Ip 's wife , prompting Ip to incapacitate them . Ip later visits his friend Chow Ching @-@ chuen , who owns and runs a cotton mill in Foshan . Chow tells Ip that a bandit gang led by Jin Shanzhao is harassing his workers and trying to extort money from them . Ip trains the workers in Wing Chun for self @-@ defense . When the bandits return to the cotton mill , the workers fight back using the techniques that Ip taught them . Ip himself arrives midway through the battle to take care of things personally and defeats Jin Shanzhao , warning him never to harass the workers again . 
 The Japanese soldiers eventually find Ip at the cotton mill . Miura tells Ip that his life will be spared if he agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts . Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match , which Miura accepts , both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese . The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan 's square . At first , the two fighters seem equally matched , but Miura soon finds himself unable to penetrate Ip 's impeccable defense and becomes overwhelmed by his relentless and direct blows . He is helpless to defend himself as Ip effortlessly uses him as a wooden dummy , inflicting a severe beating on him and clearly winning . 
 As the beaten general lies down after his defeat , Ip looks over to the cheering Chinese crowd and spots his wife and child with Chow . Enraged , Sato shoots at Ip , sparking a scuffle between the Chinese audience and the Japanese soldiers . During the scuffle , Li Zhao kills Sato with Sato 's own gun . Ip is taken away amidst the chaos . The epilogue reveals that he survives and escapes to Hong Kong with his family with the help of Chow Ching @-@ chuen . There , Ip establishes a Wing Chun school , where his students come to learn martial arts from him , including Bruce Lee .

 The film was originally conceived in 1998 when Jeffrey Lau and Corey Yuen first thought of the idea of making a film based on Ip Man 's life . Donnie Yen signed onto the project , hoping to star as Ip , with Stephen Chow co @-@ starring as Bruce Lee . Yen had signed the contract and received part of the acting fee . However , the studio producing the film closed , and the project was abandoned . 
 In December 2007 , plans to make a new Ip Man film were announced with the filmmakers researching Ip 's life in Foshan . Producer Raymond Wong stated that the film would take on a similar look and feel to SPL : Sha Po Lang . On 26 February 2008 , a press conference for the film was held in Foshan , where it was announced that Wilson Yip would be directing the film , while Yen would appear in the leading role as Ip . Lynn Hung , Lam Ka @-@ tung , Simon Yam were announced to be appearing in supporting roles , while Sammo Hung would serve as the film 's martial arts choreographer . Casting director Zhang Yan Bin spent three months casting actors in various roles for the film . He had completed casting during principal photography in March 2008 . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography for Ip Man began in March 2008 , and was completed by the end of August . A majority of the film focuses on events surrounding Ip Man that took place in Foshan in the 1930s and 1940s during the Sino @-@ Japanese War . Since the buildings in modern @-@ day Foshan are architecturally different from the ones of the film 's period , the filmmakers decided to shoot the film in Shanghai . 
 Filming first took place in a storeroom in the industrial district of Shanghai . Having difficulties scouting a cotton factory suitable for shooting , set designers decided to recreate one in the style of the 1930s . They spent weeks transforming an abandoned storeroom into the Zhen Hua Cotton Mill Factory , a 1930s cotton mill factory founded by Ip 's friend Chow Ching @-@ chuen ( played in the film by Simon Yam ) during the Sino @-@ Japanese War . It was where Ip Man first taught Wing Chun openly to the public . 
 Production designer Kenneth Mak included Western elements in his design , since Foshan , in earlier years , was a unique place where Chinese and Western cultures converged . Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts , and Western lighting , chairs and tableware were also used . To convey the culture and feel of the time , the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out . Apart from historical references , Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film . 
 = = = Stunts and choreography = = = 
 The martial arts choreography was designed by Sammo Hung and veteran fight and stunt coordinator Tony Leung Siu @-@ hung . Hung had previously collaborated with Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen as an actor in the 2005 film SPL : Sha Po Lang . He was hired as the choreographer mainly because of his experience on the 1978 film Warriors Two and 1982 's The Prodigal Son , both of which involved Wing Chun . When asked how he would work with Yen to direct the action scenes , Hung replied matter @-@ of @-@ factly , " With my mouth . " 
 Yen described the role as the most emotionally and mentally difficult in his career . He spent months preparing for the role by going on a strict diet which consisted of eating one meal a day , training in Wing Chun , and learning more about Ip Man through his two sons . This was all in the hopes of portraying an erudite and cultured Ip Man , as well as bringing out the special traits of Wing Chun . Yen even went as far as to stay in character after filming , wearing his costume and changing his voice and movement patterns . While rehearsing a fight scene , Yen was reportedly injured when an axe wielder accidentally slashed the side of his left eye . Yen also had a masseur on set as he could not raise his right shoulder due to an injury . 
 Japanese actor Hiroyuki Ikeuchi , who holds a black belt in Judo , found it " difficult " working under Hung 's command . In one scene , he suffered a mild concussion after receiving four consecutive blows . Hung later praised Yen and Ikeuchi 's performances in the film , even though Ikeuchi was not trained in Chinese martial arts and was not given a lot of complex moves .

 Ip Man 's original title was controversial . It was disputed when film director Wong Kar @-@ wai announced plans to make his own Ip Man film with Tony Leung Chiu @-@ wai while filming 2046 . Wong had planned his own Ip Man biopic titled The Great Master ( <unk> ) , with Leung playing the role of Ip . Wong 's film , however , had been in development hell , having been announced several years earlier . Producer Raymond Wong wanted to name his film Grandmaster Yip Man , which bore a resemblance to the title Wong Kar @-@ wai wanted to use for his film . 
 To settle the dispute , Raymond Wong publicly retracted the film title , stating " Actually , all along , we have called our film Ip Man , but our mainland investors said that Yip Man was a great master of his times , so we changed our title to Grandmaster Yip Man out of respect for him . " In a more recent interview , Raymond Wong revealed that The Great Master is currently in development .

 Prior to its theatrical release in China , Ip Man held a test screening in Beijing on 4 December 2008 . The film was highly praised , based on survey sheets returned by the audience . Donnie Yen 's portrayal of Ip Man was repeatedly hailed as the year 's best performance . High praise was also given to the film 's co @-@ stars , Fan Siu @-@ wong , Lam Ka @-@ tung , and Lynn Hung . Ip Man also received positive reactions from film critics . Salon 's Andrew O 'Hehir deemed Ip Man a " well @-@ paced and satisfying piece of Chinese @-@ nationalist pulp , " referring to the film 's heavy anti @-@ Japanese sentiment . 
 Derek Elley of Variety Magazine wrote in his review , " Yen , who 's taking on real star charisma in middle age , is aces as Ip , with a simple dignity that exactly mirrors the movie 's own and a gracefulness in combat that 's very different from his trademark whiplash style . " Malaysian film critic Lim Chang <unk> of The Malay Mail awarded the film three stars out of four , writing that the film was " nicely balanced with great martial arts action and an engaging narrative . " Lim later placed the film at number six in his list of " Top Ten Movies of 2008 . " Jen Ogilvie of Fortean Times wrote , " what carries Ip Man is its dramatic charge : it is the story 's entanglement in the real horrors of Japanese occupation that pulls the viewer in and builds tension into the fight scenes . " 
 = = = = Fact and fiction = = = = 
 The film was never meant to be a true biographical film to Ip Man 's life , but to broadly touch on the elements from his life . Most of the central turns of the plot are there only for the purpose of making a movie more exciting , including the scenes depicting duels between Ip Man and the Japanese , including Consul General Miura Yoshiaki ( <unk> ) , as well as Ip Man encountering hardship during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . 
 Ip Man 's eldest son , Ip Chun , would have preferred the film to be shot on location in Foshan and noted the mansion being more grand than the original .

 Ip Man is the first film in a planned trilogy . Donnie Yen reprised the lead role in the sequel Ip Man 2 , the second feature film based on the life of Ip Man . The film focuses on Ip 's movements in Hong Kong as he attempts to propagate his discipline of Wing Chun martial arts ; at the end it also briefly introduces a young Bruce Lee prior to becoming one of Ip 's most famed disciples . Ip Man 2 was released theatrically in Hong Kong in late April 2010 . Lynn Hung and Fan Siu @-@ wong reprise their supporting roles , while martial arts choreographer Sammo Hung appears as a master of Hung Ga martial arts . 
 Yen expressed his lack of interest in making a third film , feeling that , " Ip Man 2 will incontrovertibly become a classic , bettering the first . " Yen later stated that after Ip Man 2 , he would no longer be involved in a film based on Ip 's life . While both Donnie Yen and Raymond Wong were not keen on making a third Ip Man film , director Wilson Yip expressed interest in making one that would focus on the relationship between Ip and Bruce Lee . While Ip Man 2 very briefly shows Lee as a child , Yip hoped to find a suitable actor to portray Lee as an adult for the third installment . 
 In January 2014 , Variety reported that Ip Man 3 would begin shooting in 2015 with Donnie Yen reprising his role as Ip Man and Wilson Yip returning to direct . The film was initially scheduled for a late 2015 release , but it eventually was released in early 2016 . 
 = Michael Rush ( rower ) = 
 Michael Rush ( 3 January 1844 – 17 December 1922 ) was an Irish Australian sculler noted for his one @-@ on @-@ one competitions against champion opponents , which drew vast crowds of spectators . He attempted to win the World Sculling Championship . 
 Rush arrived in Sydney in 1861 at the age of 16 , an assisted immigrant brought to augment Australia 's mostly agricultural workforce . Rush was a farm labourer , who knew nothing of boats or boating , but within ten years of his arrival in Australia , Rush was Champion Sculler of the Clarence River , as well as a selector , cattle @-@ raiser and butcher . His interest in the sport of rowing dominated Rush 's life , and hampered his prosperity . He repeatedly travelled from his Clarence River home to compete for large money prizes on Sydney 's Parramatta River , neglecting his business affairs . Rush became Champion Sculler of Australia in 1873 , and defended his championship several times , not always successfully . Rush succeeded on a few occasions in having the Championship venue moved from Sydney to the Clarence River , the first to shift the focus of sculling away from the capital city . From 1874 , there was talk of Rush travelling to England to compete for the World Sculling Championship , but this did not eventuate . Instead , Edward Trickett won the World Championship on the Thames in 1876 . Rush and Trickett in 1877 competed on the Parramatta River for the World Championship , but Rush lost this race . 
 Rush was unique in early Australian sculling in that he provided opportunities for others to compete and excel , by organising regattas and other rowing events , though financially he gained little . He raised and raced horses , organised athletic carnivals , and was a generous supporter of charities , churches , and schools . His background as the son of Irish tenant farmers , a class traditionally debarred by law from owning land and hence accumulating wealth , gave Rush little understanding of the management of money . Rush and his wife had fourteen children , and the Rush family lived in grand , if not extravagant style ; most Rush enterprises were financed by mortgages or promissory notes . When the Banks Crash of 1893 came , Rush was not only deeply in debt , he did not even own the house he lived in . 
 Though his finances remained shaky , and his attempts at various business enterprises were unsuccessful , Rush continued to the end of his life to be interested and involved in the sport of rowing and sculling , organising carnivals and umpiring important matches . Rush died on his small farm in Hurstville , in December 1922 . 
 = = Youth and early life = = 
 Rush was the second son of William and Margery Rush née McGrath . He was born and spent his early years on a tenant farm in the <unk> of <unk> , County Tyrone , in the Province of Ulster , in what is now Northern Ireland . The Rushes were cattle @-@ raisers , but their 26 @-@ acre holding was too small to support their family of sons , of whom four have been identified ; there were reputedly ten Rush sons . Rush 's birth @-@ date is given as 3 January 1844 . 
 Seeking employment and better opportunities than their native land offered , Rush and his brother John emigrated in 1860 , arriving in Sydney in February 1861 per Hotspur , as assisted immigrants . The brothers at first worked in Camperdown for their uncle Michael McGrath , a retail ( or ‘ cutting ’ ) butcher , who sponsored their immigration . McGrath 's brother , Thomas McGrath , was a former Champion Sculler of the Colony of New South Wales . 
 Rush then spent some months as a drover in southern New South Wales , while his brother John , taking advantage of the new Crown Lands Act took up a selection on the Lower Clarence River in 1863 . Rush soon joined his brother , at first working for other settlers as a stockman and <unk> . In 1866 , he selected land at Ashby and began business in his own right as a butcher . 
 = = Early rowing matches = = 
 During its early days of settlement , the Lower Clarence district lacked roads ; virtually all communication within the area and with the outside world depended upon water transport . Lower Clarence settlers were by necessity good oarsmen , and several of them became national and even world champion scullers . Rush , who in his prime was over six feet tall and weighed 13 stone , soon distinguished himself as a powerful ' puller ' . He rowed the heavy settlers ’ boats , also known as ' butcher boats ' delivering meat to Clarence River customers . By 1866 , Rush was competing in various regattas regularly held among the riverside settlements of <unk> , Lawrence , <unk> and Rocky Mouth . 
 In 1869 , Rush won the title of Champion of the Clarence from Prospero Coulon . The two men then joined forces as a rowing team and competed at the Anniversary Day Regatta of 26 January 1870 held at Port Jackson . Rush and Coulon contested several events , notably winning the single @-@ scull and pair @-@ oar races , and while the prize money they received was modest , their performances were noted by Sydney rowers who quickly challenged them to private matches for large stakes . Rush and Coulon remained in Sydney for some months after the January regatta , and continued to win as a team . 
 Rush then engaged in a series of one @-@ on @-@ one matches with the scullers William Hickey , the Australian champion , and his brother Richard Hickey . Rush , being unfamiliar with rowing outrigger wager boats , on that occasion failed to win the championship from Hickey , but returned to the Lower Clarence with prize money totalling over £ 700 . 
 = = Business ventures = = 
 Rush set up as a store @-@ keeper in the town of Rocky Mouth ( Maclean ) . He operated a ' floating store ' which was anchored at Chatsworth Island during the sugar @-@ cane harvesting season when hundreds of itinerant labourers moved into the district . His steam launch <unk> Rush was used as a mobile general store , delivering goods to farmers and villagers along the river . Rush also bought several racing boats , importing ‘ riggers ’ from England , as well as ordering them custom @-@ made from local boat @-@ builders . 
 Rush divided his energies between his business ventures and his sculling contests , organising as well as competing in regattas and ' aquatic carnivals ' , so much so , that he never achieved the solid prosperity of other Clarence River commercial pioneers . He added the Criterion Hotel and a string of race @-@ horses to his business ' empire ' at Rocky Mouth . As a former farm @-@ boy from impoverished Ireland , where he might never have owned even a house plot , Rush now purchased many acres of Clarence River land , much of it having little value . Rush 's Irish background of tenant farming gave little understanding of managing capital , property , or conducting a business career . Rush fits an Irish immigrant model offered by historian Patrick O 'Farrell : 
 Too often [ Irish immigrants ] bought extensive tracts of marginal land , just because it was land , and cheap , and their pride was built on quantity ... To the dangers of inexperience and chancy judgement , they added an ingredient which made a recipe for disaster – prodigal generosity . They gave loans at no interest , gave money to unreliable friends and relations , were free and imprudent with credit they could not afford , pursued paths of extravagance when thrift was needed and were careless when caution was called for . [ T ] hey were men with big ideas seeing in the colonies their chance to cut a fine figure and break away from mean Irish lives . 
 = = Major sculling matches = = 
 Rush set his sights on the Australian Sculling Championship , and in February 1873 , won it from William Hickey in a controversial match : many claimed that Hickey ' sold ' the race . Rush insisted that the championship be contested on his home waters of the Clarence River . To make this condition was his right as the holder of a current championship . Rush 's enterprise in arranging for sponsors to provide substantial sums of prizes encouraged Australia 's best scullers to compete . These events drew large crowds of spectators and gamblers to the Clarence River , especially the town of Grafton . Rush helped to organise , and took part in , aquatic contests held Grafton in 1874 , and 1875 Two of these were held in conjunction with Grafton 's celebration of the Queen 's Birthday . Rush also organised an Intercolonial Regatta , held at Grafton 7 October 1874 at which he successfully defended his championship . However , at the Queen 's Birthday regatta of 1875 , Rush , who was ill , lost the race to Elias C. Laycock . 
 = = = World Sculling Championship = = = 
 Edward ' Ned ' Trickett sought to win the Australian Championship from Rush . Trickett was outclassed by Rush at the 1874 and 1875 events , but afterwards competed at numerous regattas and in private matches , and his form was consistently improving . Trickett and his backers demanded that Rush contest the title on the Parramatta River where he won it from Hickey . Rush declined to row anywhere but on the Clarence River , and demanded that the stakes be not less than £ 500 . By 1875 , Rush had a wife and five children to support , as well as many business commitments , and could not afford to undertake a sporting endeavour involving a major investment in time and money , unless there was a chance of an adequate financial return . Dozens of letters and articles in the Australian press debated the issue for nearly two years , as Trickett and his supporters became increasingly incensed at Rush 's stalling . Finally , former champion sculler and now a prosperous publican and backer of sculling events , offered to finance an attempt by an Australian sculler to topple the current holder of the World Sculling Championship , Englishman Joseph Sadler . Rush declined to travel to London . Trickett agreed to the journey , went to the Thames , beat Sadler , and brought home the World Championship to Australia . Rush challenged Trickett for the World title . Trickett demanded that the race be rowed on the Parramatta River , and the match came off on the afternoon of 30 June 1877 . 
 The Rush vs. Trickett match attracted the largest number of spectators ever before gathered at a Sydney sporting event , and the event is part of Australian sporting history . Estimates of the size of the crowd range from 30 @,@ 000 to 70 @,@ 000 . Shops and government offices closed for the event , special trains brought people into the city . Steam @-@ ships carrying spectators accompanied the competing champions , and hundreds of smaller , private vessels crowded the river . Special Regulations were published by the Marine Board of the NSW Government to deal with the problems of regulating maritime traffic during the event . 
 Rush was soundly beaten , Trickett winning by several lengths . A combination of factors led to Rush 's defeat . Trickett had won a World Championship , at an international venue , and he brought home to Australia the polish and self @-@ confidence that arose from this experience . Trickett trained on the Thames , the home of championship sculling , by expert coaches including Harry Kelley . Rush , though trained by the ex @-@ champion Richard Green , remained in effect an amateur , largely self @-@ taught . Rush invented his own sculling technique , based on sheer strength and endurance ; his style was often deprecated . Trickett was three inches taller than Rush , and had a longer reach . Finally , Trickett learned on the Thames to use racing @-@ craft fitted with a sliding seat , which allowed a more efficient use of the sculler 's whole body when rowing . Before the race , Rush tried a sliding seat racing @-@ shell , but could not discover any advantage , and chose instead to row a fixed @-@ seat outrigger . Once the news of Rush 's decision became public , betting odds changed dramatically , favouring Trickett , and the result of the race was considered almost a foregone conclusion . Still , Rush was known as an honest sportsman and was expected to put up a mighty effort to beat Trickett . And so he did , but without success . 
 The celebrations following the match recalled Trickett 's return from his London victory in November 1876 . The commercial exploitation of the event had been considerable , and thousands of pounds changed hands in wagers , but Trickett and Rush were out of pocket afterwards , Trickett claiming to be considerably so . The stakes were only £ 200 , and expenses such as training , accommodation , advertising , new boats and incidentals made professional sculling an expensive business , as Rush argued beforehand . Trickett claimed a considerable shortfall in gate money from spectator ships , and a public benefit concert was held for him by actor George Darrell . Others spoke up for Rush as a major financial loser from his endeavour . 
 Most histories of professional Australian sculling commence with this event . By 1877 , Australia had a vigorous interest in sport , and a class of professional athletes was emerging . Far from defeating him , the match of 30 June 1877 gave Rush new energy . After a year or two of retirement , he began to train and compete , mastering the sliding seat . He regained his Australian Championship in September 1881 . 
 = = = Rush vs Laycock = = = 
 Elias C. Laycock was his ' chief rival ' . Just a year younger than Rush , and like him , a large and powerful man , Laycock came to live on the Lower Clarence River around 1874 . The two scullers met first at the Queen 's Birthday regatta in Grafton in May 1874 . Laycock , untried at boat racing , was beaten , though undeterred . During the following years , Laycock challenged Rush and others to sculling matches , until in April 1879 , he beat World Champion Trickett at a State regatta . A series of matches followed to determine the current Australian sculling Champion , who would defend the World Title . Laycock beat Rush again and again , but Trickett eventually beat Laycock . Trickett once more went to the Thames to row against Ned <unk> , but these preliminary contests in Sydney marked the end of Rush 's World Championship ambitions .

 In April 1881 , Mason , Brothers offered a cash prize of £ 300 , to be known as the Walker Whiskey Trophy . The cash prizes attracted so many entrants that a series of preliminary heats was held during September 1881 . Rush took part , but was eliminated from the final race . Rush also rowed a number of private matches at this time , notably against J. J. Power , Harry Pearce , both of whom he beat , and Elias Laycock . The match against Laycock was for the Championship of Australia , which Laycock won with ease . Rush announced his retirement from sculling contests , not for the first or the last time .

 Francis Punch was a younger brother of sculler , publican and promoter James ' Jem ' Punch . Following the death of James , Francis bought Punch 's Hotel .

Rush won not only the Punch Trophy but regained the Australian Championship .

 Following his defeat in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events , a number of Rush 's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour , at which they presented him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set , salver , and claret jug , valued at £ 200 . These recognised his excellence as a sportsman , and his admirable qualities as a man . The salver was inscribed with a dedication , and each piece bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at the oars of an outrigger skiff . The silver items are now in the collection of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton , New South Wales . 
 = = = His last row = = = 
 Business and family commitments kept Rush busy for the next few years . He moved his home up @-@ river from Maclean to Grafton , the effective ' capital ' of the Clarence River district . Rush purchased a hotel and an adjacent store , and a riverside villa which he named ' Clarence House ' . Rush took an active part in a great many community and sporting organisations . He was a founder of the Grafton Rowing Club and was several times an office @-@ holder of the Clarence River Jockey Club . He continued to promote and take part in local regattas . One of these was the Clarence River Aquatic Carnival , held on 10 March 1883 . The Carnival attracted thousands of spectators . The main event was Rush vs Laycock for a stake of £ 1000 and the Championship of Australia , which Laycock won convincingly . At a banquet later that week , Rush announced his retirement from professional sculling , but in December of that year , he rowed Trickett on the Parramatta River for a stake of £ 400 , and lost convincingly . The newspapers praised Rush for his valour , but hinted that it was high time he retired . 
 Rush organised an Aquatic Carnival at Grafton , held on 2 January 1888 , as part of the national celebrations marking the centenary of European settlement in Australia . The event attracted many up @-@ and @-@ coming scullers , including future World Champion Henry Searle , and even Ned <unk> , who declined to compete due to illness , though he gave an exhibition of ' trick ' sculling . Rush rowed his last professional match on this occasion , as a member of a pair @-@ oar crew . 
 = = Later life and career = = 
 Rush remained interested and involved in the sport of sculling . He was in demand as a race official , for example , as a umpire or timekeeper , though he did little coaching . 
 In 1893 , Rush moved his family to Sydney . The Banks Crash reduced many Australian businessmen to ruin , Rush included . His business was built on credit alone : Rush did not even own the Grafton house where he and his family lived , having mortgaged it from the man who sold it to him . He borrowed from local banks , using his store @-@ keeping business as security . In Sydney , Rush took a lease on the York Hotel , at the corner of King and York Streets , which quickly became known as ' Mick Rush 's Hotel ' , a popular venue for meetings of sportsmen . During the next decade , Rush kept several hotels in the city of Sydney , and operated also as a hotel broker . 
 Rush organised two major Sydney sculling events , held on the Parramatta River . The first was in August 1906 which included a Veterans ' Race , and a Ladies ' Double Sculling Championship . The Veterans ' Race included many old sculling champions , with the exception of Trickett who had retired from sporting activity . In 1907 , Rush organised an even more ambitious event , ' Rush 's Rowing Carnival ' , held in February 1907 @.@ with a Veteran 's Event , and an ' All Comers ' Handicap ' offering a prize of £ 50 . Rush hoped to ' resuscitate an interest in rowing . ' The Carnival attracted several promising scullers , including future champions Richard <unk> and Peter Kemp , but spectator attendance was ' very small ' . Rush 's last recorded participation in a major sculling event was as umpire of the World Championship match between William Webb and Charles Towns held 3 August 1907 , over the Parramatta course . 
 = = Appearance and character = = 
 Rush was a tall , well @-@ built and powerful man . He was described many times in Australia 's colonial press , his ' form ' being of interest to sports fans . Journalists commented repeatedly on Rush 's open and honest manner – ' the genial Mick Rush ' – and his honourable conduct in the world of professional sculling , which earned a reputation for dishonesty . He possessed a strong social conscience , and was involved with many community and charitable projects . Some years after his death , a Grafton resident wrote , ‘ Mick Rush was the best @-@ hearted Irishman who ever broke bread , and helped many a poor beggar irrespective of colour or creed , and may his descendants follow in his footsteps . ’

 Rush married Anne <unk> ( known as Annie ) Fitzpatrick on 18 September 1865 , at St Mary 's Cathedral , Sydney . Annie Fitzpatrick , born 1846 , was the daughter of Irish ex @-@ convicts . She bore Rush fourteen children , three of whom died in infancy and two in early adulthood . None of Rush 's children became professional sportsmen , though three of his sons competed successfully in various amateur sculling contests and one as a cyclist . His daughter Emily was a well @-@ known amateur singer during her youth . Two Rush sons fought in the Boer War , another went gold @-@ prospecting on the Kalgoorlie gold @-@ fields , and died there . Rush retired around 1913 , to a cottage and ten acres of land in Hurstville , New South Wales . He died there on 22 December 1922 , after a brief illness .

 = William Sterndale Bennett = 
 Sir William Sterndale Bennett ( 13 April 1816 – 1 February 1875 ) was an English composer , pianist , conductor and music educator . At the age of ten Bennett was admitted to the London Royal Academy of Music ( RAM ) , where he remained for ten years . By the age of twenty , he had begun to make a reputation as a concert pianist , and his compositions received high praise . Among those impressed by Bennett was the German composer Felix Mendelssohn , who invited him to Leipzig . There Bennett became friendly with Robert Schumann , who shared Mendelssohn 's admiration for his compositions . Bennett spent three winters composing and performing in Leipzig . 
 In 1837 Bennett began to teach at the RAM , with which he was associated for most of the rest of his life . For twenty years he taught there , later also teaching at Queen 's College , London . Amongst his pupils during this period were Arthur Sullivan , Hubert Parry , and Tobias Matthay . Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little , although he performed as a pianist and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years . He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music . From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism between himself and the conductor Michael Costa . 
 In 1858 Bennett returned to composition , but his later works , though popular , were considered old @-@ fashioned and did not arouse as much critical enthusiasm as his youthful compositions had done . He was Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge from 1856 to 1866 . In that year he became Principal of the RAM , rescuing it from closure , and remained in this position until his death . He was knighted in 1871 . He died in London in 1875 and was buried in Westminster Abbey . 
 Bennett had a significant influence on English music , not solely as a composer but also as a teacher , as a promoter of standards of musical education and as an important figure in London concert life . In recent years , appreciation of Bennett 's compositions has been rekindled and a number of his works , including a symphony , his piano concerti , some vocal music and many of his piano compositions , have been recorded . In his bicentenary year of 2016 , several concerts of his music have been planned . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Bennett was born in Sheffield , Yorkshire , the third child and only son of Robert Bennett , the organist of Sheffield parish church , and his wife Elizabeth , née Donn . In addition to his duties as an organist , Robert Bennett was a conductor , composer and piano teacher ; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale , some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music . His mother died in 1818 , aged 27 , and his father , after remarrying , died in 1819 . Thus orphaned at the age of three , Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather , John Bennett , from whom he received his first musical education . John Bennett was a professional bass , who sang as a lay clerk in the ( then unified ) choir of King 's , St John 's and Trinity colleges . The young Bennett had a fine alto voice and entered the choir of King 's College Chapel in February 1824 . In 1826 , at the age of ten , he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music ( RAM ) , which had been founded in 1822 . The examiners were so impressed by the child 's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board . 
 Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years . At his grandfather 's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist , under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury . He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes , and after five years , with his grandfather 's agreement , he took the piano as his principal study . He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition , which he studied under the principal of the RAM , William Crotch , and then under Cipriani Potter , who took over as principal in 1832 . Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison . Bennett did not study singing , but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830 , Bennett , aged fourteen , was cast in the mezzo @-@ soprano role of the page boy Cherubino ( usually played by a woman en travesti ) . This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM . The Observer wryly commented , " of the page ... we will not speak " , but acknowledged that Bennett sang pleasingly and to the satisfaction of the audience . The <unk> , however , called his performance " in every way a blot on the piece " . 
 Among Bennett 's student compositions were a piano concerto ( No. 1 in D minor , Op. 1 ) , a symphony and an overture to The Tempest . The concerto received its public premiere at an orchestral concert in Cambridge on 28 November 1832 , with Bennett as soloist . Performances soon followed in London and , by royal command , at Windsor Castle , where Bennett played in April 1833 for King William IV and Queen Adelaide . The RAM published the concerto at its own expense as a tribute . A further London performance was given in June 1833 . The critic of The <unk> wrote of this concert : 
 [ T ] he most complete and gratifying performance was that of young Bennett , whose composition would have conferred honour on any established master , and his execution of it was really surprising , not merely for its correctness and brilliancy , but for the feeling he manifested , which , if he proceed as he has begun , must in a few years place him very high in his profession . 
 In the audience was Felix Mendelssohn , who was sufficiently impressed to invite Bennett to the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Düsseldorf . Bennett asked , " May I come to be your pupil ? " Mendelssohn replied , " No , no . You must come to be my friend " . 
 In 1834 Bennett was appointed organist of St Ann 's , Wandsworth , London , a chapel of ease to Wandsworth parish church . He held the post for a year , after which he taught private students in central London and at schools in Edmonton and Hendon . Although by common consent the RAM had little more to teach him after his seventh or eighth year , he was permitted to remain as a free boarder there until 1836 , which suited him well , as his income was small . In May 1835 Bennett made his first appearance at the Philharmonic Society of London , playing the premiere of his Second Piano Concerto ( in E @-@ flat major , Op. 4 ) , and in the following year he gave there the premiere of his Third Concerto ( in C minor , Op. 9 ) . Bennett was also a member of the Society of British Musicians , founded in 1834 to promote specifically British musicians and compositions . Davison wrote in 1834 that Bennett 's overture named for Lord Byron 's <unk> was " the best thing that has been played at the Society 's concerts " . 
 = = = Germany : Mendelssohn and Schumann ( 1836 – 42 ) = = = 
 In May 1836 Bennett travelled to Düsseldorf in the company of Davison to attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival for the first performance of Mendelssohn 's oratorio St Paul . Bennett 's visit was enabled by a subsidy by the piano @-@ making firm of John Broadwood & Sons . Inspired by his journey up the Rhine , Bennett began work on his overture The Naiads ( Op. 15 ) . After Bennett left for home , Mendelssohn wrote to their mutual friend , the English organist and composer Thomas Attwood , " I think him the most promising young musician I know , not only in your country but also here , and I am convinced if he does not become a very great musician , it is not God 's will , but his own " . After Bennett 's first visit to Germany there followed three extended visits to work in Leipzig . He was there from October 1836 to June 1837 , during which time he made his debut at the Gewandhaus as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn conducting . He later conducted his Naiads overture . During this visit he also arranged the first cricket match ever played in Germany , ( " as fitting a Yorkshireman " as the musicologist Percy M. Young comments ) . At this time Bennett wrote to Davison : 
 [ Mendelssohn ] took me to his house and gave me the printed score of [ his overture ] ' <unk> ' , and afterwards we <unk> at the ' Hôtel de <unk> ' , where all the musical clique feed ... The party consist [ ed ] of Mendelssohn , [ Ferdinand ] David , <unk> [ sic ] ... and a Mr. Schumann , a musical editor , who expected to see me a fat man with large black whiskers . 
 Bennett had been at first slightly in awe of Mendelssohn , but no such formality ever attached to Bennett 's friendship with Robert Schumann , with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night . Each dedicated a large @-@ scale piano work to the other : in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett , who reciprocated the dedication a few weeks later with his Fantasie , Op. 16 . Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett 's music ; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik , praising amongst other works Bennett 's Op. 10 Musical Sketches for piano , " three of Bennett 's loveliest pictures " . The essay ends : " For some time now he has been peering over my shoulder , and for the second time he has asked ' But what are you writing ? ' Dear friend , I shall write no more than : ' If only you knew ! ' " Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann 's music , which , he told Davison in 1837 , he thought " rather too eccentric " . 
 On Bennett 's return to London he took up a teaching post at the RAM which he held until 1858 . During his second long stay in Germany , from October 1838 to March 1839 , he played his Fourth Piano Concerto ( Op. 19 , in F minor ) and the Wood Nymphs Overture , Op. 20 . Returning to England , he wrote to his Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840 , bemoaning the difference between England and Germany ( and hoping that a German would redress the situation ) : 
 You know what a dreadful place England is for music ; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things , all the people are mad with [ <unk> ] Thalberg and [ Johann ] Strauss [ I ] , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June . I sincerely hope that Prince Albert ... will do something to improve our taste . 
 On Bennett 's third trip , from January to March 1842 , in which he also visited Kassel , Dresden and Berlin , he played his Caprice for piano and orchestra , Op. 22 , in Leipzig . Despite his then @-@ pessimistic view of music in England , Bennett missed his chance to establish himself in Germany . The musicologist Nicholas Temperley writes 
 One might guess that the early loss of both parents produced in Bennett an exceptionally intense need for reassurance and encouragement . England could not provide this for a native composer in his time . He found it temporarily in German musical circles ; yet , when the opportunity came to claim his earned place as a leader in German music , he was not quite bold enough to grasp it . 
 = = = Teacher and conductor ( 1842 – 49 ) = = = 
 Bennett returned to London in March 1842 , and continued his teaching at the RAM . The next year the post of professor of music at the University of Edinburgh became vacant . With Mendelssohn 's strong encouragement Bennett applied for the position . Mendelssohn wrote to the principal of the university , " I beg you to use your powerful influence on behalf of that candidate whom I consider in every respect worthy of the place , a true ornament to his art and his country , and indeed one of the best and most highly gifted musicians now living : Mr. Sterndale Bennett . " Despite this advocacy Bennett 's application was unsuccessful . 
 Bennett had been impressed in Leipzig with the concept of chamber music concerts , which had been , apart from string quartet recitals , a rarity in London . He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including piano trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven , works for piano solo , and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others . Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the piano virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and Frédéric Chopin 's pupil , the 13 @-@ year old Carl <unk> . 
 in 1844 Bennett married Mary Anne Wood ( 1824 – 1862 ) , the daughter of a naval commander . Composition gave way to a ceaseless round of teaching and musical administration . The writer and composer Geoffrey Bush sees the marriage as marking a break in Bennett 's career ; " from 1844 to 1856 [ Bennett ] was a freelance teacher , conductor and concert organiser ; a very occasional pianist and a still more occasional composer . " Clara Schumann noted that Bennett spent too much time giving private lessons to keep up with changing trends in music : " His only chance of learning new music is in the carriage on the way from one lesson to another . " 
 From 1842 Bennett had been a director of the Philharmonic Society of London . He helped to relieve the society 's perilous finances by persuading Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society 's orchestra , attracting full houses and much @-@ needed income . In 1842 the orchestra , under the composer 's baton , gave the London premiere of Mendelssohn 's Third ( Scottish ) Symphony , two months after its world premiere in Leipzig . In 1844 Mendelssohn conducted the last six concerts of the society 's season , in which among his own works and those of many others he included music by Bennett . From 1846 to 1854 the Society 's conductor was Michael Costa , of whom Bennett disapproved ; Costa was too devoted to Italian opera and not a partisan of the German masters , as was Bennett . Bennett wrote to Mendelssohn on 24 July , displaying some <unk> , " The Philharmonic Directors have engaged Costa ... with which I am not very well pleased , but I could not persuade them to the contrary , and am tired of quarrelling with them . They are a worse set this year than we have ever had . " 
 In May 1848 , on the opening of Queen 's College , London , Bennett , as one of the Founding Directors , delivered an inaugural lecture and joined the staff , while continuing his work at the RAM and private teaching . He wrote the thirty Preludes and Lessons , Op. 33 , for his piano students at the college ; they were published in 1853 and remained in widespread use by music students well into the twentieth century . In a profile of Bennett published in 1903 F. G. Edwards noted that Bennett 's duties as a teacher severely reduced his opportunity to compose , although he maintained his reputation as a soloist in annual chamber music and piano recitals at the Hanover Square Rooms , which included chamber music and concerti by Johann Sebastian Bach and Beethoven 's An die <unk> <unk> , " then almost novelties " . Over the years he gave over forty concerts at this venue , and amongst those who took part were the violinists Henri Vieuxtemps and Heinrich Ernst , the pianists Stephen Heller , Ignaz Moscheles and Clara Schumann , and the cellist Carlo Piatti ( for whom Bennett wrote his Sonata Duo ) ; composers represented included — apart from Bennett 's favourite classical masters and Mendelssohn — Domenico Scarlatti , Fanny Mendelssohn and Schumann . 
 As well as the demands of his work as a teacher and pianist , there were other factors that may have contributed to Bennett 's long withdrawal from large @-@ scale composition . Charles Villiers Stanford writes that the death of Mendelssohn in 1847 came to Bennett as " an irreparable loss " . In the following year Bennett severed his hitherto close ties with the Philharmonic Society , which had presented many of his most successful compositions . This break resulted from an initially minor disagreement with Costa over his interpretation at the final rehearsal of Bennett 's overture <unk> . The intransigence of both parties inflated this into a furious row , and began a breach between them which was to last throughout Bennett 's career . Bennett was disgusted at the Society 's failure to back him up , and resigned . 
 = = = Music professional ( 1849 – 66 ) = = = 
 From this point in his life Bennett was ever increasingly involved in the burdens of musical organization . In the opinion of Percy Young , he became " the prototype of the modern administrative musician ... he eventually built for himself an impregnable position , but in doing so destroyed his once considerable creative talent . " Bennett became a victim as well as a beneficiary of a trend towards professionalization in the music industry in Britain ; " The Principal and the Professor became powerful , whereas the status of the composer and the <unk> ( unless foreign ) was implicitly downgraded . " 
 In 1849 Bennett became the founding president of the Bach Society in London , whose early members included Sir George Smart , John Pyke <unk> , William Horsley , Potter and Davison . Under his direction the Society gave the first English performance of Bach 's St Matthew Passion on 6 April 1854 . Further performances of the Passion were given by the Society in 1858 and 1862 , the latter coinciding with the publication of Bennett 's own edition of the work , with a translation of the text into English by his pupil Helen Johnston . 
 In June 1853 Bennett made his last public appearance as a soloist with orchestra in his own Fourth Piano Concerto . This performance was given with a new organization , the Orchestral Union , and followed a snub from Costa , who had refused to conduct the pianist Arabella Goddard ( Davison 's wife ) in Bennett 's Third Concerto at the Philharmonic Society . In the same year Bennett declined an invitation to become the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra . He was greatly tempted by the offer , but felt it his duty to remain in England , as the offer came too late for Bennett to make alternative arrangements for some of his pupils , and he refused to let them down . After the controversial 1855 season of the Philharmonic Society at which Richard Wagner conducted , Bennett was elected to take over the conductorship in 1856 , a post which he held for ten years . At his first concert , on 14 April 1856 , the piano soloist in Beethoven 's Emperor Concerto was Clara Schumann , wife of his old friend . It was her first appearance in England . 
 Bennett 's stewardship of the Philharmonic Society orchestra was not entirely happy , and the historian of the orchestra , Cyril Ehrlich , notes " a sense of drift and decline " . Many leading members of the orchestra were also in the orchestra of the Italian Opera House in London ( and therefore partisans of the displaced Costa ) , and , in addition , Bennett proved unable to resolve personal animosities amongst his leading players . Costa took to arranging schedules for his musicians which made rehearsals ( and sometimes performances ) for the Society impractical . This gave an " impression that [ Bennett ] was capable of exerting only waning authority amongst professionals " . Moreover , comparing London with other centres around the mid @-@ century , Ehrlich notes " Verdi was in Milan , Wagner in Dresden , Meyerbeer in Paris , Brahms in Vienna , and Liszt in Weimar . London had the richest of audiences , and was offered Sterndale Bennett . " He instances the London premiere of Schumann 's Paradise and the Peri in the 1856 season , which , by engaging Jenny Lind as soloist , and with Prince Albert in the audience , brought in a substantial subscription , but was musically disastrous ( and was not helped by the chaos of a seriously overcrowded venue ) . One member of the audience thought Lind 's voice was " worn and strained " and that there would have been " vehement demonstrations of derision had not the audience been restrained in the presence of Royalty " . Newspaper critics were scarcely more complimentary . 
 Temperley writes : " After 1855 [ Bennett ] was spurred by belated honours , and occasional commissions , to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works , though it was too late to recapture his early self @-@ confidence . " Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti ; a pastoral cantata , The May Queen , Op. 39 , for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858 ; an Ode ( Op. 40 ) with words by Alfred , Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London ; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University ( Op. 41 ) with words by Charles Kingsley , which included a lament for the late Prince Albert ; a symphony in G minor ( Op. 43 ) ; a sacred cantata , The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867 ; and finally a second Piano Sonata ( The Maid of Orleans , Op. 46 ) . Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne . The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa , who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett . Eventually it was conducted by Prosper <unk> , between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion . The affair leaked into the press , and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour . 
 In March 1856 Bennett , while still teaching at the RAM and Queen 's College , was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge . He modernised the system of awarding music degrees , instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music . He held the professorship for ten years , relinquishing it in 1866 when he was appointed Principal of the RAM . 
 In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa , when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland , the original founder of the RAM , saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition , to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera , over the heads of the Academy directors . Bennett resigned from the RAM at this overbearing behaviour , and was not to return until 1866 . Towards the end of 1862 Bennett 's wife died after a painful illness . His biographer W. B. Squire suggests that " he never recovered from the effects of Mrs. Bennett 's death , and that henceforward a painful change in him became apparent to his friends . " In 1865 Bennett again visited Leipzig where he was reunited with old friends including Ferdinand David , and his Op. 43 Symphony was performed .

 In 1866 Charles Lucas , the Principal of the RAM , announced his retirement . The position was first offered to Costa , who demanded a higher salary than the directors of the RAM could contemplate , and then to Otto Goldschmidt , who was then professor of piano at the RAM . He declined and urged the directors to appoint Bennett . Lind , who was Goldschmidt 's wife , wrote that Bennett " is certainly the only man in England who ought to raise that institution from its present decay " . 
 Bennett was to find that heading a leading music college was incompatible with a career as a composer . The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous . He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week , teaching composition and arranging class @-@ lists . But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution . The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government , authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer , in 1864 and 1865 . The following year Gladstone was out of office , and the new Chancellor , Disraeli , refused to renew the grant . The directors of the RAM decided to close it , over the head of Bennett as Principal . Bennett , with the support of the faculty and the students , assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors . 
 In Stanford 's words , " As Chairman he succeeded , after the Government had withdrawn its annual grant , in winning it back , restored the financial credit of the house , and during seven years bore the harassing anxiety of complex negotiations with various public bodies of great influence who were discussing schemes for the advance of national musical education . " The schemes referred to were two proposals which would have undoubtedly undermined the viability and influence of the RAM , one to merge it in a proposed National School of Music , backed by the Royal Society of Arts under Henry Cole , the other to relocate it ( without security of tenure ) in the premises of the Royal Albert Hall . 
 The RAM in 1866 was in poor shape in terms of influence and reputation as well as financially . The critic Henry Chorley published data in that year showing that only 17 per cent of orchestral players in Britain had studied there . No alumni of the RAM were members of the orchestra at Covent Garden opera house . Chorley added , " I cannot remember one great instrumental player the Academy has turned out during the last 25 years . " Bennett himself was not entirely in accord with the emphasis Chorley placed on instrumental training for the RAM ; he was concerned ( and with reason ) that such a policy could mean supply <unk> demand for graduates . Bennett himself taught composition at the RAM ; this was undoubtedly where his greatest interests lay at this period , and it appears that the examples he gave to his pupils concentrated on his own ' conservative ' favourites of Mendelssohn , Beethoven and Mozart . Nonetheless , the reputation and popularity of the RAM increased markedly under his stewardship . The number of pupils , which had dropped catastrophically at the time when the directors had proposed closing the institution , rose steadily . At the end of 1868 there had been 66 students . By 1870 the number was 121 , and by 1872 it was 176 . 
 Bennett received honorary degrees from the universities of Cambridge ( 1867 ) and Oxford ( 1870 ) . The Philharmonic Society awarded him its Beethoven gold medal in 1867 . In 1871 he was knighted by Queen Victoria ( two years after his old antagonist Costa had been accorded the same honour ) , and in 1872 he received a public testimonial before a large audience at St James 's Hall , London . The money subscribed at this event founded a scholarship and prize at the RAM , which is still awarded . An English Heritage blue plaque has been placed at the house in 38 Queensborough Terrace , London , where Bennett lived during many of his later years . 
 Bennett died aged 58 on 1 February 1875 at his house in St John 's Wood , London . According to his son the cause was " disease of the brain " ; unable to rise one morning , he had fallen into a decline and died within a week . He was buried on 6 February , close to the tomb of Henry Purcell , in Westminster Abbey . The a cappella quartet , God is a Spirit , from his cantata The Woman of Samaria , was sung to accompany the obsequies . The first concert of the Philharmonic Society 's season , on March 18 , began with a tribute to its sometime conductor : pieces from his unfinished music for Sophocles 's tragedy Ajax , and the complete The Woman of Samaria , for which the choir was provided by the RAM . These were followed by Mendelssohn 's Violin Concerto , for which the soloist was Joseph Joachim , to whom Mendelssohn had introduced Bennett at Joachim 's London debut in 1844 . The final concert of the season ( 5 July ) included an Idyll in memory of Bennett composed by his old associate George Alexander Macfarren .

 Bennett 's son James Robert Sterndale Bennett ( 1847 – 1928 ) wrote a biography of his father . Many of the composer 's descendants became musicians or performers , including his grandsons Robert ( 1880 – 1963 ) , director of music at Uppingham School , Rutland ; Tom ( T.C. ) ( 1882 – 1944 ) , composer and singer , whose daughter Joan Sterndale @-@ Bennett ( 1914 – 1996 ) was a well known West End actress ; and Ernest Sterndale Bennett ( 1884 – 1982 ) , a theatre director in Canada .
