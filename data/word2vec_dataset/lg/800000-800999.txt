 = = = National politics = = = 
 Oklahoma has been politically conservative for much of its history , especially recently . During the first half century of statehood , it was considered a Democratic stronghold , being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections ( 1920 and 1928 ) . During this time , it was also carried by every winning Democratic candidate up to Harry Truman . However , Oklahoma Democrats were generally considered to be more conservative than Democrats in other states . 
 After the 1948 election , the state turned firmly Republican . Although registered Republicans were a minority in the state until 2015 , starting in 1952 , Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election ( 1964 ) . This is not to say that every election has been a landslide for Republicans : Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1 @.@ 5 % in 1976 , while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40 % or more of the state 's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively . Al Gore in 2000 , though , was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state . Oklahoma was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in both 2008 and 2012 . 
 Generally , Republicans are strongest in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and their suburbs , as well as the Panhandle . Democrats are strongest in the eastern part of the state and Little Dixie , as well as the most heavily African American parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa . With a population of 8 @.@ 6 % Native American in the state , it is also worth noting that most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans . 
 Following the 2000 census , the Oklahoma delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives was reduced from six to five representatives , each serving one congressional district . For the 112th Congress ( 2011 – 2013 ) , there were no changes in party strength , and the delegation included four Republicans and one Democrat .

At Pekin , a community situated between Sanborn and NY 104 , NY 429 descends the Niagara Escarpment . 
 The Sanborn – Ridge Road segment of modern NY 429 was originally designated as part of Route 30 , an unsigned legislative route , in 1908 . In the mid @-@ 1920s , the portion of Route 30 west of Rochester became part of the signed NY 31 ; however , NY 31 was realigned in the late 1920s to follow Ridge Road west from Cambria to the village of Lewiston . NY 31 's former alignment from Niagara Falls to Ridge Road via Sanborn became New York State Route 31A at this time . NY 31A was eliminated c . 1935 as part of the establishment of U.S. Route 104 ( US 104 ) . The portion of its former routing north of Sanborn became part of the new NY 429 , which was assigned to its current alignment upon assignment . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 429 begins on the banks of the Niagara River at a junction with NY 265 and NY 384 in downtown North Tonawanda . The route heads east as Wheatfield Street , crossing the CSX Transportation @-@ owned Niagara Subdivision at a grade crossing that separates an industrialized block of the street from more residential sections to the east . After three blocks , NY 429 turns onto Oliver Street and follows it northwestward through residential and industrial portions of the city , paralleling NY 265 and NY 384 for 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to a junction with Ward Road . Oliver Street and Ward Road merge here , and the combined street takes on the Ward Road name as it proceeds due northward through the solely residential northern portion of North Tonawanda . NY 429 exits the city near a junction with <unk> Road , at which point maintenance of the route shifts from the city to the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) . 
 Now in the town of Wheatfield , NY 429 heads across populated but less developed areas on its way to a junction with US 62 . North of this point , the closely spaced homes gradually give way to more isolated houses and , eventually , rural farmland . It continues on a north – south line to the town of Lewiston and the hamlet of Sanborn , located adjacent to the Lewiston – Cambria town line . In the small but developed community , NY 429 follows Buffalo Street past three blocks of homes to a junction with NY 31 ( Saunders Settlement Road ) . Buffalo Street ends here ; however , NY 429 joins NY 31 for two blocks east to Townline Road , a north – south highway delimiting the boundary between Lewiston and Cambria . NY 429 continues north on Townline Road , passing the sprawling main campus of Niagara County Community College , a stark departure from the rural fields that NY 429 traversed in Wheatfield . 
 Past the college , NY 429 follows the Lewiston – Cambria town line for the rest of its length . In terms of elevation , it reaches a crest of 644 feet ( 196 m ) at Upper Mountain Road in Pekin before it begins to descend the Niagara Escarpment , a beach ridge that further west led to the formation of Niagara Falls eons ago . Here , on clear enough days , a wide panorama can be seen of the entire northern half of the county and Lake Ontario . After descending 100 feet ( 30 m ) , it crosses a narrow plateau containing Lower Mountain Road . Another 150 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) drop follows , and NY 429 ends shortly afterward at a junction with NY 104 ( Ridge Road ) located 392 feet ( 119 m ) above sea level — a 252 @-@ foot ( 77 m ) descent from Pekin . During this final , mostly undeveloped stretch , NY 429 passes the Buffalo Diocese 's Immaculate Conception Catholic Church . 
 = = History = = 
 The portion of modern NY 429 north of Sanborn was originally designated as part of Route 30 , an unsigned legislative route , by the New York State Legislature in 1908 . Route 30 entered Sanborn from the west on what is now NY 31 and followed current NY 429 north to Ridge Road , where it turned east toward Rochester . All of legislative Route 30 west of Rochester became part of NY 31 in the mid @-@ 1920s , while the remainder of what is now NY 429 outside of North Tonawanda was taken over by the state of New York by 1926 . In the late 1920s , NY 31 was realigned between Niagara Falls and the Lewiston – Cambria town line to follow Ridge Road west to the village of Lewiston . Its former routing to Niagara Falls via Sanborn became NY 31A . 
 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the Niagara Falls – Sanborn leg of NY 31A became part of a realigned NY 3 , which had followed modern NY 425 from North Tonawanda to Saunders Settlement Road prior to the renumbering . Despite this fact , NY 31A continued to extend west to Niagara Falls , creating an overlap with the cross @-@ state NY 3 . The overlap remained in place until c . 1935 when US 104 was assigned across Upstate New York . West of Rochester , it replaced NY 31 , which was shifted southward to follow all of NY 3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester . NY 31A , meanwhile , was eliminated and partially replaced with NY 429 , a new route that continued south from Sanborn to North Tonawanda via Ward Road and Oliver and Wheatfield Streets . NY 429 has not been substantially altered since that time .

 = Baćin massacre = 
 The Baćin massacre was the killing of 83 civilians just outside the village of Baćin , near Hrvatska Dubica , committed by Croatian Serb paramilitaries . The killings took place on 21 October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence . Most of the civilians were Croats , but they also included two ethnic Serbs , taken from Hrvatska Dubica , Baćin and the nearby village of Cerovljani . The civilians were killed in the area of Krečane , at the very bank of the Una River , and their bodies were left unburied for two weeks . Most of them were subsequently bulldozed into a shallow mass grave , while a number of the bodies were thrown into the river . 
 The killings followed the takeover of Hrvatska Dubica and its immediate surroundings by the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina ( SAO Krajina ) and the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian Latin : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) following the withdrawal of the Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) in mid @-@ September , when the bulk of the civilian population left the area . The remaining Croat population in the area was either killed or expelled by November . A mass grave containing the bodies of 56 civilians killed in Baćin was uncovered in 1997 , two years after Croatia recaptured the area . The event was included in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) indictment against Slobodan Milošević and the ICTY indictment against Milan Martić . Milošević died before his trial concluded , and Martić was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison . Croatian authorities prosecuted and convicted seven other former SAO Krajina officers and officials in connection with the killings .

 In 1990 , ethnic tensions between Serbs and Croats worsened after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( Croatian : Hrvatska demokratska zajednica – HDZ ) . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian Latin : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin ( approximately 60 kilometres ( 37 miles ) north @-@ east of Split ) , parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia . In January 1991 , Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , unsuccessfully tried to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces . The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though it was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA request was refused on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milošević 's control . By the end of March , the conflict had escalated with the first fatalities . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to amalgamate the areas under their control with Serbia . These were viewed by the Government of Croatia as breakaway regions . 
 At the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . To bolster its defence , Croatia doubled its police numbers to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the Croatian police force was 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police comprising twelve battalions organised along military lines . There were also 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons . In response to the deteriorating situation , the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) in May by expanding the special police battalions into four all @-@ professional guards brigades . Under Ministry of Defence control and commanded by retired JNA General Martin Špegelj , the four guards brigades comprised approximately 8 @,@ 000 troops . The reserve police , also expanded to 40 @,@ 000 , was attached to the ZNG and reorganised into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions . The guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully equipped with small arms ; throughout the ZNG there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was poor command and control structure above the brigade level . The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to using World War II weapons taken from museums and film studios . At the time , the Croatian weapon stockpile consisted of 30 @,@ 000 small arms purchased abroad and 15 @,@ 000 previously owned by the police . To replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades , a new 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police was established .

 By June 1991 , Banovina declared itself a part of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina ( SAO Krajina ) , and the Serb – Croat conflict began to escalate . Clashes peaked in late July , when Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive codenamed Operation Stinger . It was primarily aimed at the Croat @-@ populated villages between Dvor and Hrvatska Kostajnica , and the police station in the town of Glina . The offensive was successful in securing Glina , and prompted the withdrawal of Croat forces from the Una River valley south and west of Hrvatska Kostajnica on 27 July . During the fighting , 12 Croatian policemen and 20 civilians were killed . 
 On 28 July , fighting resumed around Topusko , which was besieged by SAO Krajina forces that day , as well as around Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica . Combat in the area continued into August , and Hrvatska Kostajnica was besieged on 9 September . Three days later , SAO Krajina forces captured a major hill overlooking Hrvatska Kostajnica , prompting local Croatian forces to withdraw . On 13 September , Hrvatska Kostajnica was captured by SAO Krajina forces with JNA support . Approximately 300 Croatian troops retreated from the town or surrendered . The capture of the town was followed by killings , looting and torching of buildings in the town and surrounding villages . A total of 67 Croatian troops were captured in the town and shipped to the jail in Glina , but none arrived . SAO Krajina forces captured Hrvatska Dubica the same day , and Topusko fell on 14 September . On 21 September , Petrinja was captured by SAO Krajina forces and the JNA , denying Croatia an important bridgehead on the south ( right ) bank of the Kupa River . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 On 13 September , after SAO Krajina forces captured Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica , the conflict shifted north , where a new line of control was established south of ZNG @-@ controlled Sunja and Novska . Daily skirmishes continued there . After the ZNG pulled out of Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica , a substantial number of civilians left the area as well , leaving only about 120 Croat civilians in the two towns and the surrounding villages . About half of these stayed behind in Hrvatska Dubica , where looting and torching of houses owned by Croats or Serbs who had previously fled the town continued until mid @-@ October . Most of the civilians who stayed in their homes were elderly or women . 
 Armed Serbs burnt Croat @-@ owned houses in the village of Cerovljani , just to the north of Hrvatska Dubica , on 13 September and once more on 21 September . Three days later , the gunmen returned and after some shooting , three civilians were found dead and four more houses were torched in the village . The same day , the Catholic church bell tower was shot at using rocket @-@ propelled grenades . In October , the armed Serbs gathered ten out of eleven remaining Cerovljani residents in the village 's community centre , telling them they were to take part in a meeting . Instead , they were detained for the night and shipped away the next day to the Krečane area next to the village of Baćin , just to the west of Hrvatska Dubica and killed there . Approximately 30 elderly civilians remained in Baćin after SAO Krajina forces captured the village . All of them were taken to Krečane and killed in October as well , except for three men who were detained and killed in Hrvatska Dubica . 
 On the morning of 20 October , SAO Krajina police picked up 53 civilians in Hrvatska Dubica . Most of them were Croats , but there were several Serbs and Muslims by nationality . They were told they were being taken to a meeting , but they were detained under armed guard in the town 's fire station . During the day , eleven people escaped or were released , either because they were Serbs or because they had Serb relatives . On 21 October , SAO Krajina forces moved 43 detainees from Hrvatska Dubica . The detainees were placed on a bus and told that they would be taken to Glina and released in a prisoner exchange . However the group , all of them Croats except for two Serbs , were taken to Krečane and killed . In the same period , an additional 24 civilians from villages around Hrvatska Dubica were killed by Serb forces at unknown locations . 
 The bodies of those killed at Krečane were left unburied for two weeks . Some of the victims were not immediately killed , rather they took days to die and people living on the opposite bank of the Una River in Bosnia and Herzegovina claim that they heard cries for help for days after the killings took place . After two weeks , most of the bodies were bulldozed into a shallow grave on the bank of the river , and the rest thrown into the Una . The grave was located sufficiently close to the river to allow the current to wash at least some of the bodies away . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 All surviving Croat civilians were expelled from the area of Hrvatska Dubica on 20 November . At least 118 Croat and other non @-@ Serb civilians were killed in Baćin and its vicinity by February 1992 . By 1995 , numerous Croat @-@ owned houses in Hrvatska Dubica , all Croat @-@ owned houses in Cerovljani and about half the Croat @-@ owned houses in Baćin were torched , dynamited or otherwise destroyed . The Catholic churches in Hrvatska Dubica , Cerovljani and Baćin were destroyed , and the foundations of the church destroyed in Hrvatska Dubica were completely removed . 
 The mass grave at Krečane near Baćin was discovered in 1997 , two years after Croatian authorities recaptured the area in Operation Storm . The mass grave contained 56 bodies , 36 of which were identified . The remaining twenty were buried in a common grave at the Catholic cemetery in Hrvatska Dubica . 
 The killings of the civilians taken from Hrvatska Dubica , Cerovljani and Baćin were included in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) trial of Milan Martić , and the trial of Slobodan Milošević . Martić , who coordinated the combat activities of SAO Krajina forces and the JNA with Colonel Dušan <unk> , the security head of the JNA 10th ( Zagreb ) Corps in the area of Hrvatska Kostajnica , was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for his role in an ethnic cleansing campaign against non @-@ Serbs in Croatia . The judgment identified 83 civilians — the 43 taken from Hrvatska Dubica , 10 from Cerovljani and approximately 30 from Baćin who were killed at <unk> on or about 21 October 1991 . Milošević died in custody in March 2006 before a verdict could be reached . 
 Croatian authorities prosecuted in absentia and convicted seven Croatian Serbs for killing of at least 75 persons in the Baćin massacre in 2013 . Commanding officer of SAO Krajina TO in Dubica <unk> <unk> , commander of SAO Krajina police in Dubica Momčilo Kovačević and two of their subordinates , Stevo <unk> and Veljko <unk> were sentenced to 20 years in prison each , and Stevan <unk> was sentenced to 15 years in prison for organizing detention of the civilians and participation in their execution near Baćin . Head of the SAO Krajina civilian authorities in Dubica , Branko <unk> and the commander of SAO Krajina TO in Kostajnica , Slobodan Borojević , were sentenced to 15 years in prison each under the command responsibility for failing to prevent or punish the crime . 
 = Buffalo nickel = 
 The Buffalo nickel or Indian Head nickel was a copper @-@ nickel five @-@ cent piece struck by the United States Mint from 1913 to 1938 . It was designed by sculptor James Earle Fraser . 
 As part of a drive to beautify the coinage , five denominations of US coins had received new designs between 1907 and 1909 . In 1911 , Taft administration officials decided to replace Charles E. Barber 's Liberty Head design for the nickel , and commissioned Fraser to do the work . They were impressed by Fraser 's designs showing a Native American and an American bison . The designs were approved in 1912 , but were delayed several months because of objections from the Hobbs Manufacturing Company , which made mechanisms to detect slugs in nickel @-@ operated machines . The company was not satisfied by changes made in the coin by Fraser , and in February 1913 , Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh decided to issue the coins despite the objections . 
 Despite attempts by the Mint to adjust the design , the coins proved to strike indistinctly , and to be subject to wear — the dates were easily worn away in circulation . In 1938 , after the expiration of the minimum 25 @-@ year period during which the design could not be replaced without congressional authorization , it was replaced by the Jefferson nickel , designed by Felix Schlag . Fraser 's design is admired today , and has been used on commemorative coins and gold bullion pieces . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1883 , the Liberty Head nickel was issued , featuring designs by Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber . After the coin was released , it was modified to add the word " CENTS " to the reverse because the similarity in size with the half eagle allowed criminals to gild the new nickels and pass them as five dollar coins . An Act of Congress , passed into law on September 26 , 1890 required that coinage designs not be changed until they had been in use 25 years , unless Congress authorized the change . The act made the current five @-@ cent piece and silver dollar exceptions to the twenty @-@ five year rule ; they were made eligible for immediate redesign . However , the Mint continued to strike the Liberty Head nickel in large numbers through the first decade of the 20th century . 
 President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 expressed his dissatisfaction with the artistic state of the American coinage , and hoped to hire sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens to redesign all the coins . Constrained by the 1890 act , the Mint only hired Saint @-@ Gaudens to redesign the cent and the four gold pieces . Saint @-@ Gaudens , before his 1907 death , designed the eagle and double eagle , which entered circulation that year ; the cent , quarter eagle , and half eagle were designed by other artists and released into circulation by 1909 . By that time , the Liberty Head nickel had been in circulation for more than 25 years , and was eligible for redesign regardless of the special provision . In 1909 , Mint Director Frank Leach instructed Barber to make pattern coins for new nickels . Most of these coins featured the first president , George Washington . The press found out about the pieces , and speculated they would be released into circulation by the end of the year . The Mint received orders from banks in anticipation of the " Washington nickel " . However , the project was discontinued when Leach left office on November 1 , 1909 , to be replaced by Abram Andrew . 
 Andrew was dissatisfied with the just @-@ issued Lincoln cent , and considered seeking congressional authorization to replace the cent with a design by sculptor James Earle Fraser . While the change in the cent did not occur , according to numismatic historian Roger Burdette , " Fraser 's enthusiasm eventually led to adoption of the Buffalo nickel in December 1912 " .

 On May 4 , 1911 , Eames MacVeagh , son of Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh wrote to his father : 
 A little matter that seems to have been overlooked by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration , and it seems to me that it would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort . As possibly you are aware , it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration , as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty @-@ five years . I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation . 
 Soon after the MacVeagh letter , Andrew announced that the Mint would be soliciting new designs for the nickel . Fraser , who had been an assistant to Saint @-@ Gaudens , approached the Mint , and rapidly produced concepts and designs . The new Mint director , George Roberts , who had replaced Andrew , initially favored a design featuring assassinated President Abraham Lincoln , but Fraser soon developed a design featuring a Native American on one side and a bison on the other . Andrew and Roberts recommended Fraser to MacVeagh , and in July 1911 , the Secretary approved hiring Fraser to design a new nickel . Official approval was slow in coming ; it was not until January 1912 that MacVeagh asked Roberts to inform Fraser that he had been commissioned . MacVeagh wrote , " Tell him that of the three sketches which he submitted we would like to use the sketch of the head of the Indian and the sketch of the buffalo . " Roberts transmitted the news , then followed up with a long list of instructions to the sculptor , in which he noted , " The motto , ' In God We Trust ' , is not required upon this coin and I presume we are agreed that nothing should be upon it that is not required . " Fraser completed the models by June 1912 , and prepared coin @-@ size electrotypes . He brought the models and electrotypes to Washington on July 10 , where they met with the enthusiastic agreement of Secretary MacVeagh . 
 = = = Hobbs affair = = = 
 In July 1912 , word of the new design became publicly known , and coin @-@ operated machine manufacturers sought information . Replying to the inquiries , MacVeagh wrote that there would be no change in the diameter , thickness , or weight of the nickel . This satisfied most firms . However , Clarence Hobbs of the Hobbs Manufacturing Company , of Worcester , Massachusetts requested further information . According to Hobbs , his firm was the manufacturer of a device which would detect counterfeit nickels inserted into vending machines with complete accuracy . Discussions continued for most of the rest of 1912 , with Hobbs demanding various changes to the design , to which the artist was reluctant to agree . When in December 1912 , the Hobbs Company submitted a modified design for the nickel , MacVeagh strongly opposed it . On December 18 , Roberts officially approved Fraser 's design , and the sculptor was authorized to complete and perfect the design , after which he would be paid $ 2 @,@ 500 ( US $ 61 @,@ 300 with inflation ) for his work . 
 On January 7 , 1913 , Fraser 's approved design was used to strike experimental pieces ; the sculptor later wrote that he remembered several of the workmen commenting that the new piece struck more easily than the old . Afterwards , Roberts asked Fraser if the Hobbs Company was content with the design . The sculptor told the Mint director that the firm wanted changes made , and Fraser agreed to meet with them further . Over the following two weeks , Fraser worked with George Reith , the Hobbs Company 's mechanic who had invented the anti @-@ slug device , in an attempt to satisfy the firm 's concerns . On January 20 , Fraser wired the Mint from his studio in New York , announcing that he was submitting a modified design , and explained that the delay was " caused by working with inventor until he was satisfied " . The next day , Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis sent Roberts a sample striking of the revised design , stating , " the only change is in the border , which has been made round and true " . 
 Despite the apparent agreement , the Hobbs Company continued to interpose objections . Engraver Barber was asked for his view ; he stated that Reith , who had attended the trial striking , had been given all the time and facilities he had asked for in testing the new pieces , and the mechanic had pronounced himself satisfied . Hobbs Company agent C. U. Carpenter suggested that Reith had been intimidated by the preparations that had already gone into the issue of the modified nickel , " and , instead of pointing out clearly just what the situation demanded , agreed to adapt our device to the coin more readily that [ sic ] he was warranted in doing " . On February 3 , Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list of changes that he wanted in the coin , and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs and Reith . On the fifth , following the conference , which ended with no agreement , Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten @-@ page letter , complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company , and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close . MacVeagh agreed to hold a meeting at his office in Washington on February 14 . When the Hobbs Company requested permission to bring a lawyer , Fraser announced he would be doing the same . The Hobbs Company sought letters of support from the business community , with little success ; Fraser 's efforts to secure support from artists for his position were more fruitful . Barber prepared patterns showing what the nickel would look like if the changes demanded by Hobbs were made . MacVeagh conducted the meeting much like a legal hearing , and issued a letter the following day . 
 The Secretary noted that no other firm had complained , that the Hobbs mechanism had not been widely sold , and that the changes demanded — a clear space around the rim and the flattening of the Indian 's cheekbone — would affect the artistic merit of the piece . 
 It is of course true that only the most serious business considerations should stand in the way of the improvement of the coinage , and this particular coin has great claims of its own , because of its special quality . If we should stop new coinage — which is always allowed every twenty @-@ five years — for any commercial obstacles less than imperative , we should have to abandon a worthy coinage altogether . This would be a most serious handicap to the art of the Nation , for scarcely any form of art is more influential than an artistic coin , where the coin is widely circulated . 
 You will please , therefore , proceed with the coinage of the new nickel . 
 After he issued his decision , MacVeagh learned that the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad Company , which Hobbs claimed had enthusiastically received his device , was actually removing it from service as unsatisfactory . The Secretary 's decision did not end the Hobbs Company efforts , as the firm appealed to President Taft . With only two weeks remaining in his term , the President was not minded to stop the new nickel ( production of which had started on February 18 ) and MacVeagh wrote to Taft 's secretary , Charles D. <unk> , " Certainly Hobbs got all the time and attention out of this administration that any administration could afford to give to one manufacturing corporation . " Numismatic historian and coin dealer Q. David Bowers describes the Hobbs matter as " much ado about nothing from a company whose devices did not work well even with the Liberty Head nickels " . 
 = = Release and production = = 
 The first coins to be distributed were given out on February 22 , 1913 , when Taft presided at groundbreaking ceremonies for the National American Indian Memorial at Fort Wadsworth , Staten Island , New York . The memorial , a project of department store magnate Rodman Wanamaker , was never built , and today the site is occupied by an abutment for the Verrazano @-@ Narrows Bridge . Forty nickels were sent by the Mint for the ceremony ; most were distributed to the Native American chiefs who participated . Payment for Fraser 's work was approved on March 3 , 1913 , the final full day of the Taft administration . In addition to the $ 2 @,@ 500 agreed upon , Fraser received $ 666 @.@ 15 ( US $ 15 @,@ 900 with inflation ) for extra work and expenses through February 14 . 
 The coins were officially released to circulation on March 4 , 1913 , and quickly gained positive comments as depicting truly American themes . However , The New York Times stated in an editorial that " The new ' nickel ' is a striking example of what a coin intended for wide circulation should not be ... [ it ] is not pleasing to look at when new and shiny , and will be an abomination when old and dull . " The Numismatist , in March and May 1913 editorials , gave the new coin a lukewarm review , suggesting that the Indian 's head be reduced in size and the bison be eliminated from the reverse . 
 With the coin now in production , Barber monitored the rate at which dies were expended , as it was the responsibility of his Engraver 's Department to supply all three mints with working dies . On March 11 , 1913 , he wrote to Landis that the dies were being used up three times faster than with the Liberty Head nickel . His department was straining to produce enough new dies to meet production . In addition , the date and denomination were the points on the coin most subject to wear , and Landis feared the value on the coin would be worn away . Barber made proposed revisions , which Fraser approved after being sent samples . These changes enlarged the legend " FIVE CENTS " and changed the ground on which the bison stands from a hill to flat ground . According to data compiled by numismatic historian David Lange from the National Archives , the changes to what are known as Type II nickels ( with the originals Type I ) actually decreased the die life . The new Treasury Secretary , William G. McAdoo , wanted further changes in the coin , but Fraser had moved on to other projects and was uninterested in revisiting the nickel . The thickness of the numerals in the date was gradually increased , making them more durable ; however the problem was never addressed with complete success , and even many later @-@ date Buffalo nickels have the date worn away . 
 The Buffalo nickel saw minor changes to the design in 1916 . The word " LIBERTY " was given more emphasis and moved slightly ; however many Denver and San Francisco issues of the 1920s exhibit weak striking of the word , the Denver issue of 1926 especially ; Bowers questions whether any change was made to the portrait of the Indian , though Walter Breen in his reference work on United States coins states that Barber made the Indian 's nose slightly longer . According to Breen , however , none of these modifications helped , with the coin rarely found well @-@ struck and with the design subject to considerable wear throughout the remainder of its run . The bison 's horn and tail also posed striking problems , again with the Denver and San Francisco issues of the 1920s in general , and 1926 @-@ D in particular , showing the greatest propensity for these deficiencies . 
 The piece was struck by the tens of millions , at all three mints ( Philadelphia , Denver and San Francisco ) , through the remainder of the 1910s . In 1921 , a recession began , and no nickels at all were struck the following year . The low mintage for the series was the 1926 @-@ S , at 970 @,@ 000 — the only date @-@ mint combination with a mintage of less than 1 million . The second lowest mintage for the series came with the 1931 nickel struck at the San Francisco Mint . The 1931 @-@ S was minted in a quantity of 194 @,@ 000 early in the year . There was no need for more to be struck , but Acting Mint Director Mary Margaret O 'Reilly asked the San Francisco Mint to strike more so that the pieces would not be hoarded . Using materials on hand , including the melting down of worn @-@ out nickels , San Francisco found enough metal to strike 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 more pieces . Large quantities were saved in the hope they would become valuable , and the coin is not particularly rare today despite the low mintage . 
 A well @-@ known variety in the series is the 1937 – D " three @-@ legged " nickel , on which one of the buffalo 's legs is missing . Breen relates that this variety was caused by a pressman , Mr. Young , at the Denver Mint , who in seeking to remove marks from a reverse die ( caused by the dies making contact with each other ) , accidentally removed or greatly weakened one of the animal 's legs . By the time Mint inspectors discovered and condemned the die , thousands of pieces had been struck and mixed with other coins . 
 Another variety is the 1938 @-@ D / S , caused by dies bearing an " S " mintmark being repunched with a " D " and used to strike coins at Denver . While the actual course of events is uncertain , Bowers is convinced that the variety was created because Buffalo nickel dies intended for the San Francisco mint were repunched with the " D " and sent to Denver so they would not be wasted — no San Francisco Buffalo nickels were struck in 1938 , but they were produced at Denver , and it was already known that a new design would be introduced . The 1938 @-@ D / S was the first repunched mintmark of any US coin to be discovered , causing great excitement among numismatists when the variety came to light in 1962 . 
 When the Buffalo nickel had been in circulation for the minimum 25 years , it was replaced with little discussion or protest . The problems of die life and weak striking had never been solved , and Mint officials advocated its replacement . In January 1938 , the Mint announced an open competition for a new nickel design , to feature early President Thomas Jefferson on the obverse , and Jefferson 's home , Monticello on the reverse . In April , Felix Schlag was announced as the winner . The last Buffalo nickels were struck in April 1938 , at the Denver Mint , the only mint to strike them that year . On October 3 , 1938 , production of the Jefferson nickel began , and they were released into circulation on November 15 .

 In a 1947 radio interview , Fraser discussed his design : 
 Well , when I was asked to do a nickel , I felt I wanted to do something totally American — a coin that could not be mistaken for any other country 's coin . It occurred to me that the buffalo , as part of our western background , was 100 % American , and that our North American Indian fitted into the picture perfectly . 
 The visage of the Indian which dominates Fraser 's obverse design was a composite of several Native Americans . Breen noted ( before the advent of the Sacagawea dollar ) that Fraser 's design was the second and last US coin design to feature a realistic portrait of an Indian , after Bela Pratt 's 1908 design for the half eagle and quarter eagle . 
 The identity of the Indians whom Fraser used as models is somewhat uncertain , as Fraser told various and not always consistent stories during the forty years he lived after designing the nickel . In December 1913 , he wrote to Mint Director Roberts that " [ b ] <unk> the nickel was made I had done several portraits of Indians , among them Iron Tail , Two Moons , and one or two others , and probably got characteristics from those men in the head on the coins , but my purpose was not to make a portrait but a type . " 
 By 1931 , Two Guns White Calf , son of the last Blackfoot tribal chief , was capitalizing off his claim to be the model for the coin . To try to put an end to the claim , Fraser wrote that he had used three Indians for the piece , including " Iron Tail , the best Indian head I can remember . The other one was Two Moons , the other I cannot recall . " In 1938 , Fraser stated that the three Indians had been " Iron Tail , a Sioux , Big Tree , a Kiowa , and Two Moons , a Cheyenne " . Despite the sculptor 's efforts , he ( and the Mint ) continued to receive inquiries about the identity of the Indian model until his 1953 death . 
 Nevertheless , John Big Tree , a Seneca , claimed to be a model for Fraser 's coin , and made many public appearances as the " nickel Indian " until his 1967 death at the age of 92 ( though he sometimes alleged he was over 100 years of age ) . Big Tree was identified as the model for the nickel in wire service reports about his death , and he had appeared in that capacity at the Texas Numismatic Association convention in 1966 . After Big Tree 's death , the Mint stated that he most likely was not one of the models for the nickel . There have been other claimants : in 1964 , Montana Senator Mike Mansfield wrote to Mint Director Eva B. Adams , enquiring if Sam Resurrection , a Choctaw was a model for the nickel . Adams wrote in reply , " According to our records , the portrait is a composite . There have been many claimants for this honor , all of whom are undoubtedly sincere in the belief that theirs is the one that adorns the nickel . " 
 According to Fraser , the animal that appears on the reverse is the American bison Black Diamond . In an interview published in the New York Herald on January 27 , 1913 , Fraser was quoted as saying that the animal , which he did not name , was a " typical and shaggy specimen " which he found at the Bronx Zoo . Fraser later wrote that the model " was not a plains buffalo , but none other than Black Diamond , the <unk> animal in the Bronx Zoo . I stood for hours ... He refused point blank to permit me to get side views of him , and stubbornly showed his front face most of the time . " However , Black Diamond was never at the Bronx Zoo , but instead lived at the Central Park Zoo until he was sold and slaughtered in 1915 . Black Diamond 's mounted head is still extant , and has been exhibited at coin conventions . The placement of Black Diamond 's horns differs considerably from that of the animal on the nickel , leading to doubts that Black Diamond was Fraser 's model . One candidate cited by Bowers is Bronx , a bison who was for many years the herd leader of the bison at the Bronx Zoo . 
 From its inception , the coin was referred to as the " Buffalo nickel " , reflecting the American colloquialism for the North American bison . As the piece is 75 % copper and 25 % nickel , prominent numismatist Stuart Mosher objected to the nomenclature in the 1940s , writing that he was " uncertain why it is called a ' Buffalo nickel ' although the name is preferable to ' Bison copper ' " . The numismatic publication with the greatest circulation , Coin World , calls it an Indian head nickel , while R.S. Yeoman 's Red Book refers to it as an " Indian Head or Buffalo type " . 
 In 2001 , the design was adopted for use on a commemorative silver dollar . In 2006 , the Mint began striking American Buffalo gold bullion pieces , using a modification of Fraser 's Type I design . 
 = Green children of Woolpit = 
 The legend of the green children of Woolpit concerns two children of unusual skin colour who reportedly appeared in the village of Woolpit in Suffolk , England , some time in the 12th century , perhaps during the reign of King Stephen . The children , brother and sister , were of generally normal appearance except for the green colour of their skin . They spoke in an unknown language , and the only food they would eat was beans . Eventually they learned to eat other food and lost their green pallor , but the boy was sickly and died soon after he and his sister were baptised . The girl adjusted to her new life , but she was considered to be " rather loose and wanton in her conduct " . After she learned to speak English , the girl explained that she and her brother had come from Saint Martin 's Land , a subterranean world inhabited by green people . 
 The only near @-@ contemporary accounts are contained in William of Newburgh 's Historia rerum <unk> and Ralph of Coggeshall 's <unk> Anglicanum , written in about 1189 and 1220 respectively . Between then and their rediscovery in the mid @-@ 19th century , the green children seem to surface only in a passing mention in William Camden 's Britannia in 1586 , and in Bishop Francis Godwin 's fantastical The Man in the Moone , in both of which William of Newburgh 's account is cited . 
 Two approaches have dominated explanations of the story of the green children : that it is a folktale describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world , perhaps one beneath our feet or even extraterrestrial , or it is a garbled account of a historical event . The story was praised as an ideal fantasy by the English anarchist poet and critic Herbert Read in his English Prose Style , published in 1931 . It provided the inspiration for his only novel , The Green Child , written in 1934 . 
 = = Story = = 
 One day at harvest time , according to William of Newburgh during the reign of King Stephen ( 1135 – 1154 ) , the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children , a brother and sister , beside one of the wolf pits that gave the village its name . Their skin was green , they spoke an unknown language , and their clothing was unfamiliar . Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne . Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw beans , which they consumed eagerly . The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour . The boy , who appeared to be the younger of the two , became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised . 
 After learning to speak English , the children – Ralph says just the surviving girl – explained that they came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight . William says the children called their home St Martin 's Land ; Ralph adds that everything there was green . According to William , the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit ; they had been herding their father 's cattle when they heard a loud noise ( according to William , the bells of Bury St Edmunds ) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found . Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and , after being guided by the sound of bells , eventually emerged into our land . 
 According to Ralph , the girl was employed for many years as a servant in Richard de Calne 's household , where she was considered to be " very wanton and impudent " . William says that she eventually married a man from King 's Lynn , about 40 miles ( 64 km ) from Woolpit , where she was still living shortly before he wrote . Based on his research into Richard de Calne 's family history , the astronomer and writer Duncan Lunan has concluded that the girl was given the name " Agnes " and that she married a royal official named Richard Barre . 
 = = Explanations = = 
 Neither Ralph of Coggeshall nor William of Newburgh offer an explanation for the " strange and prodigious " event , as William calls it , and some modern historians have the same reticence : " I consider the process of worrying over the suggestive details of these wonderfully pointless miracles in an effort to find natural or psychological explanations of what ' really , ' if anything , happened , to be useless to the study of William of Newburgh or , for that matter , of the Middle Ages " , says Nancy Partner , author of a study of 12th @-@ century historiography . Nonetheless , such explanations continue to be sought and two approaches have dominated explanations of the mystery of the green children . The first is that the narrative descends from folklore , describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of a " fairy Otherworld " . In a few early as well as modern readings , this other world is extraterrestrial , and the green children alien beings . The second is that it is a garbled account of a real event , although it is impossible to be certain whether the story as recorded is an authentic report given by the children or an " adult invention " . His study of accounts of children and servants fleeing from their masters led Charles Oman to conclude that " there is clearly some mystery behind it all [ the story of the green children ] , some story of drugging and kidnapping " . Jeffrey Jerome Cohen offers a different kind of historical explanation , arguing that the story is an oblique account of the racial difference between the contemporary English and the indigenous Britons . 
 = = = Folklore = = = 
 Scholars such as Charles Oman note that one element of the children 's account , the entry into a different reality by way of a cave , seems to have been quite popular . Gerald of Wales tells a similar story of a boy who , after escaping his master , " encountered two <unk> who led him through an underground passage into a beautiful land with fields and rivers , but not lit by the full light of the sun " . But the motif is poorly attested ; E. W. Baughman lists it as the only example of his <unk> category of English and North American folk tale motifs : " Inhabitants of lower world visit mortals , and continue to live with them " . Martin Walsh considers the references to St Martin to be significant , and sees the story of the green children as evidence that the feast of Martinmas has its origins in an English aboriginal past , of which the children 's story forms " the lowest stratum " . E. S. Alderson suggests a Celtic connection in a 1900 edition of Notes and Queries : " ' Green ' spirits are ' sinless ' in Celtic literature and tradition ... It may be more than a coincidence that the green girl marries a ' man of [ Kings ] Lynn . ' Here the original [ Celtic word ] would be <unk> , evil , i.e. the pure fairy marries a sinful child of earth . " 
 In a modern development of the tale the green children are associated with the Babes in the Wood , who were left by their wicked uncle to die ; in this version the children 's green colouration is explained by their having been poisoned with arsenic . Fleeing from the wood in which they were abandoned , possibly nearby Thetford Forest , the children fell into the pits at Woolpit where they were discovered . Local author and folk singer Bob Roberts states in his 1978 book A Slice of Suffolk that " I was told there are still people in Woolpit who are ' descended from the green children ' , but nobody would tell me who they were ! " 
 Other commentators have suggested that the children may have been aliens , or inhabitants of a world beneath the Earth . In a 1996 article published in the magazine Analog , astronomer Duncan Lunan hypothesised that the children were accidentally transported to Woolpit from their home planet as the result of a " matter transmitter " malfunction . Lunan suggests that the planet from which the children were expelled may be trapped in synchronous orbit around its sun , presenting the conditions for life only in a narrow twilight zone between a fiercely hot surface and a frozen dark side . He explains the children 's green colouration as a side effect of consuming the genetically modified alien plants eaten by the planet 's inhabitants . 
 Lunan was not the first to state that the green children may have been extraterrestrials . Robert Burton suggested in his 1621 The Anatomy of Melancholy that the green children " fell from Heaven " , an idea that seems to have been picked up by Francis Godwin , historian and Bishop of Hereford , in his speculative fiction The Man in the Moone , published posthumously in 1638 .

 Many Flemish immigrants arrived in eastern England during the 12th century , and they were persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154 ; a large number of them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont , 3rd Earl of Leicester . Paul Harris has suggested that the green children 's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin , slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds , where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time . They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit . <unk> , bewildered , and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes , the children would have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers . The children 's colour could be explained by green sickness , the result of a dietary deficiency . Brian Haughton considers Harris 's explanation to be plausible , and the one most widely accepted , although not without its difficulties . For instance , he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by the children as being Flemish . 
 Historian Derek Brewer 's explanation is even more prosaic : 
 The likely core of the matter is that these very small children , herding or following flocks , strayed from their forest village , spoke little , and ( in modern terms ) did not know their own home address . They were probably suffering from chlorosis , a deficiency disease which gives the skin a greenish tint , hence the term " green sickness " . With a better diet it disappears . 
 Jeffrey Jerome Cohen proposes that the story is about racial difference , and " allows William to write obliquely about the Welsh " : the green children are a memory of England 's past and the violent conquest of the indigenous Britons by the Anglo @-@ Saxons followed by the Norman invasion . William of Newburgh reluctantly includes the story of the green children in his account of a largely unified England , which Cohen juxtaposes with Geoffrey of Monmouth 's The History of the Kings of Britain , a book that according to William is full of " gushing and untrammeled lying " . Geoffrey 's history offers accounts of previous kings and kingdoms of various racial identities , whereas William 's England is one in which all peoples are either assimilated or pushed to the boundaries . According to Cohen , the green children represent a dual intrusion into William 's unified vision of England . On one hand they are a reminder of the racial and cultural differences between Normans and Anglo @-@ Saxons , given the children 's claim to have come from St Martin 's Land , named after Martin of Tours ; the only other time William mentions that saint is in reference to St Martin 's Abbey in Hastings , which commemorates the Norman victory in 1066 . But the children also embody the earlier inhabitants of the British Isles , the " Welsh ( and Irish and Scots ) who [ had been ] forcibly anglicized ... The Green Children resurface another story that William had been unable to tell , one in which English <unk> dominion becomes a troubled assumption rather than a foregone conclusion . " The boy in particular , who dies rather than become assimilated , represents " an adjacent world that cannot be annexed ... an otherness that will perish to endure " .

 The English anarchist poet and critic Herbert Read describes the story of the green children in his English Prose Style , published in 1931 , as " the norm to which all types of fantasy should conform " . It was the inspiration for his only novel , The Green Child , written in 1934 . A 1994 adaptation of the story by Kevin Crossley @-@ Holland tells it from the point of view of the green girl . 
 Author John Macklin includes an account in his 1965 book , Strange Destinies , of two green children who arrived in the Spanish village of Banjos in 1887 . Many details of the story very closely resemble the accounts given of the Woolpit children , such as the name of Ricardo de <unk> , the mayor of Banjos who befriends the two children , strikingly similar to Richard de Calne . It therefore seems that Macklin 's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit , particularly as there is no record of any Spanish village called Banjos . 
 Australian novelist and poet Randolph Stow uses the account of the green children in his 1980 novel The Girl Green as <unk> ; the green girl is the source for the title character , here a blond girl with green eyes . The green children become a source of interest to the main character , Crispin Clare , along with some other characters from the Latin accounts of William of Newburgh , Gervase of Tilbury , and others , and Stow includes translations from those texts : these characters " have histories of loss and dispossession that echo [ Clare 's ] own " . The green children are the subject of a 1990 community opera performed by children and adults , composed by Nicola <unk> with a libretto written by Kevin Crossley @-@ Holland . In 2002 English poet Glyn Maxwell wrote a verse play based on the story of the green children , <unk> ( the earlier name for Woolpit ) , which was performed once in New York City . In Maxwell 's version the girl becomes an indentured servant to the lord of the manor , until a stranger named <unk> buys her freedom and takes her to an unknown destination . 
 = Norman Yardley = 
 Norman Walter Dransfield Yardley ( 19 March 1915 – 3 October 1989 ) was an English cricketer who played for Cambridge University , Yorkshire County Cricket Club and England , as a right @-@ handed batsman and occasional bowler . An amateur , he captained Yorkshire from 1948 to 1955 and England on fourteen occasions between 1947 and 1950 , winning four Tests , losing seven and drawing three . Yardley was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1948 and in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack , he was described as Yorkshire 's finest amateur since Stanley Jackson . 
 Yardley played schoolboy cricket at St Peter 's , York . A highly talented all @-@ round sportsman , he went to St John 's College , Cambridge , and won Blues at cricket , squash , rugby fives and field hockey . In the university matches , he scored 90 in his second year , 101 in his third and was captain for his final year . He made his Yorkshire debut in 1936 and played for the county until 1955 , when he retired as a player . He made his Test match debut against South Africa in 1939 and after the Second World War was chosen as vice @-@ captain to Wally Hammond on the 1946 — 47 tour of Australia where he captained England in the fifth Test . He followed Hammond as skipper in 1947 , and captained England intermittently until 1950 when his business commitments allowed . In 1948 he succeeded to the Yorkshire leadership when Brian Sellers resigned . Yardley remained in the position until 1955 , during a time when Yorkshire had several difficult players in their dressing room . Under Yardley , Yorkshire were joint champions in 1949 but too often for the liking of supporters , finished second to Surrey in the County Championship . He served as a Test match selector between 1951 and 1954 , acting as chairman of selectors in 1952 . He was President of Yorkshire C.C.C. from 1981 to 1984 , when he resigned after becoming involved in controversy over the decision to release Geoffrey Boycott in 1983 . He died after a stroke in 1989 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Yardley was born in Royston , near Barnsley , on 19 March 1915 to a family with no real background in cricket . He was sent to St Peter 's , York , where he made a good impression as a cricketer , being in the school team for five years from 1930 and captain in his final two years . In 1933 , his first season in charge , he scored 973 runs at an average of 88 @.@ 45 , scoring three centuries in consecutive innings . He headed the bowling averages , with 40 wickets at 11 @.@ 90 runs per wicket . His form that season saw him selected for the match between Young Amateurs and Young Professionals at Lord 's Cricket Ground , in which Yardley scored 189 in his first representative match , playing against his future England team @-@ mate Denis Compton . In 1934 , Yardley played in two further representative matches at Lord 's , for The Rest against Lord 's Schools , and for Public Schools against The Army , making 117 , the first century in the fixture for Public Schools , and 63 . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack later cited these successes as a demonstration of his ability to perform well on important occasions . While still at school , he came to the attention of Yorkshire County Cricket Club , playing for the Yorkshire Colts side and receiving coaching from George Hirst . He played for Yorkshire Second XI once in 1932 , twice in 1933 and twice in 1934 .

 Leaving St Peter 's School , Yardley went to St John 's College , Cambridge University , where he immediately began to show all @-@ round ability at sports . He won the North of England Squash Championships every year between 1934 and 1939 , and won his Blue in hockey , squash , and Rugby Fives . However , his main distinction came from cricket , where he was a Blue in each his four years at Cambridge . He played for the University team in his first year , the 1935 season , making ten first @-@ class appearances without much success . His Wisden obituary noted that " class rather than performance guaranteed his place . " He made his first @-@ class debut against Sussex , scoring a duck in his first innings and 24 runs in the second . He passed fifty on just one occasion that season , scoring 319 runs at an average of 16 @.@ 78 , and bowled 69 balls without taking a wicket . Nevertheless , he played in the University Match , scoring just 19 and 36 . 
 In the following season , Yardley improved considerably , becoming a dominant force in University Cricket according to Wisden . His maiden first @-@ class century came in a narrow Cambridge victory over the Army , and he scored a second against Surrey , remaining not out for 116 in a total of 359 . Bowling much more regularly , his maiden wickets in first @-@ class cricket came in a performance of four wickets for 45 against Yorkshire , including the wicket of Len Hutton . Yardley topped the Cambridge batting averages and played an effective innings of 90 in the University Match . This display impressed Stanley Jackson , an influential former Yorkshire amateur cricketer , and he urged the Yorkshire selectors to include Yardley in the first team . Yardley was still appearing in the county second team at this stage , but at the end of August , he made his debut for the Yorkshire first eleven , appearing in the County Championship match against Derbyshire . He scored 12 in his only innings and took a wicket . He played in a further seven matches for Yorkshire , scoring 309 runs in ten innings with a highest score of 89 against Hampshire , with further fifties against Surrey and Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . In all first @-@ class cricket that season , Yardley scored 1 @,@ 017 runs at an average of 37 @.@ 66 and took 12 wickets at an average of 26 @.@ 08 . 
 Yardley continued to make progress in his batting in 1937 . For Cambridge , he scored fifties against the Army and Surrey . Against Hampshire he took four for 47 and five for 41 , and when Cambridge collapsed to 35 for six chasing a victory target of 141 , he scored 64 not out to take the side to a win . Playing Sussex , he scored a century and took four for 36 , while in the University match , he scored 101 in two and a half hours . Yardley 's form saw him selected for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord 's , although he scored only 7 and 4 , and when he joined Yorkshire after the Cambridge season , he made his first century for the county against Surrey , as well as three other fifties . His overall first @-@ class figures were 1 @,@ 472 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 45 and 31 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 87 . He was picked for the winter MCC tour of India , under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson , where he scored 519 runs at an average 25 @.@ 95 but only took one wicket . No official Tests were played on the tour , but Yardley played in the representative matches which took place , scoring 96 in the first game , but his highest score in four other innings was 31 . 
 Honours continued to come Yardley 's way in the 1938 season . He was chosen to captain Cambridge in his final season in the team ; although his side did not win a match , Yardley enjoyed some personal success . Among his fifties were innings of 67 against the touring Australian team and 61 in the University Match . He was included in different representative sides ; he was selected in a Test trial , playing for the Rest , and played a second game against the Australians for the Gentlemen of England , although he did not pass fifty in either match . For the Gentlemen against the Players , Yardley scored 88 . He did not make the full England side but was twelfth man in two Tests against Australia . His highest innings of the season was 97 for Yorkshire against Gloucestershire , and in all first @-@ class matches , Yardley accumulated 1 @,@ 217 runs at an average of 31 @.@ 20 and took 22 wickets at 35 @.@ 45 . 
 = = = Test debut and war service = = = 
 By this stage , Yorkshire regarded Yardley as the heir to Brian Sellers as captain , and the England Test selectors also began to prepare him to assume the England captaincy . At the end of the 1938 season , Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice @-@ captain to Wally Hammond . He made a good start to the tour , scoring centuries in his first two innings , both surpassing his previous highest score . Wisden noted that he made a good impression on spectators in these early matches . In his fourth match , he captained the MCC in Hammond 's absence for the first time . When Len Hutton was injured in a tour match and missed the first Test , <unk> made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in the second innings . Hutton returned for the second match , and the successes of other batsmen meant that Yardley was not required in the other Tests on the tour . However , he scored a third century when he captained the MCC against Border . 
 Having built up a reputation as one of the best amateur cricketers in England , Yardley played three early season matches for the MCC , but he was selected for neither the Gentlemen nor for England that year . He played his first full season for Yorkshire , scoring centuries against Cambridge , Warwickshire and Sussex ; in total , he scored 1 @,@ 086 runs at an average of 27 @.@ 84 and took 17 wickets . 
 War brought first @-@ class cricket to an end in 1939 , and Yardley joined the first battalion of the Green Howards , along with his Yorkshire team @-@ mate Hedley Verity . After training in Omagh , Northern Ireland , where he played several cricket matches with Verity , he served in India , Iran , Syria , Egypt , Sicily , Italy and Iraq . In January 1944 , he was wounded in Italy , rejoining the First Battalion in Iraq on his recovery to become an instructor , before being demobilised at the end of the war .

 When County cricket resumed in England in 1946 , Yorkshire won the County Championship . Yardley scored 788 runs at an average of 23 @.@ 17 , with just one century , for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire . With the ball , he was used less frequently than before the war and took only nine wickets . He was not selected for any Test matches , but appeared for England in a Test trial and scored 39 and 11 . He also played twice for the MCC and represented the Gentlemen against the Players , making 29 and a duck in a heavy defeat for the amateurs . Critics regarded his season as unsuccessful , but he was chosen as vice @-@ captain to Hammond on the tour to Australia that winter , continuing his pre @-@ war role . 
 It was intended that Yardley would appear lower down in the batting order , batting with a substantial total accumulated by the previous batsmen . However , the frailties of the England batting meant he often appeared in a crisis and had to rebuild several innings . Bill Bowes , the Yorkshire and England bowler who covered the tour as a journalist , was impressed by Yardley 's approach , noting that he did not back away from the fast bowlers , who frequently bowled bouncers at him : " In fact , Yardley played cricket with a determination we had never seen in Yorkshire or in his days at the university . " He made the greatest impression as a bowler , surprising commentators with his effectiveness . He did not bowl in the first six matches , but in his first over of the tour dismissed Arthur Morris who had already scored a century . From that point , he was used effectively to break up partnerships . In the Tests , he removed Donald Bradman in three successive innings , while in the third Test , he took two wickets , including Bradman , in two deliveries . Bowes believed the natural length of Yardley 's bowling was perfect for Australian pitches — he was not skilful enough to alter the length at which he bowled so his bowling in other conditions was less effective . The Australian reporter Clif Cary wrote " It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket . The first time they seemed fairly amused , but when he was regularly breaking partnerships , their enthusiasm knew no bounds , and it is said that in Melbourne after he had obtained Bradman 's wicket for the third time , Yardley blushed profusely when one excited team @-@ mate slapped him on the back and shouted " Well , bowled , Spofforth " . 
 In the Tests , Yardley 's only scores over fifty , his first in Test cricket , came in the third Test , where he scored 61 and 53 not out . In England 's first innings , he helped his side to recover from a batting collapse , surviving for two hours . His second innings lasted 89 minutes and helped England to avoid defeat for the first time in the series . In the same match , Yardley bowled more overs than he had done previously on the whole tour , following injuries to Bill Voce and Bill Edrich , two of England 's main bowlers . Bowling leg theory with a fielders concentrated on the leg side , Yardley managed to move the ball off the seam . He dismissed Bradman twice in the match , having figures of three for 67 in the second innings and taking five wickets in the match . This was the first time that an England player had scored fifty runs in both innings and taken five wickets in a Test . Yardley also had substantial bowling workload in the fourth Test , delivering 31 overs in Australia 's first innings to take three for 101 . When Hammond did not play in the final Test , Yardley became captain , doing so courageously according to Wisden , which also pointed out that Yardley used field placing more effectively than Hammond . In the series , Yardley scored 252 runs at an average of 32 @.@ 50 , His ten wickets at an average of 37 @.@ 20 placed him first in the series bowling averages . He played in the drawn Test on the short tour to New Zealand which followed , opening the batting scoring 22 and taking a wicket .

 Yardley enjoyed his most successful season with the bat in the 1947 season , scoring 1 @,@ 906 runs at an average of 44 @.@ 32 with five centuries ; his bowling took eleven wickets . Following Hammond 's retirement immediately after the 1946 – 47 tour , Yardley captained England against South Africa throughout the season . In the first Test , he made his highest Test score . England were unexpectedly made to follow on in the face of a large South African total ; when Yardley came to the crease in the second innings , England looked likely to be defeated at 170 for four , still 155 runs behind the tourists . Yardley scored 99 , being caught in the slips just before reaching his century , but his batting had helped to save the game and earned praise from Wisden for " batting soundly " . Yardley and Denis Compton added 237 , which was a record partnership for the fifth wicket in England and remains , in August 2010 , England 's best fifth wicket stand against South Africa . Yardley 's only other score over fifty in the series came in the drawn fifth Test when he scored 59 . However , he scored 41 in just over an hour in helpful conditions for fast bowlers in the third Test and 36 on a difficult pitch in the fourth Test . Yardley scored 273 runs at an average of 39 @.@ 00 in the series . In contrast to his efforts in Australia , he bowled just six overs in the series without taking a wicket . England won the second , third and fourth Tests to win the series , helped by a negative approach from the tourists . Yardley captained the Gentlemen against the Players for the first time , at Lord 's and Scarborough , and captained The Rest against Middlesex , the County Champions . His batting and captaincy in the season earned him selection as one of Wisden 's Cricketers of the Year .

 Following Brian Sellers resignation , Yardley was appointed Yorkshire captain at the start of the 1948 season . With his England commitments and other absences , he only played in 12 County Championship matches . He had not toured the West Indies with MCC in 1947 – 48 , when Gubby Allen captained the side . However , Yardley resumed his leadership of England when Australia , captained by Bradman , toured the country without losing a match . Yardley led the MCC in an early match against the tourists , and captained England in a Test trial , but only played three other games , all for Yorkshire , before the first Test , with a top score of 46 . 
 In the first Test , England were bowled out for 165 after Yardley won the toss and batted in difficult conditions . Wisden did not blame Yardley for the collapse as England did not bat well . He then set defensive fields to keep down Australia 's scoring rate , taking a wicket himself with his fourth ball as part of figures of two for 32 . The Australian batsmen found it difficult to score quickly against the negative tactics but still established a lead of 344 . Yardley batted an hour in the second innings to score 22 but Australia recorded an eight wicket win . Before the second Test , Yardley played for Yorkshire against the Australians , and although unsuccessful with the bat , took two for nine with the ball , his first wickets of the season for his county . 
 England adopted an aggressive strategy in the second Test , but could not avoid a second defeat . Yardley frequently changed his bowlers to unsettle the Australians in their first innings , and took two for 35 himself as England briefly held the advantage . However , the lower order batsmen mounted a recovery , Yardley being criticised for his reluctance to bowl Doug Wright . The England captain then arrested a batting collapse by adding 87 with Denis Compton , scoring 44 himself , but Australia led by 135 on first innings . Yardley took two wickets in two balls in Australia 's second innings , narrowly missing a hat @-@ trick when Keith Miller only just got his bat down on the ball to avoid being bowled , and had figures of two for 36 , but Australia scored 460 for seven and bowled England out for 186 . In between Tests , Yardley scored his only century of the season , but his contributions to the third Test were minimal . He scored 22 and bowled four wicketless overs . However , the home side fought back in the match , for which Len Hutton was dropped . England scored 363 and bowled out Australia for 221 . They scored 174 for three before declaring , but rain intervened to prevent Yardley pushing for a win . 
 England maintained their newly confident approach , being on top for most of the fourth Test . Yardley 's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38 , Yardley contributing two wickets . England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared . He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day , allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break @-@ up of the pitch . Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes , a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match . In addition , the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply . However , England made several errors : Godfrey Evans , the England wicket @-@ keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances ; three catches were dropped by fielders , and England 's only specialist spinner , Jim Laker , bowled poorly . Consequently , Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton 's bowling . Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen , Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner . Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket ; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton , who was hit for 30 runs in four overs , although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton 's bowling . The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers , but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball . Australia won by seven wickets ; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day . Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win ; he believed that Yardley used Hutton 's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring , but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long . Wisden also stated that England should have won the match . 
 Around this time , and particularly after the fourth Test defeat , critics suggested that Walter Robins , one of the selectors , should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job . However , Robins ' age counted against him ; the selectors were satisfied with Yardley 's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances , and retained him for the final Test . In that match , he failed twice with the bat , scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated , bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings . England lost the series 4 – 0 . Yardley managed 150 runs at an average of 16 @.@ 66 , not passing fifty in a single innings . However , he once again topped the England bowling averages , taking nine wickets at an average of 22 @.@ 66 . Bowes believed that the pressure of captaincy had affected Yardley 's batting . Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley 's future , stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer . 
 Yardley 's only other representative appearance in 1948 was as captain of the Gentlemen against the Players at Lords , where he scored 61 . In the whole season , he scored 1 @,@ 061 runs at an average of 29 @.@ 47 and 14 wickets at an average of 35 @.@ 14 — he took just five wickets outside of the Tests . 
 = = = Captain of Yorkshire = = = 
 Yardley was unavailable to captain the MCC tour of South Africa in the winter of 1948 – 49 , which was led by George Mann . Mann did well enough to retain the position for two Tests in the 1949 season ; Freddie Brown captained the other two and Yardley did not play for England that year . In all first @-@ class matches that season , he scored 1 @,@ 612 runs at an average of 37 @.@ 48 and took 22 wickets at an average of 33 @.@ 86 . He did not score a century in the County Championship , but passed three figures for Yorkshire against the New Zealand touring team and for the North against the South in a festival match . His only representative game outside of festival matches was for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord 's ; Mann was appointed captain for the game . That season , Yorkshire shared the County Championship with Middlesex , the only time Yorkshire won the competition during Yardley 's leadership . 
 Yardley 's batting form dipped in the 1950 season . He scored 1 @,@ 082 runs at an average of 24 @.@ 59 , the final time he reached four figures in a season . With the ball he took 19 wickets at an average of 32 @.@ 10 . Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship behind joint winners Lancashire and Surrey . It took seven matches for Yardley to reach fifty runs in an innings , but he hit centuries against Surrey , Somerset and Scotland in the second half of the season . The West Indies toured England and Yardley resumed the England captaincy ; he also captained MCC against the tourists and England against The Rest in a Test trial . However , neither Yardley nor Mann , the two likeliest candidates , were able to accept the captaincy of the MCC side in Australia that winter . The selectors spent much of the season assessing other players . Although Yardley represented the Gentlemen against the Players , the side was led by Brown , who scored a century and was appointed captain of the touring side . Brown also assumed the captaincy of England for the final Test against West Indies and Yardley was left out of the team . In the three Tests he played , Yardley scored 108 runs at an average of 18 @.@ 00 with a top score of 41 . He won the first Test but lost the next two , West Indies ' first Test wins in England ; the final Test was also lost by Brown . Following this series , Yardley did not play any more Tests , although his name was mentioned as a potential captain in 1953 before Hutton was appointed as England 's first professional captain of the twentieth century . At the time , Yardley was still considered the best amateur candidate . In 20 Tests , Yardley scored 812 runs at an average of 25 @.@ 37 and four fifties . With the ball , he took 21 wickets at an average of 33 @.@ 66 . On the fourteen occasions he was captain , he won four times , lost seven and drew three . 
 Yorkshire finished second in the County Championship to Warwickshire in the 1951 season and second to Surrey in the 1952 season . However , in following season , Yorkshire dropped to equal twelfth , their worst ever finish at that time . In the following two seasons , the team were again runners up , Surrey winning on both occasions . Yardley scored more than 850 runs in each season , but only managed two more centuries . These were 183 not out against Hampshire in 1951 , the highest innings of his career , and an unbeaten score of exactly 100 against Gloucestershire in his final season . His batting average was generally between 24 and 31 , except in 1953 when in matches in England he averaged 36 @.@ 53 . Yardley used himself as a bowler more often in 1951 and 1952 , delivering more overs than any other time in his career in the latter year . He took 32 and 43 wickets respectively in each season , his highest two season totals , and taking five wickets in an innings on three occasions , having only done so twice before . However , he bowled less often during his final three seasons , with a subsequent drop in his tally of wickets . His only representative cricket , apart from annual matches at the Scarborough Festival for the Gentlemen against the Players and occasionally for T. N. Pearce 's XI , was the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord 's in 1954 . 
 Judgements were mixed on Yardley 's performance as Yorkshire 's captain . His record would have been considered good at any other county , but not by the standards set by previous Yorkshire sides . Critics felt that Yorkshire should have won the Championship with the players available . Contemporaries believed him to be the best captain in the country tactically , taking reasonable chances without too many risks and judging players strengths and weakness . Trevor Bailey , who played against him for Essex and under him for England , wrote that he thought him " an outstanding tactician and an expert on wicket behaviour . He was unquestionably one of the best captains I have ever played with or against . It has been said that he was too nice to lead Yorkshire , but I cannot think of anybody I have preferred playing under . " Alan Gibson believed that unlike some county captains , Yardley was worth his place in the side on cricketing ability . However , he seemed unable to extract the best from his players . Jim Kilburn noted that he used orthodox tactics , even when a different approach was called for , while other critics believed that he was shocked by the attitude of some difficult players in the side . Neither Yardley nor Hutton , his senior professional , were <unk> in the dressing room and kept apart from others . Both were frequently absent , playing in representative matches . This may have inflamed the situation , leading to accusations that some players were out of control . Yardley disliked confrontation , and Ray Illingworth , who played under him , described him as too nice to stand up to his players . But Bob Appleyard , another of his former players , gives Yardley credit for recognising his potential and encouraging him to become a spinner , and believes that he and Hutton made a formidable pair of tacticians . Generally , he was popular with his players . 
 Between 1951 and 1954 , Yardley served as a Test selector , serving as chairman in 1952 at the time when Hutton was chosen as England captain . Following the 1955 season , aged 40 and increasingly bothered by lumbago , Yardley retired from the team . He ended his first @-@ class career with 18 @,@ 173 runs at an average of 31 @.@ 17 , and 279 wickets at an average of 30 @.@ 48 . Wisden later described him as " the finest Yorkshire amateur since F. S. Jackson " . 
 = = Style and technique = = 
 Yardley had a good technique for batting . He possessed a fluent , attractive style , and his height allowed him to reach the ball and drive more comfortably than most . His best shots were on the leg side , using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs . Yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty , and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation . He bowled intelligently , leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect , but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success . He was a good fielder in positions close to the batsmen . 
 = = Career after cricket = = 
 Yardley worked as a wine merchant outside cricket . After his retirement from playing he worked as a cricket journalist and served as an expert summariser on Test Match Special from 1956 until 1969 , as well as in 1973 . According to David Frith , the only time he was moved to express severe disapproval was when Brian Close was dismissed after a poor shot in the Fourth Test in 1961 at Old Trafford ; this was part of a final @-@ day England collapse that handed Australia the match and a 2 – 1 series win after the hosts had been on course for victory and the series lead . Trevor Bailey , who was a colleague in the commentary box for the later part of Yardley 's time with Test Match Special , wrote : " I always considered Norman Yardley to be an ideal summariser : accurate , informative and very sensible , and able to explain not only what happened but also the reasons why . His knowledge about pitches , tactics and the technicalities of the game was exceptional ... Articulate , expert , and possessing considerable charge [ sic ] , I thought his interpretation of events on the field and his post @-@ session summaries were sound , balanced and never less than fair . " 
 He served on the Yorkshire Cricket Committee , and from 1981 , he was Yorkshire President . However , he became involved in the controversy surrounding Geoffrey Boycott , to whom the committee had decided not to give a new contract . Yardley resigned early in 1984 after a vote of no confidence , dismayed by the attitude of Boycott 's supporters . Anthony Woodhouse wrote in his history of Yorkshire : " he conducted affairs in a fair and unbiased manner . Alas , he should never have been burdened with the politics of Yorkshire cricket in the 1980s . " He died at Lodge Moor , Sheffield on 3 October 1989 following a stroke . 
 = Vorontsov Palace ( Alupka ) = 
 The Vorontsov Palace ( Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> ; Russian : <unk> ́ вский <unk> ́ <unk> ) or the Alupka Palace is an historic palace situated at the foot of the Crimean Mountains near the town of Alupka in Crimea . The Vorontsov Palace is one of the oldest and largest palaces in Crimea , and is one of the most popular tourist attractions on Crimea 's southern coast . 
 The palace was built between 1828 and 1848 for Russian Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov for use as his personal summer residence at a cost of 9 million silver rubles . It was designed in a loose interpretation of the English Renaissance revival style by English architect Edward Blore and his assistant William Hunt . The building is a hybrid of several architectural styles , but faithful to none . Among those styles are elements of Scottish Baronial , Mughal architecture , and Gothic Revival architecture . Blore had designed many buildings in the United Kingdom , and was later particularly well known there for completing the design of Buckingham Palace in London . 
 Once completed , the palace was visited by many members of the Russian Empire 's elite ruling class ; a great number of these vastly wealthy nobles were so taken with the palace and its seaboard site that they were moved to create their own summer retreats in the Crimea . By the early 20th century not only many aristocrats , but also members of the Imperial Family , including the Tsar himself , has palaces in an assortment of architectural styles in the vicinity . 
 An important feature of the Vorontsov Palace is the adjoining park ensemble , which features 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) of greenery and forestry arranged by German landscape gardener Carolus <unk> . Today , the Vorontsov Palace is a part of the " Alupka Palace @-@ Park Complex , " a national historical preserve including the Massandra Palace in neighbouring Massandra . 
 Owing to its status as an important local tourist attraction and architectural monument , the <unk> Palace and its surrounding park complex were commonly featured in Ukrainian and Soviet cinema productions such as : An Ordinary Miracle ( 1964 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 1976 ) , Crazy Day or The Marriage of Figaro ( 2004 ) , and Sappho ( 2008 ) . 
 Russian poet Ivan Bunin visited the palace in 1900 and wrote a short poem entitled " Long alley leading down to the shore ... " ( Russian : К <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ... ) .

 In the period following the Napoleonic wars , the new city of Odessa emerged as Russia 's southern capital with a vibrant cosmopolitan society centered on a handful of brilliant Russian aristocrats and beautiful Polish ladies such as Zofia Potocka and Karolina Rzewuska . According to <unk> <unk> , the viceroy 's court in Odessa looked like a " small capital of an imperial <unk> " . While many Neoclassical buildings appeared in Odessa , the Crimea ( or <unk> , as it was then better known ) was still perceived as a wild , exotic hinterland . The mid @-@ 1820s saw the appearance of highly popular Romantic works celebrating its rugged beauty , such as Alexander Pushkin 's poem The Fountain of <unk> and Adam Mickiewicz 's Crimean Sonnets . Both poets were fascinated with Lord Byron 's Oriental romances and pictured the Crimea as an exotic land of Tartar Muslim traditions which had flourished in the Khanate of Crimea until its demise in 1783 . 
 Mikhail Vorontsov was appointed Viceroy of Novorossiya in May 1823 . Even before their arrival in Odessa , the <unk> started buying up lands in the southwest of Crimea , which was sparsely populated and little known at the time . Alupka was bought in 1824 from colonel Theodosios <unk> , the owner of Livadia and Oreanda . By that time , the <unk> also had property in <unk> , Massandra , Ai @-@ <unk> , and Cape Martian . 
 = = = Original design and ethos = = = 
 The Vorontsov Palace was commissioned as a summer residence for the Governor @-@ General of Novorossiya , Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov ( born 1782 – died 1856 ) . The Prince was a dedicated Anglophile . His father , Semyon Vorontsov , had been Catherine the Great 's ambassador to England , and the Prince had been educated in London . His sister , Catherine , had married an English aristocrat and become the <unk> of one of England 's grandest country houses , Wilton House . On the accession of Paul I , in 1796 , Semyon Vorontsov fell from favour and his estates confiscated and not returned until 1801 , after the accession of Alexander 1 . It 's therefore unsurprising that he chose to reside with his daughter in England until his death and that Mikhail Vorontsov was a frequent visitor to that country . 
 Vorontsov had been purchasing land from the local Tartars for the site of his new palace at Alupka from 1823 ; however , the acquisition had been part of a deal which necessitated Vorontsov to build a new mosque . Part of the site had already been planted with fine trees in 1787 for Prince Potemkin by the English landscape gardener William Gould as part of Potemkin 's " improvements " to the area in perpetration of a visitation by Catherine the Great following Potemkin 's bloodless annexation of the Crimea to Russia . On acquiring ownership of the site , Vorontsov immediately employed the German gardener Karl <unk> to further improve the site and layout the grounds and gardens for the proposed new palace . 
 In 1824 , the architect Philip Elson was commissioned to build a small house for the Vorontsov family to inhabit while the new palace was under construction . Now much altered in form , and known as the Asiatic Pavilion , this building still stands . 
 Originally , the prince wanted a strictly Classical design , and plans for such a design were executed , in Chester by architect Thomas Harrison and modified , on site , by Odessa architect Francesco Boffo . The two architects had previously worked together on the design for Vorontsov 's official residence in Odessa . Harrison 's plans for he palace at Alupka show a classical villa on the site of the present palace 's corps de logis with bedroom floors below , on what are now the lower terraces of the present palace . On the garden front , facing the sea , the plans show a large double height classical exedra ; Vorontsov must have approved of this concept as it was the only feature ( albeit transformed to an Islamic style ) , to be incorporated from Harrison 's plans into the new plans . 
 Construction began in 1828 , however , it was suspended in June 1831 before the building has risen from its foundations . This may have been because the principal architect Harrison had died the previous year and Boffo working alone may not have been an option – his alterations to Harrison 's plans for the Governor 's residence in Odessa had been unfavorably received . 
 = = = Change of plan = = = 
 Vorontsov had traveled widely in England , and had doubtless seen the newly emerging Jacobethan style – a hybrid revival styles based on the English buildings of the late 16th and early 17th centuries , which , in turn , had been influenced by the English Renaissance style which had belatedly evolved from the Italian Renaissance style of a century earlier . Vorontsov decided to review the design in order to incorporate these new trends from Western European architecture . 
 This major change from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style , little known in Russia , meant Vorontsov had to find an alternative architect to execute a new design . This was further complicated by Vorontsov 's desire to not only have a loose Jacobethan style , but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan 's Palace , <unk> Fort , and other local Tatar architecture . The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea 's position as a place where the East and West meet . It was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period . 
 As a result of the expansion of the British Empire , a similar approach was also gaining popularity in Britain . An Anglicised interpretation of Islamic architecture is exemplified by the Brighton Royal Pavilion , completed in 1823 , and the <unk> House , completed a few years earlier . Both these buildings drew heavily on the Islamic motifs , which were later to be evident at the Vorontsov Palace and were new and novel designs at the time of the Prince 's visit to England . 
 Vorontsov decided upon the British architect Edward Blore to redesign and complete the building . Blore was a curious choice of architect ; though able his work has often been often considered bland and uninspired . The eminent architectural historian Howard Colvin claimed that " a dull competence pervaded all his work " , while the country house architectural expert Mark Girouard has described Blore as " a bit of a bore . " However , Blore 's stolid and conventional designs were admired by the English Tory aristocracy – a class to which Vorontsov 's sister belonged and for whom Blore had worked at Wilton . The Anglophile Vorontsov was also a great admirer and friend of Sir Walter Scott for whom Blore had worked at the great Scottish baronial country house Abbotsford ; therefore it seems likely that these latter connections led Vorontsov to Blore . 
 Blore had already worked on many grand British buildings and a couple of buildings in colonial Australia . Blore himself did not visit the town of Alupka , however , he was well informed about the area 's mountainous landscape and terrain . Construction restarted in 1830 , under the supervision of Blore 's fellow architect William Hunt . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 Blore 's new plan for the corps de logis of house was constrained by Vorontsov 's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison 's original design ; this severely restricted the shape , size and layout of the palaces principal rooms . However , rather than erect a compact and low classical villa , as Harrison had designed , Blore 's plan was radically different , with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side , and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern . The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi 's <unk> Masjid mosque , which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison 's design to be incorporated , once given an Islamic makeover , harmoniously into the design . 
 In places , the seemingly at odds architectural styles can be viewed simultaneously ; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets . These coupled with the castellated parapets add what appears to be an almost Moorish element to the late English Renaissance air of the northern facade . 
 However , it is the southern garden facade which displays the strongest of the building 's Islamic influences ; it has a flat roof and is topped by two minaret @-@ style towers at its centre . These minarets flank the massive , central bay , this takes the form of a projecting double height porch entered through a high Islamic horseshoe arch . The interior of the porch takes the form of an exedra , which is really an elaborately decorated open vestibule ; it has an inscribed <unk> stating " There is no God but Allah " in Arabic . The porch is flanked by two short wings , each of two bays and adorned with cast iron balconies and verandahs overlooking over the terraces and their statuary . 
 While the designs for the corps de logis were confined by the foundations of Harrison 's earlier plan , the secondary wings and precincts were not . Abandoning completely Harrisons concept of bedrooms set in terraces beneath the corp de logis , Blore 's assistant architect , Hunt , opted for the typical vast sprawling wings and servants ' quarters of the 19th century English country house . These took full advantage of the gradients and topography of the site , and with their courtyards came to resemble a small medieval , fortified town of towers and high castellated walls . Nowhere is this more evident than the Shuvalov Passage , an enclosed carriage drive squeezed between the high walls of two wings , leading from the castellated Western Gatehouse to the forecourt before the northern facade . The passage , which twists and turn beneath high wall and towers and even passes under a bridge , resembles the street of a medieval town , rather than the approach to a country house . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 <unk> imported thousands of his serfs from the Moscow , Vladimir , and Voronezh governorates of the Russian Empire to construct the palace . These unpaid workers performed all the labour by hand , aided only by primitive hand tools . Masons were also brought in to help with the construction . The palace 's ashlar blocks were made from a local greenish @-@ gray tinge diabase , chosen for its unique color to match the colours of the surrounding mountainous landscape and forest greenery . All other building materials were imported from outside the Empire . 
 One of the first of the palace 's many rooms to be completed was the main dining room , built from 1830 to 1834 . The principal central wing of the mansion was constructed from 1831 to 1837 . Between 1841 and 1842 , a billiard room was constructed adjoining the dining room . From 1838 through to 1844 , the guest wing , the east wing , towers , the service wing , and the front entrance were completed . The final wing built of the mansion was the library wing ; this was under construction from 1842 to 1844 . The remaining four years of building works were spent on the palace 's interior decoration . 
 William Hunt , the onsite architect employed to oversee Blore 's design , while remaining faithful to Blore 's overall plans , was not afraid to alter them . Most notably , the Western Gatehouse , the main approach to the palace , was intended to have octagonal towers , but Hunt redesigned the gatehouse in an English 14th @-@ century castle style , with solid round towers and machicolations , nearly identical to the towers at Bodiam Castle , East Sussex . 
 After completion of the palace , Hunt remained at Alupka working on an assortment of projects in and around the estate building long carriage drives , roads and structural improvements to the gardens surrounding the palace . One of his largest projects was an extension to the palace itself , the Shuvalov wing , which was to be the summer retreat of the Vorontsov 's daughter Countess Sofia Shuvalova and her children , the countess was estranged from her husband This wing <unk> the palace to the western gatehouse , and created the enclosed Shuvalov Passage leading to the main entrance . Hunt remained in the Prince 's employ until his retirement in 1852 . 
 = = Interior = = 
 The palace consists of a total of 150 rooms , the principal of which are panelled with wood block floors . Inside the corps de logis , it had been Blore 's intention to follow the English 19th century tradition of distinct masculine and feminine suites of reception rooms ; with a library , dining rooms and billiard room <unk> to left of the central hall for men , and a massive drawing room to the right for women . This layout of sexually designated zones had become popular in Victorian England ; however its intention was not to segregate the sexes , but more to define furnishings – the male zones tended to have heavy oak furniture and dark ' Turkey ' carpets , whereas the female zones would have more delicate furnishings of rosewood , <unk> carpets and chintz soft furnishings . However , for unknown reasons , this concept was never executed and the female part of the house was extended into the male territory , with the intended billiard room becoming the countess 's boudoir while the study became a further small sitting room for feminine use . Above these seaward facing rooms were the family bedrooms . 
 Following the female claim to the principal rooms of the corps de logis , the library and dining room were relocated to a secondary wing not built until much later . This secondary wing is linked to the west of corps de logis by a large arcaded loggia ; originally open , it is now glazed and known as the Winter Garden . A later secondary wing , known as the Shuvalov wing ( named after Vorontsov 's son @-@ in @-@ law , Count Shuvalov ) was not part of Blore 's original plan and designed by his assistant , William Hunt . 
 The most notable of which are the blue room , chintz room , dining room , and the Chinese cabinet . The museum covers the first floor 's first eight rooms , featuring more than 11 @,@ 000 exhibits , including engravings of the 18th century , paintings from the 16th through 19th centuries , including those depicting Crimean scenarios by Armenian seascape painter Ivan Aivazovsky , as well as furniture crafted by Russian wood masters from the 19th century . 
 The library , the last of the palace 's rooms to be completed , is based on Sir Walter Scott 's own library , revealing the personal friendship that Blore had with Scott . Inside , the library features about 6 @,@ 000 literary and musical works of the 18th and 19th centuries . The interior 's woodwork , including the doors , panelling , and ceilings , is made out of oak . The walls are adorned in cloth , with designs made by Dutch , Flemish , French , and Italian painters . The palace 's Gothic fireplaces are made out of polished diabase . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 The palace sits surrounded by gardens and a park ; these grounds consisting of 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) were laid out by the German landscape gardener Carolus <unk> in the first half of the 19th century in the form of an amphitheatre : featuring wide open spaces and gardens planted alongside the walkways . The walkways are gravelled with 29 bags of coloured stones from the Crimean village of <unk> . 
 The largest of the landscaping undertakings carried out on the palace 's grounds were performed between 1840 and 1848 with the aid of soldiers , who also assisted in the formation and leveling of the terraces laid out before of the palace 's southern façade . Fauna was introduced from various locations throughout the world , including the Mediterranean , the Americas , and East Asia . Flora imported over a 150 years ago still numbers almost 200 species . 
 <unk> had the park designed in such a way that it would incorporate the landscape 's native vegetation , mountain springs , and nearby rocky masses , in addition to foreign plant species brought in from the Mediterranean , both North and South America , as well as from East Asia . Today , the park still features more than 200 exotic tree and shrub species , including a wide variety of palm trees , laurels , cypresses , olive trees , and evergreen <unk> , among many others . 
 In the summer of 1848 , the palace and its grounds were enhanced by the addition of three pairs of white marble Medici lions ; this statuary was placed alongside the wide flight of steps climbing the terraces to the palace . Each of the statues , by Italian sculptor Giovanni <unk> , are depicted in a varying pose – a pair of " sleeping lions " at the bottom of the steps , " waking lions " near the centre , and " standing lions " at the top nearest the palace . 
 Crimea 's coastal highway runs through the park , dividing it into the upper and lower portions . The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs , as well as by the native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth . A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby , which was placed there in 1829 . The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden . It features three pairs of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace 's southern façade , carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni <unk> . 
 = = Influence = = 
 The construction of Mikhail Vorontsov 's summer residence in Alupka so impressed Tsar Nicholas I that he decided to have his own family retreat built at neighbouring Oreanda . In September 1837 , the Tsar and Tsarina visited the Crimea for the first time . The viceroy entertained them at his new residence in Alupka . Impressed with the palace and its setting , the Prussian @-@ born Empress commissioned from Karl Friedrich Schinkel , a Berlin @-@ based architect , a design for a new residence . His design called for a striking combination of Greek Revival and Egyptian Revival elements . The palace was to be perched on the craggy shore in Oreanda . The court architect Andrei <unk> offered a less expensive design , which was adopted . The Tsarina 's palace was built between 1843 and 1853 under the supervision of William Hunt and <unk> , an architect from Odessa . This edifice was destroyed by a 1882 conflagration , with only a marble rotunda remaining . The next emperor , Alexander II , had the royal residence moved to Livadia . 
 Vorontsov 's building activities started a tradition of imperial residency of the area which would attract many of Russia 's smart and most elite to also build villas and palaces in the Crimea . One of the first such buildings was the Gaspra Palace , designed by William Hunt in the 1830s for Prince Alexander Galitzine , one of Alexander I 's most trusted advisors . Blore 's design inspired another straightforward imitation on the eastern shore of the Black Sea : the Dadiani Palace in Zugdidi that was commissioned by the last Princess of Mingrelia in 1873 and , at the time of the Russian Revolution , was in possession of the House of Murat . Neo @-@ Moorish architectural elements were also incorporated in the design of the royal villas in <unk> and Likani .

 Count , later ( 1845 ) Prince Mikhail Vorontsov ( 30 May 1782 – 18 November 1856 ) , Viceroy of New Russia , builder of the palace . He was renowned for his success in the Napoleonic wars . As the Viceroy of the Caucasus from 1844 to 1853 , he supervised the conduct of the Caucasian War . Having completed the palace , <unk> , now suffering progressive blindness , spent little time there . His commitments to the expanding Russian Empire took him to Tiflis ; there , he waged wars on the rebellious local tribes . The now elderly Vorontsov , a confirmed anglophile , was particularly distressed by the outbreak of the Crimean War , which , in England , was heavily promoted by his English nephew , Sidney Herbert . Embarrassed and distressed , he retired from public life to the privacy of Odessa . Vorontsov died in 1856 , having lived just long enough to see the signing of the Peace of Paris . Vorontsov 's tomb in the Odessa Cathedral was ruined by the Soviets , but his remains survived the Soviet era and were returned to the newly rebuilt cathedral in 2005 . 
 Countess , later Princess Yelizaveta Vorontsova ( 19 September 1792 – 27 April 1880 ) , a daughter of Count Franciszek Ksawery Branicki by Aleksandra von Engelhardt , one of the nieces and heiresses of Prince Potemkin , the founder of New Russia ( who was childless ) . She was one of the many Polish noble women who married the Russian aristocrats during the brief period of the " Polish enchantment " , when Alexander I publicly conducted an affair with Marie <unk> and his heir Konstantin was in love with her sister Joanna <unk> . When exiled to the Black Sea coast after The <unk> affair , Alexander Pushkin wooed Elise Vorontsova in Odessa and addressed several poems to her . Apparently resenting his advances , the countess complained to her husband , who had his young rival exiled to a northern village . After her husband 's death , Yelizaveta rarely visited the Alupka Palace , preferring to live in Odessa . 
 Prince Semyon Vorontsov ( 23 October 1823 – 6 May 1882 ) , the only son and heir of Prince Mikhail . He served under his father in the Caucasus with distinction and figures in Leo Tolstoy 's novella Hadji Murat , as do his wife and father . On 26 August 1851 he married in Alupka , against his parents ' wishes , Madame <unk> , née Princess <unk> , once famed for her radiant beauty . The couple found the cost of running the palace too high , and after making various economies they seldom visited the Crimea . After Semyon 's death without issue , the widow plundered the palace of many of its entailed furnishings and paintings and settled at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne with the Duca di <unk> , her son from a previous marriage . 
 Countess Sofia Shuvalova ( 1825 – 15 August 1879 ) , the daughter of Prince Mikhail and Princess Elizaveta . In 1844 , she married Count Andrei Shuvalov , the owner of <unk> ( not to be confused with another branch of the Shuvalov family whose family seat was the Schloss <unk> in Courland ) . The marriage was not happy , inducing her to live separately from her husband , who died in the house of another woman in 1876 . From the 1850s Sofia and her children used Alupka as a country retreat , occupying the long West Wing now named after them , the Shuvalov Wing , while her brother Prince Semyon occupied the remainder of the palace . 
 Count , later ( 1882 ) Prince Pavel Vorontsov @-@ Shuvalov ( 1846 – 1885 ) , the son of Sofia Shuvalova and grandson of Mikhail Vorontsov , inherited the largely empty palace and the Vorontsov title on the death of his uncle in 1882 . He died three years later . His wife , Yelizaveta <unk> , née Baroness Pilar von <unk> , outlived him by 54 years . They had no children . An imperial ukase from 7 July 1882 designated Alupka the centrepiece of the Vorontsov <unk> , which was to be inherited in the right of primogeniture . 
 Count Mikhail Shuvalov ( 7 July 1850 – 5 January 1904 ) inherited the entailed estate in 1885 from his brother Count Pavel . On 12 February 1886 , the Emperor authorized him to use the princely title and to style himself Prince Vorontsov @-@ Shuvalov . He was a bachelor and lived abroad . On his death , the title of Prince Vorontsov ( Serene Highness ) became extinct . 
 Countess Elizaveta Vorontsova @-@ <unk> ( 25 July 1845 – 15 July 1924 ) , the elder sister of Pavel and Mikhail Shuvalov . She was the last private owner of the palace , and restored much of its former splendour , buying back many of its former furnishings , and living quietly there with her husband , Count <unk> Ivanovich Vorontsov @-@ <unk> , a scion of the only surviving branch of the Vorontsov family . At the beginning of the World War I , Count <unk> was the Governor @-@ General of Caucasus . He died in Alupka in 1916 . 
 Countess Yelizaveta Vorontsova @-@ <unk> lived in the palace until April 1919 . During the great evacuation of the Crimea by the Russian Whites , she sailed to Malta aboard a British ship . She was accompanied by her grandchildren from the Sheremetev family , including Count Nikolai Sheremetev , who later married Princess Irina <unk> ( <unk> ) . Yelizaveta 's descendants also include actress Anne <unk> . 
 = = Later history = = 
 Four years after the October Revolution , in 1921 , the palace was nationalised , after which it was converted into a museum . This occupied the main , dining , and library wings of the building . In addition to the state @-@ confiscated Vorontsov family possessions , the museum also featured the exhibits of the nationalised estates of the Romanovs , <unk> , and <unk> all of whom had estates in the vicinity . In 1927 , the palace 's Shuvalov wing housed a sanatorium " 10 Years of October , " while the palace 's main concourse became home to Alupka resort 's polyclinic and spa baths . 
 When World War II began in 1941 , most of the museum 's exhibits were evacuated for safety from Alupka . However , some 537 artistic and graphics exhibits ( including temporary exhibition paintings from the State Russian Museum and the Simferopol Art Museum ) , 360 pieces of the building 's decor , sets of unique furniture , and a series of historic books were stolen by occupying Nazi German forces , amounting to a loss of 5 million rubles at the time . 
 During the war , Adolf Hitler presented the palace as a reward to Field Marshal Erich von Manstein , who made it personal headquarters . This explains why the palace was so well preserved . The building was later converted into a museum for Wehrmacht officers stationed in and around Crimea . Originally , the Nazis had planned to dynamite the palace , but the rapid advance of the Separate Coastal Army and supporting Yalta partisan groups during the Crimean Offensive saved the palace from destruction . 
 From 11 to 14 February 1945 , the Yalta Conference took place in the neighbouring , former imperial Livadia Palace ; this was between representatives from the United States , the United Kingdom , and the Soviet Union . Winston Churchill and his British delegation were given temporary residence within the Vorontsov Palace . Within two weeks , construction workers had restored 22 rooms in the main palace , 23 rooms in the Shuvalov wing , and even replanted the palace gardens . The palace 's English @-@ inspired architectural style gained praise from Churchill himself : Churchill was so taken by the garden 's Medici lions that he later asked Stalin if he could take them home ; Stalin declined the request . 
 The setting of our abode was impressive ... Behind the villa , half Gothic and half Moorish in style , rose the mountains , covered in snow , culminating in the highest peak in the Crimea . Before us lay the dark expanse of the Black Sea , severe , but still agreeable and warm even at this time of the year . Carved white lions guarded the entrance to the house , and beyond the courtyard lay a fine park with sub @-@ tropical plants and cypresses . 
 Following the war , the palace was used as a summer retreat for the Soviet secret police , and later as a trade sanatorium . In 1956 , the palace was once again reinstated as a museum , and two years later , it was further expanded by art treasures . However , the majority of the artwork looted during the war was never recovered , only a small fragment of the former collection was returned to the museum . In 1965 , the palace was included into the " Alupka Palace @-@ Park Complex , " a national historical preserve which also includes the Massandra Palace in neighboring Massandra , built in the Louis XIII château style for Russian Tsar Alexander III . 
 Although it has survived years of wear and warfare , one of the palace 's wings is now in danger of collapsing into the Black Sea below . Cracks have begun to appear in the library , housing almost 10 @,@ 000 books and manuscripts . Although Edward Blore had a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art drainage system built into the palace 's foundation , years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide . Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval @-@ style gatehouse near the palace 's west side .

 = Hugh Boyle Ewing = 
 Hugh Boyle Ewing , ( October 31 , 1826 – June 30 , 1905 ) , was a diplomat , author , attorney , and Union Army general during the American Civil War . He was a member of the prestigious Ewing family , son of Thomas Ewing , the eldest brother of Thomas Ewing , Jr. and Charles Ewing , and the foster brother and brother @-@ in @-@ law of William T. Sherman . General Ewing was an ambitious , literate , and erudite officer who held a strong sense of responsibility for the men under his command . He combined his West Point experience with the Civil War system of officer election . 
 Ewing 's wartime service was characterized by several incidents which would have a unique impact on history . In 1861 , his political connections helped save the reputation of his brother @-@ in @-@ law , William T. Sherman , who went on to become one of the north 's most successful generals . Ewing himself went on to become Sherman 's most trusted subordinate . His campaigning eventually led to the near @-@ banishment of Lorenzo Thomas , a high @-@ ranking regular army officer who had intrigued against Sherman . He was present at the Battle of Antietam , where his brigade saved the flank of the Union Army late in the day . During the Vicksburg campaign , Ewing accidentally came across personal correspondence from Confederate President Jefferson F. Davis to former President Franklin Pierce which eventually ruined the reputation of the latter . Ewing was also present in Kentucky during Major General Stephen G. Burbridge 's " reign of terror " , where he worked to oppose Burbridge 's harsh policies against civilians , but was hampered by debilitating rheumatism . He ended the war with an independent command , a sign he held the confidence of his superiors , acting in concert with Sherman to trap Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina . 
 After the war , Ewing spent time as Ambassador to the Netherlands and became a noted author . He died in 1905 on his family farm . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Hugh Ewing was born in Lancaster , Ohio . He was educated at the U.S. military academy , but was forced to resign on the eve of graduation after failing an engineering exam , which was a major embarrassment to his family . While a member of the cadet corps , he was close friends with future Union generals John Buford Jr . , Nathaniel C. McLean , and John C. Tidball . His father appointed Philip Sheridan to the open seat . 
 During the gold rush in 1849 , Ewing went to California , where he joined an expedition ordered by his father , then Secretary of the Interior , to rescue immigrants who were imprisoned in the Sierra by heavy snows . He returned in 1852 with dispatches for the government . 
 He then completed his course in law and settled in St. Louis . He practiced law there from 1854 to 1856 , when he moved with his young brother , Thomas Jr . , and brothers @-@ in @-@ law William T. Sherman and Hampden B. Denman to Leavenworth , Kansas , and began speculating in lands , roads , and government housing . They quickly established one of the leading law firms of Leavenworth , as well as a financially powerful land agency . 
 In 1858 , Ewing married Henrietta Young , daughter of George W. Young , a large planter of the District of Columbia , whose family was prominent in the settlement and history of Maryland . He soon afterward took charge of his father 's salt works in Ohio . 
 = = Civil War = = 
 In April 1861 , Governor William Dennison appointed Ewing as the brigade @-@ inspector of Ohio volunteers . He served under Rosecrans and McClellan in western Virginia . Ewing became colonel of the 30th Ohio Volunteer Infantry in August 1861 . 
 In November 1861 , when his brother @-@ in @-@ law William T. Sherman was relieved of his command in disgrace , Ewing aided his younger sister Ellen Ewing Sherman in making the rounds of Washington D.C. , denying sensationalist media claims that Sherman was insane , and personally lobbying the President for Sherman 's reinstatement . Ewing and his sister argued that Sherman 's requests for men and material in Kentucky had been denied in Washington , and that the charges of insanity had been part of a conspiracy orchestrated by Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas . Eventually the political influence of the Ewing family persevered , and with the assistance of Henry Halleck , Sherman was returned to command . President Abraham Lincoln praised Sherman 's " talent & conduct " publicly to a large group of important officers , and later banished Thomas to a meaningless post on recruiting duty in the Trans @-@ Mississippi Theater . 
 Under McClellan , Ewing commanded a regiment and then a brigade in the Kanawha Division in the IX Corps . In the Battle of South Mountain , he led the assault which drove the enemy from the summit ; and at midnight of that day , he received an order placing him in command of the brigade of Colonel Eliakim P. Scammon , who was in temporary command of the Kanawha division after its commander Major General Jacob D. Cox had been elevated to command of the IX Corps , replacing the fallen Major General Jesse Lee Reno who was killed earlier that day . At Antietam his brigade was placed upon the extreme left of the army , where , according to the report of the commander of the left wing , General Ambrose Burnside , " by a brilliant change of front he saved the left from being completely driven in . " 
 After Antietam , Ewing was placed on sick leave because of chronic dysentery , and was promoted to Brigadier General on November 29 , 1862 . He transferred West and served throughout the campaign before Vicksburg , leading the assaults made by General Sherman ; and upon its fall was placed in command of a division in the XVI Corps . At Chattanooga , he was given command of the 4th Division of the XV Corps , which formed the advance of Sherman 's army and carried Missionary Ridge . Prior to the Battle of Chattanooga , Ewing 's command led a diversionary raid that resulted in the destruction of the Empire State Iron Works in Dade County , Georgia , which was being refurbished to increase the South 's manufacturing capability . Sherman considered Ewing his most reliable division commander . 
 In the aftermath of Vicksburg , Ewing 's command wrecked Confederate President Jefferson Davis 's Fleetwood Plantation , and Ewing turned over Davis ' personal correspondence to his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Sherman . However , Ewing also sent copies of the letters to a few people he had known in Ohio , which , after the documents were published , permanently sullied the reputation of former President Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire . Their release coincided with that of Pierce 's book , Our Old Home . As early as 1860 , Pierce had written to Davis about " the madness of northern abolitionism " , and other letters uncovered stated that he would " never justify , sustain , or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel , heartless , aimless unnecessary war " , and that " the true purpose of the war was to wipe out the states and destroy property . " 
 In October 1863 , Ewing was placed in command of the occupation forces in Louisville , Kentucky . He was unfortunate enough to serve during Maj. Gen. Stephen Gano Burbridge 's " reign of terror , " where martial law was declared several times . On August 11 , 1864 , Burbridge ordered soldiers from the 26th Kentucky to select four men to be taken from prison in Louisville to Eminence , Kentucky , to be shot for unknown outrages , and on August 20 , several suspected Confederate guerrillas were also to be taken from Louisville and executed . General Ewing declared their innocence and sought a pardon from Burbridge , but he refused to give the pardon and the men were shot . 
 In his autobiography , Ewing describes an incident in October 1862 with Colonel Augustus Moor , who had struck a member of Ewing 's regiment with his sword when the enlisted soldier had fallen out of a march . Ewing immediately confronted Moor . In his own words : 
 He was at the table with his Staff and Colonels , drinking Ohio wine from long @-@ necked bottles , and smoking , and presented quite an old @-@ time German scene . I Told him I would not tolerate the German custom of treating common soldiers , if applied to my men , by any officer . I preserved discipline by taking care of my troops , collectively and individually . 
 Colonel Moor quickly apologized . While General Ewing respected the discipline of the German regiment , he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command , better suited to Americans . He was capable of recognizing the military tradition of other units while accommodating the unique needs of his own . General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865 , and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co @-@ operate with the Army of the James , when Lee surrendered . 
 In 1864 , Ewing suffered an attack of rheumatism , and received treatment several times thereafter , often being confined to his chair . He was likely prostrated with illness as Commander of Louisville during Burbridge 's madness in Kentucky . He was made a brevet major general on March 13 , 1865 . After leaving the Army , he experienced painful attacks for the rest of his life , often bedridden for periods of up to forty days . 
 = = Postbellum career = = 
 President Andrew Johnson appointed Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland , where he served from 1866 to 1870 . This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans , for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother , Charles Ewing . Blaine told the President that Hugh was ' acting badly ' . Blaine himself was disingenuous , having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman that he was doing everything possible to nominate his close personal friend , former Ohio General <unk> Brinkerhoff , for the post . Nonetheless , Blaine 's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon , possibly due to the influence of his sister , whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant . 
 Upon his eventual return to the United States , Ewing retired to a farm near Lancaster , Ohio , where he died of old age . 
 He was the author of : The Black List ; A Tale of Early California ( 1887 ) ; A Castle in the Air ( 1887 ) ; The Gold Plague , and other works .

 In 2002 , Thompson starred alongside John Lynch , Geraldine Somerville , Lauren Cook and John Thomson in the Jim Doyle @-@ directed film Re @-@ Inventing Eddie . The movie is about a man named Eddie ( Lynch ) , who is hounded by social services and branded a paedophile after an innocent <unk> game with his children is taken out of context . About two years later and shortly before entering <unk> , Thompson successfully auditioned to feature in the BBC children 's comedy programme Stupid ! . Out of around 400 hopeful youngsters , he was one of only a few to be selected to appear in the show . Prior to Stupid !

 Thompson auditioned in 2006 for the role of Cameron McIntyre in the long @-@ standing British soap opera Coronation Street . The part would have had him be on @-@ screen friends with Chesney Brown , played by Sam Aston , who Thompson already knew from the Carol Godby Theatre Workshop . Producers for Coronation Street , however , were so impressed by Thompson that they asked him to audition for a different role . His try @-@ out was successful and he was given a six @-@ month contract , along with the option to extend it for up to a year . He was cast as Ryan Connor , a boy who moves to Weatherfield — the fictional Greater Manchester setting of Coronation Street — with his mother , Michelle ( played by actress and former Hear 'Say band member Kym Marsh ) , and her brothers , Liam ( Rob James @-@ Collier ) and Paul ( Sean Gallagher ) . The Bolton News reported that Thompson would spend between one and two days in front of the camera , and that he would be given an on @-@ set tutor to help complete his school work . 
 On his first day of filming , in July 2006 , Thompson — who grew up watching Coronation Street — was starstruck . " [ It ] was the strangest day of my life because I was in a room with all these famous people . " He added : " It was completely different to how I imagined it would be . Everyone 's been really nice to me and it 's going well . " Prior to the airing of the Connor family 's arrival on the famous cobblestone street in August 2006 , Thompson commented , " I can 't say too much about Ryan and the story lines , but he 's very mischievous . The character is not a bad lad , but he 's not a good lad either . " Garth Philips , series producer , said at the time , " We held extensive casting sessions to get this family right , and the energy that Sean , Rob , Kym and Ben have will certainly make them a joy to watch on screen . " He continued , " They 're a twenty @-@ first century Coronation Street family , and we hope our viewers will be as enthralled and excited by them as we are . " 
 Within his first year on Coronation Street , Thompson had acted out scenes that involved his character stealing a car , <unk> the wall of the local newsagents , and discovering that his mother 's fiancée was having a gay affair with her male best friend . Still impressed with Thompson 's acting ability , producers of the series had his contract extended to 2009 . Reflecting on his first year in the soap , Thompson said : " It 's been a really strange year and a lot of things have happened . It 's been absolutely brilliant . The filming is everything that I could have wanted it to be . It 's fantastic and I enjoy it more than anything . " He added : " My favourite story lines so far have been doing the graffiti and stealing the car . I really enjoyed filming those two . " 
 In 2009 , opposite Sacha Parkinson , who plays Sian Powers , Thompson filmed his first screen kiss . He said of the experience , " It was bizarre because Sacha had done one before and I hadn 't . I knew the line I had to say and then kiss her . I knew it every time , and every time I said it I was shaking . " He continued , " Oh it was dreadful . I mean I don 't get nervous when I go on stage or anything like that , but it was just bizarre . It was one of those things that I got really nervous about . " The on @-@ screen romance was part of a controversial New Year 's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities , only to be discovered by Ryan 's adoptive mother Michelle .

 Ozy and Millie is a webcomic , created by D. C. Simpson syndicated by North America Syndicate , which debuted in January 1997 . The comic was part of <unk> from 2001 to 2003 , going independent for several years before returning to <unk> in November 2006 . It follows the adventures of assorted anthropomorphized animals . New strips were released on most weekdays , though the comic 's run ended in 2008 . The comic centers on Ozy and Millie , two young foxes attending North <unk> Elementary School in Seattle , contending with everyday elementary school issues such as tests and bullies , as well as more surreal situations . Although the strip ceased being produced in 2008 , it is currently being re @-@ run on <unk> . 
 The strip concentrates on character interaction , but sometimes veers into commentary based on Simpson 's political views . Most of the strips have been reprinted in book form . Five collections were released through Plan 9 Publishing , but they have all gone out of print ; currently a complete set of the strip 's archives is available through <unk> The strip is listed in the top 200 most read webcomic on The Webcomic List .

 Ozy and Millie originally started as a print comic strip in a Washington college newspaper , the Copper Point Journal , in 1997 using ink and brush as drawing implements . Simpson claims to have been influenced by comics and cartoons such as Bloom County , Calvin and Hobbes , The Simpsons and Pogo . It became an irregular webcomic in early 1998 . In June 1998 , it became a Monday @-@ Friday daily strip . In the same year , Simpson won a newspaper syndicates ' college cartoonist award . When the strip began , Simpson 's artistic style was similar to that in Calvin and Hobbes . In 2000 , the strip went on hiatus and returned with a new , unique style . The strip also went on hiatus several times . It was once on hiatus for five months , between August 23 , 2003 to January 22 , 2004 . Between January 30 , 2004 , and January 12 , 2009 Simpson also ran another strip , I Drew This , a webcomic specifically about her political views , which also appear in Ozy and Millie . In 2002 , the strip won the Web Cartoonist 's Choice Awards for " Best Anthropomorphic Comic " . Ozy and Millie also won the 2006 and 2007 Ursa Major Awards for " Best Anthropomorphic Comic Strip " .

 Ozymandias Justin Llewellyn is a ten @-@ year @-@ old fox of an unidentified species ( also called an " Adolescent Gray Zen Fox " ) who attends North <unk> Elementary School in Seattle , together with his friend Millie . He was originally supposed to be a wolf , until a fan showed Simpson a photo of Arctic fox cubs , that Simpson claimed were " absolute ringers " for Ozy . However , Ozy retained his whisker marks . Ozy 's full name , Ozymandias Justin Llewellyn , is a reference to the poem Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley . 
 Ozy is recognised by his large top hat , which he got from his father Llewellyn when he adopted Ozy . The only other clothing he wears is a vest , which makes him the target of some of Millie 's practical jokes . He is adept at letting Millie 's pranks pass by without effect , but he does suffer bullying at the hands of the school jock , Jeremy , who likes to stuff Ozy into rubbish bins . Ozy also suffers from annual baldness , usually through either a freak accident or because of Millie . Although it is caused by a gypsy curse ( later revealed by Llewellyn to be a myth ) which has passed on through Ozy 's adoptive father 's heritage largely unnoticed , it does affect Ozy badly since he is the first Llewellyn with any hair to lose . Ozy is also quiet and serene , usually playing the " straight person " . Under Llewellyn 's guidance , Ozy also practices Zen ; or rather a humorous version of it . 
 Ozy is told by Llewellyn that his birth mother 's name was Shelley and that she disappeared after discovering perfection when she created the " perfect " ice cream flavor , but since absolute perfection is incompatible with the world , she ascended to a higher plane of existence . 
 Ozy 's father left before he was born and become a monk . The pair met when the monk came to town for a visit , though Ozy decided to stay with Llewellyn , whom he considered his " true " dad .

 Millicent Mehitabel Mudd , better known as Millie , is a ten @-@ year @-@ old red fox girl who is Ozy 's best friend . Millie is usually seen wearing a set of blue denim overalls . Unlike Ozy , who is calm , Millie is chaotic and manic , both in the destruction she leaves behind and the ways she devises of avoiding work . She is a rebel and is opposed to any form of authority , which regularly leads to confrontations with both her teacher , Ms. <unk> , and her mother , Mililani Mudd . Her destructive and rebellious habits not only get herself into trouble , but Ozy too . Her most infamous antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur . Although she is normally manic , she also has a strong sense of justice , facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees . However , her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother , playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school . None of which matters any less to her , as long as she has fun doing it . Millie says aloud what others think , and does what others , for fear of reaction from the people around them , would not dare . She , like Ozy , often tries to answer the most important questions in life , but her method of finding the answers makes her unique . 
 = = = Llewellyn = = = 
 Ozy 's adoptive father , known only as Llewellyn , is a red dragon . Llewellyn and other members of his dragon family have been responsible for running several secret conspiracies . He also lends both Ozy and Millie advice , although his advice tends to be nonsense . He has also tried to run for U.S. president – first under the " Rainbow Peace Party " in 1968 , the " People With Nothing Better To Do " Party in 2000 , then under the " Zen Party " in 2004 and 2008 . He also runs his house as a separate nation : Greater <unk> . His favourite pastime is playing the " House Rules <unk> " , a game which has many , very complicated rules , that is claimed to be rather opposite to Calvinball . Llewellyn married Millie 's Mother at the end of the Daily Strip . Of all the characters in Ozy and Millie , Simpson has claimed that Llewellyn is her favorite . 
 = = = Ms. Mudd = = = 
 Ms. Mililani Minerva Mudd , Millie 's mother , is a lawyer , who is as an older , wiser , more temperate version of Millie . She was like Millie in her childhood , and as a result knows how to deal with any trouble caused by her , much to Millie 's annoyance . While Ms. Mudd knows how to deal with Millie , she is also the first to lend her support if there is anything amiss . She married Llewellyn at the end of the strip 's run in a storyarc from November – December 2008 . Her full name was revealed on October 1 , 2008 .

 Other characters in Ozy and Millie include Avery , a raccoon friend who constantly tries to be " cool , " even ditching his " uncool " friends such as Ozy . Ironically , his friend Stephan the aardvark is the <unk> character in the strip . Avery 's younger brother , <unk> , constantly undermines his coolness . The two major antagonists are Felicia the sheep , a " popular girl " who teases Millie for being too individualistic , and Jeremy the jock rabbit who bullies Ozy . 
 Other minor characters include Ms. <unk> , Ozy and Millie 's kangaroo teacher and Principal Beau Vine , the bull principal of the school who allows bullying believing that , " Repeated exposure to unprovoked assault squelches unhealthy nonconformist tendencies . " Dr. I. <unk> ( German for insane or mad ) , is a ring @-@ tailed lemur psychiatrist of the school who fights with Vine over school issues . Ozy 's dragon cousin Isolde is another character who , like Llewellyn , is in charge of various conspiracies . Another character is Pirate Captain Locke , a child pirate from an alternate dimension on the other side of Llewellyn 's couch , in which people age backwards . Locke , currently the same age as Millie , is also her biological father .

 Critic Fred Patten is one of the main supporters of the strip . In 2001 , he wrote that the strip was , " a gently humorous fantasy with a liberal political philosophy . " In 2006 , Patten still claimed that , " Ozy and Millie is one of the top anthropomorphic cartoon strips on the Internet , " although he did also comment negatively about the loss of colour in between changes of printed editions of books . The comic is also popular because of its relatively inoffensive content , with one person writing that it was , " Suitable for readers of all ages , really . "

 Two series of Ozy and Millie books have been formed , the first of which was discontinued and replaced by the second .

 = The Madcap Laughs = 
 The Madcap Laughs is the debut solo album by the English singer @-@ songwriter Syd Barrett . It was recorded after Barrett had left Pink Floyd in April 1968 . The album had a chequered recording history , with work beginning in mid @-@ 1968 , but the bulk of the sessions taking place between April and July 1969 , for which five different producers were credited − including Barrett , Peter Jenner ( 1968 sessions ) , Malcolm Jones ( early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 1969 sessions ) , and fellow Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Roger Waters ( mid @-@ 1969 sessions ) . Among the guest musicians are Willie Wilson from ( Gilmour 's old band ) Jokers Wild and Robert Wyatt of the band Soft Machine . 
 The Madcap Laughs , released in January 1970 on Harvest in the UK , and on Capitol Records in the US , enjoyed minimal commercial success on release , reaching number 40 on the UK 's official albums chart , while failing to hit the US charts . It was re @-@ released in 1974 as part of Syd Barrett ( which contained The Madcap Laughs and Barrett ) . The album was remastered and reissued in 1993 , along with Barrett 's other albums , Barrett ( 1970 ) and Opel ( 1988 ) , independently and as part of the Crazy Diamond box set . A newly remastered version was released in 2010 .

 In the second half of 1967 and through to early 1968 , when still part of Pink Floyd , Barrett 's behaviour became increasingly erratic and unpredictable . Many report having seen him on stage with the group during this period , strumming on one chord through an entire concert or not playing at all . In August 1967 , Pink Floyd were forced to cancel their appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival , informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion . Band manager Peter Jenner and bassist Roger Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist ( an appointment he failed to attend ) , while a stay on the Spanish island of Formentera with Sam Hutt , a doctor well established in the underground music scene , led to no visible improvement in Barrett 's behaviour . A few dates in September were followed by the band 's first tour of the United States . At this point , Barrett 's condition grew steadily worse . At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco , during a performance of " Interstellar Overdrive " , Barrett slowly detuned his guitar ; the audience seemed to enjoy such antics , unaware of the rest of the band 's consternation . Sometime in October , Jenner transferred tapes of " In the Beechwood " , two takes of " Vegetable Man " , and a 5 @-@ minute backing track called " No Title " , which Jenner hoped Barrett would finish eventually . 
 Around Christmas 1967 , guitarist David Gilmour , an old friend of Barrett 's from Cambridge , was asked by the other members of Pink Floyd to join as a second guitarist , initially to not replace Barrett , but to cover for him , because his unpredictable behaviour prevented him from performing . For several shows Gilmour sang and played guitar while Barrett wandered around on stage , every now and then deciding to join in playing guitar and singing . Waters and fellow band members keyboardist Richard Wright and drummer Nick Mason soon grew weary of Barrett 's on @-@ stage antics and , on 26 January 1968 , when Waters was driving his bandmates from London to a show at Southampton University , they all agreed to go without Barrett : according to Gilmour 's recollection , one person asked , " Shall we pick Syd up ? " and another said , " Let 's not bother . " Since Barrett had written or co @-@ written 10 of the 11 songs on their debut album , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , as well as the band 's three singles up to this point , the original plan was to keep him in the group as a non @-@ touring member − in a similar arrangement to what The Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson − but this soon proved to be unworkable . On 6 April , the group officially announced that Barrett was no longer a member of Pink Floyd . Upon leaving the Floyd , Barrett said to Melody Maker : " I suppose it was really just a matter of being a little offhand about things " .

 After Barrett left Pink Floyd in April 1968 , Peter Jenner and Andrew King , from the band 's management , followed suit . In May , Jenner led Barrett into the then @-@ named EMI Studios , on Abbey Road in northwest London , to record some solo material , only part of which would later appear on The Madcap Laughs . Jenner thought Barrett would like to finish the tracks that Jenner transferred the previous October , Barrett on the other hand , had other plans . During these first , tentative sessions , Jenner failed to properly record any vocals at all , for the tracks " Golden Hair " , " Late Night " , " Clowns and Jugglers " ( later retitled " Octopus " ) , " Silas Lang " , or " <unk> ( Parts One and Two ) " . After recording had resumed in June and July , progress continued on these tracks , especially " Swan Lee " , and a new , improved version of " Clowns and Jugglers " was taped at this point also . Barrett wouldn 't commit to recording the track " Rhamadam " ( sic ) to tape properly , however . 
 Although Jenner claims he got on well with the singer , he would also state that the 1968 sessions had not gone smoothly , admitting : " I had seriously underestimated the difficulties of working with him ... " Shortly after the July dates , Barrett abruptly stopped recording , breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Corner and then going off on a drive around Britain in his Mini ; he ended up in psychiatric care in Cambridge . 
 By the start of 1969 , a somewhat recovered Barrett decided to return to his musical career and revisit the Jenner @-@ produced recordings . He contacted EMI , and was passed on to Malcolm Jones , then @-@ head of EMI 's new prog rock label , Harvest . After both Jenner and Norman Smith , Pink Floyd 's producer at the time , declined to work on the album , Jones agreed to take on the role . 
 = = = Malcolm Jones sessions = = = 
 Jones had little difficulty in persuading his boss , Roy Featherstone , and Ron White , <unk> of EMI recordings , to allow Barrett to record with the company again . In April 1969 , the young executive took over the project and Barrett began working on newer material , while reworking the 1968 recordings . Jones would later explain the rationale behind EMI letting Barrett record again : " What was decided was to see what was the strength of Syd 's new material , and plan accordingly . If it worked , then , O.K. we 'd do an album . If not , we 'd call it a day ... " In a meeting at Barrett 's flat in Earls Court , unsure of Jenner 's production technique , Jones asked to hear some of the previous year 's tapes ; Barrett played him " Swan Lee " , " Late Night " , " Rhamadam " , " <unk> ( Parts One and Two ) " and " Golden Hair " . Of these , " Swan Lee " had no vocals , but Jones saw potential in the song ; " Late Night " did have vocals and , Jones remarked , " a certain charm " ; while " Golden Hair " was " great " . After the playbacks , Barrett performed several songs on guitar for Jones : " Opel " and " Clowns and Jugglers " ( both attempted during the sessions with Peter Jenner ) , and the newly written " Terrapin " and " Love You " . 
 The Jones @-@ produced sessions commenced on 10 April 1969 at EMI 's Studio 3 , with that day being dedicated to going through the 1968 tapes again to see what could be improved upon . The first track to be worked on was " Swan Lee " , which received vocal overdubs and a new guitar track , and several ideas for " Clowns and Jugglers " were considered ; Barrett and Jones both felt that the results were superior to the previous versions . The following day , in about five hours , Barrett recorded vocal and guitar tracks for four recently recorded songs , starting with " Opel " , and two old ones . Barrett and his new producer were in agreement that " Opel " was among the best of the new recordings at this time ; only two complete takes of the song were taped , though , after multiple false starts . The next song attempted was " Love You " , the first take of which featured a faster tempo than the officially released take 2 . After " Love You " , they recorded " It 's No Good Trying " , which was similarly completed in just a few takes . Barrett was in " great form , and very happy " , Jones recalled , and " very together " . During the lunch break that day , they talked about improving some of the other songs from the Jenner sessions , particularly " Golden Hair " and " Late Night " , the last of which was just a backing track at this point . After returning to the studio , they worked on " Terrapin " , with Barrett requiring just a single take , and added slide guitar and vocals to " Late Night " . 
 The following session took place on 17 April , in Studio 2 at Abbey Road . Jones arrived there to find that Barrett had brought in friends of his as support musicians : Jerry Shirley , drummer with Humble Pie , and Willie Wilson , Jokers Wild 's drummer , although for this occasion he was playing bass . The problem with this new set @-@ up , though , was that the songs were recorded as Barrett played them live in the studio ; on the released versions , a number of them have false starts and commentaries from Barrett . The first track Barrett and his fellow musicians worked on was " No Man 's Land " , after Barrett had played through the song several times , to allow Shirley and Wilson to pick up the segments . Once the rehearsal was through , they went for a take , to check how the band sounded and to test the equipment from within the control room . After these tests , the band recorded three takes , the last of which became the master take for " No Man 's Land " ; the bass , however , was re @-@ recorded at a later date . Playing along with Barrett wasn 't easy , according to Jones : " It was a case of following him , not playing with him . They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind ... " Shirley said of Barrett : " He gave the impression he knew something you didn 't . He had this music sort of giggle ... " 
 Next , they recorded a song that Barrett had written in a few minutes , " Here I Go " , which required no overdubs at all . This session for " No Man 's Land " and " Here I Go " lasted just three hours . When asked if he had any new songs for the following week 's session , on 23 April , Barrett 's replied that he had " a weird idea I want to try out " and that other musicians would not be required . Afterwards , Barrett mentioned that he was interested in <unk> one of the Jenner tracks − " Rhamadam " . On the morning of the 23rd , Barrett arrived at the studio with a cassette player , on which he had recorded motorbike sounds ; these , he told Jones , were " all ready to [ be ] put onto the ' Rhamadam ' four track " . The producer described the sound quality as " terrible " , an opinion that was confirmed once Barrett 's player had been hooked up to a 4 @-@ track machine . Instead it was decided that Barrett should source the motorbike sounds from EMI 's large sound effects library . The selection process took up to an hour , at which point Jones started to lose faith in Barrett . Later on , Barrett changed his mind and abandoned the idea . 
 The session on 25 April was almost cancelled , due to Jones becoming ill from colitis . Beforehand , it had been agreed that this session would be dedicated to transferring their previously recorded , 4 @-@ track recordings onto Studio 3 's newer 8 @-@ track machine , for further overdubs in later sessions . At Jones ' suggestion , and despite warnings the producer had received that Barrett should not be in the studio unaccompanied . Barrett went in on his own to carry out the mixing . It had been decided that nearly all of the tracks that were recorded up to that point needed further overdubbing except for " No Man 's Land " and " Here I Go " . At this point , Barrett considered placing " Opel " on the album , Jones calls it among Barrett 's " best and most haunting " songs . On the session for 3 May , three tracks on the album were overdubbed by Robert Wyatt , Hugh Hopper and Mike Ratledge , all members of the band Soft Machine : The three songs were " Love You " , ( now dropping " It 's " ) " No Good Trying " , and " Clowns and Jugglers " . Even after the Soft Machine members added overdubs to " Clowns and Jugglers " , Barrett wished to add bass and drums to it . 
 Robert Wyatt had said that the musicians would ask " What key is that in , Syd ? " , to which Barrett would simply reply " Yeah " or " That 's funny " . During this time , Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers ' debut LP , Joy of a Toy , although his performance on " Religious Experience " was not released until the album was reissued in 2003 . The next day 's session had Barrett adding backwards guitar to " No Good Trying " , and lead to " Terrapin " and " No Man 's Land " . It was around this time that Jones ' involvement came to an end – during these last few sessions , Gilmour had started taking an interest in how Barrett was getting along with his album . Although Barrett had told his flatmate that he was going off " for an afternoon drive " , he instead followed Pink Floyd out to Ibiza . During the trip , he asked David Gilmour for his help on the album , and , at the end of May , Malcolm Jones abandoned his production responsibilities . 
 = = = David Gilmour and Roger Waters sessions = = = 
 In his book The Making of the Madcap Laughs , Jones states that " when Dave came to me and said that Syd wanted him and Roger to do the remaining parts of the album , I acquiesced " . Roger Waters and David Gilmour were in the process of completing Pink Floyd 's Ummagumma album when they got involved with The Madcap Laughs that July and helped Barrett finish his album − " in a two @-@ day sprint " , according to Pink Floyd biographer Rick Sanders . " We had very little time , " Gilmour recalled in a May 2003 interview . " Syd was very difficult , we got that very frustrated feeling : Look , its your fucking career , mate . Why don 't you get your finger out and do something ? The guy was in trouble , and was a close friend for many years before then , so it really was the least one could do . " 
 After the first session with new producers Gilmour and Waters , on 12 June , they had remade " Clowns and Jugglers " into " Octopus " , from the Soft Machine 's overdubbed version ; then , they re @-@ recorded " Golden Hair " , and recorded " Long Gone " and " Dark Globe " . As the following day 's session was dedicated to overdubbing " Octopus " , this became Barrett 's final session for over a month , due to a temporary halt while Gilmour and Waters mixed Ummagumma , to Barrett 's dismay , and a Floyd tour in the Netherlands . However , towards the end of July , on the 26th , they managed to record " She Took a Long Cold Look at Me " , " Feel " , " If It 's in You " , another version of " Long Gone " , an attempt at a re @-@ make of " Dark Globe " , and even a medley of " She Took " / " Feel " / " If It 's in You " . Barrett would not allow the musicians to rehearse or to re @-@ record their overdubs , insisting that they sounded fine . After several months of intermittent recording , the album was finally deemed complete . After the final recording sessions for the album had been completed , Gilmour and Waters mixed not just the tracks they had produced , but also the Jones tracks , in a matter of two days . Five tracks were mixed on 5 August : " Long Gone " , " She Took " , " Feel " , " If It 's in You " , and " Octopus " . The following day , three tracks , " Golden Hair " , " Dark Globe " , and " Terrapin " , were mixed in just three hours . The track order was sequenced by Barrett and Gilmour on 6 October . 
 = = Release , reception , and aftermath = = 
 " Octopus " was released as a single in November 1969 and The Madcap Laughs followed on 3 January 1970 . The album was released by Harvest in the UK , while in the US it was issued by Capitol Records . It sold 6 @,@ 000 copies in the first few months and reached number 40 in the UK and was fairly well @-@ reviewed by music critics . Upon release , Gilmour said : " Perhaps we were trying to show what Syd was really like . But perhaps we were trying to punish him ... " While Barrett admitted that " I don 't think it would stand as my last statement " , Waters was more optimistic , declaring Barrett a " genius " . Initial sales and reaction were deemed sufficient by EMI to sanction a second solo album . 
 Malcolm Jones was shocked by the substandard musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters @-@ produced songs , however : " I felt angry . It 's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind ... " Barrett later said of the album : " I liked what came out , only it was released far too long after it was done . I wanted it to be a whole thing that people would listen to all the way through with everything related and balanced , the tempos and moods offsetting each other , and I hope that 's what it sounds like . " In a bid to increase sales , Jones wrote a letter to music magazine , Melody Maker , under an alternate name , writing how great the album was . 
 It 's quite nice but I 'd be very surprised if it did anything . If I were to drop dead , I don 't think it would stand as my last statement . " 
 On 6 June 1970 , Barrett gave his one and only solo performance , the performance was held at the Kensington Olympia , backed by Gilmour and Shirley , and baffled the audience ( including Gilmour and Shirley ) when he abruptly took off his guitar after the fourth number and walked off stage . They played " Terrapin " , " Gigolo Aunt " , " Effervescing Elephant " , and " Octopus " . From the start of the performance up to ( but not including ) " Octopus " , the vocals were inaudible . The performance has been bootlegged .

 For the album cover , Barrett painted the floor of his bedroom in Wetherby Mansions orange and purple . The nude woman appearing on the back of the record sleeve was an acquaintance of his known as " Iggy the Eskimo " . Photographer Mick Rock says , " When I arrived for ' The Madcap Laughs ' photo session , Syd was still in his underpants .. His lady friend of two weeks , ' Iggy the Eskimo ' , was naked in the kitchen .. " Iggy met Barrett in March 1969 , through Barrett 's then @-@ girlfriend , Jenny Spires . Barrett had moved into Wetherby Mansions , and Jenny took Iggy there one evening . Iggy stayed on at the flat when Jenny left for The States a couple of weeks later . Iggy didn 't know who Barrett was or that he was previously in Pink Floyd . Iggy heard Barrett play several songs that would later appear on the album , one being " Terrapin " , which she called " quite catchy " . In October 2010 she was interviewed , revealing that her name was Evelyn . The album was designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis . The original sleeve featured no musician credits , barring producer credit ; later issues contain musician credits . On the original release , track 10 is listed as " She Took a Long Cold Look " , although on the 2010 remaster the track is re @-@ titled to " She Took a Long Cool Look " , in similar vein to An Introduction to Syd Barrett .

 " The Field Where I Died " is the fifth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by Rob Bowman . The episode originally aired in the United States on November 3 , 1996 on the Fox network . It is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 3 and was seen by 19 @.@ 85 million viewers upon its initial broadcast . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Mulder 's search for an informant inside a cult compound leads him and Scully to one of the cult leader 's wives . What they soon discover is an unexpectedly close connection with the woman involving reincarnation . Scully discovers that spirits inhabit living beings in order to tell their stories . After Mulder 's regression scene , he details all of his past lives . 
 Morgan and Wong wrote the episode specifically for Kristen Cloke , who had previously been the protagonist of their science fiction series Space : Above and Beyond . The two also wanted to write an episode to challenge Duchovny as an actor . The installment was also inspired by Ken Burns ' eponymous Civil War documentary . " The Field Where I Died " received mixed to positive reviews from television critics , with many praising the episode 's exploration of loss and grief as well as Cloke 's acting . Others , however , felt that the entry was bogged down by Duchovny 's performance and the entry 's over @-@ use of emotion . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In <unk> , Tennessee , authorities receive a tip from someone named Sidney alleging child abuse and weapons possession by a local cult called the Temple of the Seven Stars . The FBI and BATF stage a raid on the Temple 's compound , but are unable to find its leader , Vernon Ephesian ( Michael Massee ) . Agent Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) experiences déjà vu and walks into a field on the compound , where he finds a trapdoor . Inside , Mulder and Agent Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) find Ephesian preparing to drink a red liquid with his six wives . Mulder stops them and handcuffs Ephesian , but he feels a strange connection to one of the wives , Melissa <unk> @-@ Ephesian ( Kristen Cloke ) . 
 Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) warns the FBI and BATF that Ephesian and his wives will be released in a day unless they can track down Sidney and the Temple 's reported weapons cache . The agents question Ephesian , who states that there is no member of the temple named Sidney . When they interview Melissa , she suddenly begins to talk like Sidney , claiming that Harry Truman is president . Scully believes Melissa is exhibiting multiple personality disorder , but Mulder thinks she is recalling a past life . The agents take her back to the temple , where she takes on the personality of a woman from the Civil War period and says that the weapons were hidden in another secret bunker in the field . She also states that Mulder , in a past life , was in the field with her , and she watched him die . 
 Mulder has Melissa undergo regression hypnosis for her to recount her past lives . She implies that she and Mulder have met over their past lives , always to be separated or lost to each other . To confirm her events , Mulder has himself hypnotized and recalls a time when he was a Jewish woman with a son , who had the same soul as his sister Samantha ; his deceased father , who was Scully , is dead . Melissa was his husband in this life , and had been taken to a Nazi concentration camp by a Gestapo officer who was The Smoking Man . Mulder also recalls his past life from the Civil War , when he was a man named Sullivan Biddle , while Melissa was Sarah Kavanaugh ; Scully , Mulder claims , was his sergeant in the Union Army . Scully finds pictures of Biddle and Kavanaugh in the county 's hall of records and gives them to Mulder . 
 The FBI and BATF plan to make another search of the compound . Ephesian , realizing that he will not survive another siege , passes out poison to the cult members and all but he and Melissa die , Melissa having feigned drinking it . As Mulder rushes into the temple , Ephesian forces Melissa to drink the poison , and when Mulder arrives he finds both of them dead . Mulder caresses Melissa , looking out into the field .

 Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong developed the episode specially for Kristen Cloke , both for her experience as the protagonist of their series Space : Above and Beyond , to translate Morgan 's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship , and for showcasing her acting . Morgan stated , " I knew she did a lot of characters and voices , so I wanted to incorporate that ... I wanted to write something for her that challenged her " . Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming , and based the various personalities on people she knew . Morgan also stated that he " wanted to write something for David Duchovny that challenged him . " When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman , the writers stated they wanted " this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns ' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter . " Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be " normal looking " and " <unk> " , explaining , " You have to believe that he believes his own rap . When he speaks , he 's just explaining that ' this is the way it is ' – and that 's when it gets very scary . " The name " Vernon " comes from cult leader David Koresh 's real name , and " Ephesian " is taken from one of the books of the Bible . 
 The Temple of the Seven Stars was built on a soundstage at North Shore Studios , one of the most expensive sets built for the show . Composer Mark Snow used samples of Gregorian chants in his score for Melissa 's death scene . The production team contacted officials of <unk> , Tennessee , who sent them a real citizen 's registry from the Civil War era which was reproduced by the props department and an expert calligrapher to make those Scully finds in the county courthouse . The photographs of Sullivan Biddle and Sarah Kavanaugh are " hybrids " of different public domain photographs , with computer effects " melding " the different features taken from different photographs . The face used for Sullivan was chosen because it bore an " uncanny " resemblance to Mulder . The poem Mulder reads at the beginning and end is from Paracelsus by Robert Browning . The first cut of " The Field Where I Died " was over an hour long , an excess length record for The X @-@ Files . Eighteen minutes had to be cut , which included two additional personalities of Melissa , and most of a third , Lily , which only makes a brief appearance in the final cut . 
 Sarah Stegall later noted that the penultimate scene , which features federal agents raiding the religious compound and finding that everyone inside has committed suicide , bears similarities to the Waco siege . Stegall even points out that the real name of the church leader in the episode , Vernon Warren , also resembles the name of the compound leader during the Waco siege : Vernon Wayne .

 " The Field Where I Died " received mixed to positive reviews from critics . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave " The Field Where I Died " a " B + " . He felt that it worked " pretty well " and there was a lot to appreciate about it , and while he noted that " the episode isn 't quite good enough for the conclusion to be as devastating as it should be " , he still praised the tragic ending . However , he felt it not believable that Mulder quickly accepts his past lives and Melissa 's part in it , and thought it would have worked better if he eased into believing it . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . She called the entry " unabashedly emotional episode " that is " unafraid to plumb the depths of human loss and grief " . Furthermore , Vitaris praised Cloke 's acting ; she called her " a truly gifted actor , slipping faultlessly into the skin of all of Melissa 's personalities . " She was , however , more critical of Duchovny , noting that his hypnosis scene was <unk> . Sarah Stegall , in The Munchkyn Zone , gave the episode a 5 out 5 rating . Stegall wrote that while the episode is " drowned in tears and soaked in muted sunlight , [ and ] teeters on the brink of sentimentality " , it manages " to stay just this side of it for a dynamite , gripping episode that showcases some fine actors " . 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode three @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , and wrote that , while the episode " stumbles around a lot " , it gives the viewer " the impression there 's nothing else on TV quite like it " . The two felt that the idea that Mulder and Scully were friends throughout their various lives was " one of the best things about the story " . They also wrote that the fact that Melissa and Mulder were somehow soul mates also prevented the story from being " obvious and pat " . However , Shearman and Pearson felt that Morgan and Wong added " a few too many ingredients " which yielded an uneven episode . Entertainment Weekly , on the other hand , was negative , giving the episode an " F " and describing it as " <unk> awful " . 
 The episode is a favorite of Anderson 's , who said she " loved the script " and that it made her cry . Series creator Chris Carter received angry calls after the Heaven 's Gate , a UFO religion cult , committed mass suicide less than six months after the episode had aired . He declined to comment . 
 = Daedaleopsis confragosa = 
 Daedaleopsis confragosa , commonly known as the thin walled maze polypore or the blushing bracket , is a species of polypore fungus in the family Polyporaceae . A plant pathogen , it causes a white rot of injured hardwoods , especially willows . The fruit bodies are semicircular and tough , have a concentrically zoned brownish upper surface , and measure up to 20 cm ( 8 in ) in diameter . The whitish underside turns gray @-@ brown as the fruit body ages , but bruises pink or red . It is found all year and is common in northern temperate woodlands of eastern North America , Europe , and Asia . The species was first described from Europe in 1791 as a form of Boletus , and has undergone several changes of genus in its taxonomic history . It acquired its current name when Joseph Schröter transferred it to Daedaleopsis in 1888 . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Daedaleopsis confragosa was first described scientifically under the name Boletus <unk> by English naturalist James Bolton , in his 1791 work An History of <unk> , growing about Halifax . He reported finding specimens on old trees near <unk> Hall , and having specimens sent to him from Darlington . The species has been shuffled between several genera in its taxonomic history : Daedalea by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801 ; Trametes by Gottlob Ludwig <unk> in 1844 ; Polyporus by Paul Kummer in 1871 ; <unk> by Otto Kuntze in 1891 ; <unk> by Patouillard in 1900 ; Agaricus by William Alphonso Murrill in 1905 ; and <unk> by Ivan <unk> in 2001 . It was transferred to its current genus , Daedaleopsis , by German mycologist Joseph Schröter in 1888 . D. confragosa is the type species of the genus Daedaleopsis . 
 Several varieties have been described . L. <unk> published var. <unk> and var. <unk> in 1975 . Both of these varieties were published invalidly are not considered to have independent taxonomic significance : variety rubescens is folded into synonymy with the main variety , while variety <unk> is now considered synonymous with Trametes suaveolens . Variety tricolor , proposed by <unk> <unk> Bondartsev and Rolf Singer in 1953 , is now the independent species Daedaleopsis tricolor . Bondartsev described the form sibirica in 1953 , but this is also no longer independent . 
 The polypore has acquired several vernacular names , including " thin @-@ maze flat polypore " , " thin walled maze polypore " , " blood @-@ stained bracket " , and " blushing bracket " . The latter name refers to its characteristic bruising reaction . James Bolton referred to it as the " rugged boletus " .

 The <unk> or <unk> fruit body is fan @-@ shaped to semicircular , and typically measures 5 – 15 cm ( 2 – 6 in ) in diameter , and up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick . Its upper surface is broadly convex to flat , dry , smooth to somewhat hairy , and usually has concentric zone lines . Its color ranges from reddish @-@ brown to brown to grayish , sometimes becoming blackish in maturity . The cap surface may have an umbo at the point of attachment to the substrate . Fruit bodies are leathery to corky when moist , but become hard and rigid when dry . The flesh is white to pinkish to brownish and tough . The underside of the fruit bodies features tiny pores measuring about 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 5 mm in diameter . They are white to tan to brown , but will develop pinkish or reddish tones if bruised . Pore shape is highly variable , ranging from circular to elongated , to mazelike , to gill @-@ like . The tubes are up to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) long . The fruit body lacks a stalk , as the shelf attaches directly to the substrate . The inedible fruit bodies have no distinctive odor and a slightly bitter taste . 
 The spore print is white ; spores are cylindrical , smooth , and measure 7 – 11 by 2 – 3 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club @-@ shaped , and dimensions of 20 – 40 by 3 – 5 μm . The hymenium features numerous <unk> ( modified terminal hyphae ) , which measure 2 – 3 μm . The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis <unk> is <unk> , meaning that there are three types of hyphae in the fruit body : skeletal hyphae , which provide structural support , are thick walled , measuring 3 – 7 μm in diameter ; generative hyphae , responsible for new growth , can be either <unk> or thick @-@ walled , may contain clamps , and measure 2 – 6 μm ; binding hyphae , thick @-@ walled and much branched , are 2 – 5 μm . 
 The polypore is used in ornamental paper making , whereby the fruit bodies are pulped , pressed , and dried to produce sheets with unusual textures and colors .

 <unk> unicolor ( formerly Daedalea unicolor ) is a common polypore species with a mazelike pore surface that can resemble D. confragosa . It can be distinguished by its thinner fruit bodies , a black line in the flesh , and the way that the tubes often break into irregular flattened teeth in maturity . Daedalea quercina , common on oak , has a larger fruit body up to 20 cm ( 8 in ) in diameter and 1 – 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick , and its pore surface is more distinctively labyrinthine ( maze @-@ like ) . It causes a brown heart rot , where carbohydrates are removed from the inner heartwood , leaving brownish , oxidized lignin .

 Daedaleopsis confragosa is a lignicolous fungus that produces a decay of sapwood . It causes white rot , a type of wood decay in which lignin is degraded and cellulose remains as a light @-@ colored residue . The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups , sometimes in tiers , in the wounds of living trees . Its preferred host is willow , but it has also been found on birch and other hardwoods . Fruiting usually occurs from June to December , but the hard shelves can persist year @-@ round . In North America , the species is most common in eastern locales , but rare in western regions . It is common in Europe , and is one of the 100 most common fungi in the United Kingdom . Its European range extends east to the Urals . In Asia it is widely distributed , having been recorded from China , western Maharashtra ( India ) , Iran , and Japan . 
 The fruit bodies are popular among fungus @-@ loving beetles . In a Russian study , 54 species from 16 families in the Coleoptera complex were recorded using the fungus ; the most common were Cis <unk> , <unk> affinis ( <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> , M. piceus ( <unk> ) , and <unk> oblongus ( <unk> ) .

 Aladdin is a 1992 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Aladdin is the 31st animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series , and was part of the Disney film era known as the Disney Renaissance . The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements , and is based on the Arab @-@ style folktale Aladdin and the Magic Lamp from One Thousand and One Nights . The voice cast features Scott Weinger , Robin Williams , Linda Larkin , Jonathan Freeman , Frank Welker , Gilbert Gottfried , and Douglas Seale . 
 Lyricist Howard Ashman first pitched the idea , and the screenplay went through three drafts before then @-@ Disney Studios president Jeffrey Katzenberg agreed to its production . The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld , and computers were used for both finishing the artwork and creating some animated elements . The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Tim Rice , who took over after Ashman 's death . 
 Aladdin was released on November 25 , 1992 and was the most successful film of 1992 , earning over $ 217 million in revenue in the United States , and over $ 504 million worldwide . The film also won many awards , most of them for its soundtrack . The film is considered by many as the best film that came out during the Disney Renaissance . Aladdin 's success led to other material inspired by the film , including two direct @-@ to @-@ video sequels , The Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves , an animated television series of the same name , toys , video games , spin @-@ offs , including a live @-@ action remake about the genie titled <unk> , Disney merchandise , and a Broadway adaptation that debuted in 2014 .

 Scott Weinger as Aladdin , a poor , but kind @-@ hearted Agrabah thief . Weinger sent in a homemade audition tape with his mother playing the Genie , and after several call backs he found six months later that he had the part . Aladdin 's supervising animator was by Glen Keane . Brad Kane provides Aladdin 's singing voice . 
 Robin Williams as The Genie , a comedic genie , with nigh omnipotent power that can only be exercised when his master wishes it . The Genie 's supervising animator was Eric Goldberg . Clements and Musker wrote the part of the Genie for Williams , and , when met with resistance , created a reel of Williams ' stand @-@ up to animation of the Genie . The directors asked Goldberg to animate a Genie over one of Williams ' old stand @-@ up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor . The resulting test , where Williams talking about schizophrenia was translated into Genie growing another head to argue with himself , made Williams " laugh his ass off " and convinced him to sign on for the role . Williams ' appearance in Aladdin ( despite his appearance along with Christian Slater and Tim Curry in the early 1992 animated film FernGully ) marks the beginning of a transition in animated film to celebrity voice actors , rather than specifically trained voice actors in animated film . Williams provided many celebrity impressions during recording sessions , which were re @-@ adapted into the fabric of the character . These included Ed Sullivan , Jack Nicholson , Robert De Niro , Groucho Marx , Rodney Dangerfield , William F. Buckley , Peter Lorre , Arnold Schwarzenegger , and Arsenio Hall . Williams also voices the Peddler , a mysterious merchant who appears at the beginning of the film . After promoting useless goods to the audience , he reveals the magic lamp and begins the story of Aladdin . Bruce Adler supplies his singing voice . The scene was completely unscripted — the production left Williams a table with props covered with a sheet and asked him to pull out objects without looking at them and describe them in @-@ character . The double role originally led to the Peddler revealing to be the Genie disguised , but that idea was later dropped . In October 2015 , Clements and Musker claimed that the Peddler is actually the Genie 's human form . 
 Jonathan Freeman as Jafar , the power @-@ hungry Grand Vizier of Agrabah . Jafar was originally envisioned as an irritable character , but the directors decided that a calm villain would be scarier . Freeman was the first actor cast and spent one year and nine months recording his dialogue . He later readjusted his voice after Weinger and Larkin were cast as he felt " Jafar had to be seen as a real threat to Aladdin and Jasmine " . Jafar 's supervising animator was Andreas Deja , who tried to incorporate Freeman 's facial expressions and gesturing into the character , while Jafar 's beggar and snake forms are animated by Kathy Zielinski . 
 Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine : The princess of Agrabah , who is tired of life in the royal palace . Larkin was chosen nine months after her audition , and had to adjust ( or lower ) her high @-@ pitched voice to reach the voice the filmmakers were looking for in the character . Jasmine 's supervising animator was Mark Henn . Lea Salonga provides Jasmine 's singing voice . 
 Frank Welker as Abu , Aladdin 's kleptomaniac pet monkey with a high @-@ pitched voice . The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study their movements for Abu 's character . In the three years it took to record the film , Welker did not meet Weinger or Williams . Welker also voices Jasmine 's tiger Rajah and the Cave of Wonders . Duncan Marjoribanks was the supervising animator for Abu , while Rajah was animated by Aaron Blaise . 
 Gilbert Gottfried as Iago , Jafar 's sarcastic , foul @-@ mouthed parrot assistant . Iago 's supervising animator Will Finn tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried 's appearance into Iago 's design , especially his semi @-@ closed eyes and the always @-@ appearing teeth . 
 Douglas Seale as The Sultan , the pompous , but kind ruler of Agrabah , who desperately tries to find a suitor for his daughter Jasmine . Some aspects of the character were inspired by the Wizard of Oz , to create a bumbling authority figure . The Sultan 's supervising animator was David Pruiksma . 
 Jim Cummings as <unk> , the Captain of the Guard . He was named after layout supervisor <unk> <unk> . He and the other guards were animated by Phil Young and Chris Wahl . 
 Charlie Adler as <unk> : A thief that Jafar sends into the Cave of Wonders at the beginning of the film but is trapped inside for being unworthy . <unk> was animated by T. Daniel <unk> .

 In 1988 , lyricist Howard Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of Aladdin . Ashman had written a 40 @-@ page film treatment remaining faithful to the plot and characters of the original story , but envisioned as a campy 1930s @-@ style musical with a Cab Calloway / Fats Waller @-@ like Genie . Along with partner Alan Menken , Ashman conceived several songs and added Aladdin 's friends named <unk> , Omar , and Kasim to the story . However , the studio were dismissive of Ashman 's treatment and removed the project from development in which Ashman and Menken were later recruited to compose songs for Beauty and the Beast . Linda Woolverton , who had also worked on Beauty and the Beast , used their treatment and developed a draft with inspired elements from The Thief of Bagdad such as a villain named <unk> 'far , an aged sidekick retired human thief named Abu , and a human handmaiden for the princess . Then , directors John Musker and Ron Clements joined the production , picking Aladdin out of three projects offered , which also included an adaptation of Swan Lake and King of the Jungle – that eventually became The Lion King . Before Ashman 's death in March 1991 , Ashman and Menken had composed " Prince Ali " and his last song , " Humiliate the Boy " . 
 Musker and Clements wrote a draft of the screenplay , and then delivered a story reel to studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg in April 1991 . Katzenberg thought the script " didn 't engage " , and on a day known by the staff as " Black Friday , " demanded that the entire story to be rewritten without rescheduling the film 's November 25 , 1992 release date . Among the changes Katzenberg requested from Clements and Musker were to not be dependent on Ashman 's vision , and the removal of Aladdin 's mother , remarking , " Eighty @-@ six the mother . The mom 's a zero . " Screenwriting duo Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were brought in to rework the story , and the changes they made included the removal of Aladdin 's mother , the strengthening of the character of Princess Jasmine , and the deletion of several of the Ashman @-@ Menken songs . Aladdin 's personality was rewritten to be " a little rougher , like a young Harrison Ford , " and the parrot Iago , originally conceived as an uptight British archetype , was reworked into a comic role after the filmmakers saw Gilbert Gottfried in Beverly Hills Cop II . Gottfried was cast to provide Iago 's voice . By October 1991 , Katzenberg was satisfied with the new version of Aladdin . As with Woolverton 's screenplay , several characters and plot elements are based on the 1940 version of The Thief of Bagdad , the location of the film was changed from Baghdad , Iraq to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah . 
 = = = Design and animation = = = 
 One of the first issues that the animators faced during production of Aladdin was the depiction of Aladdin himself . Director and producer John Musker explains : 
 He was initially going to be as young as 13 , but that eventually changed to eighteen . Aladdin was designed by a team led by supervising animator Glen Keane , and was originally made to resemble actor Michael J. Fox . During production , it was decided that the design was too boyish and wasn 't " appealing enough , " so the character was redesigned to add elements derived from actor Tom Cruise and Calvin Klein models . 
 The design for most characters was based on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld , which production designer Richard Vander Wende also considered appropriate to the theme , due to similarities to the swooping lines of Persian miniatures and Arabic calligraphy . Jafar 's design was not based on Hirschfeld 's work because Jafar 's supervising animator , Andreas Deja , wanted the character to be contrasting . Each character was animated alone , with the animators consulting each other to make scenes with <unk> characters . Since Aladdin 's animator Glen Keane was working in the California branch of Walt Disney Feature Animation , and Jasmine 's animator Mark Henn was in the Florida one at Disney @-@ MGM Studios , they had to frequently phone , fax or send designs and discs to each other . The Magic Carpet is a sentient carpet who is able to fly . Animator Randy Cartwright described working on the Carpet as challenging , since it is only a rectangular shape , who expresses himself through pantomime – " It 's sort of like acting by origami " . Cartwright kept folding a piece of cloth while animating to see how to position the Carpet . After the character animation was done , the carpet 's surface design was applied digitally . 
 For the scenery design , layout supervisor <unk> <unk> took many pictures of his hometown of Isfahan , Iran for guidance . Other inspirations for design were Disney 's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad . The coloring was done with the computerized CAPS process , and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue , the antagonists darker ones such as red and black , and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow . Computer animation was used for some elements of the film , such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave . 
 Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind ; even though Katzenberg suggested actors such as John Candy , Steve Martin , and Eddie Murphy , Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role . Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks in the shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time , Hook and Toys . Unusually for an animated film , much of Williams ' dialogue was ad @-@ libbed : for some scenes , Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions , but allowed to improvise his lines . It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters . Eric Goldberg , the supervising animator for the Genie , then reviewed Williams ' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match . 
 The producers added many in @-@ jokes and references to Disney 's previous works in the film , such as a " cameo appearance " from directors Clements and Musker and drawing some characters based on Disney workers . Beast , Sebastian from The Little Mermaid , and Pinocchio make brief appearances , and the wardrobe of the Genie at the end of the film — Goofy hat , Hawaiian shirt , and sandals — are a reference to a short film that Robin Williams did for the Disney @-@ MGM Studios tour in the late 1980s . 
 = = = Robin Williams ' conflicts with the studio = = = 
 In gratitude for his success with Touchstone Pictures ' Good Morning , Vietnam , Robin Williams voiced the Genie for SAG scale pay ( $ 75 @,@ 000 ) , on condition that his name or image not be used for marketing , and his ( supporting ) character not take more than 25 % of space on advertising artwork , since Williams ' film Toys was scheduled for release one month after Aladdin 's debut . For financial reasons , the studio went back on the deal on both counts , especially in poster art by having the Genie in 25 % of the image , but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller . The Disney Hyperion book Aladdin : The Making of an Animated Film listed both of Williams ' characters " The Peddler " and " The Genie " ahead of main characters , but was forced to refer to him only as " the actor signed to play the Genie " . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is " consistently good , rivaling the best of Disney 's other animated musicals from the ' 90s . " Menken and Ashman began work on the film together , with Rice taking over as lyricist after Ashman died of AIDS @-@ related complications in early 1991 . Although fourteen songs were written for Aladdin , only six are featured in the movie , three by each lyricist . The DVD Special Edition released in 2004 includes four songs in early animations tests , and a music video of one , " Proud of Your Boy " , performed by Clay Aiken , which also appears on the album DisneyMania 3 . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The filmmakers thought the moral message of the original tale was not appropriate , and decided to " put a spin on it " , by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great thing , but eventually becoming a problem . Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not – both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble faking to be different people , and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine , who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is . Being " imprisoned " is also discussed , a fate that occurs to most of the characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are stuck to their lifestyles , Genie is attached to his lamp and Jafar , to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison @-@ like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace , and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees . Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess , being rebellious to the royal life and the social structure , and trying to make her own way , unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue .

The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned @-@ up animation , prepared for Aladdin 's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003 , and a second disc with bonus features . Accompanied by a $ 19 million marketing campaign , the DVD sold about 3 million units in its first month , but it was less than the number of copies , sold in that amount of time , by any other Platinum Edition released before it . The film 's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5 @.@ 1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix . The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008 , along with its sequels . 
 According to an insert in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case , Aladdin was going to be released on Blu @-@ ray Disc as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013 . Instead , Peter Pan was released on Blu @-@ ray as a Diamond Edition on February 5 , 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary . A non @-@ Diamond Edition Blu @-@ ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013 . The Belgian edition ( released without advertisements , commercials or any kind of fanfare ) comes as a 1 @-@ disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD ) . The same disc was released in the United Kingdom on April 14 , 2013 . Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on a Diamond Edition Blu @-@ ray on October 13 , 2015 . The film was released on Digital HD on September 29 , 2015 .

 = = = Controversies = = = 
 One of the verses of the opening song " Arabian Nights " was altered following protests from the American @-@ Arab Anti @-@ Discrimination Committee ( ADC ) . The lyrics were changed in July 1993 from " Where they cut off your ear if they don 't like your face , " in the original release to " Where it 's flat and immense and the heat is intense . " The change first appeared on the 1993 video release . The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release , but the re @-@ release uses the edited lyric . The rerecording has the original voice on all other lines and then a noticeably deeper voice says the edited line . The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line . Entertainment Weekly ranked Aladdin in a list of the most controversial films in history , due to this incident . The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine . They criticized the characters ' Anglicized features and Anglo @-@ American accents , in contrast to the other characters in the film , which are dark @-@ skinned , have foreign accents and grotesque facial features , and appear villainous or greedy . 
 Protests were also raised to another scene . When Aladdin is attacked by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony , Aladdin quietly says a line that some people reported hearing as " Good teenagers , take off your clothes , " which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity . However , according to the director 's commentary on the 2004 DVD , while Musker and Clements did admit Scott Weinger ad @-@ libbed during the scene , they claimed " we did not record that , we would not record that . " and said the line was " Good tiger , take off and go ... " and the word " tiger " is overlapped by Rajah 's snarl . After the word tiger , a second voice can be heard which has been suggested was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack . Because of the controversy , Disney removed the line on the DVD release . 
 Animation enthusiasts have noticed similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams ' unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler ( also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International ) . These similarities include a similar plot , similar characters , scenes and background designs , and the antagonist Zig @-@ Zag 's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar . Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler , The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s , its production being mired in difficulties including financial problems , copyright issues , and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work . The late release , coupled with Miramax purchasing and re @-@ editing the film , has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a copy of Aladdin .

 Martin Gélinas ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ] ; born June 5 , 1970 ) is a Canadian former ice hockey forward who played 1 @,@ 273 games in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the Edmonton Oilers , Quebec Nordiques , Vancouver Canucks , Carolina Hurricanes , Calgary Flames , Florida Panthers and Nashville Predators . A first round selection of the Los Angeles Kings , 7th overall , at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft , Gélinas never played for the team as he was included in one of the most significant trades in NHL history while he was still playing junior hockey for the Hull Olympiques . He was sent to the Oilers as a part of the Wayne Gretzky trade in 1988 . 
 Gélinas reached the Stanley Cup finals with four teams . He was a member of Edmonton 's 1990 championship team and also reached the final in 1994 with Vancouver , 2002 with Carolina and 2004 with Calgary . He tied a record in 2004 by scoring three series @-@ winning goals in one playoff year , earning the nickname " The Eliminator " . After playing his final professional season with SC Bern in the Swiss National League A ( NLA ) , Gélinas turned to coaching and player development . He was named an assistant coach with the Calgary Flames in 2012 .

 = = = Junior = = = 
 Gélinas played two seasons of junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) for the Hull Olympiques between 1987 and 1989 . He scored 101 goals and 107 assists in 106 games . In his first year , 1987 – 88 , Gélinas finished 10th in QMJHL scoring with 131 points . He won the Michel Bergeron Trophy as offensive rookie of the year and was named Canadian Hockey League rookie of the year in addition to being named a QMJHL first @-@ team all @-@ star . Gélinas added 32 points in 17 playoff games as the Olympiques defeated the Drummondville Voltigeurs in the final to win the President 's Cup . At the 1988 Memorial Cup , Gélinas won the George Parsons Trophy as the most sportsmanlike player of the tournament . 
 The National Hockey League ( NHL ) Central Scouting Bureau ranked Gélinas as the eighth best prospect at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft . He was selected by the Los Angeles Kings with the seventh overall pick . Gélinas never played for the Kings as on August 9 , 1988 , he was included in one of the most significant trades in NHL history . The Edmonton Oilers sent Wayne Gretzky , Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley to the Kings in exchange for Gelinas , Jimmy Carson , three first round draft picks and $ 15 million in cash . 
 As one of the key players coming to Edmonton in what he later called " the biggest trade in sports history " , Gélinas endured the scrutiny of the Canadian media and pressure created by angry and disappointed fans after the Oilers dealt away a player in Gretzky who was considered a national icon . Gélinas began the 1988 – 89 season with the Oilers and made his NHL debut and scored his first point , on an assist , on October 7 , 1988 , against the New York Islanders . He scored his first goal ten days later against Jon Casey of the Minnesota North Stars but he was returned to Hull after six games to complete his second season of junior hockey . Making his international debut , Gélinas played with the Canadian national junior team at the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships . He recorded two assists in seven games for the fourth place Canadians . 
 = = = Edmonton , Vancouver and Carolina = = = 
 Joining the Oilers full @-@ time in 1989 – 90 , Gélinas recorded 25 points in 46 games . At the age of 19 , he was a member of Edmonton 's " Kid Line " playing alongside 22 @-@ year @-@ olds Joe Murphy and Adam Graves . The trio provided an offensive boost in the post @-@ season as the Oilers reached the 1990 Stanley Cup Final against the Boston Bruins . Edmonton won the best @-@ of @-@ seven championship series four games to one and captured the Stanley Cup . After recording 40 points in 1990 – 91 , Gélinas scored only 29 points the following season . The Quebec Nordiques , who had been criticized by local fans and media for failing to select Gélinas at the 1988 draft , attempted to acquire him in exchange for Bryan Fogarty . The deal failed to materialize and Gélinas remained with the Oilers for the 1992 – 93 season where his offensive production again declined , to 23 points . 
 The Nordiques finally acquired Gélinas on June 20 , 1993 , in exchange for Scott Pearson . He lasted only 31 games with Quebec before being placed on waivers and claimed by the Vancouver Canucks . After scoring 16 points in 33 games to end the 1993 – 94 regular season with Vancouver , Gélinas added nine points in 24 playoff games . The Canucks reached the 1994 Stanley Cup Final but were defeated in seven games by the New York Rangers . In the lockout @-@ shortened 1994 – 95 season , he scored 23 points in 46 games and won his first of two consecutive Fred J. Hume Awards as Vancouver 's " unsung hero " . Gélinas finally achieved the offensive production expected of him when he was drafted by recording consecutive 30 @-@ goal seasons . He scored 30 goals in 1995 – 96 and led the Canucks with 35 goals , was second to Alexander Mogilny with 68 points and recorded a four @-@ goal game against the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 – 97 . He won three team awards : The Cyclone Taylor Award as Vancouver 's most valuable player , the Molson Cup for earning the most three star selections and the Most Exciting Player Award . 
 A collision with Edmonton 's Dan McGillis early in the 1997 – 98 season forced Gélinas out of the lineup with a sprained knee . He missed 16 games due to the injury and had only eight points in 24 games played . His tenure with the Canucks ended January 3 , 1998 . He was traded , along with Kirk McLean to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Sean Burke , Geoff Sanderson and Enrico Ciccone . Gélinas was added to Carolina 's roster to add a physical presence to the team and improve the team at both ends of the ice . He finished the season with 24 points in 40 games with the Hurricanes , and was invited to join Team Canada for the 1998 World Championship . Gélinas scored one goal for the sixth @-@ place Canadians . 
 Placed in a defensive role , Gélinas 's offensive statistics fell to 28 points in 1998 – 99 and 30 in 1999 – 2000 . The Hurricanes placed him on waivers late in the latter season , but remained with the team after he went unclaimed . His teammates expressed relief that he hadn 't been moved the following season as , after improving to 59 points , Gélinas scored the game @-@ winning goal to clinch a playoff spot for Carolina . He recorded only one assist in six post @-@ season games , then accepted a lessened role with the Hurricanes as he was placed on the third line in 2001 – 02 . Gélinas led the Hurricanes to their first Stanley Cup Final in franchise history after scoring the overtime @-@ winning goal in the sixth game of the Eastern Conference final to eliminate the Toronto Maple Leafs . Carolina fell to the Detroit Red Wings in five games in the 2002 Stanley Cup Final . 
 = = = Calgary , Florida and Nashville = = = 
 Gélinas chose to decline his contract option for 2002 – 03 and left Carolina as a free agent . He signed a contract with the Calgary Flames on July 2 , 2002 . A 52 @-@ point season was fourth best on the Flames and included his 500th career point , a game @-@ winning goal against the Detroit Red Wings on January 25 , 2003 . Gélinas reached another career milestone during the 2003 – 04 season as he played in his 1,000th NHL game on December 9 against the Minnesota Wild . His 35 points on the season was again fourth @-@ best on the team . 
 In qualifying for the 2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs , the Flames reached the post @-@ season for the first time in eight seasons . With eight goals and 15 points in the playoffs , Gélinas emerged as one of Calgary 's post @-@ season heroes . He scored the series @-@ winning goal in overtime of game seven of the Flames ' first round series against Vancouver . The victory advanced Calgary to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in 15 years . Gélinas also scored the overtime goal that eliminated Detroit in six games , which made him the first player in NHL history to score three series @-@ winning goals in overtime . He then became the second player in NHL history to score three series @-@ clinching goals in one playoff year by tallying the goal that eliminated the San Jose Sharks and propelled the Flames into the 2004 Stanley Cup Final . His heroics throughout the post @-@ season resulted in Gélinas being called " the Eliminator " . 
 The Flames ' Cinderella run ended in the final as the Tampa Bay Lightning won the series in seven games . The result was controversial as Gélinas appeared to have scored the tie @-@ breaking goal in the sixth game that would have won the Stanley Cup for Calgary had the score held up . Television replays of the play showed that the puck deflected off Gélinas ' skate and appeared to be across the goal line before Tampa goaltender Nikolai <unk> kicked it out of the net . The referees did not signal a goal , however , and no video review was requested . Tampa Bay went on to win the game in overtime . 
 As the 2004 – 05 NHL season went unplayed due to a labour dispute , Gélinas spent the season in Switzerland . He played one regular season and five playoff games with HC Lugano in the <unk> A ( NLA ) , but otherwise spent the season with HC Forward @-@ <unk> in the <unk> B ( NLB ) where he scored 37 goals in 41 games and recorded 58 points . A free agent when the NHL resumed play in 2005 – 06 , Gélinas signed a two @-@ year contract with the Florida Panthers . Brought in as a capable veteran , he played all 82 games for Florida and scored over 40 points in each season . Gélinas scored his 300th career goal in Florida 's final game of the 2006 – 07 season . 
 Leaving Florida , Gélinas signed with the Nashville Predators for the 2007 – 08 season . He had 20 points in 57 games before suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament in February 21 , 2008 , game against the Vancouver Canucks that was ultimately his final contest in the NHL . Gélinas returned to Switzerland 2008 – 09 as he signed a contract to play with SC Bern in the NLA . In 27 games , he scored 15 goals and 22 points . He retired following the season . In his NHL career , Gélinas played 1 @,@ 273 regular season games and added 147 in the playoffs .

 The Guardian Legend , known in Japan as Guardic Gaiden ( <unk> , <unk> Gaiden ) , is a 1988 hybrid action @-@ adventure / shoot ' em up video game developed by Compile for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . It is the sequel to the 1986 MSX game Guardic , and was published and released in Japan by Irem in 1988 , in North America by Brøderbund in 1989 , and in Europe by Nintendo in 1990 . 
 In the game , the player controls a lone protagonist , the Guardian , who is on a quest to destroy a large alien @-@ infested world named Naju before it reaches the planet Earth . The player must deactivate ten safety devices scattered throughout Naju , thus activating the alien world 's self @-@ destruct sequence . The player explores Naju in a non @-@ linear fashion and can acquire different weapons during the course of the game . 
 The Guardian Legend received mixed reviews from magazines such as Electronic Gaming Monthly and Nintendo Power . While it has been praised for its impressive graphics , memorable sound , and responsive controls , it has been criticized for its repetitive gameplay and complicated password system . 
 The game received little fanfare upon its release , but it has since been considered a classic example of a multiple @-@ genre game that set a standard for others such as the title Sigma Star Saga and incorporated gameplay elements from other titles such as The Legend of Zelda , Metroid , and 1942 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In The Guardian Legend , the player controls the gynoid guardian of Earth , a " highly sophisticated <unk> transformer " . The player 's mission is to infiltrate Naju , a large planet @-@ like object which aliens sent hurtling towards the Earth . While inside , the player must activate ten safety devices in order to initialize Naju 's self @-@ destruct mechanism and destroy the alien world before it reaches Earth . Five hostile tribes of alien lifeforms are vying for control of territories within Naju , and the player needs to fight through them to successfully activate the switches and escape . 
 The story is advanced through a series of messages left by one or more unidentified predecessor ( s ) who unsuccessfully attempted to engage the self @-@ destruct mechanism of Naju before the Guardian arrived . Left by the sole remaining survivor of the attack on Naju , the first message serves as an introduction ; later messages give hints that help the player open locked corridors . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Gameplay varies depending on the player 's location within Naju . The player controls the Guardian in humanoid form when exploring the surface of Naju ( the Labyrinth ) and in spaceship form when investigating Naju 's interior ( the Dungeon ) . The Guardian has a life meter that decreases after sustaining damage from enemies ; it can be replenished by collecting various items . If the life meter runs out , the Guardian explodes , and the game ends . The player can use a primary rapid @-@ fire weapon with unlimited ammunition as well as various powerful secondary weapons that consume " power chips " with each use . Power chips are also used as currency to purchase upgrades for the Guardian in a handful of shops throughout Naju . Found within the Labyrinth or obtained after defeating a boss , these upgrades include primary weapon improvements , new or upgraded secondary weapons , and round , brightly colored creatures called Landers . 
 Blue and Red Landers , recurring characters in many Compile games , increase the player 's maximum life and power chip capacities , respectively . Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend . Some of them are not items but non @-@ player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips ; others provide a password that allows the player to resume the game at a later time with their progress retained . These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints ; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off . 
 In the action @-@ adventure portion of the game known as the " Labyrinth " , the player explores the surface of Naju in humanoid form in a top @-@ down perspective . The player must navigate the Labyrinth and find and infiltrate the corridors and ultimately activate Naju 's ten safety devices . The Labyrinth consists of screen @-@ wide passages and rooms individually plotted as X – Y coordinates . A map that details these coordinates in a grid @-@ like form can be viewed on the pause <unk> . While the player can generally walk from one screen to the next , some screens are separated by portals called " warp panels " . Warp panels bear a symbol indicative of their surrounding area , and the player can only access these warp panels with keys that match these symbols . Some warp panels lead to rooms containing various clues and story elements while others are gateways to shops , password rooms , and corridors . Keys allow players to access different portions of the Labyrinth , which they can then explore in a non @-@ linear fashion . 
 In the shoot ' em up portion of the game known as the " Dungeon " , the player battles through Naju 's interior in spaceship form . The Dungeon consists of a series of enemy @-@ filled corridors which are found during exploration of the Labyrinth . The player 's objective in the Dungeon is to progress through each corridor and defeat the boss at the end . Upon completion , the player destroys the corridor and is returned to the Labyrinth , where a power @-@ up ( and sometimes a warp panel key ) is collected as a reward . While some corridors can be accessed freely , others can only be entered by performing a particular action in the corridor room . Some rooms in the Labyrinth contain clues that indicate how to unseal these corridors . Ten of the corridors in the game serve as the safety devices which must be deactivated to win the game .

 The Guardian Legend was developed for the Nintendo Famicom by Compile as the sequel to the 1986 MSX game Guardic , and it was released as Guardic Gaiden in Japan by Irem on February 5 , 1988 ( 1988 @-@ 02 @-@ 05 ) . The director was Masamitsu " Moo " <unk> , Compile 's president and the creator of the Puyo Puyo series . The development team featured many of the staff who helped create Guardic as well as Zanac and Blazing Lazers . The box art for Guardic Gaiden was created by Japanese science @-@ fiction illustrator Naoyuki Kato and depicts the Guardian as a female cyborg . The Guardian Legend was released for the NES and released in North America by Brøderbund in April 1989 ; it was published in Europe by Nintendo in 1990 . Nintendo Power previewed The Guardian Legend in January 1989 , where they discussed the game 's mechanics , graphics , and shoot ' em up sequences . They promised a full review in the following issue , but it was postponed due to a delay of the game 's release . The Guardian Legend was exhibited at the 1989 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Nevada before its release ; it was one of the prime attractions at the Brøderbund booth along with the U @-@ Force controller . In 1990 , remaining inventory of The Guardian Legend was among the assets Brøderbund sold to THQ along with the rest of its New Ventures Division .

 The game has received both praise and criticism for its multiple @-@ genre format . It was reviewed by four people in a 1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly shortly after the release of the game in 1989 . Steve Harris said that the game does more than most shoot ' em ups and that it 's a " good follow @-@ up for Zanac fans " . He added that the multiple @-@ genre format " helps elevate the whole title to a much higher level " . Ed Semrad called the game a Blaster Master clone and " only average at best " , and he echoed Harris ' opinion that those who enjoyed Zanac would enjoy The Guardian Legend . Donn Nauert said that the game is repetitive and offers little challenge and that it would have been better as a pure shoot ' em up ; he pointed to a special password ( " <unk> " ) in which players can enter to bypass all of the Labyrinth portions . Jim Allee also compared the game to Zanac and repeated what Nauert said about the lack of difficulty except in the boss battles ; he overall praised the game for successfully bringing together two distinct themes . 
 The Guardian Legend received accolades from the editors of Nintendo Power . The game appeared in the magazine 's September 1989 issue , where it debuted at # 9 on its " Top 30 " NES Chart . The editors praised the game , and described the protagonist as " the ultimate transforming hero " . The game would remain on the chart for nearly a year . In recognition of its achievements , the magazine 's editors and staff nominated the game for several awards in its first @-@ ever Nintendo Power Awards for 1989 — among them , " Best Graphics & Sound " , " Best Play Control " , and " Best Overall " — but the game did not win the top award in any of these categories . Nintendo Power published a partial walkthrough for the game in the following November 1989 issue . 
 The game received moderate praise in some German gaming magazines after its European release . In Video Games magazine the reviewer praised the game as being a good action @-@ adventure game in the same style of The Legend of Zelda ; he notes that the need to find hidden items and areas and the top @-@ down perspective closely resemble the Nintendo classic . He appreciated the variety and extras in the game , the various strategies needed to fight bosses , its difficulty , and the well @-@ done graphics . The reviewers from Power Play compared The Guardian Legend to The Legend of Zelda and Life Force . They praised the diverse gameplay and weapons , difficulty , and the mixture of action @-@ adventure and shoot ' em up elements . They criticized the game for lacking battery @-@ backed RAM to save player progress — one of the reviewers said that " the wretched fumbling with the password had long ended " — as well as its lack of challenging puzzles and a high difficulty level in some of the shoot ' em up sections .

 The game continued to receive praise from major game reviewers over a decade since its release . Lucas Thomas of the Evansville Courier & Press favorably compared The Guardian Legend with the NES title The Legend of Zelda and the Game Boy Advance title Sigma Star Saga ; he emphasized Compile 's successful fusion of the action @-@ adventure , shoot ' em up and action role @-@ playing game genres . Later , in a 2008 IGN article , Thomas listed the game at # 2 on his " Top 10 Unreleased NES Hits " list and contended that The Guardian Legend took the concept of the multiple @-@ genre game to a farther extent than Blaster Master . In October 2009 , IGN ranked The Guardian Legend as # 87 on its " Top 100 NES Games of All Time " list and deemed it " one of the most influential games in the history of the gaming industry " . In March 2008 , Game Informer editors referred to the game as " the ultimate genre bender " and likened it to a combination of the NES games The Legend of Zelda , Metroid , and 1942 . While they acclaimed the game for its " exciting and challenging " shooter stages , they criticized it for its complex world map and " outrageous " password system . In a Gamasutra interview , Retro Game Challenge designer Mike Engler said that " The Guardian Legend is one of the best games ever released " . 
 The graphics and sound of The Guardian Legend have been influential . Robert Dewar and Matthew <unk> of the open computing magazine Open Systems Today cited the game as an example of how graphics co @-@ processors such as those in the NES can compensate for inadequate CPU speed in graphics @-@ intensive computer applications . They noted that the fast @-@ paced action seen in the game could not be replicated on a personal computer at that time ( 1992 ) without an expensive graphics board and regardless of CPU speed . The music of the game , composed by <unk> Miyamoto and Takeshi Santo , has remained popular years after the game 's release . Samantha <unk> of the Melbourne @-@ based newspaper The Herald Sun reported that a remixed tune from the game was rated as the second most popular track on the website OverClocked ReMix in March 2002 . Video game cover band The Advantage 's 2006 album Elf Titled featured a cover version of music from one of the game 's dungeon levels . 
 = Hiyō @-@ class aircraft carrier = 
 The two Hiyō @-@ class aircraft carriers ( <unk> , Hiyō @-@ gata <unk> ) were built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during World War II . Both ships of the class , Hiyō and Junyō , were originally laid down as luxury passenger liners before being acquired by the IJN for conversion to aircraft carriers in 1941 . Junyō was the first of the sister ship to be completed in May 1942 and the ship participated in the invasion of the Aleutian Islands the following month . Both ships participated in several battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign in late 1942 . Their aircraft were disembarked several times and used from land bases in a number of battles in the South West Pacific . 
 Hiyō was torpedoed in June 1943 and Junyō in November ; both ships spent about three months under repair . They spent most of the time after their repairs training and ferrying aircraft before returning to combat . Hiyō was sunk by a gasoline vapor explosion caused by an American torpedo hit during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid @-@ 1944 while Junyō was damaged by several bombs . Lacking aircraft , she was used as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed in December . The ship was under repair until March 1945 when the repairs were deemed uneconomical . Junyō was then effectively hulked for the rest of the war . The ship was deemed not worth the cost to repair by the Americans after the surrender of Japan in September and she was broken up in 1946 – 47 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The ships were ordered as the fast luxury passenger liners Izumo Maru and Kashiwara Maru by Nippon Yusen Kaisha ( Japan Mail Steamship Company @-@ NYK ) in late 1938 . In exchange for a 60 % subsidy of their building costs by the Navy Ministry , they were designed to be converted to aircraft carriers . To facilitate this process , they were fitted with a double hull , additional fuel oil capacity , provisions for the fitting of additional transverse and longitudinal bulkheads , installation of a longitudinal bulkhead to separate the turbine rooms , a strengthened main deck , more height between decks , rearrangement of the superstructure and passenger accommodations to facilitate the installation of aircraft elevators and hangars , more space for additional wiring , installation of a bulbous bow and the addition of aviation gasoline storage tanks fore and aft of the machinery spaces . NYK was only interested in a maximum speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) to save fuel , but the Navy wanted a maximum speed of no less than 25 @.@ 5 knots ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) so they compromised by limiting the performance of the turbines to 80 % of maximum power during peacetime . 
 The ships had a length of about 219 @.@ 32 meters ( 719 ft 7 in ) overall . They had a beam of 26 @.@ 7 meters ( 87 ft 7 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 15 meters ( 26 ft 9 in ) . They displaced 24 @,@ 150 metric tons ( 23 @,@ 770 long tons ) at standard load . Their crew ranged from 1 @,@ 187 to 1 @,@ 224 officers and enlisted men . 
 Both ships were fitted with two Mitsubishi @-@ Curtis geared steam turbine sets with a total of 56 @,@ 250 shaft horsepower ( 41 @,@ 950 kW ) , each driving a 5 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 18 ft ) propeller . Steam was provided by six water @-@ tube boilers ; Junyō had Mitsubishi three @-@ drum boilers that operated at a pressure of 40 kg / cm2 ( 3 @,@ 923 kPa ; 569 psi ) and temperature of 420 ° C ( 788 ° F ) while Hiyō had Kawasaki @-@ La Mont boilers . Their machinery , designed for merchant service , was over four times heavier than that of the purpose @-@ built aircraft carrier Hiryū . The ships had a designed speed of 25 @.@ 5 knots , but both exceeded that by small margins during sea trials . They carried 4 @,@ 100 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 000 long tons ) of fuel oil which gave them a range of 11 @,@ 700 nautical miles ( 21 @,@ 700 km ; 13 @,@ 500 mi ) or more at 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 = = = Flight deck arrangements = = = 
 The flight deck was 210 @.@ 3 meters ( 690 ft 0 in ) long and had a maximum width of 27 @.@ 3 meters ( 89 ft 7 in ) . A large island was fitted on the starboard side that , for the first time in a Japanese carrier , was integrated with the ship 's funnel . This was angled 26 ° outwards to help keep its exhaust from interfering with flight operations . The ships were designed with two superimposed hangars , each approximately 153 meters ( 502 ft 0 in ) long , 15 meters ( 49 ft 3 in ) wide and 5 meters ( 16 ft 5 in ) high . Each hangar could be subdivided by four fire curtains and they were fitted with fire fighting foam dispensers on each side . The hangars were served by two square elevators with rounded corners , 14 @.@ 03 meters ( 46 ft 0 in ) on each side . The elevators had a maximum capacity of 5 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 11 @,@ 000 lb ) and took 15 seconds to go from the lower hangar to the flight deck . The ships were fitted with electrically operated Kure type model 4 arresting gear with nine cables . They also mounted two Type 3 crash barricades . No aircraft catapult was fitted . The ships mounted a crane on the port side of the flight deck , just aft of the rear elevator . When collapsed , it was flush with the flight deck . 
 Their air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M " Claude " fighters , plus 4 in storage , 18 Aichi D3A " Val " dive bombers , with an additional 2 in reserve , and 18 Nakajima B5N " Kate " torpedo bombers . This was revised to substitute a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters , plus 3 in storage , for the A5Ms by the time the ship commissioned in 1942 . As a result of the lessons learned from the Battle of Midway in June , the ships ' fighter complement was strengthened to 21 Zeros , and the other aircraft reduced to 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns . By the end of the year , 6 more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As . Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars , 8 or 9 were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce crowding below decks . 
 = = = Armor , armament and sensors = = = 
 As a conversion from an ocean liner , it was not possible to add much armor , although the ships had a double hull . Two plates of Ducol steel , each 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick , protected the sides of the ships ' machinery spaces . Their aviation gasoline tanks and magazines were protected by one layer of Ducol steel . In addition , their machinery spaces were further subdivided by transverse and longitudinal bulkheads to limit any flooding . 
 The primary armament consisted of a dozen 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm Type 89 anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull . They fired 23 @.@ 45 @-@ kilogram ( 51 @.@ 7 lb ) projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of 700 – 725 m / s ( 2 @,@ 300 – 2 @,@ 380 ft / s ) ; at 45 ° , this provided a maximum range of 14 @,@ 800 meters ( 16 @,@ 200 yd ) , and a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 400 meters ( 30 @,@ 800 ft ) . The ships were also initially equipped with eight triple 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns , also in sponsons along the sides of the hull . They fired .25 @-@ kilogram ( 0 @.@ 55 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 900 m / s ( 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 7 @,@ 500 meters ( 8 @,@ 202 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 meters ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at + 85 ° . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . In mid @-@ 1943 , four more triple mounts were added and another four triple mounts in late 1943 – early 1944 . Two of these last four mounts were mounted on the stern and the others were placed in front of and behind the island . A dozen single mounts were also added , some of which were portable and could be mounted on tie @-@ down points on the flight deck . After the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 , Junyō 's anti @-@ aircraft armament was reinforced with three more triple mounts , two twin mounts and 18 single mounts for the 25 mm Type 96 gun . These guns were supplemented by six 28 @-@ round AA rocket launchers . Each 12 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) rocket weighed 22 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 50 lb ) and had a maximum velocity of 200 m / s ( 660 ft / s ) . Their maximum range was 4 @,@ 800 meters ( 5 @,@ 200 yd ) . In October 1944 , Junyō had a total of 91 25 mm barrels ; 57 in 19 triple mounts , four in two twin mounts , and 30 single mounts . 
 Two Type 94 high @-@ angle fire @-@ control directors , one on each side of the ship , were fitted to control the Type 89 guns . Each director mounted a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 14 ft 9 in ) rangefinder . When Junyō first commissioned only the rangefinders were fitted and the directors were added later . Four Type 95 directors controlled the 25 mm guns and another pair were added in early 1943 . Early warning was provided by two Type 2 , Mark 2 , Model 1 air search radars . The first of these was mounted on the top of the island in mid- to late 1942 on each ship , and the other was added during 1943 . This latter system was fitted on the port side of the hull , outboard of the rear elevator . A smaller Type 3 , Mark 1 , Model 3 air search radar was added in 1944 on Junyō .

 The ships were purchased on 10 February 1941 by the Navy Ministry for the price of ¥ 48 @,@ 346 @,@ 000 and their armament and aircraft cost an additional ¥ 27 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 . The cost to convert the two ships was budgeted at ¥ 38 @,@ 073 @,@ 000 , for a grand total of ¥ 114 @,@ 219 @,@ 000 . Kashiwara Maru and Izumo Maru were temporarily referred to as No. 1001 Ship ( Dai 1001 bankan ) and No. 1002 Ship respectively to keep their conversions secret . Junyō was initially classified as an auxiliary aircraft carrier ( <unk> <unk> ) , but following the loss of four Japanese fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway , she was redesignated as a regular carrier ( <unk> ) in July ; Hiyō , completed after the loss of the carriers , received that designation from the beginning . 
 Despite being launched several days after Hiyō , Junyō was the first of the pair to be commissioned in May 1942 . She was assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet , together with Ryūjō . The ship was tasked to support the invasion of the Aleutian Islands , a diversionary thrust in support of the attack on Midway . Junyō carried 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this operation . The ship launched her first airstrike at dawn on 3 June against Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island . She accomplished little during this operation , losing 5 aircraft to all causes , and her own aircraft only shot down 5 American aircraft . 
 Upon arrival at Truk on 9 October , the two sisters were assigned to the Second Carrier Division to begin operations against American forces in the Guadalcanal area as part of the 3rd Fleet . On 15 October , the two carriers reached the vicinity of Malaita Island in the Solomon Islands and their aircraft discovered a resupply convoy for Guadalcanal that was escorted by the destroyer Meredith . Their aircraft attacked and sank the destroyer . The next day , they found the small seaplane tender , McFarland , in Lunga Roads offloading avgas into barges . Dive bombers from the sisters blew the ship 's stern off , but failed to sink McFarland . The two carriers were intended to play a prominent role in the Japanese effort to retake Guadalcanal Island and were assigned to the Advance Force for this operation . Their aircraft were supposed to provide air cover after the Japanese night attack that retook Henderson Field and then they were to be flown ashore , but Hiyō 's machinery problems caused her to return to Truk . Some of her aircraft were transferred to her sister before she departed . 
 In late October 1942 , during the Guadalcanal Campaign , Junyō took part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands . At this time , her air group consisted of 18 Zeros , 18 D3As and 9 B5Ns . Her aircraft made hits on the carrier Hornet , the battleship South Dakota and the light cruiser San Juan , but inflicted little substantial damage . A torpedo hit from one of her B5Ns , however , did force the Americans to abandon their effort to repair Hornet . During this time , Hiyō 's remaining aircraft flew to Rabaul on 23 October where they provided air cover for Japanese forces on Guadalcanal . A detachment from the air group was transferred to Buin , Papua New Guinea on 1 November and participated in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal later in the month . Those aircraft that remained at Rabaul flew back to Truk by 11 November , but the Buin detachment was ferried back to Japan on 14 December . 
 In mid @-@ November 1942 , Junyō was tasked to provide air cover for the convoy bringing reinforcements for the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal during the three @-@ day @-@ long Naval Battle of Guadalcanal . The ship 's fighters were unable to do so ; seven transports were sunk and the remaining four transports were damaged . In December 1942 – January 1943 , the carrier covered several convoys that brought reinforcements to Wewak , New Guinea and her air group was based there for several days to protect the forces there before returning to Truk on 20 January . The ship then covered the evacuation of forces from Guadalcanal through early February . 
 Hiyō had returned to Japan in December and Junyō followed in February . Both ships returned to Truk in late March and their air groups were detached from in early April to participate in Operation I @-@ Go , a land @-@ based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea . The ships returned to Japan in late May and sailed for Truk on 7 June , but Hiyō was torpedoed that evening and forced to return to port for repairs . Her fighters were flown to Truk by 15 July and assigned to the light carrier Ryūhō . The ship was under repair at Yokosuka until 15 September . Junyō 's air group was deployed to Buin , Papua New Guinea on 2 July in response the American invasion of Rendova Island on 30 June . Leaving her aircraft behind , the carrier returned to Japan in late July . 
 Junyō ferried aircraft to Singapore in mid @-@ August and troops and equipment to the Caroline Islands the following month . On 5 November 1943 , she was hit by a torpedo , but the damage was light , other than the disabled rudder . The ship was under repair and refit until 29 February 1944 at Kure . The air groups of both carriers were reconstituted at Singapore on 1 November . The aircraft transferred to Truk on 1 December and then to Kavieng at the end of December before reaching Rabaul on 25 January 1944 ; the survivors were back at Truk on 20 February and the air group was disbanded . 
 Hiyō departed Japan for Singapore on 24 November . She arrived on 3 December and was almost immediately assigned duties as an aircraft ferry until January when the ship returned to Japan . In the meantime , the Japanese Navy had restructured its carrier air groups so that one air group was assigned to one carrier division and Air Group 652 was assigned to the 2nd Carrier Division with Hiyō , Junyō and Ryūhō on 1 March . The air group was last in priority to be rebuilt and only had 30 Model 21 Zeros , 13 Model 52 Zeros and 4 D3As on hand on 1 April of its authorized 81 fighters , 36 dive bombers and 27 torpedo bombers . The ships conducted training for their aircraft in the Inland Sea until 11 May when she sailed for Tawi @-@ Tawi in the Philippines . The new base was closer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands where the Japanese expected the next American attack . However , the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots and American submarines were very active in the vicinity which restricted the ships to the anchorage . 
 = = = Battle of the Philippine Sea = = = 
 The Japanese fleet was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June , where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines , when Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa learned of the American attack on the Mariana Islands the previous day . Upon reaching Guimares , the fleet refuelled and sortied into the Philippine Sea where they spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June . The Americans failed to locate Ozawa 's ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided on launching his air strikes early the following morning . At this time , Air Group 652 consisted 81 Zeros , 27 D3As , 9 Yokosuka D4Y " Judy " dive bombers and 18 Nakajima B6N " Jill " torpedo bombers , roughly evenly divided among the three ships . The three carriers launched multiple air strikes against the American ships , but generally failed to locate them and did not inflict any damage while losing most of their aircraft . 
 At dusk , the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance . They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon of the following day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched . Hiyō was struck by two bombs , one of which detonated above the bridge and killed or wounded virtually everyone there . More seriously , the ship was struck by one torpedo dropped by a Grumman TBF Avenger from Belleau Wood . This knocked out the starboard engine room and started fires , but Hiyō was able to continue , albeit a slower speed . Two hours later , a large explosion occurred when leaking gasoline vapor ignited and it knocked out all power on the ship . The fires raged out of control and Hiyō sank stern first shortly afterwards at 16 ° 20 ′ N 132 ° 32 ′ E. Roughly 1 @,@ 000 men were rescued by her escorting destroyers , but 247 officers and enlisted men died aboard the carrier . 
 Junyō was hit by two bombs near her island . The ship was not badly damaged , but the damage did stop flight operations . Air Group 652 claimed 2 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 9 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers shot down , but lost 11 aircraft , plus another 3 that had to ditch . By the end of the battle , the air group only consisted of 11 <unk> , 5 <unk> and 1 B6N and it was disbanded on 10 July . Most of its remaining personnel were assigned to Air Group 653 . 
 After repairs at Kure , the ship remained in the Inland Sea without aircraft until 27 October when she was tasked to transport material to Borneo . On 3 November , she was attacked by the submarine Pintado , but her escorting destroyer , <unk> , deliberately sacrificed herself by intercepting the torpedoes and sank with no survivors . While returning from Manila , Junyō was attacked by the submarines Sea Devil , Plaice and Redfish early in the morning of 9 December 1944 . She was hit by three torpedoes , but she was able to proceed on one engine . She reached Sasebo the following day and began repairs on 18 December . 
 The repairs were abandoned in March 1945 for lack of materials and the ship was moved from the dock to Ebisu Bay , Sasebo on 1 April . Efforts to camouflage the ship began on 23 April and she was reclassified as a guard ship on 20 June . Junyō 's armament was ordered removed on 5 August and the ship was surrendered to the Allies on 2 September . An American technical team evaluated the ship 's condition on 8 October and deemed her a constructive total loss . Junyō was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and scrapped between 1 June 1946 and 1 August 1947 by the Sasebo Ship Company .

 Henry Albert " Hank " Azaria ( / <unk> / ə @-@ <unk> @-@ ee @-@ ə ; born April 25 , 1964 ) is an American actor , voice actor , comedian and producer . He is known for starring in the animated television sitcom The Simpsons ( 1989 – present ) , voicing Moe Szyslak , Apu Nahasapeemapetilon , Chief Wiggum , Comic Book Guy , Carl Carlson and numerous others . After attending Tufts University , Azaria joined the series with little voice acting experience , but became a regular in its second season , with many of his performances on the show being based on famous actors and characters . 
 Along with the series , Azaria became more widely known through his live @-@ action appearances in films , such as The Birdcage ( 1996 ) , Godzilla ( 1998 ) , Mystery Men ( 1999 ) , America 's Sweethearts ( 2001 ) , Shattered Glass ( 2003 ) , Along Came Polly ( 2004 ) , Run Fatboy Run ( 2007 ) , Night at the Museum : Battle of the Smithsonian ( 2009 ) and The Smurfs ( 2011 ) . 
 He also had recurring roles on the television series Mad About You and Friends , played the title character in the drama Huff ( 2004 – 2006 ) , and appeared in the popular stage musical Spamalot . Though originally known as a comic actor , Azaria has also taken on more dramatic roles including the TV films Tuesdays With Morrie ( 1999 ) and Uprising ( 2001 ) . He has won five Emmys and a Screen Actors Guild Award . Azaria was married to actress Helen Hunt from 1999 to 2000 and has been married to actress Katie Wright since 2007 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Azaria was born in Queens , New York City , the son of Sephardic Jewish parents , Ruth ( <unk> ) and Albert Azaria . His grandparents on both sides hailed from Thessaloniki , Greece , and his family spoke Ladino . Azaria 's father ran several dress @-@ manufacturing businesses , while his mother raised him and his two older sisters , Stephanie and Elise . Before marrying his father , Azaria 's mother had been a publicist for Columbia Pictures , promoting films in Latin American countries , as she was fluent in both English and Spanish . During his childhood , Azaria often " memorize [ d ] and mimic [ <unk> ] " the scripts of the films , shows and stand @-@ up comedy routines that he enjoyed . 
 Azaria attended The Kew @-@ Forest School in Forest Hills . He decided to become an actor after performing in a school play at the age of 16 , becoming , at the expense of his academic studies , " obsessed with acting . " Both of his parents loved all forms of show business , which further spurred him to become an actor . He studied drama at Tufts University from 1981 to 1985 , where he met and befriended actor Oliver Platt and noted that " Oliver was a better actor than I was in college , and he really inspired me . " Together they both starred in various college stage productions , including The Merchant of Venice , before Azaria trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts . Although he did not expect the endeavor to be successful , Azaria decided to become a professional actor , so that later in his life , he would not regret not having tried . Azaria 's first acting job was an advertisement for Italian television when he was seventeen years old . He also worked as a busboy . Azaria originally intended to work predominantly as a theatrical actor , and he and Platt set up their own company , named Big Theatre , although Harold Pinter 's The Dumb Waiter was the only thing they ever performed . He decided that television was a better arena and offered more opportunity so , after being offered work with talent agent Harry Gold , Azaria moved to Los Angeles .

 Azaria got along with Gold who was lukewarm about working with him , but after a woman Azaria had " worked with in New York got really furious with him because he said he 'd work with me and then didn 't " , Gold sent him out for auditions . He made his television debut with a role in the pilot episode of the 1986 ABC comedy @-@ drama series Joe Bash , with Peter Boyle . His part – a one @-@ line role as the police officer Maldonado – was edited out before the show was broadcast , although the role secured him admission to the Screen Actors Guild . Azaria appeared in the TV film Nitti : The Enforcer , about the gangster Frank Nitti , and appeared in the failed pilot Morning Maggie , alongside Matthew Perry , with whom he became good friends . He played Joe in an episode of the sitcom Family Ties in 1988 , in which he had one line and the following year he played Steve Stevenson in an episode of Growing Pains . Azaria has described his career progression as being gradual ; he did not achieve overnight recognition or fame . In Los Angeles , Azaria was trained by acting coach Roy London . Between acting jobs he performed as a stand @-@ up comedian , and worked as a bartender for a catering firm . 
 = = = The Simpsons ( 1989 – present ) = = = 
 Azaria became famous for his voice work in the ongoing animated television series The Simpsons . He joined the show having previously performed only one voice over : as the titular animated dog in the failed Fox pilot Hollywood Dog , a show he described as " sort of Roger Rabbit @-@ esque , where the dog was animated but everybody else was real . " The first voice he performed on The Simpsons was that of town bartender Moe Szyslak , replacing Christopher Collins who had initially recorded the character 's voice . Having known him from Hollywood Dog , casting director Bonita Pietila called Azaria and asked him to audition for the voice of Moe . At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play , utilizing a voice based on actor Al Pacino 's performance in the film Dog Day Afternoon . He used the voice in his audition for The Simpsons and , at the request of the show 's executive producers Matt Groening and Sam Simon , made the voice more " gravelly " . Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio . Before he had even seen a script , he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode " Some Enchanted Evening " , dubbing Collins ' voice . Azaria did not expect to hear from the show again , but they continued to call him back , first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum , and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon . He felt that , initially , " [ the producers ] didn 't seem too pleased with what I had done ... [ Simon ] was very exacting ... [ and ] was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy . But then , much to my surprise , he would still keep having me back every week . But each week , I thought it was going to be my last week , because I really didn 't think I had done that well . " Nevertheless , by the show 's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices , and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast . Since he joined later than the rest of the cast , Groening still considered Azaria the " new guy " . In addition to Moe , Wiggum and Apu , Azaria provides the voices of the Comic Book Guy , Carl Carlson , Cletus Spuckler , Professor Frink , Dr. Nick Riviera , Lou , Snake Jailbird , Kirk Van Houten , the Sea Captain , Superintendent Chalmers , Disco Stu , Duffman , the Wiseguy and numerous other one @-@ time characters . 
 As Moe 's voice is based on Al Pacino 's , likewise many of Azaria 's other recurring characters are based on existing sources . He took Apu 's voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area , and also loosely based it on Peter Sellers ' character <unk> V. Bakshi from the film The Party . Originally , it was thought that Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotyped , but after Azaria 's reading of the line " Hello , Mr. Homer " , which the show 's producers thought was hilarious , the character stayed . Azaria , however , disputed this on <unk> with Ray Ellin , claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical . Chief Wiggum 's voice was originally a parody of David Brinkley , but when Azaria was told it was too slow , he switched it to that of Edward G. Robinson . Officer Lou is based on Sylvester Stallone , and Dr. Nick is " a bad Ricky Ricardo impression . " The " Wise Guy " voice is " basically Charles Bronson , " while Carl is " a silly voice [ Azaria ] always did . " Two of the voices come from his time at college : Snake 's is based on Azaria 's old college roommate , while Comic Book Guy 's voice is based on a student , who lived in the room next door to Azaria , who went by the name " F " . Professor Frink is based on Jerry Lewis 's performance in the original The Nutty Professor , and the Sea Captain is based on English actor Robert Newton 's portrayal of many pirates . Azaria based his performance for the one @-@ time character Frank Grimes , from the episode " Homer 's Enemy " , on actor William H. Macy . He counts Grimes as the hardest , most emotional performance he has ever had to give in the history of The Simpsons . 
 Azaria 's work on the show has won him four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice @-@ Over Performance , in 1998 , 2001 , 2003 and 2015 . He was also nominated for the award in 2009 and 2010 , but lost to co @-@ star Dan Castellaneta and guest star Anne Hathaway respectively . He was nominated again in 2012 . Azaria , with the rest of the principal cast , reprised all of his voice roles from The Simpsons , for the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie . Azaria notes that he spends " an embarrassingly small amount of time working on The Simpsons " . He works for " an hour on Thursdays when we read through the script , then four hours on Monday when we record it , and I 'll pop in again once or twice . " He concludes it is " the best job in the world , as far as I 'm concerned . " 
 Up until 1998 , Azaria was paid $ 30 @,@ 000 per episode . Azaria and the five other main The Simpsons voice actors were then involved in a pay dispute in which Fox threatened to replace them with new actors , and went as far as preparing for casting of new voices . However , the issue was soon resolved and from 1998 to 2004 , they received $ 125 @,@ 000 per episode . In 2004 , the voice actors intentionally skipped several script read @-@ throughs , demanding they be paid $ 360 @,@ 000 per episode . The strike was resolved a month later , with Azaria 's pay increasing to something between $ 250 @,@ 000 and $ 360 @,@ 000 per episode . In 2008 , production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors , who wanted a " healthy bump " in salary . The dispute was later resolved and Azaria and the rest of the cast received their requested pay raise , approximately $ 400 @,@ 000 per episode . Three years later , with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut , Azaria and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut , down to just over $ 300 @,@ 000 per episode . 
 His co @-@ star in The Simpsons Nancy Cartwright wrote that : " The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then , little by little , his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated . I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star . "

 With the continuing success of The Simpsons , Azaria began taking on other , principally live @-@ action , roles . He was a main cast member on the show Herman 's Head ( 1991 – 1994 ) playing Jay Nichols , alongside The Simpsons co @-@ star Yeardley Smith . He regularly recorded for The Simpsons and filmed Herman 's Head during the same day . Following the series ' cancellation Azaria unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Joey Tribbiani , one of the lead characters in the sitcom Friends . He was instead cast in the role of the scientist David , one of Phoebe Buffay 's boyfriends in the series . He appeared in the show 's tenth episode " The One with the Monkey " , before the character left for a research trip in Minsk . He reprised the role in the show 's seventh season ( 2001 ) , before making several appearances in the ninth ( 2003 ) . This return culminates in David proposing to Phoebe ; she rejects him , and David leaves the show for good . From 1995 to 1999 , Azaria had a recurring role in the sitcom Mad About You as Nat Ostertag , the dog walker . Azaria was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his roles in both Mad About You ( in 1998 ) and Friends ( in 2003 ) . Azaria had the lead role in the short @-@ lived sitcom If Not For You in 1995 , playing record producer Craig Schaeffer . 
 Azaria produced and starred in the sitcom Imagine That in 2002 , replacing <unk> mid @-@ season in the NBC lineup . He played Josh Miller , a comedy writer , who " transformed " each episode into a character Miller has imagined , " provid [ ing ] a humorous outlet for his frustrations at home and work " . Production closed after five episodes and it was canceled after just two aired , due to poor critical reaction and ratings . Azaria later commented on the show " I wanted to do something really truthful and interesting and impactful . We had a bunch of executives sitting in the room , all agreeing that The Larry Sanders Show was our favorite thing on television , but we couldn 't do it on NBC , and nor would we want to from a business standpoint ; it simply wouldn 't make enough money . By the time it aired , the writing was sort of on the wall , and I don 't blame them at all . It was apparent it wasn 't working . " 
 He starred as psychiatrist Craig " Huff " <unk> in the Showtime drama series Huff , which ran for two seasons between 2004 and 2006 , airing 24 episodes . Azaria served as an executive producer on the show and directed an episode of its second season . After reading the pilot script , he sent it to Platt , who took the role of Huff 's friend Russell Tupper . Azaria enjoyed working on the show , but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator Bob Lowry ( producer ) , noting that it " was tough to marry our visions all the time , [ because ] we both cared so much about it that neither of us were willing to let go . " Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly called Azaria " impressively subtle " in the role , while John Leonard of New York magazine said he was a " shrewd bit of casting . " The show garnered seven Emmy nominations in 2005 , including a nomination for Azaria for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series . Despite the awards , the show continually received low ratings , and Showtime chose not to commission it for a third season . 
 Returning to live @-@ action television in 2011 , Azaria starred in the NBC sitcom Free Agents , a remake of the British series of the same name . He played Alex Taylor , a recently divorced public relations executive " who is missing his kids and trying to keep himself together " , and ends up sleeping with a co @-@ worker ( Kathryn Hahn ) . Azaria also served as a producer on the show . He was apprehensive about the project , disliking the lengthy schedule required of a lead actor in a single @-@ camera series , and favoring the " sensibility " of cable shows . However , he liked the script and executive producer John Enbom 's previous series Party Down and decided to accept the part . Despite Azaria mounting a campaign on Twitter to save it , the series was canceled after four episodes due to low ratings . In 2014 , Azaria had a recurring role in the second season of Showtime 's Ray Donovan , playing FBI agent Ed Cochran .

 Azaria made his film debut in the direct @-@ to @-@ video release Cool Blue ( 1990 ) , as Buzz . His first theatrically released feature film appearance came the same year in Pretty Woman , as a police detective . His next major film role was as television producer Albert Freedman in the 1994 film Quiz Show , which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . In 1996 , Azaria played gay Guatemalan housekeeper <unk> Spartacus in the film The Birdcage . For the role , which Azaria considers to be his " big break " , he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role , and critically branded " the most hilarious performance in the film , " by Alison <unk> of The Austin Chronicle , while Empire wrote that he " [ stole ] the show . " For the role he used a Guatemalan accent , and made himself sound as effeminate as possible . He had chosen two possible voices , an effeminate one and a tougher one . After advice from a drag queen , he chose the effeminate voice . Three weeks into production , he realized he sounded exactly like his grandmother , which aided his performance . <unk> was originally going to be a single scene part , with the larger role of the housekeeper being played by David Alan Grier . With the producers fearing the racial connotations of a black actor in such a part , Azaria inherited the full role . 
 He appeared in numerous other films in the late 1990s , including Heat ( 1995 ) , Grosse Pointe Blank ( 1997 ) , Celebrity ( 1998 ) and worked opposite Gwyneth Paltrow , as Walter Plane , in the 1998 adaptation of Great Expectations . He played photographer Victor " Animal " <unk> in Godzilla ( 1998 ) . Godzilla was one of Azaria 's first starring roles in a blockbuster film . Its five @-@ month shoot was the longest of his career to date , but he considered it a good chance to boost his profile . He noted , " I 'm so used to melding into every character I play . Even people in the business think the guy who did Birdcage , Quiz Show and Great Expectations are three different actors — which in a way makes me proud , but in another way is very frustrating . It 's the curse and blessing of the character actor " . The shoot 's physical challenges , and the film 's critical failure , led Azaria to later describe it as " tough to make , and very disappointing when it came out . It was one you definitely chalk up and say , ' That was part of paying your dues , better luck next time ' . " In 1999 , he starred in the drama Mystery , Alaska as Charles Danner , and the comedy superhero film Mystery Men , as the faux @-@ British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja . Other film roles included Hector <unk> in America 's Sweethearts ( 2001 ) , Claude in Along Came Polly ( 2004 ) , and the young Patches O <unk> in Dodgeball : A True Underdog Story ( 2004 ) , the latter two with Ben Stiller . For his role of Claude , a French scuba instructor , in Along Came Polly , Azaria donned a wig and worked out extensively to get into the physical shape the part required . 
 Azaria played composer Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins ' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999 . Paul Clinton wrote that Azaria was " brilliant as the tortured ( is there any other kind ) artist Blitzstein . " The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie , winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role . Azaria described the latter as the " best work [ he has ] done . " These were two of the first dramatic roles Azaria had taken ; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy , but tries to balance the two . Azaria commented : " all the roles I got were in comedy at first , and I was certainly happy to get those , so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got . And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles . But I never went , ' OK , now it 's time to get a dramatic role . ' " His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001 . The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played <unk> <unk> , one of the revolt 's leaders . Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film 's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected . " I know [ Avnet ] liked the fact I was Jewish , and he knew I could do accents well . He cast me and David Schwimmer in [ Uprising ] , and we were both sort of mystified . He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny . He never explained it satisfactorily to me ; I don 't understand why . " His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him , causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python . Azaria found Uprising to be " very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging " material . In 2003 , Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly , the former editor of The New Republic , in the drama film Shattered Glass . Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film " has become a weird kind of eulogy to him . " 
 Since Huff 's conclusion in 2006 , Azaria has continued to make multiple film appearances . He played the smooth @-@ talking Whit in David Schwimmer 's directorial debut Run Fatboy Run ( 2007 ) . During production he became good friends with co @-@ star Simon Pegg , performing The Simpsons voices on request , frequently distracting Pegg when he was supposed to be filming . He worked with Stiller again on 2009 's Night at the Museum : Battle of the Smithsonian in which Azaria played the villainous pharaoh Kah Mun Rah , utilizing a Boris Karloff accent . Although the film received mixed reviews , critics praised Azaria 's performance . Perry Seibert of TV Guide wrote that " thanks to Azaria , a master of comic timing . His grandiose , yet slightly fey bad guy is equally funny when he 's chewing out minions as he is when deliberating if Oscar the Grouch and Darth Vader are evil enough to join his team . " He appeared as Abraham in Year One ( 2009 ) , Dr. Knight in 2010 's Love and Other Drugs , and played Deep Throat director Gerard Damiano in Lovelace ( 2013 ) . 
 Azaria played Gargamel in the computer @-@ animated / live @-@ action adaptation of The Smurfs ( 2011 ) . Azaria wore a prosthetic nose , ears , buck teeth , eyebrows and a wig , as well as shaving his head . He spent approximately 130 hours in the make @-@ up chair over the course of the production . Azaria considered Gargamel 's voice to be the most important part of his performance . The producers wanted an " old , failed , Shakespearean actor " voice , but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European . He eventually selected a voice similar to that of Paul Winchell 's from the cartoon . Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired , and considered Gargamel too one @-@ dimensional a character and " just this straight villain " ; he opted to make Gargamel " more sarcastic " than in the cartoon , but " discovered that there 's no way to play Gargamel without screaming your head off at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs " . He interpreted him as " very lonely " , adding that " he hates the Smurfs because they 're such a happy family . He wants in really badly . I think he wants to be embraced as a Smurf " . Azaria worked with the writers to " infuse " the script with some of his ideas about the character , " particularly with the ' married ' relationship between Gargamel and [ his cat ] <unk> [ sic ] " which Azaria conceived . 
 Reviewers from The San Francisco Chronicle and The Boston Globe commented on Azaria 's " overacting " in the role of Gargamel . More positive reaction came from Scott Bowles of USA Today called Azaria the " human standout " ; Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt he suffered the " greatest disservice " of the film 's cast due to a poor script . Azaria noted in an interview with The A.V. Club that The Smurfs and Night at the Museum were films he agreed to do primarily for the money , but that " I won ’ t even do that unless I think it will at least be fun to do ... I really try to throw myself into it , figure out the funniest , cleverest way to get the material over , and make it fun to do and fun to watch . " Azaria reprised his role in the 2013 sequel The Smurfs 2 . Azaria is set to star in Oppenheimer Strategies with Richard Gere .

 Azaria performed a number of voice roles in addition to The Simpsons , although he noted in 2005 : " I started doing other voiceovers for cartoons for a couple of years , but I didn 't really love it . I was spoiled by The Simpsons . " He voiced Venom / Eddie Brock in Spider @-@ Man : The Animated Series between 1994 and 1996 . In the animated feature Anastasia ( 1997 ) , he voiced Bartok the bat and reprised the role in the direct @-@ to @-@ video prequel Bartok the Magnificent ( 1999 ) . For his performance in Anastasia , Azaria won the Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Male Performer in an Animated Feature Production . He also voiced Eric in the American dub of the series Stressed Eric , Harold <unk> in the 2001 Futurama episode " That 's Lobstertainment ! " , and Abbie Hoffman and Allen Ginsberg in Chicago 10 ( 2007 ) . For the 2011 film Hop , Azaria voiced Carlos and Phil . The response to the film was mostly negative , but many reviewers praised Azaria 's performance . For example , Sandie Chen of The Washington Post said " Azaria has been honing his over @-@ the @-@ top Spanish accent since The Birdcage , so anything he says grabs some laughs " , while Emma Simmonds of Time Out called him an " unflappable presence , voicing two characters with style " . Later in the year he voiced The Mighty Sven in Happy Feet Two . Azaria voices <unk> Sheldon in Mack & <unk> . He also voices the lead character , Texan border agent Bud <unk> , in Bordertown , which started in 2016 . 
 Once The Simpsons was " going steadily " and Azaria had enough money to live on , he stopped working on commercials as he found them " demoralizing " , feeling that he sounded sarcastic whenever he read for them . When recording the part of " Jell @-@ O Man " for a Jell @-@ O commercial , he was told to make the voice he offered " more likeable and friendly so that children like him . " After pointing out that " Jell @-@ O Man " was a fictional character , he left and pledged to never record for an advertisement again . However , in 2012 he voiced several insects in a commercial for the Chevrolet Sonic .

 Azaria wrote and directed the 2004 short film Nobody 's Perfect , which won the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Short at the US Comedy Arts Festival . In January 2007 , he was confirmed to be directing Outsourced , a film about two American workers who journey to get their jobs back , after their factory is moved to Mexico . In 2009 , Azaria told Empire he was instead focusing on making a documentary about fatherhood . Two years later he told the Los Angeles Times that this project was " half @-@ complete " and was " forever looking for financing to finish it . " It eventually began in 2014 , airing on AOL as an online series titled Fatherhood . According to AOL , the series of short episodes documents Azaria 's " touching , humorous , and often enlightening journey from a man who is not even sure he wants to have kids , to a father going through the joys , trials and tribulations of being a dad . " 
 He has periodically returned to theatrical work , appearing in several productions . In 2003 , he appeared as Bernard in a run of David Mamet 's play Sexual <unk> in Chicago , along with Matthew Perry and Minnie Driver , in London 's West End . Azaria made his first appearance as Sir Lancelot , the French <unk> , and four other characters in Spamalot , the musical version of Monty Python and the Holy Grail , which opened in Chicago in December 2004 , before moving to the Shubert Theatre on Broadway . The show met with critical acclaim , receiving fourteen Tony Award nominations in 2005 , with Azaria being nominated for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical . Reuniting with The Birdcage director Mike Nichols , and being a huge Monty Python fan , he saw it as an opportunity he could not pass up , describing it as " so much fun that I haven 't realized how tiring it is " , and " the most fun that I 've ever had in my entire life " . He took a break from the show in June 2005 , with Alan Tudyk filling in for him , to work on Huff , but returned in December 2005 . In late 2007 he starred in Aaron Sorkin 's The Farnsworth Invention , playing RCA head David Sarnoff . In 2016 , he starred in the world premiere of Dry Powder opposite Claire Danes , John Krasinski , and Sanjit De Silva , directed by Thomas Kail , at The Public Theater in New York City . 
 Azaria starred in and co @-@ wrote the third episode of the Funny or Die web @-@ series <unk> , entitled " A Legend in the Booth " . He played Jim Brockmire , a legendary baseball announcer , fired for a profanity @-@ filled breakdown live on air after discovering his wife was having an affair . Azaria based the voice and style of Brockmire on several veteran sportscasters , including Bob Murphy and Phil Rizzuto . He has since appeared as Brockmire on the NFL Network 's The Rich Eisen Podcast to discuss the National Football League . In November 2012 , Azaria sued actor Craig Bierko over the ownership of the Brockmire voice . The case was ruled in Azaria 's favour in 2014 . Both actors had been using a baseball announcer voice before and since meeting at a party in 1990 , but US district judge Gary Allen <unk> ruled that only Azaria 's voice was , as Brockmire , a defined , " tangible " character and thus subject to copyright .

 Azaria 's friends refer to him as " the freakish mimic " due to his ability to copy almost anyone 's voice , instantly after he has heard it . As a child he believed that everyone could do this , but later realized that it was not a common talent . Azaria can " remember every voice I hear , famous or otherwise ... they kind of remain in the memory banks , so I 'm ready to trot them out . " Azaria was glad to have found the " ultimate outlet " for this skill , in The Simpsons . He " didn 't realize it [ when he joined the show ] , but it became like a lab for a character actor . I had to do so many voices . " In the early 2000s , Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of : " For the first 10 years of The Simpsons , I would develop a bunch of voices . And then ... I hit a point when I was tapped out . Every noise I can make , I have made . Even characters like Gargamel , I 've done . Even if it was only two or three lines , at some point I 've done something similar on The Simpsons , at least somewhere along the line . " 
 For many of Azaria 's characters , much of their humor is derived from a " funny voice " , such as The Birdcage and Night at the Museum : Battle of the Smithsonian . He stated that " being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone , a broader character that I try to humanize , a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in , " although he finds it " much easier to be someone much closer to myself , " as it requires " less energy ... than playing characters that are so out there and high strung " . 
 The Simpsons creator Matt Groening has stated that Azaria possesses the ability to turn unfunny lines into some of the best in an episode , while former writer Jay Kogen stated : " Just when I think I know [ Azaria 's ] bag of tricks , he 's always got a new thing he does to surprise me . " Throughout the run of The Simpsons , Azaria has had to sing in character several times , a task which he describes as easier than singing normally . The Smurfs writer David N. Weiss says Azaria " has a beautiful treasure trove of talent , " and " became what you wished you were writing " . Playwright <unk> Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was " by far " her favorite actor , praising his " versatility " and " tendency to take small roles that would normally fade into the background and to consistently create characters people care about " , noting his roles in Shattered Glass , Mystery , Alaska and especially Dodgeball : A True Underdog Story .
