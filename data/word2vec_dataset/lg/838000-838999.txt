 On the morning of 22 September , Cressy and her sisters , Aboukir and Hogue , were on patrol without any escorting destroyers as these had been forced to seek shelter from bad weather . The three sisters were steaming in line abreast about 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) apart at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . They were not expecting submarine attack , but had lookouts posted and one gun manned on each side to attack any submarines sighted . The weather had moderated earlier that morning and Tyrwhitt was en route to reinforce the cruisers with eight destroyers . 
 U @-@ 9 , commanded by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen , had been ordered to attack British transports at Ostend , but had been forced to dive and take shelter from the storm . On surfacing , she spotted the British ships and moved to attack . She fired one torpedo at 06 : 20 at Aboukir which struck her on the starboard side ; the ship 's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men . Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06 : 55 despite counterflooding compartments on the opposite side to right her . 
 As Hogue approached her sinking sister , her captain , Wilmot Nicholson , realized that it had been a submarine attack and signaled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water . Having stopped and lowered all her boats , Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06 : 55 . The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U @-@ 9 to broach the surface and Hogue 's gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again . The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed and sank at 07 : 15 . 
 Cressy attempted to ram the submarine , but did not succeed and resumed her rescue efforts until she too was torpedoed at 07 : 20 . Weddigen had fired two torpedoes from his stern tubes , but only one hit . U @-@ 9 had to maneuver to bring her bow around with her last torpedo and fired it at a range of about 550 yards ( 500 m ) at 07 : 30 . The torpedo struck on the port side and ruptured several boilers , scalding the men in the compartment . As her sisters had done , Cressy took on a heavy list and then capsized before sinking at 07 : 55 . Several Dutch ships began rescuing survivors at 08 : 30 and were joined by British fishing trawlers before Tyrwhitt and his ships arrived at 10 : 45 . From all three ships 837 men were rescued and 62 officers and 1 @,@ 397 enlisted men lost : 560 of those lost were from Cressy . 
 In 1954 the British government sold the salvage rights to all three ships to a German company and they were subsequently sold again to a Dutch company which began salvaging the wrecks ' metal in 2011 . 
 = Myron Cope = 
 Myron Cope ( January 23 , 1929 – February 27 , 2008 ) , born Myron Sidney <unk> , was an American sports journalist , radio personality , and sportscaster . He is best known for being " the voice of the Pittsburgh Steelers . " 
 Cope was a color commentator for the Steelers ' radio broadcasts for 35 years . He was known for his distinctive , nasally voice with an identifiable Pittsburgh accent , idiosyncratic speech pattern , and a level of excitement rarely exhibited in the broadcast booth . Cope 's most notable catch phrase was " <unk> " / <unk> / . Cope was the first football announcer inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame . Cope 's autobiography , Double Yoi ! , was published in 2002 . Legislation honoring Cope is currently pending before the United States House of Representatives , having already passed in the United States Senate . 
 = = Education and early career = = 
 Born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to Jewish parents of Lithuanian ancestry , Cope graduated from Taylor <unk> High School in 1947 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2009 . He also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh . He was originally a journalist before becoming a broadcaster . His first job was in Erie , Pennsylvania , with the Daily Times , and by the summer of 1951 , he was working for the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette . Cope then became a freelance journalist , most notably for Sports Illustrated , the Saturday Evening Post , and the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette . In 1963 , Cope received the E.P. Dutton Prize for " Best Magazine <unk> in the Nation , " for a portrayal of Cassius Clay . Cope spent the 1983 college football season as a color analyst for the Pittsburgh Panthers . In 1987 , he was named by the Hearst Corporation as a noted literary achiever , along with Mark Twain , Jack London , Frederic Remington , Walter Winchell , and Sidney Sheldon . At its 50th Anniversary , Sports Illustrated selected Cope ’ s profile of Howard Cosell as one of the 50 best written works ever published in the magazine . 
 = = Family life = = 
 Cope married Mildred Lindberg of Charleston in 1965 , and the couple moved to Mt . Lebanon . In 1972 , the Copes moved to nearby Upper St. Clair . Mildred died on September 20 , 1994 . In 1999 , Cope moved back to Mt . Lebanon , to a condo in the Woodridge neighborhood . He remained there until his final days , when he entered a Mt . Lebanon nursing home , and is claimed by Mt . Lebanon as a " native . " 
 Cope had three children , Elizabeth , Martha Ann , and Daniel . Martha Ann died shortly after her birth . His son , Daniel , was born with severe autism ; he has lived most of his life at the Allegheny Valley School , an institution specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities . Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing autism , and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent of a child with autism and his efforts to better educate the public at large about autism . 
 = = Steelers broadcasting = = 
 In 1968 , Cope began doing daily sports commentaries on what was then WTAE @-@ AM radio in Pittsburgh . His unique nasal voice , with a distinctive Pittsburgh area accent , was noticed by the Steelers ' brass , and he made his debut as a member of the Steelers ' radio team in 1970 . 
 During Cope 's 35 @-@ year broadcasting career with the Steelers — the longest term with a single team in NFL history — he was accompanied by only two play @-@ by @-@ play announcers : the late Jack Fleming , with whom he broadcast until 1994 , followed by Bill Hillgrove , who still fills this broadcast role today . 
 In keeping with his comic personality , a series of television commentaries on WTAE @-@ TV saw Cope calling himself " Doctor Cope " and wearing a white lab coat while pretending to examine the opposing team 's strengths and weaknesses . His predictor was known as the " Cope @-@ ra @-@ scope . " 
 = = = Catchphrases and Nicknames = = = 
 Like other sports announcers in Pittsburgh , particularly Penguins commentator Mike Lange and the late Pirates announcer Bob Prince , Cope had a repertoire of unique catchphrases employed in his broadcasts , such as " Mmm @-@ Hah ! " and " <unk> <unk> " ( his version of " <unk> dokey " ) . Cope often used Yiddish expressions , especially " <unk> ! " and " Yoi ! " ( sometimes multiplied as " Double Yoi " or rarely " Triple Yoi " ) . 
 Cope also created nicknames for many players and opposing teams . It was Cope who popularized " The Bus " as a nickname for former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis , " Jack Splat " for Jack Lambert , and he gave Kordell Stewart the nickname " Slash . " 
 Cope also used the term " Cincinnati <unk> " to describe their division rivals , known during the 1990s for a string of bad seasons and numerous draft busts . 
 = = Terrible Towel = = 
 Cope played a large role in the invention of the Terrible Towel . Needing a way to excite the fans during a 1975 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts , Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout . Originally , Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks , but realizing the high costs for the masks , opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel . The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and " is arguably the best @-@ known fan symbol of any major pro sports team " . 
 In 1996 , Cope gave the rights to The Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Valley School in <unk> , Pennsylvania . The school provides care for more than 900 people with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities , including Cope 's son who has severe autism . Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise $ 3 million for the school .

 Cope announced his retirement from broadcasting on June 20 , 2005 , citing health concerns . Eight days later , it was announced that Cope was the recipient of the Pete Rozelle Award for " long @-@ time exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football . " Upon his retirement , the Steelers did not replace Cope , opting instead to downsize to a two @-@ man broadcast team . 
 On October 31 , 2005 , Cope was honored for his lifetime accomplishments at halftime of the contest between the Steelers and the Ravens . In addition , the Steelers produced a special commemorative edition Terrible Towel with his familiar expressions printed on it . As seen on the towel , production was limited to 35 @,@ 000 towels , representing 35 years of service to the Steelers . Later that season when the team advanced to Super Bowl XL , many Steeler fans wanted Cope to come out of retirement just to call " The one for the thumb . " Cope declined partially for health reasons and partially to enjoy retirement . 
 Cope died of respiratory failure at a Mt . Lebanon nursing home on the morning of February 27 , 2008 . In the days following his death , many ceremonies were held in his honor , including the local sporting events of the Pittsburgh Panthers college basketball team . Two days after his death , hundreds of people gathered in heavy snow in front of the Pittsburgh City Hall to honor Cope ; included in the ceremony was one minute of silent Terrible Towel waving . His funeral , which was held on February 29 , 2008 , was private . Due to Cope 's large impact on the Pittsburgh area , Bob Smizik , a local sportswriter wrote ,

 = MissingNo . = 
 MissingNo . ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> ) , or <unk> , is an unofficial Pokémon species found in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue . Standing for " Missing Number " , MissingNo. are used as error handlers by game developer Game Freak ; they appear when the game attempts to access data for a nonexistent Pokémon species . Due to the programming of three in @-@ game events , players can encounter MissingNo. via a glitch . The species was first documented by Nintendo in the May 1999 issue of Nintendo Power . 
 Encountering MissingNo. causes graphical errors and the mass replication of the sixth item in the player 's item menu ; the latter effect resulted in the glitch 's coverage by strategy guides and game magazines . IGN has noted MissingNo . ' s appearance in Pokémon Red and Blue as one of the most famous video game glitches . Fans of the series have attempted to rationalize MissingNo. as part of the games ' canon , and sociologists have studied its impact on players . 
 = = History = = 
 Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo , the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996 . The player assumes the role of a Pokémon Trainer whose goal is to capture and train creatures called Pokémon . Players use the creatures ' special abilities to combat other Pokémon , and certain abilities also grant new ways to navigate the game 's world , such as instantaneous travel between two areas . 
 Nintendo first documented the events that cause MissingNo. to appear in the May 1999 issue of Nintendo Power , with a warning that " any contact with it ( even if you don 't catch it ) could easily erase your game file or disrupt your graphics " . The glitch is the result of a succession of events : first , players watch an in @-@ game tutorial for Pokémon capture . The player then uses a Pokémon with the Fly ability to reach the game 's Cinnabar Island location , and then uses a Pokémon with the Surf ability to travel up and down the eastern " shore " of the island until a MissingNo. appears . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Encountering a MissingNo . Pokémon is the result of three computing events . The first is the game 's random battle encounter system ; each area assigns values to Pokémon in a data buffer , which the game accesses for the player 's encounters with wild Pokémon . However , no values are assigned to this buffer on the east coast of the Cinnabar and <unk> Island locations — the information from the previously visited area is used instead . The second factor is the in @-@ game tutorial , which temporarily stores the player 's name in the data buffer . This causes the game to access the hexadecimal values of the player 's name for Pokémon encounters at Cinnabar and <unk> Island . The third factor is the game 's error handling system ; if the game selects a value from the data buffer that is not an existing Pokémon , a subroutine is triggered that causes the appearance of a Pokémon named MissingNo . , short for " Missing Number " . 
 As with any wild Pokémon , players may flee from , fight or capture MissingNo . After an encounter with MissingNo . , the quantity of the sixth item in the player 's item menu is usually increased by a large amount and the game 's Hall of Fame Pokémon gallery becomes permanently glitched . Temporary graphical glitches may also occur , which can be removed by viewing the statistics page for another Pokémon or resetting the console . A captured MissingNo. is a fully functional Pokémon , and appears in the game 's Pokémon index as number 000 . All MissingNo. possess consistent abilities , type , statistics and sounds . The Pokémon commonly appears as a scrambled " d " -shape , but certain encounter values cause it to appear as one of three sprites not used by other Pokémon . 
 = = Reaction and reception = = 
 While it only appeared in a few games in the series , MissingNo. has had a significant impact . Calling it a " programming quirk " , Nintendo warned against encountering it , claiming players could possibly have to restart the game from the beginning to remove the graphical glitches . Despite Nintendo 's warning , information on how to encounter MissingNo. was printed in several magazines and player 's guides due to its perceived positive effect . Certain players attempted to sell " tips " on capturing MissingNo. for up to $ 200 . Despite it not being an intentional part of the game , in 2009 , IGN included MissingNo. in its list of the top video game Easter eggs , citing its usefulness in replicating the game 's rarer items . IGN stated in a related article , " It really says something about Pokémon fans that they took what is a potentially game @-@ ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokémon , " and later called it an " unforgettable " glitch that helped push the original games to " gaming super stardom " . 
 Players ' reactions to MissingNo. have been the subject of sociological studies . Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge stated that Game Freak created " one of the most popular glitches ever in game history " , and cited its creative usage by players . In the book Pikachu 's Global Adventure : The Rise and Fall of Pokémon , professor of education Julian Sefton @-@ Green noticed that in his study of his son 's reaction to MissingNo . ' s usage as a " cheat " , the child 's outlook towards the game was altered drastically , and added that the presence of such elements as a result broke the illusion of the game as an enclosed world and reminded them that " at heart , it is a computer program " . The book Playing with Videogames contains an in @-@ depth study of MissingNo . , which details players ' curiosity when encountering the Pokémon . It describes their tendency to compare notes on its appearance , and to give assessment and critique to each other 's findings . The book states that , in their attempts to interpret MissingNo. as part of the series 's narrative through fan art and fiction , Pokémon communities celebrated the game 's imperfections and tried to imprint themselves on its canon . The author described these circumstances as unique to MissingNo . , and called its popularity an unusual case . 
 = Edward of Angoulême = 
 Edward of Angoulême ( 27 January 1365 – c . 20 September 1370 ) was second in line to the throne of the Kingdom of England and heir to the Earldom of Kent and the elder brother of Richard of Bordeaux ( later King Richard II ) . Born in Angoulême , he was the eldest child of Edward , Prince of Wales , commonly called " the Black Prince " , and Joan , Countess of Kent , and thus was a member of the House of Plantagenet . Edward 's birth , during the Hundred Years ' War , was celebrated luxuriously by his father and by other monarchs , such as Charles V of France . 
 Edward died at the age of five , leaving his three @-@ year @-@ old brother , Richard of Bordeaux , as the new second in line . After the Black Prince 's death in 1376 , Richard became heir apparent to Edward III and succeeded the following year . Richard later ordered a monument to be made for his brother 's tomb , which he had re @-@ located ; he also depicted his brother on the Wilton Diptych . In 1399 , after twenty @-@ two years of what has been described as a " turbulent reign " , Richard was overthrown by his cousin , Henry of Bolingbroke , and subsequently imprisoned in Pontefract Castle , where he died in 1400 . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Birth = = = 
 Edward was born at the Château d 'Angoulême , in Angoulême , then part of the Duchy of Aquitaine . His name , Edward of Angoulême , is a territorial designation referring to his birthplace ; this was a common naming practice in 14th @-@ century England . Through his father , Edward , the Black Prince , he was a member of the House of Plantagenet and the second , but eldest surviving grandson of the reigning English monarch , Edward III . Edward was related to the reigning French royal House of Valois through his paternal grandmother , Philippa of Hainault . His mother , Joan , was his father 's first cousin once removed , and was suo jure Countess of Kent . 
 Edward 's date of birth has been a matter of debate . In the Dictionary of National Biography article for his father , Edward 's birth year is given as 1363 , 1364 or 1365 , based on three contemporary chronicles , including that of Jean Froissart . A letter sent by Joan of Kent to Edward III on 4 February 1365 announces Edward 's birth on 27 January ; therefore , this is the date of birth most used . News of Edward 's birth was " so acceptable to his royal grandfather , that the king conferred upon the messenger , John <unk> , an annuity of forty pounds per annum for life . " 
 Edward was baptized at the Château d 'Angoulême , in March 1365 . The Black Prince enjoyed luxury and Edward 's baptism was meant to show the natives of Aquitaine that they had a sovereign in the Black Prince : present were 154 lords and 706 knights and , supposedly , 18000 horses ; over £ 400 were spent on candles alone . Edward 's baptism was also celebrated with " splendid tournaments . " One of his godparents was Bishop Jean de Crois . The name the Black Prince chose for his eldest son had been borne by three English kings and had already become a popular name with political implications by the time Edward and his brother , Richard ( b . 1367 ) , were born . In Yorkist times , these were the most popular names . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 After a prolonged suffering , Edward died of the bubonic plague ; although the exact time of his death is not precisely known , the date of January 1371 is commonly used . The Wigmore Chronicle of 1370 states that Edward died " around the feast of Saint Michael [ 29 September ] " ; this is probably the correct date . 
 The Black Prince found out about Edward 's death after he returned from the Siege of Limoges ; " he was very grieved in his heart , but none can escape death . " Edward 's loss " was a bitter grief to [ the Black Prince and Joan of Kent ] " and only increased the severity of the Black Prince 's illness . Edward had " already won a reputation for a Christ @-@ like character , " and in his infancy , " historians have been willing to see the seeds of those high qualities which distinguished his father and his grandfather , which were denied to his brother Richard II . " The Black Prince returned to England with Joan and Richard in 1371 , and died there in 1376 of dysentery . 
 Before the Black Prince and his family left for England , he left his brother , John of Gaunt , in charge of arranging Edward 's funeral , which took place in Bordeaux and was attended by all of the barons of Gascony and Poitou . Edward 's body was exhumed in 1388 / 9 and transported back to England by Robert <unk> , Bishop of Aire , who was acting under Richard II 's orders . It was at this time that Edward was buried at " <unk> Langley , " also known as Children 's Langley , a priory on the estate of Kings Langley . Between 1540 and 1607 , the church at Kings Langley was ruined ; and Edward had already been re @-@ buried at the Church of the Austin Friars by 1598 . 
 While Richard could not have remembered Edward well , he still " recalled [ his brother ] with pious affection . " Thus , Edward is featured on the Wilton Diptych , a small diptych which depicts Richard kneeling before the Virgin ( represented by Joan of Kent ) and Child ( represented by Edward ) . The Diptych is held at the National Gallery of London . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Edward 's early demise caused great pain to both Richard and his parents : historian Alison Weir states that , from the time the Black Prince returned to England after Edward 's death , " he was a broken man . " Edward 's death also had a substantial impact on English history . Even during Edward 's lifetime , fears that John of Gaunt would claim the throne existed ; Parliament passed the Act of 1368 , which permitted children born in the English domains in France to inherit the Kingdom of England , perhaps fearing that the Act of 1351 , which established Edward and Richard 's citizenship as English , would not be enough to ensure their succession . After Edward III 's death and Richard 's ascension , a regency led by John of Gaunt was avoided . Nonetheless , Gaunt maintained his influential position in the years that followed , and acted as de facto regent until January 1380 . 
 Although Richard was only ten years old when he began his reign , towards the end of the 1390s , he began what historians consider to be a period of " tyranny . " By the time of Edward 's death , England was in the midst of fighting during the Hundred Years ' War , which had been started by Edward III . Richard made efforts to end the war , but was unsuccessful due to opposition from his magnates and the French refusing to formally acknowledge their territorial losses by transferring land to the English . In 1399 , Richard was imprisoned in the Tower of London and abdicated in favour of his cousin , the Earl of Derby . With Richard 's death on 14 February 1400 , the direct line of the House of Plantagenet was brought to an end .

 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie ( also known as The SpongeBob Movie for short ) is a 2004 American animated / live @-@ action comedy film based on the Nickelodeon television series , SpongeBob SquarePants . The film was directed by series creator Stephen Hillenburg , and stars the regular television cast of Tom Kenny , Bill Fagerbakke , Clancy Brown , Rodger Bumpass , and Mr. Lawrence , with guest performances by Scarlett Johansson , Jeffrey Tambor , Alec Baldwin and David Hasselhoff . The plot follows Plankton 's plan to steal King Neptune 's crown and send it to Shell City . SpongeBob and Patrick must retrieve the crown to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune 's wrath and their home ( Bikini Bottom ) from Plankton 's plan . 
 Previous offers by Paramount Pictures to create a film version of SpongeBob were rejected by Hillenburg , but he eventually accepted one in 2002 . When the film went into production , Hillenburg and the show 's staff halted production on the series after the third season . A writing team — Hillenburg , Paul Tibbitt , Derek Drymon , Aaron Springer , Kent Osborne and Tim Hill — was assembled , conceiving the idea of a mythical hero 's quest : the search for a stolen crown , which would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface . The film was originally going to be as the series finale ; however , Nickelodeon wanted more episodes , so Paul Tibbitt assumed Hillenburg 's position as showrunner to produce further episodes after the movie . During production , Jules Engel , Hillenburg 's mentor at the California Institute of the Arts , died ; the film was dedicated to his memory . 
 Tie @-@ in promotions were made by 7 @-@ Eleven , the Cayman Islands and Burger King , which decorated some stores with 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) SpongeBob inflatable figures . The film was a box @-@ office success , grossing over $ 140 million with a $ 30 million budget , and received generally positive reviews from critics . A stand @-@ alone sequel titled The SpongeBob Movie : Sponge Out of Water was released on February 6 , 2015 , and a third film is expected to be released on February 8 , 2019 .

 The film follows the plot of the TV series SpongeBob SquarePants , focusing on the anthropomorphic sea sponge of the same name ( Tom Kenny ) . SpongeBob dreams about managing the Krusty Krab restaurant , which is in trouble because a customer has no cheese on his Krabby Patty , but SpongeBob saves the day . He wakes up and cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for the Krusty Krab 2 , hoping that his boss Mr. Krabs ( Clancy Brown ) will promote him to manager of the new restaurant built next door to the original Krusty Krab . At the ceremony , SpongeBob is passed over ; his co @-@ worker , Squidward Tentacles ( Rodger Bumpass ) , has been given the promotion because Mr. Krabs thinks he is " more mature " than SpongeBob . 
 Meanwhile , Plankton ( Mr. Lawrence ) , Mr. Krabs ' business rival , devises a plot to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and frame Mr. Krabs . He steals King Neptune 's ( Jeffrey Tambor ) crown that night , leaving evidence that pins the crime on Mr. Krabs , and sends the crown to Shell City , a distant , mysterious land from which no fish has returned . That night , SpongeBob goes to his favorite restaurant , Goofy Goober 's ; he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend , Patrick Star ( Bill Fagerbakke ) , waking up the next morning with a headache . King Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 the same morning and threatens to slay Mr. Krabs . Although SpongeBob criticizes Mr. Krabs shortly after he arrives , he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City . Neptune freezes Mr. Krabs , still certain that he is the culprit , and tells SpongeBob to return with the crown in six days for him to spare Mr. Krabs . SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City in the Patty Wagon , a car shaped like a Krabby Patty . 
 In Bikini Bottom , Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant , the Chum Bucket , with the claim that Krabs bequeathed him the recipe . He sends a hitman named Dennis ( Alec Baldwin ) to pursue SpongeBob and Patrick . Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing Neptune 's crown and tries to alert Neptune . However , Plankton uses mind @-@ controlling bucket helmets disguised as souvenirs to control Bikini Bottom 's residents , including Squidward , and renames the city <unk> . 
 Meanwhile , SpongeBob and Patrick encounter a dangerous trench , but Neptune 's daughter Mindy ( Scarlett Johansson ) helps them past it by making them think she can transform them into men . They are stopped by Dennis , who tries to crush them with his spiked boots , but he is in turn stepped on by a massive " cyclops " ( a diver ) ( Neil Ross ) . The " cyclops " grabs SpongeBob and Patrick , and goes to his beachside store , revealed to be Shell City . At the store , SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown , but are killed in a lethal drying @-@ out process with the heat lamp turned on . Their tears short @-@ circuit the heat lamp ; its smoke activates the sprinkler system , reviving their bodies and the other dried sea creatures to be sold as souvenirs . As the sea creatures attack the diver , SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach . When they lose their way home , David Hasselhoff offers them a ride ; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea . 
 Back at the Krusty Krab 2 , Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs . Just in time , SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown and confront Plankton , who then drops a mind @-@ control bucket on Neptune , enslaving him . SpongeBob performs the song " Goofy Goober Rock " ( performed by Jim Wise ) and , after transforming into an electric guitar @-@ wielding wizard for the duration of the song , he frees Bikini Bottom 's residents . Plankton is arrested , and King Neptune thanks SpongeBob for his bravery and thaws Mr. Krabs , who makes SpongeBob manager of the Krusty Krab 2 in gratitude .

 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was long @-@ planned ; Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had approached series creator Stephen Hillenburg for a film based on the show , but he refused for more than a year . Hillenburg was concerned , after watching The Iron Giant and Toy Story with his sons , about the challenge of SpongeBob and Patrick doing something more cinematically @-@ consequential and inspiring without losing what he calls the SpongeBob " cadence . " He said , on a break from season @-@ four post @-@ production , " To do a 75 @-@ minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake , I think [ ... ] This had to be SpongeBob in a great adventure . That 's where the comedy 's coming from , having these two naïve characters , SpongeBob and Patrick , a doofus and an idiot , on this incredibly dangerous heroic odyssey with all the odds against them . " 
 In 2002 , Hillenburg and the show 's staff stopped making episodes to work on the film after the show 's third season . The film 's plot originally had SpongeBob rescue Patrick from a fisherman in Florida ; an obvious reference to the 2003 film , Finding Nemo , this was later said by Tom Kenny ( the voice of SpongeBob ) to be a " joke " plot to keep fans busy . Hillenburg wrote the film with five other writer @-@ animators from the show ( Paul Tibbitt , Derek Drymon , Aaron Springer , Kent Osborne and Tim Hill ) over a three @-@ month period in a room of a former Glendale , California bank . Osborne said , " It was hugely fun [ ... ] although it did get kind of <unk> in there . " At the beginning of the series , Hillenburg screened a number of silent shorts ( from Laurel and Hardy , Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton ) and work by two modern comic actors : Jerry Lewis and Pee @-@ wee Herman , both obvious inspirations for SpongeBob . For the film , the writers created a mythical hero 's quest : the search for a stolen crown , which brings SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface . Bill Fagerbakke ( the voice of Patrick ) said about the plot , " It 's just nuts . I 'm continually dazzled and delighted with what these guys came up with . " 
 When the film was completed , Hillenburg wanted to end the series " so [ it ] wouldn 't jump the shark " . However , Nickelodeon desired more episodes ; Hillenburg stated : " Well , there was concern when we did the movie [ in 2004 ] that the show had peaked . There were concerns among executives at Nickelodeon . " As a result , Hillenburg resigned as the series ' showrunner , appointing supervising producer , writer , director , and storyboard artist Paul Tibbitt to succeed him . Tibbitt was one of Hillenburg 's favorite crew members : " [ I ] totally trusted him . " Tibbitt is still showrunner , and acts as an executive producer since 2008 . Hillenburg no longer writes or runs the show on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis , but reviews each episode and submits suggestions : " I figure when I 'm pretty old I can still paint [ ... ] I don 't know about running shows . " Tom Kenny , Bill Fagerbakke and the crew confirmed that they had completed four episodes for broadcast on Nickelodeon in early 2005 , and planned to finish a total of about 20 for the fourth season . 
 In September 2003 , Jules Engel , Hillenburg 's mentor when he studied experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts , died . Hillenburg dedicated the film to him : " He truly was the most influential artistic person in my life . I consider him my ' Art Dad . ' "

 There were a number of stages involved in the making of the film , beginning with a rough animation process of ideas drawn on Post @-@ it notes . The writers drew , working from rough outlines rather than scripts ( which made the humor more visual than verbal ) . Hillenburg said , " It 's in the characters ' extreme body language , in how they slither capriciously around the deadpan frames . " The storyboard artists , including Sherm Cohen , then illustrated ideas conceived by the writers . In the series Tom Yasumi and Andrew Overtoom do the animatics , but director Hillenburg and writer Derek Drymon did the animatics for the film . Yasumi and Overtoom were the film 's animation @-@ timing directors , concentrating on the sheets . The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was animated at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea . The animators worked semi @-@ digitally ; pencil @-@ drawn poses would be composited into layouts in Photoshop . 
 Series writer and storyboard artist Erik Wiese left the show for a year to work on Samurai Jack and Danny Phantom , but returned to do storyboards and character layout for the film . He " always wanted to be a feature animator , and the movie felt like I was on the character animation end " , describing the experience as " a blast — it felt like coming home . " 
 Hillenburg enjoyed the process of making the film : " The TV schedule is tight , and you don 't always have a lot of time to work on your drawings . " He appreciated the film 's hand @-@ drawn animation : " I think the movie 's drawings are much superior than the TV show " , although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film 's release . " There 's a lot of talk about 2 @-@ D being dead , and I hope people don 't think that . Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2 @-@ D. He would agree with me that it 's all about what you 're trying to say . There are many ways to tell a story , and what 's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story . " The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero , Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles .

 The film features live @-@ action scenes directed by Mark Osborne in Santa Monica , California . The ship used during the 30 @-@ second opening featuring the pirates singing the theme was the Bounty , a 180 @-@ foot ( 55 m ) -long , enlarged reconstruction of the 1787 Royal Navy sailing ship HMS Bounty built for 1962 's Mutiny on the Bounty . The ship has appeared in a number of other films , including Treasure Island ( 1999 ) , Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest ( 2006 ) and Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End ( 2007 ) . In film trailers , live @-@ action scenes were taken from Das Boot ( 1981 ) , The Hunt for Red October ( 1990 ) and U @-@ 571 ( 2000 ) . 
 Baywatch and Knight Rider actor David Hasselhoff made a cameo in the live @-@ action scenes , offering SpongeBob and Patrick a ride to Bikini Bottom . The scene was originally written before consulting Hasselhoff . Hillenburg was pleased with the storyboards ; Lead storyboard artist Sherm Cohen said , " He had been wrestling with the ending for quite a while , and finally he was ready to pitch his ideas to some of the other board artists . " Hillenburg was counting on casting Hasselhoff , and the first question asked him was " So , do we have Hasselhoff ? " He replied " No " , with a grin . Hasselhoff eventually agreed , before seeing the script . Hillenburg said about the actor , " He 's a great guy [ ... ] He was great at making fun of himself . " 
 The crew built a 750 @-@ pound ( 340 kg ) , 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) replica of Hasselhoff . The $ 100 @,@ 000 replica was kept at Hasselhoff 's home ; he has said , " It freaked me out because it was so lifelike , with teeth , when you touch it [ it ] feels like real skin . It 's soft , like your skin . " At the completion of filming , Hasselhoff said , " That 's ridiculously awesome . What are you gonna do with it ? " Asked by the crew if he wanted to keep it , he answered , " Uh , yeah . Okay . " Hasselhoff filmed in cold water , where he was pulled by a sled nine yards across the sea ; he described the experience as " cold but [ a ] lot of fun . " 
 In late March 2014 , Hasselhoff auctioned off the replica with other memorabilia collected during his career . Julien 's Auctions handled the item 's sale , which were expected to bring in between $ 20 @,@ 000 and $ 30 @,@ 000 . The auction was scheduled to begin on April 11 .

In addition to the series ' cast , it was reported on March 23 , 2004 that Scarlett Johansson , Jeffrey Tambor and Alec Baldwin would play new characters Mindy , King Neptune and Dennis , respectively , and David Hasselhoff would appear as himself . 
 Johansson accepted the role because she likes cartoons and was a fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show . When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo , he saw his character ( King Neptune ) and joked , " This is me . " He remembered the first cartoon he saw , Bambi : " My first cartoon , I had to be carried out crying [ ... ] It was Bambi . It 's like the great American wound : the death of Bambi 's mother . ' Run , Bambi , run ! ' " Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin ; Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a " phone " : " I wouldn 't say that about his performance . He might be mad if we said that . Technically , it was like he was in another booth in the studio . " 
 Baywatch and Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff accepted the role when his daughters , Taylor @-@ Ann and Hayley , urged him : " I got an offer to do a cameo in the SpongeBob Movie and I turned to my girls , who were like 16 and 14 , and I said , ' Who 's SpongeBob ? ' and they said , ' Oh my God , Dad , it 's the number one cartoon in the world , you gotta do it . ' " Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo : " It was great fun and to this day around the world kids stop me and say , ' Are you David Hasselhoff ? ' because I was the only human in the picture . " Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans : " It 's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn 't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans . "

Narholz was honored at the 2005 ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards for his work on the film , and received a nomination for Music in an Animated Feature Production at the 32nd Annie Awards . 
 American rock band The Flaming Lips recorded " SpongeBob & Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy " . They shot the song 's music video , directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley , in Austin , Texas . Coyne said , " Stephen [ Hillenburg ] seems to be a fan of the weirder music of the late ' 80s and early ' 90s [ ... ] He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then . " Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake , but Hillenburg refused ; according to Coyle , " ... but [ Stephen Hillenburg ] said , ' I don 't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there . I don 't like those commercial people . I like you guys , and Wilco and Ween . ' " American band Wilco wrote and recorded " Just a Kid " . One of the film 's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air <unk> hanging from Tweedy 's rearview mirror in I Am Trying to Break Your Heart : A Film About Wilco . Tweedy said , " I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness at the bottom of the sea as ' advanced darkness ' [ ... ] How could I not write a song for this film ? It automatically makes me the coolest dad on the block . " Avril Lavigne recorded the series ' theme for the soundtrack . Other artists contributing to the soundtrack were Motörhead , singing " You Better Swim " ( a derivative of their 1992 song " You 'd Better Run " ) ; Prince Paul ( " Prince Paul 's Bubble Party " ) ; Ween ( " Ocean Man " ) , and the Shins ( " They 'll Soon Discover " , partially written in 2001 ) . 
 " The Best Day Ever " , written by Tom Kenny ( SpongeBob 's voice actor ) and Andy Paley , was featured in the film and on its soundtrack . Kenny and Paley were working on what would become the album The Best Day Ever , writing " The Best Day Ever " and " Under My Rock " . The film 's production team needed two more tracks for the soundtrack ; Hillenburg heard the songs , and decided to include them . " The Best Day Ever " ended up being played during the film 's closing credits .

 Julia Pistor , the film 's co @-@ producer , said that although Nickelodeon ( which owns the SpongeBob trademark ) wanted to sell character @-@ themed backpacks , lunch boxes and wristwatches it respected Hillenburg 's integrity and gave him control of merchandising . Hillenburg had no problem with candy and ice cream tie @-@ ins , Pistor said ( because of the treats ' simplicity ) , but he had issues with fast food tie @-@ ins ; according to him , the latter was " full of hidden additives . " Pistor said , " The trouble is that you can 't go out with animated films without a fast @-@ food tie @-@ in [ ... ] People don 't take you seriously . " Hillenburg replied , " Yeah , well , my take on that is that we shouldn 't do that [ ... ] We didn 't want to suddenly become the people serving up food that 's not that good for you - especially kids . We work with Burger King , and they make toys and watches . But to actually take the step of pushing the food , that 's crossing the line . I don 't want to be the Pied Piper of fast food . " 
 The film was promoted across the United States . Nickelodeon joined Burger King for a 12 @-@ figure toy line based on the film , and about 4 @,@ 700 Burger King stores perched 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) , inflatable SpongeBob figures on their roofs as part of the promotion ( one of the largest in fast @-@ food history ) .

 On November 11 , 2004 , it was reported that a number of the inflatables had been stolen from Burger King roofs nationwide . Burger King chief marketing officer Russ Klein said , " As to the motives behind these apparent ' <unk> ' , we can only speculate . We did receive one ransom note related to an inflatable SpongeBob disappearance in Minnesota . " The chain offered a year 's supply of Whopper sandwiches as a reward for information leading to the return of inflatables stolen in November . One was found attached to a railing at the football @-@ field 50 @-@ yard line at an Iowa college , and another under a bed in Virginia . A ransom note was found for a third : " We have SpongeBob . Give us 10 Krabby Patties , fries , and milkshakes . " Steven Simon and Conrad ( C.J. ) Mercure Jr. were arrested after stealing an inflatable from a Burger King in St. Mary 's County , Maryland . While facing up to 18 months in jail and a $ 500 fine , Simon and Mercure said they were proud of what they did ; Simon said , " Once we got caught by the police , we were like , now we can tell everybody . " The following year Burger King took " extra security precautions " , when Stormtroopers from George Lucas ' Star Wars guarded the delivery of Star Wars toys to a Burger King in North Hollywood .

 Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars , calling it " the ' Good Burger ' of animation ... <unk> us down inside a fast @-@ food war being fought by sponges , starfish , crabs , tiny plankton and mighty King Neptune .

" Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic said , " Like the TV show it 's based on , it 's a daffy , enjoyable creation . " Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the feature a score of three out of four : " It 's not The Incredibles , or one of those animated features that spent <unk> on character design , pedigree and verisimilitude .

" Will Lawrence of Empire gave the film four out of five stars , calling it " a film for kids , students , <unk> , anyone who enjoys a break from reality .

 Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that " The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie retains the 2 @-@ D charm of the hugely popular Nickelodeon cartoon but adds a few tricks – a little 3 @-@ D here , a little David Hasselhoff there .

 Some reviews praised David Hasselhoff 's appearance in the film . Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post wrote , " Getting to see the hairs on Hasselhoff 's back ( and thighs , and calves ) magnified exponentially is perhaps a bit creepy . Like the movie , it 's all in good fun . " Nancy Basile of About.com , who gave the film four out of five stars , wrote that Hasselhoff " must have a great sense of humor . " Cinema Blend founder Joshua Tyler called Hasselhoff 's role " the best movie cameo I 've seen since Fred Savage stuck a joint in his crotch and played a clarinet to charm the resulting smoke like a snake . " 
 David Edelstein of Slate criticized the film 's plot , calling it a " big , heavy anchor of a story structure to weigh him down . " Mike Clark of USA Today called it " harmlessly off @-@ the @-@ cuff — but facing far more pedigreed multiplex competition ... SpongeBob barely rates as OK when compared with The Incredibles .

" After the film 's release , fans " began to turn away from the show , " causing fansites to " bec [ ome ] deserted . " Some fans believe that the show 's 2012 ratings decline correlates with a decline in quality , and " whatever fan support [ the show ] enjoys is not enough " to save it from its slide in ratings .

 = Horseshoe Curve ( Pennsylvania ) = 
 Horseshoe Curve is a three @-@ track railroad curve on the Norfolk Southern Railway 's Pittsburgh Line in Blair County , Pennsylvania . The curve itself is about 2 @,@ 375 @-@ foot ( 724 m ) long and 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) in diameter ; it was completed in 1854 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as a way to lessen the grade to the summit of the Allegheny Mountains . It eventually replaced the time @-@ consuming Allegheny Portage Railroad , the only other route across the mountains for large vehicles . 
 The rail line has been important since its opening , and during World War II the Curve was targeted by Nazi Germany in 1942 as part of Operation Pastorius . The Curve was later owned and used by Pennsylvania Railroad successors Penn Central , Conrail , and Norfolk Southern . Horseshoe Curve was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 , and became a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2004 . 
 Horseshoe Curve has long been a tourist attraction with a trackside observation park being completed in 1879 . In the early 1990s the park was renovated and a visitor center built ; the Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages the center , which has exhibits pertaining to the curve . 
 = = Location and design = = 
 Horseshoe Curve is on the Pittsburgh Line , the Norfolk Southern Railway Pittsburgh Division main line between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . Westbound trains climb a maximum grade of 1 @.@ 85 percent for 12 miles ( 19 km ) from Altoona to Gallitzin ; just west of the Gallitzin Tunnels trains pass the summit of the Allegheny Mountains , then descend for 25 miles ( 40 km ) to Johnstown on a grade of 1 @.@ 1 percent or less . 
 The curve is 5 miles ( 8 km ) west of Altoona in Logan Township , Blair County at railroad milepost 242 . The Blair County Veterans Memorial Highway ( SR <unk> ) follows the valley west from Altoona and tunnels under the curve . Horseshoe Curve bends around a dam and lake , the highest of three reservoirs along the valley which are owned by the Altoona Water Authority and supply water to the city . Horseshoe Curve spans two ravines formed by creeks : Kittanning Run on the north side of the valley , and <unk> Run on the south . 
 For every 100 feet ( 30 m ) , the tracks at the Horseshoe Curve bend 9 degrees and 15 minutes with the entire curve totaling 220 degrees . The curve is 2 @,@ 375 feet ( 724 m ) long and , at its widest , about 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) across . The Horseshoe Curve descends from an approximate elevation of 1 @,@ 640 feet ( 500 m ) on the southern side to 1 @,@ 600 feet ( 490 m ) on the northern . The grade of the curve was listed by the Pennsylvania Railroad as 1 @.@ 45 percent , and currently as 1 @.@ 34 percent by Norfolk Southern . Each track consists of 136 pounds per yard ( 67 @.@ 5 kg / m ) , welded rails that were , as of 2012 , laid in 2011 . Prior to <unk> and the introduction of dynamic braking and rail oilers , the rails along the curve would be transposed — left to right and vice versa — to equalize the wear on each rail from the flanges of passing steam locomotives and rail cars , thereby extending their lifespan .

 In 1834 the state of Pennsylvania built the Allegheny Portage Railroad across the Allegheny Mountains to connect Philadelphia and Pittsburgh , as part of the Main Line of Public Works . The Portage Railroad was a series of canals and inclined planes and remained in use until the mid @-@ 19th century . The Pennsylvania Railroad was incorporated in 1847 to build a railroad from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh , replacing the cumbersome Portage Railroad . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Using surveys completed in 1842 , the state 's engineers recommended a route west from Lewistown that followed the ridges with a maximum grade of 0 @.@ 852 percent on the 84 @-@ mile ( 135 km ) line . The Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad , John Edgar Thomson , instead chose a route on lower , flatter terrain along the Juniata River and accepted the resulting steeper grade west of Altoona . The valley west of Altoona was split into two ravines by a mountain ; surveys had already found a route with an acceptable grade east from Gallitzin to the south side of the valley , and Horseshoe Curve allowed the same grade to continue to Altoona . Engineers built an earth fill over the first ravine encountered while ascending , formed by Kittanning Run , cut the point of the mountain between the ravines , and filled in the second ravine , formed by <unk> Run . 
 Work on Horseshoe Curve began in 1850 and took over three years . It was done without heavy equipment , only men " with picks and shovels , horses and drags " . The entire line , including Horseshoe Curve , opened on February 15 , 1854 . The total cost for 31 @.@ 1 miles ( 50 @.@ 1 km ) of track between Altoona and Johnstown was $ 2 @,@ 495 @,@ 000 or $ 80 @,@ 225 per mile ( $ 49 @,@ 850 / km ) . The remaining part of the mountain inside the curve was leveled in 1879 to allow the construction of a park and observation area — the first built for viewing trains . As demand for train travel increased , a third track was added to the curve in 1898 and a fourth was added two years later . 
 From around the 1860s to just before World War II passengers could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve . Two branch railroads connected to the main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century ; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines . The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal . Across from the station , a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle , where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s . A reservoir was built at the apex of the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona ; a second reservoir , below the first , was finished in 1896 . The third reservoir , Lake Altoona , was completed by 1913 . A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors , and a gift shop was built in 1940 . 
 Horseshoe Curve was depicted in brochures , calendars and other promotional material ; Pennsylvania Railroad stock certificates were printed with a vignette of it . The Pennsylvania pitted the scenery of Horseshoe Curve against rival New York Central Railroad 's " Water Level Route " during the 1890s . A raised @-@ relief , scale model of the curve was included as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad 's exhibit at the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago . Pennsylvania Railroad conductors were told to announce the Horseshoe Curve to daytime passengers — a tradition that continues aboard Amtrak trains .

 During World War II PRR carried troops and matériel for the Allied war effort , and the Curve was under armed guard . The military intelligence arm of Nazi Germany , the Abwehr , plotted to sabotage important industrial assets in the United States in a project code @-@ named Operation Pastorius . In June 1942 four men were brought by submarine and landed on Long Island , planning to destroy such sites as the Curve , Hell Gate Bridge , Alcoa aluminum factories and locks on the Ohio River . The would @-@ be saboteurs were quickly apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after one , George John <unk> , turned himself in . 
 During the 1954 celebration of the centennial of the opening of Horseshoe Curve , a night photo was arranged by Sylvania Electric Products using 6 @,@ 000 flashbulbs and 31 miles ( 50 km ) of wiring to illuminate the area . The stunt also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb . Pennsylvania steam locomotive 1361 was placed at the park inside the Horseshoe Curve on June 8 , 1957 . It is one of 425 K4s @-@ class engines , the principal passenger locomotives on the Pennsylvania Railroad that regularly plied the curve . The Horseshoe Curve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13 , 1966 . The operation of the observation park was transferred to the city of Altoona the same year . The Pennsylvania Railroad was combined with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 . The merger created Penn Central , which went bankrupt and was taken over by the federal government in 1976 , as part of the merger that created Conrail . The second track from the inside at the Horseshoe Curve was removed by Conrail in 1981 . The K4s 1361 was removed from the curve for a restoration to working order in September 1985 and was replaced with the ex @-@ Conrail EMD <unk> diesel @-@ electric locomotive <unk> that was repainted into a Pennsylvania Railroad scheme . 
 Starting in June 1990 , the park at the Horseshoe Curve underwent a $ 5 @.@ 8 million renovation funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and by the National Park Service through its " America 's Industrial Heritage Project " . The renovations were completed in April 1992 with the dedication of a new visitor center . In 1999 Conrail was divided between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern , with the Horseshoe Curve being acquired by the latter . The Horseshoe Curve was lit up again with fireworks and rail @-@ borne searchlights during its sesquicentennial in 2004 as an homage to the celebrations in 1954 . It was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2004 .

 Train count peaked in the 1940s with over 50 passenger trains per day along with many freight and military trains . Demand for train travel dropped greatly after World War II as highway and air travel became popular . The curve is still busy as part of Norfolk Southern 's Pittsburgh Line and , as of 2008 , was passed by 51 scheduled freight trains each day , not including locals and helper engines which can double the number . The 3 @,@ 000 @-@ horsepower ( 2 @,@ 200 kW ) EMD <unk> @-@ 2s and <unk> helpers are coupled to the rear of long trains , providing power on the ascent and assisting in braking on the descent . The 2012 Norfolk Southern track chart lists the annual traffic density passing Horseshoe Curve as 111 @.@ 8 million short tons ( 101 @.@ 4 Mt ) , including locomotives . Amtrak 's Pennsylvanian between Pittsburgh and New York City rounds the curve once each way daily . Average speed for trains at Horseshoe Curve are 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) for freight and approximately 41 miles per hour ( 66 km / h ) for passenger trains . 
 The Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages a visitor center next to the curve which is open April to October . The 6 @,@ 800 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 632 m2 ) center has historical artifacts and memorabilia relating to the curve , and a raised @-@ relief map of the Altoona – Johnstown area . Access to the curve is by a 288 @-@ foot ( 88 m ) funicular or a 194 @-@ step stairway . The funicular is single @-@ tracked , with the cars passing each other halfway up the slope ; the cars are painted to resemble Pennsylvania Railroad passenger cars . Along with the locomotive , a former " watchman 's shanty " is in the park . Horseshoe Curve is popular with railfans ; watchers might see three trains passing at once . As part of Norfolk Southern 's 21st Century Steam program , the former Nickel Plate steam locomotive 765 traversed Horseshoe Curve in August 2012 — the first steam locomotive to do so since 1977 — while deadheading to and from Harrisburg . Nickel Plate 765 returned to the curve in May 2013 with public excursion trains from Lewistown to Gallitzin . 
 = 29th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry = 
 The 29th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union army of the United States during the American Civil War . The regiment was organized in December 1861 when three new companies were attached to a battalion of seven Massachusetts companies that had been in active service since May 1861 . These seven companies had been recruited to fill out the 3rd Massachusetts and 4th Massachusetts regiments and had signed on for three years of service . When the 3rd and 4th Massachusetts were mustered out in July 1861 , the seven companies that had signed on for three years were grouped together to form a battalion known as the Massachusetts Battalion . Finally , in December 1861 , three more companies were added to their roster to form a full regiment and the unit was designated the 29th Massachusetts . 
 The regiment took part in 29 battles and four sieges in a variety of theaters of the war . After their early service at Fortress Monroe in Virginia , the 29th was attached , in the spring of 1862 , to the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsular Campaign as part of the famed Irish Brigade . The 29th had the distinction of being the only regiment of non @-@ Irish ethnicity to serve in that brigade . In January 1863 , the IX Corps ( including the 29th Massachusetts ) was transferred to Kentucky and engaged in operations against Confederate guerillas . In the summer of 1863 , the IX Corps was again transferred and took part in the Siege of Vicksburg and the Siege of Jackson , Mississippi . In the fall of 1863 , IX Corps took part in the Knoxville Campaign which resulted in the defeat of Confederate forces in eastern Tennessee . The spring of 1864 saw the IX Corps and the 29th Massachusetts once again returned to duty with the Army of the Potomac , just in time to take part in the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg . During the Siege of Petersburg , the unit suffered their worst casualties of the war in the Battle of Fort Stedman on March 25 , 1865 . 
 The 29th was mustered out of service on August 11 , 1865 . Including the seven months served by most of the regiment before its designation as the 29th , the unit had one of the longest terms of service of any Massachusetts regiment — a total of four years and three months . 
 = = Massachusetts Battalion = = 
 On April 15 , 1861 , three days after the attack on Fort Sumter , the call went out from Massachusetts Governor John Andrew for the immediate mobilization of the four existing regiments of Massachusetts militia . The 3rd and 4th Massachusetts both left for Washington , D.C. , on April 17 to serve a term of 90 days . But in their haste to reach the capital , these regiments had departed without a full complement of ten companies as required by army regulations . In the following weeks , seven additional companies were formed in Massachusetts and assigned to the 3rd and 4th to fill out their rosters . Unlike the majority of companies in the 3rd and 4th regiments , which had enlisted for 90 days , these new companies signed on for three years of service . These seven companies would eventually form the majority of the 29th Massachusetts . 
 While serving with the 3rd and the 4th Massachusetts , these companies were primarily garrisoned at Fortress Monroe at the end of the Virginia Peninsula . This strategically important foothold in Virginia allowed Union forces to control the major waterway of Hampton Roads . In an unsuccessful effort to strengthen their hold on the Peninsula , Union troops marched from Fortress Monroe and attacked the Confederate position at Big Bethel Church , resulting in the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10 , 1861 . Two of the companies that would eventually become part of the 29th were involved in this action . The expedition was commanded by Colonel Ebenezer W. Peirce . 
 When the 3rd and 4th Massachusetts regiments were mustered out in July 1861 , the seven " three @-@ year " companies were consolidated on July 16 to form the " Massachusetts Battalion " under the command of Captain Joseph Barnes . The battalion served relatively light garrison and guard duty at Fortress Monroe , Newport News and Hampton for the remainder of 1861 . In December , three more companies were added to the battalion and , with a full complement of ten companies , the unit became known as the 29th Massachusetts Infantry . 
 Peirce was appointed the first commander of the 29th . The regimental historian recorded that this appointment was " exceedingly distasteful " to the 29th as there had been an expectation that Barnes , who had led the Massachusetts Battalion , would command the new regiment . Barnes , however , was placed second in command to Peirce as lieutenant colonel . Further , Peirce was disliked for his failure at Big Bethel . During the winter of 1862 , charges were brought against Peirce by officers of the 29th and he was court @-@ martialed for incompetence and improper conduct . His superior officer , Brigadier General John E. Wool , overturned the ruling and Peirce remained in command of the 29th Massachusetts . 
 = = Peninsular Campaign = = 
 During the winter and early spring of 1862 , the 29th was deployed on various minor expeditions near Fortress Monroe , Newport News and Norfolk , Virginia . On March 8 and 9 , the regiment was present during the Battle of Hampton Roads , a naval engagement fought primarily between the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia . The regiment helped man a land battery during the engagement , and the men of the 29th were amazed by the new ironclad vessels and the changes they brought to naval warfare . 
 In the middle of March , once again at Fortress Monroe , the 29th witnessed the arrival of the Army of the Potomac , commanded by Major General George B. McClellan . McClellan intended to use Fortress Monroe as his base of operations for an assault on the Confederate capital of Richmond . The effort would be known as the Peninsular Campaign . Over the course of March 1862 , the men of the 29th watched as roughly 100 @,@ 000 Union soldiers and 15 @,@ 000 mules and horses debarked from Fortress Monroe . The 29th was to remain at Fortress Monroe as the Army of the Potomac made its way toward Richmond . As the campaign became bogged down outside the Confederate capital , additional troops were called for and the 29th Massachusetts departed Hampton Roads on June 7 , 1862 . 
 = = = Attachment to the Irish Brigade = = = 
 Traveling by steamboat up the York River , the 29th arrived at White House Landing and marched to the battle front on June 8 , 1862 . The regiment was attached to the Irish Brigade ( 2nd Brigade , 1st Division , II Corps ) . Contemporaries and historians alike have wondered at this unusual assignment . The 29th Massachusetts was made up of men descended , largely , from old @-@ stock English families , some with heritage dating back to the Mayflower . There was , at the time , significant social friction in New England between established Protestant families and Irish immigrants . While the regimental historian observed that the 29th was " cordially welcomed " to the Irish Brigade , other historians , such as Marion Armstrong , point out the oddity of the " aristocratic 29th Massachusetts ... thrown in with three regiments of New York Irishmen . " Historian Daniel Callaghan quotes period sources describing the " unlikely matching of ancient political foes , " and the manner in which the men of the 29th tolerated the Irish @-@ born commander of the Irish Brigade , Brig. Gen. Thomas Francis Meagher , " coldly , in a pinched and critical silence . " 
 Despite these social differences , the 29th Massachusetts fought alongside the Irish regiments through heavy combat ( the first the regiment had seen ) during the Seven Days Battles . During this series of battles , the Confederates drove McClellan 's army away from Richmond , resulting in the failure of the Peninsular Campaign . After the Union retreat , Meagher praised the 29th 's actions in battle saying that they " had proved themselves the equals of any others in the Brigade , and had no superiors in the army . " Meagher would later call the 29th " Irishmen in disguise . " During the Seven Days Battles , the 29th suffered moderate casualties of six killed and 18 wounded . These casualties included Peirce whose right arm was shot off by cannon fire . Command of the regiment then fell to Barnes . 
 = = Maryland Campaign = = 
 Following the failure of the Peninsular Campaign , elements of the Army of the Potomac were shipped to northern Virginia to provide assistance to Union Maj. Gen. John Pope . Pope had been attempting to open a second assault on Richmond from the north , but he was defeated during the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 30 , 1862 . The 29th Massachusetts , along with other elements of the II Corps , arrived too late to take part in the battle . 
 After his victory at Bull Run , Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee invaded Maryland in September 1862 . The Army of the Potomac , including the 29th Massachusetts , moved to intercept the Confederate offensive . The two armies clashed at Sharpsburg , Maryland , during the Battle of Antietam on September 17 , 1862 . 
 = = = Battle of Antietam = = = 
 The battle commenced in the early morning with several assaults on the Confederate left flank by the I Corps and the XII Corps . After these failed , the II Corps , including the Irish Brigade , was called upon to assault a position near the Confederate center known as the " Sunken Road " or " Bloody Lane . " The trench @-@ like road afforded the Confederates a strong defensive position . Just after 9 a.m. , Maj. Gen. Israel B. Richardson 's division , with the Irish Brigade in the lead , moved toward the Sunken Road . Meagher envisioned the delivery of a few volleys from the brigade followed by an impetuous charge . As the Irish Brigade advanced up the crest toward the Sunken Road , it took heavy fire from the Confederates . The progress of the brigade was slowed by a sturdy split rail fence . When Meagher asked for volunteers to run forward and take it down , Corporal Samuel C. Wright of the 29th sprang forward with several others . Wright recalled that many were shot down before they reached the fence and , as " one would grasp a rail , it would be sent flying out of his hands by rifle shots . " The dash back to the lines was just as dangerous . Cpl. Wright was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery at Antietam . He would , over the course of successive battles , be wounded five times and reported dead twice . Despite his travails , he survived the war . 
 The Irish Brigade , though advancing in good order under heavy fire and delivering effective fire in return , did not reach the Sunken Road . The brigade retired , the regimental historian observed , " as steadily as on drill . " The 29th has been criticized by some historians , including Marion Armstrong , for not advancing as quickly as the rest of the Irish Brigade . An accident in the terrain , a small rise in front of the 29th 's position , afforded them cover , and their casualties were lighter than those of the other regiments of the brigade . Armstrong argues that Barnes was reluctant to leave this advantageous ground , a factor which may have contributed to the failure of the Irish Brigade 's charge . The casualties of the 29th were nine killed , 31 wounded and four missing . 
 = = Fredericksburg Campaign = = 
 The Battle of Antietam had been a tactical stalemate . McClellan claimed it as a strategic victory as Lee 's army retreated back into Virginia . Despite this , President Lincoln was displeased with McClellan 's failure to pursue Lee and replaced him with Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside . During November 1862 , Burnside proceeded to gather the Army of the Potomac in Falmouth , Virginia , preparing to assault Lee 's army across the Rappahannock River in Fredericksburg , Virginia . 
 = = = Removal from the Irish Brigade = = = 
 While in camp in Falmouth in late November , the officers of the 29th learned that Meagher had arranged for a green Irish Brigade flag to be presented to the regiment , recognizing their role as " honorary Irishmen " and their bravery during the Battle of Antietam . Barnes declined the gift , however . According to the regimental historian , " While the Colonel would have been proud to receive the flag for the regiment as a token of the respect of their Irish comrades , yet he objected to the flag being carried by the regiment , on the ground that it was not an Irish regiment . " Irish Brigade historians , including Joseph <unk> , have observed that there may have been some controversy surrounding the issue . According to <unk> , Barnes refused to accept the flag because they believed it " would brand them as Fenians , " or Irish revolutionaries . 
 As a result of this incident , on November 30 , 1862 , the 29th was transferred out of the Irish Brigade and into Brig. Gen. Benjamin C. Christ 's brigade in the IX Army Corps . It was replaced in the Irish Brigade by the 28th Massachusetts , an Irish regiment . 
 The transfer spared the 29th from the Battle of Fredericksburg in which their new brigade played almost no role . Their former comrades in the Irish Brigade , however , made a harrowing charge during the battle and suffered severe casualties . 
 = = Kentucky = = 
 Following his failure during the Battle of Fredericksburg , Burnside was removed from command of the Army of the Potomac and returned to the command of the IX Corps , to which the 29th Massachusetts now belonged . On February 5 , 1863 , the IX Corps was detached from the Army of the Potomac and transferred from Virginia to Kentucky where Burnside was to take command of the Department of the Ohio and Union operations in Kentucky and east Tennessee . 
 The 29th Massachusetts reached Cincinnati via railroad on March 26 , then marched into Kentucky . They were stationed in Paris , Kentucky , during April 1863 , conducting light duty in defending against occasional raids by Confederate guerrillas . In late April they marched to Somerset , Kentucky , where they were occupied with similar duty until early June 1863 . 
 = = Mississippi = = 
 In early June , most of the IX Corps was transferred to the command of Maj. Gen. Ulysses Grant who required reinforcements in the Siege of Vicksburg , the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River . The 29th Massachusetts traveled with other elements of the IX Corps via steamship down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers . They arrived in the vicinity of Vicksburg in late June and began digging entrenchments . Less than two weeks after the regiment arrived in Mississippi , the city of Vicksburg surrendered on July 4 , 1863 . 
 Following the surrender of Vicksburg , the remaining Confederate forces in Mississippi concentrated in the state capital of Jackson . Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman took several corps of Unions troops , including the IX Corps , and laid siege to Jackson in mid @-@ July . While digging trenches , the 29th was exposed to heavy artillery and sharpshooter fire from the Confederates , but the regiment suffered only one casualty during the siege . During the night of July 16 , the Confederate army in Jackson managed to slip away from the city and the siege was ended . 
 Shortly afterward , the IX Corps was recalled to Kentucky , as Burnside was eager to begin his operations in Tennessee . On the way back to Vicksburg , the 29th acted as provost guard , marching at the rear of the IX Corps to gather stragglers . They missed the first group of steamships to depart for Cincinnati and had to wait three weeks , until August 12 , with other regiments at a camp in Milldale , Mississippi , near Vicksburg . Camp conditions were unsanitary and the weather extremely hot . Many of the men suffered from disease during and after this encampment . As the regimental historian wrote , " Deaths were very frequent among the troops here during this time , burial parties were almost constantly engaged , and the funeral notes of the fife and drum could be heard nearly every hour in the day . None save the strongest came out of that campaign in sound health . " 
 = = Knoxville Campaign = = 
 Burnside gathered his Army of the Ohio in the vicinity of Lexington , Kentucky , in late August 1863 in preparation for an invasion of eastern Tennessee . The region was strategically important as a rail link between Virginia and Chattanooga . Also , the population of eastern Tennessee was primarily Unionist . Therefore , it became a key strategic goal of Lincoln 's to force Confederate troops out of the region in hopes that Unionists would gain support and bring the state back into the Union . 
 Prior to the march , half of the men in the 29th were on the sick list as a result of their service in Mississippi , including Barnes , who took an extended leave and returned for a time to Massachusetts . In his absence , Peirce returned to the 29th to command the unit . 
 The march across Kentucky , through the Cumberland Gap and on to Knoxville , Tennessee , was one of the longest marches the 29th ever executed — a distance of more than 200 miles ( 320 km ) covered between September 1 and September 26 , 1863 . 
 On October 21 , the IX Corps made camp in and around Lenoir City , Tennessee , and remained there until November 14 , 1863 . During this time , Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet launched an offensive aimed at the expulsion of Burnside 's troops from Knoxville . The IX Corps , including the 29th Massachusetts , moved southwest to meet the Confederates near Loudon , Tennessee . Union forces were rapidly repulsed and retreated to Knoxville . The siege of that city by the Confederates began in mid @-@ November 1863 . The 29th 's position during the siege was within Fort Sanders . When Longstreet launched his assault on Fort Sanders on November 29 , 1863 , the 29th saw heavy action in repulsing the Confederates . Two members of the 29th , Sgt. Jeremiah Mahoney and Pvt. Joseph S. Manning , later received the Medal of Honor for their bravery in capturing two Confederate battle flags during the battle . The 29th lost only two killed in the Battle of Fort Sanders owing to the strength of their position on the walls of the fort . 
 Following this Union victory and the retreat of Longstreet 's troops to Virginia , the 29th was stationed in mid @-@ December 1863 at Blaine , Tennessee , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) northeast of Knoxville . <unk> on an open plain , exposed to wind and snow , and running very low on provisions , the regiment suffered severely during December 1863 and January 1864 and referred to the camp at Blaine as their Valley Forge . At the end of December , Barnes rejoined the 29th as its commander and Peirce was elevated to brigade command . 
 In January 1864 , with the end of their three @-@ year term of service only four months away , the men of the 29th were given the option to reenlist for another three years . Those men who chose to accept the offer would receive a 30 @-@ day furlough , while those that did not would be consolidated with the 36th Massachusetts to serve out their remaining months . A total of 166 men chose to reenlist and approximately 90 did not . 
 On March 21 , 1864 , the 29th and the IX Corps commenced their long march back to Ohio via the Cumberland Gap , reaching Cincinnati on April 1 , 1864 . From there , the men who had reenlisted were sent back to Boston for the furlough they had been promised and those who had not were sent on to Virginia to join the 36th Massachusetts . 
 = = Overland Campaign = = 
 While the remaining men of the 29th were on furlough in Massachusetts , Lt. Gen. Ulysses Grant , as general @-@ in @-@ chief of the Union Army , began the Overland Campaign . During the spring of 1864 , he would direct the actions of the Army of the Potomac in northern Virginia , aggressively pushing Lee 's Confederate army toward Richmond in a series of major battles . The men formerly of the 29th who had been transferred to the 36th Massachusetts took part in the opening battles of the campaign , the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House , incurring casualties of seven killed and 30 wounded out of a total of 90 men . This detachment fulfilled their three @-@ year enlistment in mid @-@ May 1864 and returned home . 
 The furlough for the newly reenlisted ended on May 16 and the 29th Massachusetts , now a small fraction of its original size , departed for Virginia . They rejoined the Army of the Potomac on May 20 , 1864 just in time to take part in the closing battles of the Overland Campaign , particularly the Battle of Cold Harbor . On June 1 , 1864 , the regiment suffered casualties of one killed , 12 wounded and three captured during Grant 's first assault at Cold Harbor . Although the regiment had been temporarily assigned to the V Corps , on June 3 it rejoined the IX Corps . Over the next nine days , the regiment built breastworks and served on picket duty until June 12 when IX Corps rapidly marched to the outskirts of Petersburg , Virginia , in preparation for an assault on that city .

 = = = Assault on Petersburg = = = 
 In the pre @-@ dawn hours of June 17 , the divisions of the IX Corps formed up for an assault on the entrenched Confederate position outside Petersburg . Barnes of the 29th had been elevated to command of the 2nd Brigade , 1st Division of the IX Corps , to which the 29th belonged . Major Charles Chipman was placed in command of the 29th in his stead . While other divisions of the IX Corps attacked and were repulsed , the 1st Division moved to its assigned position in the late afternoon and lay down , studying the Confederate breastworks and awaiting orders to advance . At first , the division , to its relief , received orders that the attack had been called off . A short time later , however , came the order to attack . The division , including the 29th , charged from their protected position in a ravine out into an open plain in front of the Confederate entrenchments . According to the regimental historian , " They had scarcely emerged upon the open plain , when the whole crest of the Confederate works was fringed with fire and smoke ; grape , canister , and musketballs filled the air . " 
 During this charge , the color @-@ bearer of the 29th , Sgt. Silas Grosvenor , was shot through the head . The colors were picked up by Sgt. John A. Tighe who was also killed . Sergeant Major William F. Willis picked up the flag and became the third color @-@ bearer killed in the charge . At this point , the 29th was forced to pause in its advance and retired a short distance . In the confusion , the colors were left on the field . Major Chipman asked for two volunteers to go with him onto the open ground to retrieve the colors . The three found the colors and , according to the regimental historian , the Confederates , admiring the bravery of the trio , did not fire and allowed them to return to their lines . 
 The 1st Division of the IX Corps eventually captured the Confederate works in their front , however little had been accomplished by the assault on Petersburg overall . The Confederates remained strongly entrenched and the long Siege of Petersburg began . The 29th , numbering just 100 men at this time , lost six killed and 23 wounded . 
 = = = Battle of the Crater = = = 
 The 29th occupied trenches outside Petersburg with the rest of the Army of the Potomac during the summer of 1864 . In July , Union troops dug a mine beneath the Confederate position and , on July 30 , 1864 , a massive amount of gunpowder was detonated in the mine , blasting a hole in the Confederate position . During the resulting Battle of the Crater , the 1st Division of the IX Corps led a confused and failed attack . The 29th took part , charging into the crater with other regiments and eventually retreating , losing three killed , seven wounded and six captured . 
 = = = Battle of Fort Stedman = = = 
 The 29th played a minor role in the Battle of Globe Tavern , a movement intended to tighten the siege around Petersburg , on August 18 , 1864 . The regiment suffered only a few casualties during this engagement . In the fall of 1864 , the 29th served uneventful duty along the Petersburg siege lines and was eventually , in November , assigned a garrison post in Battery 11 , a small , unfinished ravelin ( detached fortification ) outside of Fort Stedman . Stedman was one of many earthen fortifications built along Union lines during the siege , and was only 150 yards from the Confederate trenches — the narrowest distance between the two armies . They would remain at this post for the next four months . 
 On March 25 , 1865 , the regiment fought in the Battle of Fort Stedman , the Confederate Army 's final offensive during the Siege of Petersburg . Before dawn on March 25 , Confederate troops achieved complete surprise and easily occupied Fort Stedman entering the rear sally port almost unchallenged . Major Charles T. Richardson , then in command of the 29th , hearing some light gunfire , ordered the 29th to fall in . No general alarm had yet been raised , but Richardson felt certain that an attack was underway . Within minutes , approximately 500 Confederates , a small part of the overall offensive , swept over Battery 11 . The 29th held their ground , however , engaging in heated hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat and eventually capturing 300 Confederates — more than twice their own number . The Confederates still occupied Fort Stedman , however , and soon sent another offensive to occupy Battery 11 . This time , the 29th was forced to retreat back to Fort Haskell , the nearest defensible position . 
 Among the 29th 's casualties in this engagement was Sgt. Calvin F. Harlow who , finding himself surrounded by Confederates , refused to surrender . He and the Confederate officer demanding his surrender shot each other simultaneously . Poet Walt Whitman , learning of Harlow 's story , wrote about him in his book Specimen Days . 
 After four hours , the Confederate attack lost momentum , and their forces began to pull back into Fort Stedman . An overwhelming Union counterattack eventually recaptured the fort . The 29th took part in the counterattack , re @-@ capturing Battery 11 . Color @-@ bearer Conrad Homan of the 29th was the first to re @-@ enter Battery 11 and was later awarded the Medal of Honor . The regiment lost 10 killed and an unknown number of captured in this engagement . 
 = = Mustering out = = 
 The 29th did not take part in the pursuit of Lee 's army during the Appomattox Campaign . The small regiment was instead withdrawn to Washington shortly after Lee 's surrender and served as provost guards in the capital . On August 11 , 1865 , the 29th was mustered out of service . Approximately 173 of its members ( roughly 15 percent ) were killed in action or died of wounds or disease . Official numbers as to the number of wounded are not available . The unit served in 15 states and traveled more than 4 @,@ 200 miles ( 6 @,@ 800 km ) . Taking into account the seven months of duty served prior to the official formation of the regiment , plus a term of reenlistment served by many members , the 29th Massachusetts had one of the longest terms of service of any Massachusetts regiment , a total of four years and three months . 
 = Black hole = 
 A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing — including particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from inside it . The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole . The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon . Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it , it appears to have no locally detectable features . In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . Moreover , quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass , making it essentially impossible to observe . 
 Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace . The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 , although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958 . Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity ; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity . The discovery of neutron stars sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality . 
 Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle . After a black hole has formed , it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings . By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes , supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses ( M ☉ ) may form . There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies . 
 Despite its invisible interior , the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light . Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction , forming some of the brightest objects in the universe . If there are other stars orbiting a black hole , their orbits can be used to determine the black hole 's mass and location . Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars . In this way , astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems , and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A * , at the core of our own Milky Way galaxy , contains a supermassive black hole of about 4 @.@ 3 million solar masses . 
 On 11 February 2016 , the LIGO collaboration announced the first observation of gravitational waves ; because these waves were generated from a black hole merger it was the first ever direct detection of a binary black hole merger . On 15 June 2016 , a second detection of a gravitational wave event from colliding black holes was announced .

 The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was first put forward by John Michell in a letter written in 1783 to Henry Cavendish of the Royal Society : 
 If the semi @-@ diameter of a sphere of the same density as the Sun were to exceed that of the Sun in the proportion of 500 to 1 , a body falling from an infinite height towards it would have acquired at its surface greater velocity than that of light , and consequently supposing light to be attracted by the same force in proportion to its vis <unk> , with other bodies , all light emitted from such a body would be made to return towards it by its own proper gravity . 
 In 1796 , mathematician Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du système du Monde ( it was removed from later editions ) . He justified his argument mathematically in 1799 . 
 Such " dark stars " were largely ignored in the nineteenth century , since it was not understood how a massless wave such as light could be influenced by gravity . 
 = = = General relativity = = = 
 In 1915 , Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity , having earlier shown that gravity does influence light 's motion . Only a few months later , Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to the Einstein field equations , which describes the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass . A few months after Schwarzschild , Johannes Droste , a student of Hendrik Lorentz , independently gave the same solution for the point mass and wrote more extensively about its properties . This solution had a peculiar behaviour at what is now called the Schwarzschild radius , where it became singular , meaning that some of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite . The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the time . In 1924 , Arthur Eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of coordinates ( see Eddington – Finkelstein coordinates ) , although it took until 1933 for Georges Lemaître to realize that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was an unphysical coordinate singularity . Arthur Eddington did however comment on the possibility of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild radius in a 1926 book , noting that Einstein 's theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible stars like Betelgeuse because " a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high a density as the sun . Firstly , the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from it , the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth . Secondly , the red shift of the spectral lines would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence . Thirdly , the mass would produce so much curvature of the space @-@ time metric that space would close up around the star , leaving us outside ( i.e. , nowhere ) . " 
 In 1931 , Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar calculated , using special relativity , that a non @-@ rotating body of electron @-@ degenerate matter above a certain limiting mass ( now called the Chandrasekhar limit at 1 @.@ 4 M ☉ ) has no stable solutions . His arguments were opposed by many of his contemporaries like Eddington and Lev Landau , who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would stop the collapse . They were partly correct : a white dwarf slightly more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star , which is itself stable because of the Pauli exclusion principle . But in 1939 , Robert Oppenheimer and others predicted that neutron stars above approximately 3 M ☉ ( the Tolman – Oppenheimer – Volkoff limit ) would collapse into black holes for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar , and concluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least some stars from collapsing to black holes . 
 Oppenheimer and his co @-@ authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped . This is a valid point of view for external observers , but not for infalling observers . Because of this property , the collapsed stars were called " frozen stars " , because an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius . 
 = = = Golden age = = = 
 In 1958 , David Finkelstein identified the Schwarzschild surface as an event horizon , " a perfect unidirectional membrane : causal influences can cross it in only one direction " . This did not strictly contradict Oppenheimer 's results , but extended them to include the point of view of infalling observers . Finkelstein 's solution extended the Schwarzschild solution for the future of observers falling into a black hole . A complete extension had already been found by Martin Kruskal , who was urged to publish it . 
 These results came at the beginning of the golden age of general relativity , which was marked by general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research . This process was helped by the discovery of pulsars in 1967 , which , by 1969 , were shown to be rapidly rotating neutron stars . Until that time , neutron stars , like black holes , were regarded as just theoretical curiosities ; but the discovery of pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of compact objects that might be formed by gravitational collapse . 
 In this period more general black hole solutions were found . In 1963 , Roy Kerr found the exact solution for a rotating black hole . Two years later , Ezra Newman found the axisymmetric solution for a black hole that is both rotating and electrically charged . Through the work of Werner Israel , Brandon Carter , and David Robinson the no @-@ hair theorem emerged , stating that a stationary black hole solution is completely described by the three parameters of the Kerr – Newman metric : mass , angular momentum , and electric charge . 
 At first , it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole solutions were pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions imposed , and that the singularities would not appear in generic situations . This view was held in particular by Vladimir Belinsky , Isaak <unk> , and Evgeny Lifshitz , who tried to prove that no singularities appear in generic solutions . However , in the late 1960s Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking used global techniques to prove that singularities appear generically . 
 Work by James Bardeen , Jacob Bekenstein , Carter , and Hawking in the early 1970s led to the formulation of black hole thermodynamics . These laws describe the behaviour of a black hole in close analogy to the laws of thermodynamics by relating mass to energy , area to entropy , and surface gravity to temperature . The analogy was completed when Hawking , in 1974 , showed that quantum field theory predicts that black holes should radiate like a black body with a temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole . 
 The first use of the term " black hole " in print was by journalist Ann Ewing in her article " ' Black Holes ' in Space " , dated 18 January 1964 , which was a report on a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . John Wheeler used the term " black hole " at a lecture in 1967 , leading some to credit him with coining the phrase . After Wheeler 's use of the term , it was quickly adopted in general use . 
 = = Properties and structure = = 
 The no @-@ hair theorem states that , once it achieves a stable condition after formation , a black hole has only three independent physical properties : mass , charge , and angular momentum . Any two black holes that share the same values for these properties , or parameters , are indistinguishable according to classical ( i.e. non @-@ quantum ) mechanics . 
 These properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole . For example , a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object . Similarly , the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of Gauss 's law , the ADM mass , far away from the black hole . Likewise , the angular momentum can be measured from far away using frame dragging by the gravitomagnetic field . 
 When an object falls into a black hole , any information about the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole , and is lost to outside observers . The behavior of the horizon in this situation is a dissipative system that is closely analogous to that of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and electrical resistance — the membrane paradigm . This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism , which do not have any friction or resistivity at the microscopic level , because they are time @-@ reversible . Because a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with only three parameters , there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions : the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very little information about what went in . The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole horizon , including approximately conserved quantum numbers such as the total baryon number and lepton number . This behavior is so puzzling that it has been called the black hole information loss paradox . 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 The simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum . These black holes are often referred to as Schwarzschild black holes after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1916 . According to Birkhoff 's theorem , it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric . This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass . The popular notion of a black hole " sucking in everything " in its surroundings is therefore only correct near a black hole 's horizon ; far away , the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass . 
 Solutions describing more general black holes also exist . Non @-@ rotating charged black holes are described by the Reissner – Nordström metric , while the Kerr metric describes a non @-@ charged rotating black hole . The most general stationary black hole solution known is the Kerr – Newman metric , which describes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum . 
 While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value , the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass . In Planck units , the total electric charge Q and the total angular momentum J are expected to satisfy 
 <formula> 
 for a black hole of mass M. Black holes satisfying this inequality are called extremal . Solutions of Einstein 's equations that violate this inequality exist , but they do not possess an event horizon . These solutions have so @-@ called naked singularities that can be observed from the outside , and hence are deemed unphysical . The cosmic censorship hypothesis rules out the formation of such singularities , when they are created through the gravitational collapse of realistic matter . This is supported by numerical simulations . 
 Due to the relatively large strength of the electromagnetic force , black holes forming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star . Rotation , however , is expected to be a common feature of compact objects . The black @-@ hole candidate binary X @-@ ray source GRS 1915 + 105 appears to have an angular momentum near the maximum allowed value . 
 Black holes are commonly classified according to their mass , independent of angular momentum J or electric charge Q. The size of a black hole , as determined by the radius of the event horizon , or Schwarzschild radius , is roughly proportional to the mass M through 
 <formula> 
 where <unk> is the Schwarzschild radius and MSun is the mass of the Sun . This relation is exact only for black holes with zero charge and angular momentum ; for more general black holes it can differ up to a factor of 2 . 
 = = = Event horizon = = = 
 The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon — a boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole . Nothing , not even light , can escape from inside the event horizon . The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary , information from that event cannot reach an outside observer , making it impossible to determine if such an event occurred . 
 As predicted by general relativity , the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass . At the event horizon of a black hole , this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole . 
 To a distant observer , clocks near a black hole appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole . Due to this effect , known as gravitational time dilation , an object falling into a black hole appears to slow as it approaches the event horizon , taking an infinite time to reach it . At the same time , all processes on this object slow down , from the view point of a fixed outside observer , causing any light emitted by the object to appear redder and dimmer , an effect known as gravitational redshift . Eventually , the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen . 
 On the other hand , indestructible observers falling into a black hole do not notice any of these effects as they cross the event horizon . According to their own clocks , which appear to them to tick normally , they cross the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour ; it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations . 
 The shape of the event horizon of a black hole is always approximately spherical . For non @-@ rotating ( static ) black holes the geometry of the event horizon is precisely spherical , while for rotating black holes the sphere is oblate . 
 = = = Singularity = = = 
 At the center of a black hole , as described by general relativity , lies a gravitational singularity , a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite . For a non @-@ rotating black hole , this region takes the shape of a single point and for a rotating black hole , it is smeared out to form a ring singularity that lies in the plane of rotation . In both cases , the singular region has zero volume . It can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution . The singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite density . 
 Observers falling into a Schwarzschild black hole ( i.e. , non @-@ rotating and not charged ) cannot avoid being carried into the singularity , once they cross the event horizon . They can prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent , but only up to a limit ; after attaining a certain ideal velocity , it is best to free fall the rest of the way . When they reach the singularity , they are crushed to infinite density and their mass is added to the total of the black hole . Before that happens , they will have been torn apart by the growing tidal forces in a process sometimes referred to as <unk> or the " noodle effect " . 
 In the case of a charged ( Reissner – Nordström ) or rotating ( Kerr ) black hole , it is possible to avoid the singularity . Extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a wormhole . The possibility of traveling to another universe is however only theoretical , since any perturbation would destroy this possibility . It also appears to be possible to follow closed timelike curves ( returning to one 's own past ) around the Kerr singularity , which lead to problems with causality like the grandfather paradox . It is expected that none of these peculiar effects would survive in a proper quantum treatment of rotating and charged black holes . 
 The appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as signaling the breakdown of the theory . This breakdown , however , is expected ; it occurs in a situation where quantum effects should describe these actions , due to the extremely high density and therefore particle interactions . To date , it has not been possible to combine quantum and gravitational effects into a single theory , although there exist attempts to formulate such a theory of quantum gravity . It is generally expected that such a theory will not feature any singularities . 
 = = = Photon sphere = = = 
 The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness in which photons that move on tangents to that sphere would be trapped in a circular orbit about the black hole . For non @-@ rotating black holes , the photon sphere has a radius 1 @.@ 5 times the Schwarzschild radius . Their orbits would be dynamically unstable , hence any small perturbation , such as a particle of infalling matter , would cause an instability that would grow over time , either setting the photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole , or on an inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon . 
 While light can still escape from the photon sphere , any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole . Hence any light that reaches an outside observer from the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects between the photon sphere and the event horizon . 
 Other compact objects , such as neutron stars , can also have photon spheres . This follows from the fact that the gravitational field external to a spherically @-@ symmetric object is governed by the Schwarzschild metric , which depends only on the object 's mass rather than the radius of the object , hence any object whose radius shrinks to smaller than 1 @.@ 5 times the Schwarzschild radius will have a photon sphere . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is impossible to stand still , called the ergosphere . This is the result of a process known as frame @-@ dragging ; general relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly " drag " along the spacetime immediately surrounding it . Any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the direction of rotation . For a rotating black hole , this effect is so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to just stand still . 
 The ergosphere of a black hole is a volume whose inner boundary is the black hole 's event horizon and an outer boundary of an oblate spheroid , which coincides with the event horizon at the poles but noticeably wider around the equator . The outer boundary is sometimes called the <unk> . 
 Objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere . Through the Penrose process , objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered . This energy is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole causing the latter to slow . 
 = = = Innermost stable circular orbit ( ISCO ) = = = 
 In Newtonian gravity , test particles can stably orbit at arbitrary distances from a central object . In general relativity , however , there exists an innermost stable circular orbit ( often called the ISCO ) , inside of which , any infinitesimal perturbations to a circular orbit will lead to <unk> into the black hole . The location of the ISCO depends on the spin of the black hole , in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole ( spin zero ) is : 
 <formula> 
 and decreases with increasing spin . 
 = = Formation and evolution = = 
 Considering the exotic nature of black holes , it may be natural to question if such bizarre objects could exist in nature or to suggest that they are merely pathological solutions to Einstein 's equations . Einstein himself wrongly thought that black holes would not form , because he held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius . This led the general relativity community to dismiss all results to the contrary for many years . However , a minority of relativists continued to contend that black holes were physical objects , and by the end of the 1960s , they had persuaded the majority of researchers in the field that there is no obstacle to the formation of an event horizon . 
 Once an event horizon forms , Penrose proved , general relativity without quantum mechanics requires that a singularity will form within . Shortly afterwards , Hawking showed that many cosmological solutions that describe the Big Bang have singularities without scalar fields or other exotic matter ( see " Penrose – Hawking singularity theorems " ) . The Kerr solution , the no @-@ hair theorem , and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical properties of black holes were simple and comprehensible , making them respectable subjects for research . The primary formation process for black holes is expected to be the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars , but there are also more exotic processes that can lead to the production of black holes . 
 = = = Gravitational collapse = = = 
 Gravitational collapse occurs when an object 's internal pressure is insufficient to resist the object 's own gravity . For stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little " fuel " left to maintain its temperature through stellar nucleosynthesis , or because a star that would have been stable receives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature . In either case the star 's temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under its own weight . The collapse may be stopped by the degeneracy pressure of the star 's constituents , allowing the condensation of matter into an exotic denser state . The result is one of the various types of compact star . The type of compact star formed depends on the mass of the remnant of the original star left after the outer layers have been blown away . Such explosions and pulsations lead to planetary nebula . This mass can be substantially less than the original star . Remnants exceeding 5 M ☉ are produced by stars that were over 20 M ☉ before the collapse . 
 If the mass of the remnant exceeds about 3 – 4 M ☉ ( the Tolman – Oppenheimer – Volkoff limit ) , either because the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion of matter , even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to stop the collapse . No known mechanism ( except possibly quark degeneracy pressure , see quark star ) is powerful enough to stop the implosion and the object will inevitably collapse to form a black hole . 
 The gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of stellar mass black holes . Star formation in the early universe may have resulted in very massive stars , which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to 103 M ☉ . These black holes could be the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of most galaxies . It has further been suggested that supermassive black holes with typical masses of ~ 105 M ☉ could have formed from the direct collapse of gas clouds in the young universe . Some candidates for such objects have been found in observations of the young universe . 
 While most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly , an outside observer does not actually see the end of this process . Even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the reference frame of infalling matter , a distant observer would see the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon , due to gravitational time dilation . Light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the observer , with the light emitted just before the event horizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time . Thus the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon ; instead , the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly red @-@ shifted , eventually fading away . 
 = = = = Primordial black holes in the Big Bang = = = = 
 Gravitational collapse requires great density . In the current epoch of the universe these high densities are only found in stars , but in the early universe shortly after the big bang densities were much greater , possibly allowing for the creation of black holes . The high density alone is not enough to allow the formation of black holes since a uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass to bunch up . In order for primordial black holes to form in such a dense medium , there must be initial density perturbations that can then grow under their own gravity . Different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the size of these perturbations . Various models predict the creation of black holes , ranging from a Planck mass to hundreds of thousands of solar masses . Primordial black holes could thus account for the creation of any type of black hole . 
 = = = High @-@ energy collisions = = = 
 Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes . In principle , black holes could be formed in high @-@ energy collisions that achieve sufficient density . As of 2002 , no such events have been detected , either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance in particle accelerator experiments . This suggests that there must be a lower limit for the mass of black holes . Theoretically , this boundary is expected to lie around the Planck mass ( <unk> = √ <unk> / G ≈ 1 @.@ 2 × 1019 GeV / c2 ≈ 2 @.@ 2 × 10 − 8 kg ) , where quantum effects are expected to invalidate the predictions of general relativity . This would put the creation of black holes firmly out of reach of any high @-@ energy process occurring on or near the Earth . However , certain developments in quantum gravity suggest that the Planck mass could be much lower : some <unk> scenarios for example put the boundary as low as 1 TeV / c2 . This would make it conceivable for micro black holes to be created in the high @-@ energy collisions that occur when cosmic rays hit the Earth 's atmosphere , or possibly in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN . These theories are very speculative , and the creation of black holes in these processes is deemed unlikely by many specialists . Even if micro black holes could be formed , it is expected that they would evaporate in about 10 − 25 seconds , posing no threat to the Earth . 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 Once a black hole has formed , it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter . Any black hole will continually absorb gas and interstellar dust from its surroundings and omnipresent cosmic background radiation . This is the primary process through which supermassive black holes seem to have grown . A similar process has been suggested for the formation of intermediate @-@ mass black holes found in globular clusters . 
 Another possibility for black hole growth , is for a black hole to merge with other objects such as stars or even other black holes . Although not necessary for growth , this is thought to have been important , especially for the early development of supermassive black holes , which could have formed from the coagulation of many smaller objects . The process has also been proposed as the origin of some intermediate @-@ mass black holes . 
 = = = Evaporation = = = 
 In 1974 , Hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation ; this effect has become known as Hawking radiation . By applying quantum field theory to a static black hole background , he determined that a black hole should emit particles that display a perfect black body spectrum . Since Hawking 's publication , many others have verified the result through various approaches . If Hawking 's theory of black hole radiation is correct , then black holes are expected to shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles . The temperature of this thermal spectrum ( Hawking temperature ) is proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole , which , for a Schwarzschild black hole , is inversely proportional to the mass . Hence , large black holes emit less radiation than small black holes . 
 A stellar black hole of 1 M ☉ has a Hawking temperature of about 100 <unk> . This is far less than the 2 @.@ 7 K temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation . Stellar @-@ mass or larger black holes receive more mass from the cosmic microwave background than they emit through Hawking radiation and thus will grow instead of shrink . To have a Hawking temperature larger than 2 @.@ 7 K ( and be able to evaporate ) , a black hole would need a mass less than the Moon . Such a black hole would have a diameter of less than a tenth of a millimeter . 
 If a black hole is very small , the radiation effects are expected to become very strong . Even a black hole that is heavy compared to a human would evaporate in an instant . A black hole with the mass of a car would have a diameter of about 10 − 24 m and take a nanosecond to evaporate , during which time it would briefly have a luminosity of more than 200 times that of the Sun . Lower @-@ mass black holes are expected to evaporate even faster ; for example , a black hole of mass 1 TeV / c2 would take less than 10 − 88 seconds to evaporate completely . For such a small black hole , quantum gravitation effects are expected to play an important role and could hypothetically make such a small black hole stable , although current developments in quantum gravity do not indicate so . 
 The Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak and would thus be exceedingly difficult to detect from Earth . A possible exception , however , is the burst of gamma rays emitted in the last stage of the evaporation of primordial black holes . Searches for such flashes have proven unsuccessful and provide stringent limits on the possibility of existence of low mass primordial black holes . NASA 's Fermi Gamma @-@ ray Space Telescope launched in 2008 will continue the search for these flashes . 
 = = Observational evidence = = 
 By their very nature , black holes do not directly emit any electromagnetic radiation other than the hypothetical Hawking radiation , so astrophysicists searching for black holes must generally rely on indirect observations . For example , a black hole 's existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its gravitational interactions with its surroundings . However , the Event Horizon Telescope ( EHT ) , run by MIT 's Haystack Observatory , is an attempt to directly observe the immediate environment of the event horizon of Sagittarius A * , the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way . The first image of the event horizon may appear as early as 2018 . The existence of magnetic fields just outside the event horizon of Sagittarius A * , which were predicted by theoretical studies of black holes , was confirmed by the EHT in 2015 . 
 = = = Detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes = = = 
 On 24 September 2015 the LIGO gravitational wave observatory made the first @-@ ever successful observation of gravitational waves . The signal was consistent with theoretical predictions for the gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes : one with about 36 solar masses , and the other around 29 solar masses . This observation provides the most concrete evidence for the existence of black holes to date . For instance , the gravitational wave signal suggests that the separation of the two object prior to merger was just 350 km ( or roughly 4 times the Schwarzschild radius corresponding to the inferred masses ) . The objects must therefore have been extremely compact , leaving black holes as the most plausible interpretation . 
 More importantly , the signal observed by LIGO also included the start of the post @-@ merger ringdown , the signal produced as the newly formed compact object settles down to a stationary state . Arguably , the ringdown is the most direct way of observing a black hole . From the LIGO signal it is possible to extract the frequency and damping time of the dominant mode of the ringdown . From these it is possible to infer the mass and angular momentum of the final object , which match independent predictions from numerical simulations of the merger . The frequency and decay time of the dominant mode are determined by the geometry of the photon sphere . Hence , observation of this mode confirms the presence of a photon sphere , however it cannot exclude possible exotic alternatives to black holes that are compact enough to have a photon sphere . 
 The observation also provides the first observational evidence for the existence of stellar @-@ mass black hole binaries . Furthermore , it is the first observational evidence of stellar @-@ mass black holes weighing 25 solar masses or more . 
 = = = Proper motions of stars orbiting Sagittarius A * = = = 
 The proper motions of stars near the center of our own Milky Way provide strong observational evidence that these stars are orbiting a supermassive black hole . Since 1995 , astronomers have tracked the motions of 90 stars orbiting an invisible object coincident with the radio source Sagittarius A * . By fitting their motions to Keplerian orbits , the astronomers were able to infer , in 1998 , that a 2 @.@ 6 million M ☉ object must be contained in a volume with a radius of 0 @.@ 02 light @-@ years to cause the motions of those stars . Since then , one of the stars — called S2 — has completed a full orbit . From the orbital data , astronomers were able to make refine the calculations of the mass to 4 @.@ 3 million M ☉ and a radius of less than 0 @.@ 002 lightyears for the object causing the orbital motion of those stars . The upper limit on the object 's size is still too large to test whether it is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius ; nevertheless , these observations strongly suggest that the central object is a supermassive black hole as there are no other plausible scenarios for confining so much invisible mass into such a small volume . Additionally , there is some observational evidence that this object might possess an event horizon , a feature unique to black holes . 
 = = = Accretion of matter = = = 
 Due to conservation of angular momentum , gas falling into the gravitational well created by a massive object will typically form a disc @-@ like structure around the object . Artists ' impressions such as the accompanying representation of a black hole with corona commonly depict the black hole as if it were a flat @-@ space material body hiding the part of the disc just behind it , but detailed mathematical modelling shows that the image of the disc would actually be distorted by the bending of light that originated behind the black hole in such a way that the upper side of the disc would be entirely visible , while there would be a partially visible secondary image of the underside of the disk . 
 Within such a disc , friction would cause angular momentum to be transported outward , allowing matter to fall further inward , thus releasing potential energy and increasing the temperature of the gas . 
 When the accreting object is a neutron star or a black hole , the gas in the inner accretion disc orbits at very high speeds because of its proximity to the compact object . The resulting friction is so significant that it heats the inner disc to temperatures at which it emits vast amounts of electromagnetic radiation ( mainly X @-@ rays ) . These bright X @-@ ray sources may be detected by telescopes . This process of accretion is one of the most efficient energy @-@ producing processes known ; up to 40 % of the rest mass of the accreted material can be emitted as radiation . ( In nuclear fusion only about 0 @.@ 7 % of the rest mass will be emitted as energy . ) In many cases , accretion discs are accompanied by relativistic jets that are emitted along the poles , which carry away much of the energy . The mechanism for the creation of these jets is currently not well understood . 
 As such , many of the universe 's more energetic phenomena have been attributed to the accretion of matter on black holes . In particular , active galactic nuclei and quasars are believed to be the accretion discs of supermassive black holes . Similarly , X @-@ ray binaries are generally accepted to be binary star systems in which one of the two stars is a compact object accreting matter from its companion . It has also been suggested that some ultraluminous X @-@ ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate @-@ mass black holes . 
 In November 2011 the first direct observation of a quasar accretion disk around a supermassive black hole was reported . 
 = = = X @-@ ray binaries = = = 
 X @-@ ray binaries are binary star systems that emit a majority of their radiation in the X @-@ ray part of the spectrum . These X @-@ ray emissions are generally thought to result when one of the stars ( compact object ) accretes matter from another ( regular ) star . The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides a unique opportunity for studying the central object and to determine if it might be a black hole . 
 If such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object , it cannot be a black hole . The absence of such a signal does , however , not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star . By studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and to obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object . If this is much larger than the Tolman – Oppenheimer – Volkoff limit ( that is , the maximum mass a neutron star can have before it collapses ) then the object cannot be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole . 
 The first strong candidate for a black hole , Cygnus X @-@ 1 , was discovered in this way by Charles Thomas Bolton , Louise Webster and Paul Murdin in 1972 . Some doubt , however , remained due to the uncertainties that result from the companion star being much heavier than the candidate black hole . Currently , better candidates for black holes are found in a class of X @-@ ray binaries called soft X @-@ ray transients . In this class of system , the companion star is of relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates of the black hole mass . Moreover , these systems are actively emit X @-@ rays for only several months once every 10 – 50 years . During the period of low X @-@ ray emission ( called quiescence ) , the accretion disc is extremely faint allowing detailed observation of the companion star during this period . One of the best such candidates is <unk> Cyg . 
 = = = = <unk> and advection @-@ dominated accretion flow = = = = 
 The faintness of the accretion disc of an X @-@ ray binary during quiescence is suspected to be caused by the flow of mass entering a mode called an advection @-@ dominated accretion flow ( <unk> ) . In this mode , almost all the energy generated by friction in the disc is swept along with the flow instead of radiated away . If this model is correct , then it forms strong qualitative evidence for the presence of an event horizon , since if the object at the center of the disc had a solid surface , it would emit large amounts of radiation as the highly energetic gas hits the surface , an effect that is observed for neutron stars in a similar state . 
 = = = = Quasi @-@ periodic oscillations = = = = 
 The X @-@ ray emissions from accretion disks sometimes flicker at certain frequencies . These signals are called quasi @-@ periodic oscillations and are thought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion disk ( the innermost stable circular orbit ) . As such their frequency is linked to the mass of the compact object . They can thus be used as an alternative way to determine the mass of candidate black holes . 
 = = = Galactic nuclei = = = 
 Astronomers use the term " active galaxy " to describe galaxies with unusual characteristics , such as unusual spectral line emission and very strong radio emission . Theoretical and observational studies have shown that the activity in these active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) may be explained by the presence of supermassive black holes , which can be millions of times more massive than stellar ones . The models of these AGN consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the Sun ; a disk of gas and dust called an accretion disk ; and two jets perpendicular to the accretion disk . 
 Although supermassive black holes are expected to be found in most AGN , only some galaxies ' nuclei have been more carefully studied in attempts to both identify and measure the actual masses of the central supermassive black hole candidates . Some of the most notable galaxies with supermassive black hole candidates include the Andromeda Galaxy , M32 , M87 , NGC <unk> , NGC <unk> , NGC 4258 , NGC 4889 , NGC 1277 , OJ 287 , <unk> <unk> + <unk> and the Sombrero Galaxy . 
 It is now widely accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy , not just active ones , contains a supermassive black hole . The close observational correlation between the mass of this hole and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy 's bulge , known as the M @-@ sigma relation , strongly suggests a connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy itself . 
 = = = Microlensing ( proposed ) = = = 
 Another way that the black hole nature of an object may be tested in the future is through observation of effects caused by a strong gravitational field in their vicinity . One such effect is gravitational lensing : The deformation of spacetime around a massive object causes light rays to be deflected much as light passing through an optic lens . Observations have been made of weak gravitational lensing , in which light rays are deflected by only a few arcseconds . However , it has never been directly observed for a black hole . One possibility for observing gravitational lensing by a black hole would be to observe stars in orbit around the black hole . There are several candidates for such an observation in orbit around Sagittarius A * . 
 = = = Alternatives = = = 
 The evidence for stellar black holes strongly relies on the existence of an upper limit for the mass of a neutron star . The size of this limit heavily depends on the assumptions made about the properties of dense matter . New exotic phases of matter could push up this bound . A phase of free quarks at high density might allow the existence of dense quark stars , and some supersymmetric models predict the existence of Q stars . Some extensions of the standard model posit the existence of <unk> as fundamental building blocks of quarks and leptons , which could hypothetically form <unk> stars . These hypothetical models could potentially explain a number of observations of stellar black hole candidates . However , it can be shown from arguments in general relativity that any such object will have a maximum mass . 
 Since the average density of a black hole inside its Schwarzschild radius is inversely proportional to the square of its mass , supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes ( the average density of a 108 M ☉ black hole is comparable to that of water ) . Consequently , the physics of matter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more mundane . For example , a supermassive black hole could be modelled by a large cluster of very dark objects . However , such alternatives are typically not stable enough to explain the supermassive black hole candidates . 
 The evidence for the existence of stellar and supermassive black holes implies that in order for black holes to not form , general relativity must fail as a theory of gravity , perhaps due to the onset of quantum mechanical corrections . A much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not feature singularities or event horizons and thus black holes would not be real artifacts . In 2002 , much attention has been drawn by the <unk> model in string theory . Based on calculations for specific situations in string theory , the proposal suggests that generically the individual states of a black hole solution do not have an event horizon or singularity , but that for a classical / semi @-@ classical observer the statistical average of such states appears just as an ordinary black hole as deduced from general relativity . 
 = = Open questions = = 
 = = = Entropy and thermodynamics = = = 
 In 1971 , Hawking showed under general conditions that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease , even if they collide and merge . This result , now known as the second law of black hole mechanics , is remarkably similar to the second law of thermodynamics , which states that the total entropy of a system can never decrease . As with classical objects at absolute zero temperature , it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy . If this were the case , the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy @-@ laden matter entering a black hole , resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe . Therefore , Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy , and that it should be proportional to its horizon area . 
 The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking 's discovery that quantum field theory predicts that a black hole radiates blackbody radiation at a constant temperature . This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics , since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink . The radiation , however also carries away entropy , and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in Planck units is in fact always increasing . This allows the formulation of the first law of black hole mechanics as an analogue of the first law of thermodynamics , with the mass acting as energy , the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy . 
 One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume , since entropy is normally an extensive quantity that scales linearly with the volume of the system . This odd property led Gerard ' t Hooft and Leonard Susskind to propose the holographic principle , which suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume . 
 Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi @-@ classical calculation of black hole entropy , this situation is theoretically unsatisfying . In statistical mechanics , entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities ( such as mass , charge , pressure , etc . ) . Without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity , one cannot perform such a computation for black holes . Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity . In 1995 , Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa showed that counting the microstates of a specific supersymmetric black hole in string theory reproduced the Bekenstein – Hawking entropy . Since then , similar results have been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity . 
 = = = Information loss paradox = = = 
 Because a black hole has only a few internal parameters , most of the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost . Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole , it appears that only information concerning the total mass , charge , and angular momentum are conserved . As long as black holes were thought to persist forever this information loss is not that problematic , as the information can be thought of as existing inside the black hole , inaccessible from the outside . However , black holes slowly evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation . This radiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the matter that formed the black hole , meaning that this information appears to be gone forever . 
 The question whether information is truly lost in black holes ( the black hole information paradox ) has divided the theoretical physics community ( see Thorne – Hawking – <unk> bet ) . In quantum mechanics , loss of information corresponds to the violation of vital property called unitarity , which has to do with the conservation of probability . It has been argued that loss of unitarity would also imply violation of conservation of energy . Over recent years evidence has been building that indeed information and unitarity are preserved in a full quantum gravitational treatment of the problem .

 = Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live = 
 Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live ( also called Back to Business ) was the third residency show by American recording artist Beyoncé . Announced in March , and held during four consecutive nights in May 2012 in Atlantic City , New Jersey , the concerts were part of the opening of the new entertainment resort , hotel , casino and spa , Revel . Beyoncé stated that her alter ego Sasha Fierce was brought back to life for the performances and the main concept was the fact that the birth of her first baby made her more grounded . She promoted the shows by projecting images and releasing behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage on her official website . 
 The stage included several LED screens and the singer was backed by female background vocalists , all @-@ female band and dancers . The set list contained songs from Beyoncé 's four studio albums as well as several covers and " Jumpin ' , Jumpin ' " , which she recorded with her former girl group Destiny 's Child . She collaborated on outfits with several fashion designers including Ralph and Russo , Swarovski , Dolce & Gabbana , David Koma and her mother , designer Tina Knowles . Critics praised the costumes and Beyoncé 's look during the shows . 
 Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live received positive reviews from music critics who praised Beyoncé 's vocals and dance abilities during the concerts calling it her post @-@ pregnancy comeback show . Commercially , the shows were also successful with the tickets for all three shows being sold out in one minute on April 6 , 2012 , after they were made available for purchase . Later , when the fourth show was announced , it eventually sold out as well . A preview of the performance of " End of Time " appeared online on May 27 , 2012 and footage of the concert was used in Beyoncé 's 2013 HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream .

 On March 19 , 2012 , Beyoncé 's publicist Yvette Noel @-@ Schure announced that the singer would perform three shows ( May 25 – 27 , 2012 ) at Revel Atlantic City to inaugurate the resort and its Ovation Hall , a 5 @,@ 050 @-@ seat concert venue . The concerts were noted as the singer 's first performances since giving birth to her daughter , Blue Ivy Carter , in January of the same year and her first shows since the 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé residency shows in August 2011 . Rehearsals began in March , two months prior to the date of the concerts as Beyoncé had to lose sixty pounds for the show after her pregnancy . James Dinh of MTV News wrote that it was further expected from the concerts to be " much more of a grand spectacle " in comparison with 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé , with high @-@ tech LED display , intense choreography and video backdrops . 
 On March 20 , 2012 , several billboards by Beyoncé were projected on the Big Screen of the NASDAQ on Times Square advertising her show in Revel Atlantic City . On May 24 , 2012 , the first half of a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes video detailing the event premiered . It showed rehearsals and preparations for the show and a performance of " Halo " . In it , Beyoncé stated that she is excited , yet nervous about the shows . She said " [ Performing at Revel is ] like going back to my old job and it 's a little strange . " She continued saying that it was vital for her not to lose herself and still have her own passion even after she became a mother , something she was accomplishing with the shows . Director / Choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. said that the show had the potential of being the greatest show of Beyoncé 's career . The second behind @-@ the @-@ scenes video detailing the event premiered the next day , on May 25 , 2012 . During the video , Beyoncé stated that she tried to bring back to life her alter ego Sasha Fierce for the show . She further said that she is anxious about the show as her team was doing it in two weeks , unlike her previous shows which were prepared in two months . Beyoncé further revealed the concept of the show saying , " What I 'm trying to say with the show ... yes , I had a baby , but it just made me more grounded " . The concert was also called Back to Business referencing Beyoncé 's song " Run the World ( Girls ) " .

 Onstage , Beyoncé was backed by her all @-@ female band consisting of eleven members , background vocalists and ten dancers including the French duo Les Twins . The stage included several LED screens on which grainy @-@ color videos were shown as well as several black and white geometric patterns . Video interludes with voice @-@ overs recorded by Beyoncé were also shown . Dawn Fallik of The Wall Street Journal noted that the stage set offered " a seemingly endless number of screens and levels " for Beyoncé 's all @-@ female band . Jim Farber of the Daily News praised the look of the graphics saying that they were elegant and classic like a zebra 's stripes . The light shows during the performances were " modest " as described by Ben Ratliff of The New York Times . 
 Glenn Gamboa of Newsday wrote that the stage set of massive cubes was similar to the Watch the Throne Tour by Jay @-@ Z and Kanye West and noted that the " complicated " system of screens which was used to leave an impression that Beyoncé and her dancers were stepping in and out of black @-@ and @-@ white images was influenced by the opening credits of James Bond films . He further noted , " There were so many striking visual images both on stage and on screen , the show felt like a Pinterest board come to life -- packed with bold colors and graphics , elegant modern dance positions and video clips . " Tris McCall of The Star @-@ Ledger also compared the light @-@ up platforms on the stage with the towering cubes used during the Watch the Throne Tour . In another review , he noted , " The light show was as hypnotic as Laser Floyd , the costumes glittered like mirror balls , and the bass at Ovation Hall was so booming that I often felt like I was standing in a stiff wind . " Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote , 
 " Beyonce 's name might have been the one on the ticket for the two @-@ hour , 27 @-@ song program , but those responsible for its design and staging deserve as much credit as anyone . The show 's visual centerpiece was a stage @-@ spanning video display screen offering an endless array of multi @-@ hued shapes and geometric patterns , not to mention crystal @-@ clear wide shots and close @-@ ups of the star . The result was a dramatic presentation befitting a performer of Beyonce ’ s magnitude . " 
 The set list contained songs from Beyoncé 's four studio albums as well as " Jumpin ' , Jumpin ' " , which she recorded with Destiny 's Child . In addition of performing her songs , Beyoncé also covered Whitney Houston 's version of " I Will Always Love You " ( 1992 ) during the performance of " Halo " , Donna Summer 's " Love to Love You Baby " ( 1975 ) during the performance of " Naughty Girl " , Goo Goo Dolls ' " Iris " ( 1998 ) during " If I Were a Boy " and Lauryn Hill 's " Ex @-@ Factor " ( 1998 ) . Caryn Ganz of Spin magazine noted that Beyoncé 's up @-@ tempo songs were performed at the beginning of the concert . Fallik of The Wall Street Journal noted that the show " relied too much on lesser @-@ known , slower songs that lulled the crowd into their seats instead of bringing them to their feet " and added that " only a couple songs called for much movement " . 
 = = Fashion and wardrobe = = 
 The shows featured couture costumes designed by fashion house Ralph and Russo . Designer Tamara Ralph said Beyoncé asked them to be " really creative " while creating items with " an ultra @-@ glamorous feel to them " . The duo 's inspiration was " modern showgirl " , paying attention to the " comfort and flexibility of each outfit and the ease of getting in and out of the pieces with quick costume changes " . All the crystals for the show were provided by Swarovski ; a team of 20 <unk> worked to complete the looks , which were embellished with more than 500 @,@ 000 crystals from Swarovski Elements in four weeks . Beyoncé wore shoes by Stuart Weitzman . The dancers were dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and David Koma clothes . The band wore Alexander Vauthier clothes while The Mamas wore pin @-@ up girl clothing . Some clothes for the show were also designed by Beyoncé 's mother Tina Knowles . Beyoncé also worked with David Koma who designed a panelled bodysuit with lace detailing . Koma described his collaboration during an interview with Vogue , saying , " I absolutely love to work with Beyoncé and her team and I 'm very happy that she is back ... She looks more beautiful than ever and it 's always a pleasure to work with her ! " . Co @-@ designer Michael Russo further described his collaboration with Beyoncé , " Beyoncé always delivers energetic performances ... It was an absolute pleasure to work with her to create exquisite pieces that dazzle on stage . " 
 Beyoncé changed costumes five times during the show . Her looks ranged from a sparkling fringed set to a red leotard . Her fashion during the shows received praise from critics . Celia L. Smith of Essence magazine described Beyoncé 's look as " fabulous " while further calling her costumes " dazzling " and " fierce " . A writer of Vogue magazine noted that Beyoncé 's show " required something a little more spectacular than her recent dressed @-@ down chic " . Dawn Fallik of The Wall Street Journal commented that Beyoncé was " shedding costumes like a chameleon changing colors " during the show . He went on saying , " There were fashion montages with Beyonce in 1950s cat glasses , 1960s headbands and 1970s mod form " further concluding that the fashion was " all well and good " . Emily Sheridan of the Daily Mail also praised the costumes designed for the show , describing them as " sexy " . Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote in his review that the " shape @-@ hugging , leg @-@ baring costumes in which she was garbed were , by today 's standards , [ were ] almost demure .

During the performance of the song , pre @-@ recorded vocals by Jay @-@ Z who is featured on it were played . " Diva " was performed as the sixth song of the set . Prior to the performance of " Naughty Girl " , a spoken @-@ word segment about female sexuality was shown with Beyoncé saying " Harnessing the power of your body requires responsibility " . During the performance of the song she also included a sample of the groans and coos from Donna Summer 's " Love to Love You Baby " and sang a snippet of it as a tribute to the singer following her death . During the performance of the eighth song , " Party " , confetti were dropped on stage from the roof and dice @-@ shaped beach balls were being tossed through the crowd as dancers in large feathered headdresses performed a choreography in the aisles . During " Dance for You " , Beyoncé did not sing live but was accompanied vocally by her three backup vocalists and performed a choreographed bump and grind dance . She was wearing a black leotard during the performance of " Freakum Dress " which featured a strut @-@ heavy footwork . During the performance of " I Care " , Beyoncé matched the notes of her guitarist 's solo and " Schoolin ' Life " followed . " 1 + 1 " saw her singing the song seated on top of a piano and the performance focused on the singer and individual members of her band . 
 The ballad " I Miss You " was performed in front of an electronic backdrop in which a male dancer was silhouetted in kinetic , black @-@ and @-@ white stripes . A re @-@ arranged version of " Resentment " followed with an acoustic guitar used for its musical backbone . Beyoncé opened the performance of " If I Were a Boy " saying " We all know how it feels to be hurt and lied to " and later turned it into a guitar @-@ pop song , in which elements of Goo Goo Dolls ' adult @-@ alt ballad " Iris " were used . An acoustic cover of " Ex @-@ Factor " originally performed by Lauryn Hill followed . " Flaws and All " featured Beyoncé making facial expressions as she dedicated the song to her fans , singing the lines , " I don 't know why you love me / And that ’ s why I love you . " During the performance of " Irreplaceable " , she asked from the crowd to sing the lines " to the left " along with her and made a competition in singing between sections . The first verse and the chorus were sung solely by the crowd . The intro of " Countdown " began with Beyoncé 's ululations and moans , the Boyz II Men sample used in the song , and the opening drum crack and continued with the song 's music video being projected on the screen .

Cathy <unk> of <unk> commented that Beyoncé was " fiercer than ever " during the shows . Glenn Gamboa of Newsday described it as her " most ambitious live show yet " and noted that " the reason for the shows ... was to test herself , as a new mother and an artist . " USA Today 's Elysa Gardner praised the show , saying that " The singer was all business — that is to say , warm and gracious , glamorous and relentless . Backed by an all @-@ female band and a tireless posse of dancers and backup vocalists , Beyonce reasserted her unique pop persona ; she was at once angel and seductress , cool diva and woman of the people . " She noted that with the performance of the concerts , Beyoncé reaffirmed " her solidarity with all her fans " and confirmed that she plans on " sticking around for a good long time . " 
 Caryn Ganz of Spin wrote : " Beyoncé is the greatest performer of her generation and she knows it well .

Celia L. Smith of Essence magazine wrote that , " She sang , danced and put on a show like no other " . A writer for Rap @-@ Up noted that Beyoncé didn 't miss a step during the choreography and added that " Sasha Fierce is alive and well " . Writing that she didn 't disappoint , a journalist of Black Entertainment Television described the concert as " phenomenal " further praising the high @-@ energy performance of her up @-@ tempo songs and adding that she " dazzled " her fans . The journalist added that " Though she made it look easy , keeping up to the beat of the vibrant tunes was no easy task " and marked it as " [ the ] pop queen ’ s return to her throne " . Dawn Fallik of The Wall Street Journal praised Beyoncé 's dancing and voice during the show saying that they were in " enviable form " . Rebecca Thomas of MTV News described the performances as a " spectacular fitting her [ Beyoncé 's ] rising icon status " . 
 Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine noted that there were two highlights of the night , aside from the choreography and vocal prowess ; the dynamic between Beyoncé and her fans and the video montages from her personal life . Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Beyoncé was in a " fighting shape , breezing through four nights of wickedly aggressive modern R & B " and added that the most " attention @-@ grabbing " moments of the night were the covers of other artists that she performed during the concert . Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network noted that " Beyonce and her small army of supporting singers , dancers and musicians ... conjured an impressive onslaught of sight , sound and motion . " He further noted that unlike Lady Gaga and Madonna who used " sartorial extremism " to call attention to themselves , " It is testament to Beyonce ’ s star @-@ power that her stage incandescent presence never allowed the visual pyrotechnics behind her or the hyperkinetic dancers beside her to rise above the peripheral . " Praising the feminism showcased during the show , Tris McCall of The Star @-@ Ledger wrote in his review that Beyoncé gave everything she had for the concert pulling them out as vigorously as she could . He further added " The star gave Ovation Hall exactly what it wanted , and left the new theater smoking . The problem for Revel now : following it up .

He concluded that no other pop artist sounds " quite as awake " as Beyoncé does . 
 Beyoncé 's performance also received positive response from celebrities and fans . US First Lady Michelle Obama , who attended the show said , " Beyoncé stepped up in a way that so many of our celebrities and athletes are stepping up on behalf of this issue , so I love her to death and was glad to be out there moving my body with her . " Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie used his Twitter account to write that everything about the show was " great " . Beyoncé 's husband and rapper Jay @-@ Z , also wrote on Twitter that Beyoncé was the " best performer in the world " . A writer of Complex magazine further discussed his statements , " Sure , he 's married to her ... But upon further reflection , he just might have a point . What other artist out there gives the type of live performance she does on a nightly basis ? Who can give you that incredible voice singing power ballads and up @-@ tempo dance cuts — while dancing ? ...

 Fantasia is a 1940 American animated film produced by Walt Disney and released by Walt Disney Productions . With story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer , and production supervision by Ben Sharpsteen , it is the third feature in the Disney animated features canon . The film consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski , seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra . Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film 's Master of Ceremonies , providing a live @-@ action introduction to each animated segment . 
 Disney settled on the film 's concept as work neared completion on The Sorcerer 's Apprentice , an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse , who had declined in popularity . As production costs grew higher than what it could earn , Disney decided to include the short in a feature @-@ length film with other segments set to classical pieces . The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound , a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound . 
 Fantasia was first released in theatrical roadshow engagements held in thirteen U.S. cities from November 13 , 1940 . It received mixed critical reaction and was unable to make a profit due to World War II cutting off distribution to the European market , the film 's high production costs , and the expense of leasing theatres and installing the Fantasound equipment for the roadshow presentations . The film was subsequently reissued multiple times with its original footage and audio being deleted , modified , or restored in each version . As of 2012 , Fantasia has grossed $ 76 @.@ 4 million in domestic revenue and is the 22nd highest @-@ grossing film of all time in the U.S. when adjusted for inflation . Fantasia , as a franchise , has grown to include video games , Disneyland attractions , a live concert , and a theatrically released sequel ( Fantasia 2000 ) co @-@ produced by Walt 's nephew Roy E. Disney in 1999 . Fantasia has grown in reputation over the years and is now widely acclaimed ; in 1998 the American Film Institute ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their 100 Years ... 100 Movies and the fifth greatest animated film in their 10 Top 10 list .

 In 1936 , Walt Disney felt that the Disney studio 's star character Mickey Mouse needed a boost in popularity . He decided to feature the mouse in The Sorcerer 's Apprentice , a deluxe cartoon short based on the poem written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and set to the orchestral piece by Paul Dukas inspired by the original tale . The concept of matching animation to classical music was used as early as 1928 in Disney 's cartoon series , the Silly Symphonies , but he wanted to go beyond the usual slapstick , and produce shorts where " sheer fantasy unfolds ... action controlled by a musical pattern has great charm in the realm of unreality . " Upon receiving the rights to use the music by the end of July 1937 , Disney considered using a well @-@ known conductor to record the music for added prestige . He happened to meet Leopold Stokowski , conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra since 1912 , at Chasen 's restaurant in Hollywood , and talked about his plans for the short . Stokowski recalled that he did " like the music " ; was happy to collaborate on the project , and offered to conduct the piece at no cost . 
 Following their meeting , Disney 's New York representative ran into Stokowski on a train headed for the East Coast . In writing to Disney , he reported that Stokowski was " really serious in his offer to do the music for nothing . He had some very interesting ideas on instrumental coloring , which would be perfect for an animation medium " . In his excited response dated October 26 , 1937 , Disney wrote that he felt " all steamed up over the idea of Stokowski working with us ... The union of Stokowski and his music , together with the best of our medium , would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation . " He had already begun working on a story outline , and wished to use " the finest men ... from color ... down to animators " on the short . The Sorcerer 's Apprentice was to be promoted as a " special " and rented to theatres as a unique film , outside of the Mickey Mouse cartoon series . 
 An agreement signed by Disney and Stokowski on December 16 , 1937 , allowed the conductor to " select and employ a complete symphony orchestra " for the recording . Disney hired a stage at the Culver Studios in California for the session . It began at midnight on January 9 , 1938 , and lasted for three hours using eighty @-@ five Hollywood musicians . As production costs of The Sorcerer 's Apprentice climbed to $ 125 @,@ 000 , it became clearer to Disney and his brother Roy , who managed the studio 's finances , that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own . Roy wanted his brother to keep any additional costs on the film to a minimum . He said , " because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature ... we have no idea what can be expected from such a production . " Ben Sharpsteen , a production supervisor on Fantasia , noted that its budget was three to four times greater than the usual Silly Symphony , but Disney " saw this trouble in the form of an opportunity . This was the birth of a new concept , a group of separate numbers — regardless of their running time — put together in a single presentation . It turned out to be a concert — something novel and of high quality . " 
 Ideas to produce a complete feature film were pursued in February 1938 , when inquiries were made to extend Stokowski 's contract . In August , Disney asked Stokowski 's representative to have him return to the studios to select material for the new film , which was initially titled The Concert Feature . The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on @-@ screen host to introduce each number in the program . Both had heard composer and music critic Deems Taylor provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic , and agreed he would be most suitable for the role . Disney did contact Taylor about the project , but by then work on Pinocchio , Bambi , and development on his new Burbank studio kept him too busy to work on the new feature . In a change of plans , Taylor was asked during a call on September 3 , 1938 , leave to come to the studios as soon as possible . He left New York City for Los Angeles by train two days later for a month 's visit . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Taylor arrived at the studio one day after a series of meetings began to select the musical pieces for The Concert Feature . Disney made story writers Joe Grant and Dick Huemer gather a preliminary selection of music and along with Stokowski , Taylor , and the heads of various departments , discussed their ideas . Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review . As selections were considered , a recording of the piece was located and played back at the next gathering . Disney did not contribute much to early discussions ; he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained . In one meeting , he inquired about a piece " on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme ... with animals " . The group was considering The Firebird by Igor Stravinsky , but Taylor noted that his " Le Sacre du printemps would be something on that order " , to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording , " This is marvelous ! It would be perfect for prehistoric animals . There would be something terrific in dinosaurs , flying lizards , and prehistoric monsters . There could be beauty in the settings . " 
 Numerous choices were discarded as talks continued , including Moto Perpetuo by Niccolò Paganini with " shots of dynamos , cogs , pistons " and " whirling wheels " to show the production of a collar button . Other deleted material included Prelude in G minor and Troika by Sergei Rachmaninoff , and a rendition of " The Song of the Flea " by Mussorgsky , which was to be sung by Lawrence Tibbett . On September 29 , 1938 , around sixty of Disney 's artists gathered for a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hour piano concert while he provided a running commentary about the new musical feature . A rough version of The Sorcerer 's Apprentice was also shown that , according to one attendee , had the crowd applauding and cheering " until their hands were red . " The final pieces were chosen the following morning , which included Toccata and Fugue in D minor , <unk> et le <unk> @-@ pied by Gabriel Pierné , The Nutcracker Suite , Night on Bald Mountain , Ave Maria , Dance of the Hours , Clair de Lune by Claude Debussy , The Rite of Spring and The Sorcerer 's Apprentice . Disney had already begun working out the details for the segments , and showed greater enthusiasm and eagerness as opposed to his anxiety while starting on Pinocchio . 
 Clair de Lune was soon removed from the Fantasia program , but Disney and his writers encountered problems of setting a concrete story to <unk> . Its opening march , " The Entry of the Little <unk> " , attracted Disney to the piece which at first provided suitable depictions of fauns he wanted . On January 5 , 1939 , following a search for a stronger piece to fit the mythological theme , the piece was replaced with sections of Beethoven 's sixth symphony . Stokowski disagreed with the switch , believing that Disney 's " idea of mythology ... is not quite what this symphony is about " . He was also concerned about the reception from classical music enthusiasts who would criticize Disney for venturing too far from the composer 's intent . Taylor on the other hand welcomed the change , describing it as " a stunning one " , and saw " no possible objection to it " . 
 The new feature continued to be known as The Concert Feature or Musical Feature as late as November 1938 . Hal Horne , a publicist for Disney 's film distributor RKO Radio Pictures , wished for a different title , and gave the suggestion <unk> Concert . Stuart Buchanan then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1 @,@ 800 suggestions including Bach to Stravinsky and Bach and <unk> by Stokowski . Still , the favorite among the film 's supervisors was Fantasia , an early working title that had even grown on Horne , " It isn 't the word alone but the meaning we read into it . " From the beginning of its development , Disney expressed the greater importance of music in Fantasia compared to his past work : " In our ordinary stuff , our music is always under action , but on this ... we 're supposed to be picturing this music — not the music fitting our story . " Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to people that , including himself , had " walked out on this kind of stuff . " 
 = = = Design and animation = = = 
 Animation on The Sorcerer 's Apprentice began on January 21 , 1938 , when James Algar , the director of the segment , assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream . Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe 's 1797 poem Der <unk> , and were encouraged to complete a twenty @-@ question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place . Layout artist Tom <unk> created what Dick Huemer described as " brilliantly colored thumbnails " from preliminary storyboard sketches using gouache paints , which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short . Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils to his eyes for the first time to achieve greater ranges of expression . Most of the segment was shot in live action , including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio 's sound stages with barrels in the way , which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water . 
 Disney had been interested in producing abstract animation since he saw A Color Box by Len Lye from 1935 . He explained the work done in the Toccata and Fugue was " no sudden idea ... they were something we had nursed along several years but we never had a chance to try " . Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young , who produced drawings influenced by the patterns on the edge of a piece of sound film . In late 1938 Disney hired Oskar Fischinger , a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films , including some with classical music , to work with Young . Upon review of three <unk> reels produced by the two , Disney rejected all three . According to Huemer all <unk> " did was little triangles and designs ... it didn 't come off at all . Too dinky , Walt said . " Fischinger , like Disney , was used to having full control over his work and was not used to working in a group . Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience , <unk> left the studio in apparent despair , before the segment was completed , in October 1939 . Disney had plans to make the Toccata and Fugue an experimental three @-@ dimensional film , with audiences being given cardboard stereoscopic frames with their souvenir programs , but this idea was abandoned . 
 In The Nutcracker Suite , animator Art Babbitt is said to have credited The Three Stooges as a guide for animating the dancing mushrooms in the Chinese Dance routine . He drew with a music score pinned to his desk to work out the choreography so he could relate the action to the melody and the counterpoint , " those nasty little notes underneath ... so something has to be related to that " . The studio filmed professional dancers Joyce Coles and Marjorie Belcher wearing ballet skirts that resembled shapes of blossoms that were to sit above water for Dance of the Flutes . An Arabian dancer was also brought in to study the movements for the goldfish in Arab Dance . 
 An early concept for The Rite of Spring was to extend the story to the age of mammals and the first humans and the discovery of fire and man 's triumph . John Hubley , the segment 's art director , explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists , who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans . To gain a better understanding of the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews , the director of the American Museum of Natural History , English biologist Julian Huxley , paleontologist Barnum Brown , and astronomer Edwin Hubble . Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory , and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio . The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs . 
 According to Ward Kimball , the animators were " extremely specific on touchy issues " . In the making of The Pastoral Symphony Greek mythological segment , the female centaurs were originally drawn bare @-@ breasted , but the Hays office enforcing the Motion Picture Production Code insisted that they discreetly hung garlands around the necks . The male centaurs were also toned down to appear less intimidating to the audience . Originally black female centaurs " braided ' pickaninny ' hair , shining the hooves and grooming the tails of white centaurs " appeared in the film , but this was cut out years later for racial prejudicial reasons ( see Controversies ) . 
 For inspiration on the routines in Dance of the Hours , animators studied real life ballet performers including Marge Champion and Irina <unk> . Animator John Hench was assigned to work on the segment , but resisted as he knew little about ballet . Disney then gave Hench season tickets to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo with backstage access so he could learn more about it . According to R. D. Feild 's The Art of Walt Disney , in order to draw Hyacinth , the hippo prima ballerina , a woman weighing over 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) was brought onto the live @-@ action stage and her movements were recorded by cameramen , recording the " least quiver of her flesh , noticing those parts of her anatomy that were subjected to the greatest stress and strain " . Béla Lugosi , best known for his role in Dracula , was brought in to provide reference poses for Chernabog in the Night on Bald <unk> segment . As animator Bill Tytla disliked the results , he used colleague Wilfred Jackson to pose shirtless which gave him the images he needed . There were ideas of releasing scents throughout the theater during Fantasia , including the smell of incense during Ave Maria . 
 Over one thousand artists and technicians were used in the making of Fantasia , which features more than 500 animated characters . Segments were color @-@ keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones . Before a segment 's narrative pattern was complete , an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music , and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter . The studio 's character model department would also sculpt three @-@ dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles .

 Disney wanted to experiment in more sophisticated sound recording and reproduction techniques for Fantasia . " Music emerging from one speaker behind the screen sounds thin , tinkly and <unk> . We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces ... so that audiences would feel as though they were standing at the podium with Stokowski " . For the recording of The Sorcerer 's Apprentice in January 1938 , engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation for using multiple audio channels which allowed any desired dynamic balance to be achieved upon playback . The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi @-@ circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections to increase reverberation . Though as the production of Fantasia developed , the setup used for The Sorcerer 's Apprentice was abandoned for different multi @-@ channel recording arrangements . 
 On January 18 , 1939 , Stokowski signed an eighteen @-@ month contract with Disney to conduct the remaining pieces with the Philadelphia Orchestra . Recording began that April and lasted for seven weeks at the Academy of Music , the orchestra 's home which was chosen for its excellent acoustics . In the recording sessions , thirty @-@ three microphones were placed around the orchestra that captured the music onto eight optical sound recording machines placed in the hall 's basement . Each one represented an audio channel that focused on a different section of instruments : cellos and basses , violins , brass , violas , and woodwinds and tympani . The seventh channel was a combination of the first six while the eighth provided an overall sound of the orchestra at a distance . A ninth was later added to provide a click track function for the animators to time their drawings to the music . In the forty @-@ two days of recording 483 @,@ 000 feet ( 147 @,@ 000 m ) of film was used . Disney paid all the expenses which included the musician 's wages , stage personnel , a music librarian , and the orchestra 's manager that cost almost $ 18 @,@ 000 . When the finished recordings arrived at the studio , a meeting was held on July 14 , 1939 , to allow the artists working on each segment to listen to Stokowski 's arrangements , and suggest alterations in the sound to work more effectively with their designs .

 The Disney brothers contacted David Sarnoff of RCA regarding the manufacture of a new system that would " create the illusion that the actual symphony orchestra is playing in the theater . " Sarnoff backed out at first due to financial reasons , but agreed in July 1939 to make the equipment so long as the Disneys could hold down the estimated $ 200 @,@ 000 in costs . Though it was not exactly known how to achieve their goal , engineers at Disney and RCA investigated many ideas and tests made with various equipment setups . The collaboration led to the development of Fantasound , a pioneering stereophonic surround sound system which innovated some processes widely used today , including simultaneous multi @-@ track recording , overdubbing , and noise reduction . 
 Fantasound , developed in part by Disney engineer William Garity , employed two projectors running at the same time . With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes , the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the eight tracks recorded at the Academy to four : three of which contained the audio for the left , center , and right stage speakers respectively , while the fourth became a control track with amplitude and frequency tones that drove variable @-@ gain amplifiers to control the volume of the three audio tracks . In addition were three " house " speakers placed on the left , right , and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and right stage channels which acted as surround channels . As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase signal @-@ to @-@ noise ratio , the control track was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they should be . For this , a tone @-@ operated gain @-@ adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers . 
 The illusion of sound traveling across the speakers was achieved with a device named the " pan pot " , which directed the predetermined movement of each audio channel with the control track . Mixing of the soundtrack required six people to operate the various pan pots in real time , while Stokowski directed each level and pan change which was marked on his musical score . To monitor the recording levels at lower frequencies , Disney ordered eight three @-@ color oscillators from the newly established Hewlett @-@ Packard company , a predecessor from VU meters used today . Between the individual takes , prints , and remakes , approximately three million feet of sound film was used in the production of Fantasia . Almost a fifth of the film 's budget was spent on its recording techniques .

 RKO balked at the idea of distributing Fantasia , which it described as a " longhair musical " , and believed its duration of two hours and five minutes plus intermission was too long for a general release . It relaxed its exclusive distribution contract with Disney , who wanted a more prestigious exhibit in the form of a limited @-@ run roadshow attraction . A total of thirteen roadshows were held across the United States ; each involving two daily screenings with seat reservations booked in advance at higher prices and a fifteen @-@ minute intermission . Disney hired film salesman Irving Ludwig to manage the first eleven engagements , who was given specific instructions regarding each aspect of the film 's presentation , including the setup of outside theater marquees and curtain and lighting cues . Patrons were taken to their seats by staff hired and trained by Disney , and were given a program booklet illustrated by Gyo Fujikawa . 
 The first roadshow opened at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13 , 1940 . The Disneys had secured a year 's lease with the venue that was fully equipped with Fantasound , which took personnel a week working around the clock to install . Proceeds made on the night went to the British War Relief Society for the efforts in the Battle of Britain . Ticket demand was so great that eight telephone operators were employed to handle the extra calls while the adjoining store was rented out to cater the box office bookings . Fantasia ran at the Broadway for forty @-@ nine consecutive weeks , the longest run achieved by a film at the time . Its run continued for a total of fifty @-@ seven weeks until February 28 , 1942 . 
 The remaining twelve roadshows were held throughout 1941 , which included a 39 @-@ week run at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles from January 29 . Fantasia broke the long @-@ run record at the venue in its twenty @-@ eighth week ; a record previously held by Gone with the Wind . Its eight @-@ week run at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh attracted over 50 @,@ 000 people with reservations being made from cities located one hundred miles from the venue . Engagements were also held at the Geary Theatre in San Francisco for eight months , the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland for nine weeks , the Majestic Theatre in Boston , the Apollo Theater in Chicago , and also in Philadelphia , Detroit , Buffalo , Minneapolis , Washington , D.C. , and Baltimore . 
 Fantasia grossed over $ 300 @,@ 000 in the first sixteen weeks in New York ; over $ 20 @,@ 000 in the opening five weeks in San Francisco ; and almost the same amount in the first ten weeks both in Los Angeles and Boston . The first eleven roadshows earned a total of $ 1 @.@ 3 million by April 1941 , but the $ 85 @,@ 000 in production and installation costs of a single Fantasound setup , along with theatres having to be leased , forced Disney to exceed their loan limits . The onset of the Second World War prevented plans for a potential release in Europe , normally the source of as much as forty @-@ five per cent of the studio 's income . Up to eighty @-@ eight engagements were outlined across five years , but wartime demands for material limited the number of Fantasound prints to sixteen . All but one of the Fantasound setups were dismantled and given to the war effort . Upon acquiring the film 's distribution rights in April 1941 , RKO initially continued the roadshow booking policy but presented the film in mono , which was easier to exhibit . The combined average receipts from each roadshow was around $ 325 @,@ 000 , which placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio .

 Disney allowed RKO to handle the general release of Fantasia , but fought their decision to have the film cut . He gave in as the studio needed as much income as possible to remedy its finances , but refused to cut it himself , " You can get anybody you want to edit it ... I can 't do it . " With no input from Disney , musical director Ed Plumb and Ben Sharpsteen reduced Fantasia to one hour and forty minutes at first , then to one hour and twenty minutes by removing most of Taylor 's commentary and the Toccata and Fugue . Fantasia was re @-@ released in January 1942 at more popular prices with a mono soundtrack , and was placed on the lower half of double bills with the Western film Valley of the Sun . 
 RKO reissued Fantasia once more on September 1 , 1946 , with the animated sequences complete and the scenes of Taylor , Stokowski , and the orchestra restored but shortened . Its running time was restored to one hour and fifty @-@ five minutes . This edit would be the standard form for subsequent re @-@ releases , and was the basis for the 1990 restoration . 
 By 1955 the original sound negatives began to deteriorate , though a four @-@ track copy had survived in good condition . Using the remaining Fantasound system at the studio , a three @-@ track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood . This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in <unk> , a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format , on February 7 , 1956 . The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens , which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1 @.@ 33 : 1 to the wide ratio of 2 @.@ 35 : 1 in twenty seconds without a break in the film . This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels . Only selected parts of the animation were stretched , while all live action scenes remained unchanged . This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers , as the widescreen format led to the cropping and <unk> of the images . 
 On February 20 , 1963 , Fantasia was re @-@ released in both standard and <unk> versions with stereo sound , though existing records are unclear . Its running time was fifty @-@ six seconds longer than the previous issue which is unexplained . This was the final release that occurred before Disney 's death in 1966 .

 Fantasia began to make a profit from its $ 2 @.@ 28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17 , 1969 . The film was promoted with a psychedelic @-@ styled advertising campaign , and it became popular among teenagers and college students who were reported to have taken drugs for a psychedelic experience . Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people " thought we were on a trip when we made it ... every time we 'd go to talk to a school or something , they 'd ask us what we were on . " The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping . Fantasia was issued on a regular basis , typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns , until the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 The film was reissued nationwide once more on April 15 , 1977 , this time with simulated stereo sound . This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of Buena Vista Distribution , since RKO had not been part of a release since 1946 . It had not been removed earlier as the credit sequence would have required to be re @-@ shot . A two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ minute reduction in the film 's running time in this version remains unclear in existing records . 
 For the 1982 and 1985 releases Disney presented Fantasia with a completely new soundtrack recorded in Dolby Stereo . First released on April 2 , 1982 , this version of the film marked the first time a film 's soundtrack had been digitally re @-@ recorded in its entirety . To replace Stokowski 's recordings , the noted film conductor Irwin Kostal was engaged . He directed a 121 @-@ piece orchestra and 50 @-@ voice choir for the recording that took place over eighteen sessions and cost $ 1 million . To maintain continuity with the animation Kostal based his performance on the tempos and pacing of the Stokowski recordings , including the cuts and revisions to The Rite of Spring . However , for Night on Bald Mountain he used Mussorgsky 's original orchestration instead of Leopold Stokowski 's own edition that was part of the original soundtrack . The new recording also corrected a two @-@ frame lag in projection caused by the old recording techniques used in the 1930s . Deems Taylor 's scenes were deleted and a much briefer voiceover narration was recorded by Hugh Douglas as the studio felt the modern audience " is more sophisticated and knowledgeable about music . " This version returned to around 400 theaters in 1985 , this time with actor Tim Matheson providing the narration . 
 For its fiftieth anniversary , Fantasia returned to 550 theaters nationwide on October 5 , 1990 , in its traditional 1946 version including the live action scenes with Taylor and the original Stokowski score . The film underwent a two @-@ year restoration process which began after a six @-@ month search to piece together the original negatives that had been in storage since 1946 . This marked the first time since then that a release of the film had been processed from the original and not from a copy . Each of its 535 @,@ 680 frames were restored at <unk> Laboratories , and an untouched print from 1951 was used for guidance on color and tone . Theaters were required to have specific stereo equipment installed , and to present the film in its original 1 @.@ 33 : 1 aspect ratio with black borders on the side of their screens . The Stokowski soundtrack was digitally remastered using the 1955 magnetic soundtrack , with an estimated three thousand pops and hisses being removed in the process . The 1990 reissue of Fantasia went on to gross $ 25 million domestically .

 Disney considered releasing a multi @-@ disc 78 @-@ rpm record album of Fantasia 's soundtrack in conjunction with the film 's 1940 roadshow release , but this idea was not realized . The soundtrack was ultimately released as a three record LP set in sixteen countries by Disneyland Records in 1957 under the catalog number <unk> @-@ 101 . Disney was required to obtain permission from Stokowski , who initially rejected the deal unless the Philadelphia Orchestra Association received a share of the royalties . With nearly two hours of music , the Fantasia soundtrack album is the longest soundtrack album ever released of a Disney film . 
 The Fantasia soundtrack album contains all of the musical selections but none of the commentary from the film . After stereo LP 's became possible , Buena Vista Records released a stereo version of the soundtrack album . 
 The original soundtrack was remastered and issued as a two @-@ disc CD set by Walt Disney Records in 1991 and re @-@ released in 2006 . It eventually sold 100 @,@ 000 copies . In 1982 , Buena Vista Records also released a two @-@ disc edition of the re @-@ recorded soundtrack conducted by Irwin Kostal . This was also issued on CD by Walt Disney Records . 
 In 2015 , the film 's remastered soundtrack was released as the fifth volume in the Walt Disney Records : The Legacy Collection , in recognition of the film 's 75th anniversary . The Legacy release contains both Leopold Stokowski and Irwin Kostal versions of the film 's soundtrack as well as the never before released Stokowski recording of the deleted " Clair de Lune " segment . Sterling Holloway 's reading of the " Sorcerer 's Apprentice " and " Peter and the Wolf " ( from Make Mine Music ) are also included as bonus tracks .

The first , featuring the 1990 restored theatrical version , was released on VHS and laser disc on November 1 , 1991 , as part of the " Walt Disney Classics " line . The 50 @-@ day release prompted 9 @.@ 25 million advance orders for cassettes and a record 200 @,@ 000 for discs , doubling the figure of the previous record . The " Deluxe Edition " package included the film , a " making of " feature , a commemorative lithograph , a 16 @-@ page booklet , a two @-@ disc soundtrack of the Stokowski score and a certificate of authenticity signed by Roy E. Disney , the nephew of Walt . Fantasia became the biggest @-@ selling sell @-@ through cassette of all time with 14 @.@ 2 million copies being purchased . The record was surpassed by Beauty and the Beast in December 1992 . This version was also released as a DVD in 2000 , outside of the U.S. in the United Kingdom and other countries , again under the " Walt Disney Classics " banner . 
 In November 2000 , Fantasia was released on video for the second time , this time along with Fantasia 2000 , on DVD with 5 @.@ 1 surround sound . The films were issued both separately and in a three @-@ disc set called The Fantasia Anthology . A variety of bonus features were included in the bonus disc , The Fantasia Legacy . This edition attempted to follow as closely as possible the runtime and format of the original roadshow version , and included additional restored live @-@ action footage of Taylor and the orchestra , including the bookends to the film 's intermission . In the 2000 and 2010 releases , Deems Taylor 's voice has been overdubbed throughout by Corey Burton because most of the audio tracks to Taylor 's restored scenes have been lost . 
 Both films were reissued again by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in November 2010 separately , as a two @-@ disc DVD / Blu @-@ ray set and a combined DVD and Blu @-@ ray four @-@ disc ( named the " Fantasia 2 Movie Collection " ) set that featured 1080p high @-@ definition video and 7 @.@ 1 surround sound . The 2010 version of Fantasia featured a new restoration by Reliance MediaWorks and a new sound restoration , but was editorially identical to the 2000 version . This also marked the first time the roadshow version was released in Europe . Fantasia was withdrawn from release and returned to the " Disney Vault " moratorium on April 30 , 2011 .

 Early criticism 
 Fantasia garnered significant critical acclaim at the time of release and was seen by some critics as a masterpiece . The West Coast premiere at the Carthay Circle Theatre was a grand affair , attracting some 5000 people , including Shirley Temple , Cecil B. DeMille , Forrest Tucker , James Cagney , Robert Montgomery , James Murphy , Edgar Bergen , and many other notables in the film industry . Among those at the film 's premiere was film critic Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times who considered the film to be a magnificent achievement in film which would go down in film history as a landmark film , noting the rapturous applause the film received by the audience during the various interludes . He stated that Fantasia was " caviar to the general , ambrosia and nectar for the intelligentsia " and considered the film to be " courageous beyond belief " . Music critic of the newspaper , Isabel Morse Jones , was highly praising of the soundtrack to the film , believing it to be a " dream of a symphony concert " , an " enormously varied concert of pictorial ideas , of abstract music by acknowledged composers , of performers Leopold Stokowski and orchestra players of Hollywood and Philadelphia , and , for the vast majority , new and wonderful sound effects " . Bosley Crowther of The New York Times , also at the premiere , noted that " motion @-@ picture history was made last night ... Fantasia dumps conventional formulas overboard and reveals the scope of films for imaginative excursion ... Fantasia ... is simply terrific . " Peyton Boswell , an editor at Art Digest , called it " an aesthetic experience never to be forgotten " . Time magazine described the premiere as " stranger and more wonderful than any of Hollywood 's " and the experience of Fantasound " as if the hearer were in the midst of the music . As the music sweeps to a climax , it <unk> over the proscenium arch , boils into the rear of the theatre , all but prances up and down the aisles . " Dance Magazine devoted its lead story to the film , saying that " the most extraordinary thing about Fantasia is , to a dancer or <unk> , not the miraculous musical recording , the range of color , or the <unk> integrity of the Disney collaborators , but quite simply the perfection of its dancing . " Variety also hailed Fantasia , calling it " a successful experiment to lift the relationship from the plane of popular , mass entertainment to the higher strata of appeal to lovers of classical music . " The Chicago Tribune assigned three writers to cover the film 's Chicago premiere : society columnist Harriet <unk> ; film critic Mae Tinee ; and music critic Edward Barry . <unk> left amazed at the " brilliantly @-@ attired audience " , while Tinee felt the film was " beautiful ... but it is also bewildering . It is stupendous . It is colossal . It is an overwhelmingly ambitious orgy of color , sound , and imagination . " Barry was pleased with the " program of good music well performed ... and beautifully recorded " and felt " pleasantly distracted " from the music to what was shown on the screen . In a breakdown of reviews from both film and music critics , Disney author Paul Anderson found 33 % to be " very positive " , 22 % both " positive " and " positive and negative " , and 11 % negative . 
 Those who adopted a more negative view at the time of the film 's release came mostly from the classical music community . Many took fault with Stokowski 's rearrangements and abridgements of the music . Igor Stravinsky , the only living composer whose music was featured in the film , expressed displeasure at how in Stokowski 's arrangement of The Rite of Spring , “ the order of the pieces had been shuffled , and the most difficult of them eliminated , " and criticized the orchestra 's performance , observing that the simplification of the score " did not save the musical performance , which was execrable . " Other composers and music critics leveled criticism at the premise of the film itself , arguing that presenting classical music with visual images would rob the musical pieces of their integrity . Composer and music critic Virgil Thomson praised Fantasound which he thought offered " good transmission of music " , but disliked the " musical taste " of Stokowski , with exception to The Sorcerer 's Apprentice and The Rite of Spring . Olin Downes of The New York Times too hailed the quality of sound that Fantasound presented , but said , " much of Fantasia distracted from or directly injured the scores . " Film critic Pauline Kael dismissed parts of Fantasia as " grotesquely kitschy " . Some parents resisted paying the higher roadshow prices for their children , and several complained that the Night on Bald Mountain segment had frightened them . There were also a few negative reactions that were more political in nature , especially since the film 's release happened at a time when Nazi Germany reigned supreme in Europe . One review of the film in this manner , written by Dorothy Thompson for The New York Herald Tribune on November 25 , 1940 , was especially harsh . Thompson claimed that she " left the theater in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown , " because the film was a " remarkable nightmare . " Thompson went on to compare the film to rampant Nazism , which she described as " the abuse of power " and " the perverted betrayal of the best instincts . " Thompson also claimed that the film depicted nature as being " titanic " while man was only " a moving lichen on the stone of time . " She concluded that the film was " cruel " , " brutal and brutalizing " , and a negative " caricature of the Decline of the West " . In fact , Thompson claimed that she was so distraught by the film that she even walked out of it before she saw the two last segments , Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria , because she did not want to be subject to any more of the film 's " brutalization " . 
 Later criticism 
 Fantasia holds a 96 % " fresh " rating based on a sample of 50 reviews , with an average score of 8 @.@ 6 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes , a website which aggregates film reviews . Its consensus — " A landmark in animation and a huge influence on the medium of music video , Disney 's Fantasia is a relentlessly inventive blend of the classics with phantasmagorical images " . TV Guide awarded the film four stars , calling it " the most ambitious animated feature ever to come out of the Disney studios " , noting how the film " integrates famous works of classical music with wildly uneven but extraordinarily imaginative visuals that run the gamut from dancing hippos to the purely abstract " . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times rated the film four stars out of four , and noted that throughout Fantasia , " Disney pushes the edges of the envelope " . However , Empire magazine only rated it 2 stars out of 5 ( poor ) , concluding " this is a very patchy affair - while some of the animated pieces work , others come across as downright insane " . Remarks have also been made about Fantasia not being a children 's film . Mark I. Pinksy considers Fantasia to be one of the more problematic of Disney 's animated features in that it was intended as much as for adults as children and not what people had come to expect . 
 = = = Awards and honors = = = 
 Fantasia was ranked fifth at the 1940 National Board of Review Awards in the Top Ten Films category . Disney and Stokowski won a Special Award for the film at the 1940 New York Film Critics Circle Awards . Fantasia was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26 , 1942 — one for Disney , William Garity , John N. A. Hawkins , and the RCA Manufacturing Company for their " outstanding contribution to the advancement of the use of sound in motion pictures through the production of Fantasia " , and the other to Stokowski " and his associates for their unique achievement in the creation of a new form of visualized music in Walt Disney 's production Fantasia , thereby widening the scope of the motion picture as entertainment and as an art form " . 
 In 1990 , Fantasia was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " . On the 100th anniversary of cinema in 1995 , the Vatican included Fantasia in its list of 45 " great films " made under the Art category ; the others being Religion and Values . 
 Fantasia is featured in three lists that rank the greatest American films as determined by the American Film Institute . The film ranked number 58 in 100 Years ... 100 Movies in 1998 before it was dropped from its ranking in the 10th Anniversary revision in 2007 , though it was nominated for inclusion . The 10 Top 10 list formed in 2008 placed Fantasia fifth under Animation . 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 In the late 1960s , four shots from The Pastoral Symphony were removed that depicted two characters in a racially stereotyped manner . A black <unk> called Sunflower was depicted polishing the hooves of a white <unk> , and a second named <unk> appeared briefly during the procession scenes with Bacchus and his followers . According to Disney archivist David Smith , the sequence was aired uncut on television in 1963 before the edits were made for the film 's 1969 theatrical reissue . John <unk> , the editor responsible for the change in the 1991 video release , said : " It 's sort of appalling to me that these stereotypes were ever put in " . Film critic Roger Ebert commented on the edit : " While the original film should , of course , be preserved for historical purposes , there is no need for the general release version to perpetrate racist stereotypes in a film designed primarily for children . " The edits have been in place in all subsequent theatrical and home video reissues . 
 In May 1992 , the Philadelphia Orchestra Association filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company and Buena Vista Home Video . The orchestra maintained that as a co @-@ creator of Fantasia , the group was entitled to half of the estimated $ 120 million in profits from video and laser disc sales . The orchestra dropped its case in 1994 when the two parties reached an undisclosed settlement out of court . British music publisher Boosey & Hawkes filed a further lawsuit in 1993 , contending that Disney did not have the rights to distribute The Rite of Spring in the 1991 video releases because the permission granted to Disney by Stravinsky in 1940 was only in the context of a film to be shown in theaters . The United States district court backed Boosey & Hawkes 's case in 1996 , but the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling in 1998 , stating that Disney 's original " license for motion picture rights extends to video format distribution " . 
 = = Additional material = = 
 Disney had wanted Fantasia to be an ongoing project , with a new edition being released every few years . His plan was to substitute one of the original segments with a new one as it was completed , so audiences would always see a new version of the film . From January to August 1941 , story material was developed based on additional musical works , including Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner , The Swan of Tuonela by Jean Sibelius , Invitation to the Dance by Carl Maria von Weber , and Flight of the Bumblebee by Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , which was later adapted into the Bumble Boogie segment in Melody Time ( 1948 ) . There was also consideration for a segment inspired by the Polka and Fugue from <unk> the <unk> by Jaromír Weinberger . The film 's disappointing initial box office performance and the USA 's entry into World War II brought an end to these plans . Deems Taylor prepared introductions for The Firebird by Stravinsky , La Mer by Claude Debussy , Adventures in a <unk> by John Alden Carpenter , Don Quixote by Richard Strauss , and Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky " to have them for the future in case we decided to make any one of them " . 
 Another segment , Debussy 's Clair de lune , was developed as part of the film 's original program . After being completely animated , it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time . The animation depicted two egrets flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night . The sequence was later edited and re @-@ scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music ( 1946 ) . In 1992 , a workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored , complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra . It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000 .

 In 1980 , the Los Angeles Times reported that animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Mel Shaw had begun work on <unk> , " an ambitious concept mixing jazz , classical music , myths , modern art and more , following the old Fantasia format " . Animation historian Charles Solomon wrote that development took place between 1982 and 1983 , which combined " ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries " . Proposed segments for the film included a battle between an ice god and a sun goddess set to Finlandia by Sibelius , one set in the Andes to the songs of Yma Sumac , and another featuring caricatures of Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald . The project was shelved in favor of Mickey 's Christmas Carol . 
 Roy E. Disney , the nephew of Walt , co @-@ produced Fantasia 2000 which entered production in 1990 and features seven new segments performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with conductor James Levine . The Sorcerer 's Apprentice is the only segment retained from the original film . Fantasia 2000 premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 17 , 1999 as part of a five @-@ city live concert tour , followed by a four @-@ month engagement in IMAX cinemas and a wide release in regular theatres , in 2000 . 
 Early development for a third film began in 2002 , with a working title of Fantasia 2006 . Plans were made to include The Little <unk> by Roger Allers and One by One by <unk> Hunt in the film before the project was shelved in 2004 , with the proposed segments released as individual short films .

 Fantasia is parodied in A Corny Concerto , a Warner Bros. cartoon from 1943 of the Merrie Melodies series . The short features Elmer Fudd in the role of Taylor , wearing his styled eyeglasses , who introduces two segments set to pieces by Johann Strauss ( Tales from the Vienna Woods and the Blue Danube Waltz , the former featuring Porky and Bugs and the latter featuring Daffy ) . In 1976 , Italian animator Bruno <unk> produced Allegro Non Troppo , a feature @-@ length parody of Fantasia . Jerry Bruckheimer used the story of The Sorcerer 's Apprentice as a basis for his eponymous fantasy @-@ adventure film in 2010 . Disney are developing the Night on Bald Mountain sequence from the film with Matt <unk> and Burk Sharpless writing and executive produce the live action film . 
 The animated television series The Simpsons references Fantasia in a few episodes . Matt Groening , the creator of the franchise , expressed a wish to make a parody film named Simpstasia ; it was never produced , partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature @-@ length script . In " Treehouse of Horror IV " , director David Silverman had admired the animation in Night on Bald Mountain , and made the first appearance of Devil Flanders resemble Chernabog . The episode " Itchy & Scratchy Land " references The Sorcerer 's Apprentice in a snippet titled " Scratchtasia " , which features the music and several shots parodying it exactly . 
 In 2014 , BBC Music created a film similar to Fantasia called Ten Pieces , intended to introduce children to classical music . Several pieces featured in the Fantasia films are included along with an original body music piece called " Connect It " . 
 In June 2015 plans were announced to adapt the " Night on Bald Mountain " sequence into a live @-@ action film .

 = USS Wyandotte ( 1864 ) = 
 Originally named USS Tippecanoe , after the river in Indiana , USS Wyandotte was a single @-@ turreted Canonicus @-@ class monitor built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War . Completed after the end of the war , Wyandotte was laid up until 1876 , although she received her new name in 1869 . The ship was commissioned in 1876 and assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron for the next three years . She became a receiving ship in 1879 until she was placed in reserve again in 1885 . Wyandotte was on militia duty when the Spanish – American War began and she was recommissioned in 1898 to defend Boston , Massachusetts from any Spanish raiders . The ship was decommissioned after the end of the war and sold for scrap in 1899 . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 The ship was 224 feet 6 inches ( 68 @.@ 4 m ) long overall , had a beam of 43 feet 5 inches ( 13 @.@ 2 m ) and had a maximum draft of 13 feet 3 inches ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) . Wyandotte had a tonnage of 1 @,@ 034 tons burthen and displaced 2 @,@ 100 long tons ( 2 @,@ 100 t ) . Her crew consisted of 100 officers and enlisted men . 
 Wyandotte was powered by a two @-@ cylinder horizontal vibrating @-@ lever steam engine that drove one propeller using steam generated by two Stimers horizontal fire @-@ tube boilers . The 320 @-@ indicated @-@ horsepower ( 240 kW ) engine gave the ship a top speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . She carried 140 – 150 long tons ( 140 – 150 t ) of coal . Wyandotte 's main armament consisted of two smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading , 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret . Each gun weighed approximately 43 @,@ 000 pounds ( 20 @,@ 000 kg ) . They could fire a 350 @-@ pound ( 158 @.@ 8 kg ) shell up to a range of 2 @,@ 100 yards ( 1 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of + 7 ° . 
 The exposed sides of the hull were protected by five layers of 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) wrought iron plates , backed by wood . The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one @-@ inch plates . The ship 's deck was protected by armor 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . A 5 @-@ by @-@ 15 @-@ inch ( 130 by 380 mm ) soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened to several of the older Passaic @-@ class monitors during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863 . The base of the funnel ( ship ) was protected to a height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) by 8 inches ( 200 mm ) of armor . A " rifle screen " of 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) armor 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) high was installed on the top of the turret to protected the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven , captain of her sister ship Tecumseh . The only known modification after the ship 's completion was the addition of a hurricane deck between the turret and the funnel sometime after the end of the Civil War . 
 The contract for Wyandotte , the only Navy ship to be named after the Wyandotte Indian Tribe , was awarded to Miles Greenwood ; the ship was laid down on 28 September 1862 at the shipyard of John <unk> in Cincinnati , Ohio . She was launched on 22 December 1864 and completed on 15 February 1866 . The ship 's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors . This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret . Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) to increase the ship 's buoyancy , moving the position of the turret to balance the ship 's trim and replacing all of the ship 's deck armor . Completion of the ship was further delayed by the low depth of the Ohio River which prevented her movement from Cincinnati in December 1864 to finish their fitting out . The river finally rose in March 1865 which allowed the ship to reach New Albany , Indiana on 14 March . Wyandotte was moved to Evansville , Indiana in late May to complete her hull where rudimentary facilities and illness among her workers delayed her construction still further . 
 The monitor joined her sisters Oneota , Manayunk , and Catawba in ordinary opposite Cairo , Illinois when she was completed on 15 February 1866 although they drew enough water that they had to be anchored in the main channel where they were often struck by debris , drifting ice , and were vulnerable to accidents . Wyandotte 's anchor chain was broken on 27 March when she was struck by a steamboat towing barges and the ship collided with Oneota and the two ships were dragged 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) downstream before they could be brought under control . This was a persistent problem and the Navy finally decided to move the ships down to New Orleans in May 1866 . In 1869 , she was twice renamed , first to Vesuvius on 15 June and then Wyandotte on 10 August . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The monitor was moved to Key West , Florida in 1870 and then to the Philadelphia Navy Yard by 1872 . In 1873 – 74 , Wyandotte was thoroughly overhauled by John Roach & Sons in Chester , Pennsylvania and commissioned for the first time on 24 January 1876 , under the command of Lieutenant Thomas C. Terrell . The ship was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron through 1879 and spent her time on exercises and training cruises ; she was based at Hampton Roads , Virginia for a while . She served as the station ship at Washington , D.C. , beginning in 1879 , before she was again placed in reserve in 1885 , first at Richmond , Virginia and then at Norfolk , Virginia . 
 Wyandotte was transferred to the Connecticut Naval Militia in 1896 , and she was recommissioned for local defense duties on 30 April 1898 during the Spanish – American War in response to political pressure . Commanded by Lt. John B. Milton , the ship sailed from New Haven , Connecticut on 17 May , to guard Boston and remained on there from 19 May to 5 September . Wyandotte sailed to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania after the end of the war and arrived there on 9 September . She was decommissioned on 20 September and sold for scrap on 17 January 1899 . 
 = Toluid Civil War = 
 The Toluid Civil War was fought between Kublai Khan and his younger brother , Ariq Böke , from 1260 to 1264 . Möngke Khan died in 1259 with no declared successor , precipitating infighting between members of the Tolui family line for the title of Great Khan that escalated to a civil war . The Toluid Civil War , and the wars that followed it ( such as the Berke – Hulagu war and the <unk> – Kublai war ) , weakened the authority of the Great Khan over the Mongol Empire and split the empire into autonomous khanates . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Tolui family successfully enthroned their candidate for Great Khan , Möngke , in the <unk> of 1250 and 1251 . The <unk> candidate for Great Khan , <unk> , and his cousin <unk> , were embittered by their loss and plotted a failed assassination of Möngke . Möngke took revenge by purging his opponents in the royal house , and members of both the Chagatai and Ögedei families . 
 Möngke handed control over the Caucasus region to the Golden Horde in 1252 . With the approval of Möngke , Berke succeeded his brother , Batu , as Khan of the Golden Horde in Russia in 1255 . Hulagu of the Ilkhanate seized control of the Caucasus from the Golden Horde , and his sacking of Baghdad in 1258 angered Berke , a convert to Islam . Möngke Khan died in 1259 without appointing a successor . He likely favored Ariq Böke , whom Möngke designated in 1258 as commander of Karakorum ( then capital of the empire ) , but he did little else to secure Ariq Böke 's claim to the throne . 
 = = Civil war = = 
 Kublai Khan was campaigning against the southern Song in 1260 when he received news that Ariq Böke was challenging him for the succession of the throne . Ariq Böke formed alliances with powerful members of the Mongol nobility to endorse him as a candidate for Great Khan . Most of Möngke 's immediate family supported Ariq Böke . Kublai withdrew from the Song and mobilized his troops to fight Ariq Böke . In China , Kublai summoned a kurultai at <unk> , where he was elected Great Khan . This was the first kurultai to proclaim a Great Khan outside the Mongol homeland or Central Asia . Ariq Böke convened his own kurultai in Karakorum that proclaimed him Great Khan a month later , creating two rival claimants for the throne . Hulagu embarked for Mongolia to attend the kurultai , but the Mamluk defeat of the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut forced him to retreat back to the Middle East . Berke capitalized on the Mamluk victory by invading the Ilkhanate , beginning the Berke – Hulagu war . 
 Ariq Böke allied with Berke Khan of the Golden Horde and Alghu of the Chagatai Khanate . Hulagu of the Ilkhanate was the sole ally of Kublai Khan . Berke supported Ariq Böke because he was resentful of Hulagu , who had close ties with Kublai . Hulagu and Berke , however , became occupied with their own war and could not intervene in the Toluid Civil War . 
 Kublai had access to supplies from the fertile lands of China , while Ariq Böke had to import resources to Karakorum in the semi @-@ arid steppes . Kublai Khan depended on these supplies from China and therefore needed Chinese popular support to win the civil war . Kublai ingratiated himself to his subjects with the help of his Chinese advisers . He presented himself as a sage emperor capable of uniting the Chinese , and Ariq Böke as a destructive usurper . Kublai promised to reduce taxes , modeled his government institutions to resemble those of the Chinese dynasties , and adopted the era name of <unk> , which means " moderate rule " . His policies were popular in northern China , but had no impact on his relations with the Southern Song . The Song invaded while Kublai was preoccupied with the civil war , and recovered territory previously lost to the Mongols . Kublai dispatched a diplomat , Hao Jing , to discuss the prospects of a peaceful resolution to the war with the Southern Song . The Song , however , rejected Kublai 's overtures and imprisoned Hao for the next decade . 
 Kublai now controlled three of the four possible supply lines to Karakorum . Kadan , Kublai 's <unk> ally , defended the territories of the former Western Xia from Ariq Böke and commanded the forces stationed in Gansu . Kublai 's troops guarded the area surrounding Yan ( modern Beijing ) . The only supply line still open to Ariq Böke was the Yenisei River valley in the northwest . When Kublai 's army advanced towards Karakorum in late 1260 , Ariq Böke retreated from Karakorum to a tributary of the Yenisei . The oncoming winter then compelled Kublai and Ariq Böke to encamp their armies and wait for spring . 
 In the interim , Kublai acquired more supplies and men . He fortified Yan and the border defenses of northern China . Kadan defeated and executed <unk> , a general sent to secure the vital Central Asian trade routes for Ariq Böke . Lian Xixian , one of Kublai 's Confucian advisers , commanded soldiers for the khan in western China . He won a victory against Ariq Böke 's ally , Liu Taiping , in northwestern China , seizing food supplies intended for Ariq Böke 's army . Lian also drove supporters of Ariq Böke out of the towns of <unk> and Ganzhou . In southwestern China , his forces protected Sichuan from Ariq Böke 's encroaching troops . Kublai paid Kadan and Lian Xixian handsomely for their military service in gifts and promotions . He rewarded Kadan with 300 packs of silk and 300 taels of silver , and appointed Lian Xixian to the position of Prime Minister of the Right in the Secretariat . 
 Kublai 's victories left Alghu as Ariq Böke 's only standing ally . Ariq Böke convinced Alghu to take control of the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia . Chagatai 's khan , Qara <unk> , had recently died . Alghu fought and killed <unk> , a rival claimant to the throne endorsed by Kublai as ruler of the khanate . Alghu was one of Ariq Böke 's strongest supporters and he appointed him khan of Chagatai . The khanate became an important source of Ariq Böke 's provisions . Ariq Böke gave Alghu complete control over tax revenues in the region . 
 In 1261 , Kublai and Ariq Böke engaged in battle at <unk> . Ariq Böke lost the battle and retreated . He returned to the region ten days later to challenge Kublai 's forces near the <unk> Mountains of eastern Mongolia . The troops that Ariq Böke attacked were not personally led by Kublai , and made up only a small portion of Kublai 's army . Even so , the battle ended in a stalemate . Meanwhile , most of Mongolia was now under the control of Kublai , threatening Ariq Böke 's control of the Yenisei Valley supply line . A weakened Ariq Böke entreated Alghu for help . Alghu refused , and executed the envoys sent by Ariq Böke , who had demanded a share of Alghu 's tax revenues . 
 At this time , a rebellion in China distracted Kublai from the civil war , and he departed for <unk> instead of further pursuing Ariq Böke . Ariq Böke went to war with Alghu after the threat of an attack by Kublai receded . Alghu defeated Ariq Böke 's commander , Khara <unk> , near the Ili River in Xinjiang , but lost his headquarters at <unk> to Ariq Böke . He withdrew to the oasis cities of the Tarim Basin . 
 Ariq Böke was now left with few allies , and several of his supporters deserted from his side . <unk> Tash , son of Möngke , defected , taking his father 's <unk> seal from Ariq Böke and giving it to Kublai as a symbol of his loyalty . Alghu then returned to the Ili River to remove Ariq Böke from Xinjiang . Ariq Böke lacked the resources or the allies to defend himself . He surrendered to Kublai in 1264 , ending the civil war . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Kublai imprisoned Ariq Böke , but did not immediately punish him . Kublai 's supporters wanted retribution , so Kublai ignored Ariq Böke for a year as punishment . He conducted a purge to eliminate officials in the Mongol government who sympathized with Ariq Böke . Kublai accused <unk> , an important Mongol official who served under Möngke , of treachery for conspiring with Ariq Böke . Kublai authorized the execution of <unk> and other Ariq Böke supporters . Kublai summoned a kurultai to decide a punishment for Ariq Böke and solidify his own claim to the throne . Kublai was reluctant to punish his brother without public support of the Mongol nobility . Ariq Böke died mysteriously in 1266 while still imprisoned , leading to speculation that Kublai had secretly poisoned him . 
 Ariq Böke 's defeat by Kublai could not stop the fracturing of the empire . When Kublai convened his kurultai to confirm his status as Great Khan , none of the three other khans attended . Berke and Hulagu continued fighting , until Hulagu died in 1265 . The Ögedei line sought to exploit the disunity to advance the interests of their own family . They held a grudge against the Tolui family for the kurultai of 1251 and the subsequent purge of the <unk> after the assassination plot . <unk> , from the Ögedei family , believed that a member of the <unk> deserved the title of Great Khan and started an insurrection in 1269 against Kublai that lasted for decades . 
 Most of the western khanates did not recognize Kublai as Great Khan . Although some of them still asked Kublai to confirm the enthronement of their new regional khans , the four khanates were functionally independent sovereign states . The Ilkhanate based in Persia and the Yuan dynasty based in China had close diplomatic relations , and shared scientific and cultural knowledge , but military cooperation between all four Mongol khanates would never occur again — the united Mongol Empire had disintegrated . 
 = Once Upon a Time ( game ) = 
 Once Upon a Time is a card game produced by Atlas Games , originally released in 1994 with a second edition published in 1995 and the current third edition in 2012 . One object of Once Upon a Time is to tell a fairy tale as a group . While the story is developed by the whole group , the competitive aspect of the game is that each player has an individual goal of using all of the " Storytelling " cards he or she has in hand , and finishing the story with their own special " Happy Ever After " card . Only one player at a time is the current storyteller , giving him or her a chance to play their Storytelling cards , while the other players have a chance to " interrupt " the story and become the storyteller if , for example , the storyteller mentions something on one of the interrupting player 's cards . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Each player is dealt a hand of cards that represent story elements : objects , people , events , and " aspects " often involved in fairy tales ( for instance , there are cards for " crown " , " key " , " stepmother " , " a death " , " time passes " , " sleeping " , et cetera ) . These " Storytelling " cards represent ingredients of a fairy tale , i.e. words or phrases that are likely to appear in fairy tales . From a different deck of cards , each player is also dealt a single " Happy Ever After " ending card , to be kept secret from other players until it is used . The object of the game for each player is to use their cards in telling a story , finishing the story by using their Happy Ever After card . 
 One player at a time is the storyteller . ( The 2nd edition rules suggest the starting storyteller could be the " player with the longest beard " , or any other method upon which the players agree . ) Whenever a story ingredient is mentioned , if any player has a Storytelling card for that ingredient , he or she can play it and become ( or continue being ) the storyteller . A player may be required to draw extra Storytelling cards ( for example , when they are the storyteller and are interrupted by another player who becomes the new storyteller , or if he or she hesitates for too long while telling the story ) . If the storyteller ends the story with the ending on their Happy Ever After card , and is out of cards , he or she wins . Players are expected to cooperate ( to some extent ) in order to avoid contradictions in the story as it develops , for the story to make sense , and ( according to the rulebook ) that any ending to the story is " satisfying " .

 = Avery Point Light = 
 Avery Point Light or Avery Point Lighthouse is a lighthouse in Groton , Connecticut , United States , on the Avery Point Campus of the University of Connecticut . Although construction was completed in March 1943 , the lighthouse was not lit until May 1944 due to concerns of possible enemy invasion . Its original light consisted of eight 200 @-@ watt bulbs that were later replaced by a flashing green light in 1960 . It was deactivated on June 25 , 1967 , when the United States Coast Guard Training Station moved to Governors Island . It is officially listed as the last lighthouse built in the state ; the only other claimant is the replica Mystic Seaport Light . 
 The lighthouse deteriorated until it was declared a hazard by the University of Connecticut in 1997 . A restoration effort was launched in 1999 through the American Lighthouse Foundation ( ALF ) and in 2000 by a new local chapter , the Avery Point Lighthouse Society . The restoration of the lighthouse began in 2001 and was completed in 2006 , requiring a replica lantern and extensive structural repairs and replacement of the crumbling of the blocks . Two bills for $ 150 @,@ 000 and $ 100 @,@ 000 were appropriated and used to complete the restoration . The relighting and re @-@ dedication of the lighthouse was held on October 15 , 2006 . The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 .

 The land upon which Avery Point Light was constructed was owned by Morton F. Plant 's estate ; his Branford Manor is located several hundred feet away . Twenty four years after Plant 's death the estate was sold to the state of Connecticut before being transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard . The Coast Guard 's deed required the construction and maintenance of beacon lights or other navigational aids as part of the Coast Guard 's new training facility . The Avery Point Light was named for Captain James Avery of New London , Connecticut . 
 The Avery Point Light was designed by Alfred Hopkins and Associates to be a 41 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) octagonal tower . Construction of the tower was completed in March 1943 ; it is built of brown concrete blocks and topped with an octagonal wooden lantern . During the restoration effort , it was discovered that six different types of concrete blocks were used in the construction . The tower has a total of five windows , with two facing south and one for the north , east and west . The lantern gallery deck is constructed of concrete and lined with thirty two Italian marble balusters , originally imported from Italy around 1900 . The interior has an iron ladder , originally wooden , that leads up to the watchroom level . The lighthouse design and masonry tower have Colonial Revival elements . It is the last lighthouse built in the state of Connecticut as an official navigational aid .

 The Avery Point Light was not lighted until May 2 , 1944 , due to concerns about possible enemy invasions by sea . D 'Entremont notes that the first light , consisting of eight 200 @-@ watt bulbs , were an unusual array that created a fixed white light source . Though it never had a formal keeper , the lighthouse was tended by personnel or students from the United States Coast Guard Training Station . In 1960 , the light was changed to flashing green and the candlepower rating doubled from 100 to 200 . The light was deactivated on June 25 , 1967 when the training facility moved from Avery Point to Governors Island .

 The Avery Point Light was listed by the university as being in " dangerously poor condition " by July 1997 and declared it a safety hazard . In December 2007 , Lighthouse Digest included a brief article with the title " Avery Point added to Doomsday List " after rumors of it being torn down were reported . The article included two images that show the blocked off lighthouse with its crumbling bricks and a sign reading " Keep Out Hazardous Area " . In 1999 , fund @-@ raising began to save and restore the lighthouse through the American Lighthouse Foundation ( ALF ) and in 2000 through the Avery Point Lighthouse Society ( <unk> ) , a chapter of the ALF . 
 In 2000 , the <unk> website estimated $ 25 @,@ 000 for the initial engineering study and $ 150 @,@ 000 @-@ 200 @,@ 000 to complete the restoration . In 2001 , Connecticut State Senator Catherine Cook introduced a bill for $ 150 @,@ 000 in bonds to fund the restoration of the Avery Point Light ; it was later approved . An article in the New London Day also noted an engineering study valued at $ 40 @,@ 000 was being conducted for no cost by James <unk> 's engineering firm of <unk> , Norden and Champion . 
 On December 1 , 2001 , the first part of the restoration began with the removal of the lantern . Due the deterioration of the lantern , the decision was made to make a replica of the original lantern . From 2003 through 2004 , the West Mystic Wooden Boat Building Company , donated the materials and labor to construct the replica . The company 's owner , Steve Jones , has close ties to the Avery Point Light ; he is a former lighthouse keeper for the Harbor of Refuge Light in Lewes , Delaware and is also a University of Connecticut professor . 
 The concrete blocks used in the construction were of poor construction due to the high sand content that crumbled with the expanding and contraction of the mortar . The decision was made to replace the outer face of the concrete blocks and strengthen the remaining original blocks with cement and steel reinforcements . A total of 3 @,@ 000 blocks were needed to complete the restoration and had to be produced using special molds . The restoration work on the tower began in September 2003 . Though increased costs of the restoration resulted in another need of funding to complete the project . In 2003 , federal funding for another $ 100 @,@ 000 came from the National Park Service 's " Save America ’ s Treasures Act " and it was endorsed by Senators Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman . Delays in the appropriation of funding delayed the second phase of the structural restoration until June 2005 ; and the work was conducted from July through early November . The relighting and re @-@ dedication of the lighthouse was held on October 15 , 2006 .

 The lighthouse has been claimed to be a memorial tower in various sources , including the 1994 America 's Atlantic Coast Lighthouses : A Traveler 's Guide which states " the tower was built as a memorial tower and as a symbolic representation of the USCG lighthouse keeping responsibilities . " D 'Entremont notes that the misunderstanding stems from an article from 1955 in U.S. Coast Guard Magazine and acknowledges that it has come to serve as a memorial . The lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 . 
 = William IV of the United Kingdom = 
 William IV ( William Henry ; 21 August 1765 – 20 June 1837 ) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover from 26 June 1830 until his death . The third son of George III and younger brother and successor to George IV , he was the last king and penultimate monarch of Britain 's House of Hanover . 
 William served in the Royal Navy in his youth and was , both during his reign and afterwards , nicknamed the " Sailor King " . He served in North America and the Caribbean . In 1789 , he was created Duke of Clarence and St Andrews . Since his two older brothers died without leaving legitimate issue , he inherited the throne when he was 64 years old . His reign saw several reforms : the poor law was updated , child labour restricted , slavery abolished in nearly all the British Empire , and the British electoral system refashioned by the Reform Act 1832 . Although William did not engage in politics as much as his brother or his father , he was the last monarch to appoint a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament . Through his brother , the Viceroy of Hanover , he granted his German kingdom a short @-@ lived liberal constitution . 
 At the time of his death William had no surviving legitimate children , but he was survived by eight of the ten illegitimate children he had by the actress Dorothea Jordan , with whom he cohabited for twenty years . William was succeeded in the United Kingdom by his niece , Victoria , and in Hanover by his brother , Ernest Augustus . 
 = = Early life = = 
 William was born in the early hours of the morning on 21 August 1765 at Buckingham House , the third child and son of King George III and Queen Charlotte . He had two elder brothers , George and Frederick , and was not expected to inherit the Crown . He was baptised in the Great Council Chamber of St James 's Palace on 20 September 1765 . His godparents were his paternal uncles , the Duke of Gloucester and Prince Henry ( later Duke of Cumberland ) , and his paternal aunt , Princess Augusta , then hereditary duchess of Brunswick @-@ Wolfenbüttel . 
 He spent most of his early life in Richmond and at Kew Palace , where he was educated by private tutors . At the age of thirteen , he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman , and was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780 . His experiences in the navy seem to have been little different from those of other midshipmen , though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ships by a tutor . He did his share of the cooking and got arrested with his shipmates after a drunken brawl in Gibraltar ; he was hastily released from custody after his identity became known . 
 He served in New York during the American War of Independence . While William was in America , George Washington approved a plot to kidnap him , writing : " The spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in your plan for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the Prince William Henry and Admiral Digby merits applause ; and you have my authority to make the attempt in any manner , and at such a time , as your judgment may direct . I am fully persuaded , that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince or Admiral ... " The plot did not come to fruition ; the British heard of it and assigned guards to William , who had up till then walked around New York unescorted . 
 He became a lieutenant in 1785 and captain of HMS Pegasus the following year . In late 1786 , he was stationed in the West Indies under Horatio Nelson , who wrote of William : " In his professional line , he is superior to two @-@ thirds , I am sure , of the [ Naval ] list ; and in attention to orders , and respect to his superior officer , I hardly know his equal . " The two were great friends , and dined together almost nightly . At Nelson 's wedding , William insisted on giving the bride away . He was given command of the frigate HMS Andromeda in 1788 , and was promoted to rear @-@ admiral in command of HMS Valiant the following year . 
 William sought to be made a duke like his elder brothers , and to receive a similar parliamentary grant , but his father was reluctant . To put pressure on him , William threatened to stand for the House of Commons for the constituency of Totnes in Devon . Appalled at the prospect of his son making his case to the voters , George III created him Duke of Clarence and St Andrews and Earl of Munster on 16 May 1789 , supposedly saying : " I well know it is another vote added to the Opposition . " William 's political record was inconsistent and , like many politicians of the time , cannot be certainly ascribed to a single party . He allied himself publicly with the Whigs as well as his elder brothers George , Prince of Wales , and Frederick , Duke of York , who were known to be in conflict with the political positions of their father . 
 = = Service and politics = = 
 The newly created duke ceased his active service in the Royal Navy in 1790 . When Britain declared war on France in 1793 , he was anxious to serve his country and expected a command , but was not given a ship , perhaps at first because he had broken his arm by falling down some stairs drunk , but later because he gave a speech in the House of Lords opposing the war . The following year he spoke in favour of the war , expecting a command after his change of heart ; none came . The Admiralty did not even reply to his request . He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post . In 1798 he was made an admiral , but the rank was purely nominal . Despite repeated petitions , he was never given a command throughout the Napoleonic Wars . In 1811 , he was appointed to the honorary position of Admiral of the Fleet . In 1813 , he came nearest to any actual fighting , when he visited the British troops fighting in the Low Countries . Watching the bombardment of Antwerp from a church steeple , he came under fire . A bullet pierced his coat . 
 Instead of serving at sea , he spent time in the House of Lords , where he spoke in opposition to the abolition of slavery , which although not legal in the United Kingdom still existed in the British colonies . Freedom would do the slaves little good , he argued . He had travelled widely and , in his eyes , the living standard among freemen in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland was worse than that among slaves in the West Indies . His experience in the West Indies lent weight to his position , which was perceived as well @-@ argued and just by some of his contemporaries . Others thought it " shocking that so young a man , under no bias of interest , should be earnest in continuance of the slave trade " . In his speech to the House of Lords , the Duke insulted William Wilberforce , the leading abolitionist , saying : " the proponents of the abolition are either fanatics or hypocrites , and in one of those classes I rank Mr. Wilberforce " . On other issues he was more liberal , such as supporting moves to abolish penal laws against dissenting Christians . He also opposed efforts to bar those found guilty of adultery from remarriage . 
 = = Relationships and marriage = = 
 From 1791 William lived with an Irish actress , Dorothea Bland , better known by her stage name , Mrs. Jordan , the title " Mrs. " being assumed at the start of her stage career to explain an inconvenient pregnancy and " Jordan " because she had " crossed the water " from Ireland to Britain . 
 William was part of the first generation to grow to maturity under the Royal Marriages Act 1772 , which forbade descendants of George II from marrying unless they either obtained the monarch 's consent or , if over the age of 25 , gave twelve months ' notice to the Privy Council . Several of George III 's sons , including William , chose to cohabit with the women they loved , rather than seek a wife . Having legitimate issue was not a primary concern for William , as he was one of the younger sons of George III , he was not expected to figure in the succession , which was considered secure once the Prince of Wales married and had a daughter , Princess Charlotte , second @-@ in @-@ line to the throne . 
 William appeared to enjoy the domesticity of his life with Mrs. Jordan , remarking to a friend : " Mrs. Jordan is a very good creature , very domestic and careful of her children . To be sure she is absurd sometimes and has her humours . But there are such things more or less in all families . " The couple , while living quietly , enjoyed entertaining , with Mrs. Jordan writing in late 1809 : " We shall have a full and merry house this Christmas , ' tis what the dear Duke delights in . " George III was accepting of his son 's relationship with the actress ( though recommending that he halve her allowance ) ; in 1797 , he created William Ranger of Bushy Park , which included a large residence , Bushy House , for William 's growing family . William used Bushy as his principal residence until he became king . His London residence , Clarence House , was constructed to the designs of John Nash between 1825 and 1827 . 
 The couple had ten illegitimate children — five sons and five daughters — nine of whom were named after William 's siblings ; each was given the surname " FitzClarence " . Their affair lasted for twenty years before ending in 1811 . Mrs. Jordan had no doubt as to the reason for the break @-@ up : " Money , money , my good friend , has , I am convinced made HIM at this moment the most wretched of men , " adding , " With all his excellent qualities , his domestic virtues , his love for his lovely children , what must he not at this moment suffer ? " She was given a financial settlement of £ 4 @,@ 400 ( equivalent to £ 287 @,@ 900 today ) per year and custody of her daughters on condition that she did not resume the stage . When she resumed acting in an effort to repay debts incurred by the husband of one of her daughters from a previous relationship , William took custody of the daughters and stopped paying the £ 1 @,@ 500 ( equivalent to £ 94 @,@ 600 today ) designated for their maintenance . After Mrs. Jordan 's acting career began to fail , she fled to France to escape her creditors , and died , impoverished , near Paris in 1816 . 
 Before he met Mrs. Jordan , William had an illegitimate son whose mother is unknown ; the son , also called William , drowned off Madagascar in HMS Blenheim in February 1807 . Caroline von <unk> , whose father was a general in the Hanoverian infantry , claimed to have had a son , Heinrich , by William in around 1790 but William was not in Hanover at the time that she claims and the story is considered implausible by historians . 
 Deeply in debt , William made multiple attempts at marrying a wealthy heiress , but his suits were unsuccessful . Following the death of William 's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales , then second @-@ in @-@ line to the British throne , in 1817 , the king was left with twelve children , but no legitimate grandchildren . The race was on among the royal dukes to marry and produce an heir . William had great advantages in this race — his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives , who were both beyond childbearing age anyway , and William was the healthiest of the three . If he lived long enough , he would almost certainly ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones , and have the opportunity to sire the next monarch . William 's initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother , the Prince of Wales , or turned him down . William 's younger brother Adolphus , the Duke of Cambridge , was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses ; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse @-@ Kassel , but her father Frederick declined the match . Two months later , the Duke of Cambridge married Augusta himself . Eventually , a princess was found who was amiable , home @-@ loving , and was willing to accept , even enthusiastically welcoming William 's nine surviving children , several of whom had not yet reached adulthood . At Kew on 11 July 1818 , William married Princess Adelaide of Saxe @-@ Meiningen , the daughter of George I , Duke of Saxe @-@ Meiningen . At 25 , Adelaide was half William 's age . Their marriage , which lasted almost twenty years until William 's death , was a happy one . Adelaide took both William and his finances in hand . For their first year of marriage , the couple lived in economical fashion in Germany , and William 's debts were soon on the way to being paid , especially since Parliament had voted him an increased allowance , which he reluctantly accepted after his requests to increase it further were refused . William is not known to have had mistresses after his marriage . The couple had two short @-@ lived daughters and Adelaide suffered three miscarriages . Despite this , false rumours that Adelaide was pregnant persisted into William 's reign — he dismissed them as " damned stuff " . 
 = = Lord High Admiral = = 
 William 's elder brother , the Prince of Wales , had been Prince Regent since 1811 because of the mental illness of their father , George III . In 1820 , the King died , leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent , who became George IV . William , Duke of Clarence , was now second in the line of succession , preceded only by his brother , Frederick , Duke of York . Reformed since his marriage , William walked for hours , ate relatively frugally , and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water flavoured with lemon . Both of his older brothers were unhealthy , and it was considered only a matter of time before he became king . When the Duke of York died in 1827 , William , then more than 60 years old , became heir presumptive . Later that year , the incoming Prime Minister , George Canning , appointed William to the office of Lord High Admiral , which had been in commission ( that is , exercised by a board rather than by a single individual ) since 1709 . While in office , the Duke had repeated conflicts with his Council , which was composed of Admiralty officers . Things finally came to a head in 1828 when , as Lord High Admiral , William put to sea with a squadron of ships , leaving no word of where they were going , and remaining away for ten days . The King , through the Prime Minister , by now Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , requested his resignation ; the Duke of Clarence complied . 
 Despite the difficulties the Duke experienced , he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral . He abolished the cat o ' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny , attempted to improve the standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship . He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more . Holding the office permitted William to make mistakes and learn from them — a process that might have been far more costly had he not learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors . 
 William spent the remaining time during his brother 's reign in the House of Lords . He supported the Catholic Emancipation Bill against the opposition of his younger brother , Ernest Augustus , Duke of Cumberland , describing the latter 's position on the Bill as " infamous " , to the Duke of Cumberland 's outrage . George IV 's health was increasingly bad ; it was obvious by early 1830 that he was near death . The King took his leave of his younger brother at the end of May , stating , " God 's will be done . I have injured no man . It will all rest on you then . " William 's genuine affection for his older brother could not mask his rising anticipation that he would soon be king . 
 = = Reign = = 
 = = = Early reign = = = 
 When King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without surviving legitimate issue , the Duke of Clarence succeeded him as William IV . Aged 64 , he was the oldest person yet to assume the British throne . Unlike his extravagant brother , William was unassuming , discouraging pomp and ceremony . In contrast to George IV , who tended to spend most of his time in Windsor Castle , William was known , especially early in his reign , to walk , unaccompanied , through London or Brighton . Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing , he was very popular among the people , who saw him as more approachable and down @-@ to @-@ earth than his brother . 
 The King immediately proved himself a conscientious worker . His first Prime Minister Arthur Wellesley , the Duke of Wellington , stated that he had done more business with King William in ten minutes than he had with George IV in as many days . Lord Brougham described him as an excellent man of business , asking enough questions to help him understand the matter — whereas George IV feared to ask questions lest he display his ignorance and George III would ask too many and then not wait for a response . 
 The King did his best to endear himself to the people . Charlotte Williams @-@ Wynn wrote shortly after his accession : " Hitherto the King has been indefatigable in his efforts to make himself popular , and do good natured and amiable things in every possible instance . " Emily Eden noted : " He is an immense improvement on the last unforgiving animal , who died growling <unk> in his den at Windsor . This man at least wishes to make everybody happy , and everything he has done has been benevolent . " 
 William dismissed his brother 's French chefs and German band , replacing them with English ones to public approval . He gave much of George IV 's art collection to the nation , and halved the royal stud . George IV had begun an extensive ( and expensive ) renovation of Buckingham Palace ; his brother refused to reside there , and twice tried to give the palace away , once to the Army as a barracks , and once to Parliament after the Houses of Parliament burned down in 1834 . His informality could be startling : When in residence at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton , King William used to send to the hotels for a list of their guests and invite anyone whom he knew to dinner , urging guests not to " bother about clothes . The Queen does nothing but <unk> flowers after dinner . " 
 Upon taking the throne , William did not forget his nine surviving illegitimate children , creating his eldest son Earl of Munster and granting the other children the precedence of a younger son ( or daughter ) of a marquess . Despite this , his children importuned for greater opportunities , disgusting elements of the press who reported that the " impudence and rapacity of the <unk> is unexampled " . The relationship between William and his sons " was punctuated by a series of savage and , for the King at least , painful quarrels " over money and honours . His daughters , on the other hand , proved an ornament to his court , as , " They are all , you know , pretty and lively , and make society in a way that real princesses could not . " 
 = = = Reform crisis = = = 
 At the time , the death of the monarch required fresh elections and , in the general election of 1830 , Wellington 's Tories lost ground to the Whigs under Charles Grey , 2nd Earl Grey , though the Tories still had the largest number of seats . With the Tories bitterly divided , Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November , and Lord Grey formed a government . Grey pledged to reform the electoral system , which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century . The inequities in the system were great ; for example , large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members ( though they were part of county constituencies ) , while small boroughs — known as rotten or pocket boroughs — such as Old Sarum with just seven voters , elected two members of Parliament each . Often , the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats , whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents — who were , most often , their tenants — especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections . Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates . 
 When the House of Commons defeated the First Reform Bill in 1831 , Grey 's ministry urged William to dissolve Parliament , which would lead to a new general election . At first , William hesitated to exercise his prerogative to dissolve Parliament because elections had just been held the year before and the country was in a state of high excitement which might boil over into violence . He was , however , irritated by the conduct of the Opposition , which announced its intention to move the passage of an Address , or resolution , in the House of Lords , against dissolution . Regarding the Opposition 's motion as an attack on his prerogative , and at the urgent request of Lord Grey and his ministers , William IV prepared to go in person to the House of Lords and prorogue Parliament . The monarch 's arrival would stop all debate and prevent passage of the Address . When initially told that his horses could not be ready at such short notice , William is supposed to have said , " Then I will go in a hackney cab ! " Coach and horses were assembled quickly and William immediately proceeded to Parliament . Said The Times of the scene before William 's arrival , " It is utterly impossible to describe the scene ... The violent tones and gestures of noble Lords ... astonished the spectators , and affected the ladies who were present with visible alarm . " Lord Londonderry brandished a whip , threatening to thrash the Government supporters , and was held back by four of his colleagues . William hastily put on the crown , entered the Chamber , and dissolved Parliament . This forced new elections for the House of Commons , which yielded a great victory for the reformers . But although the House of Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform , the House of Lords remained implacably opposed to it . 
 The crisis saw a brief interlude for the celebration of the King 's Coronation on 8 September 1831 . At first , William wished to dispense with the coronation entirely , feeling that his wearing the crown while proroguing Parliament answered any need . He was persuaded otherwise by traditionalists . He refused , however , to celebrate the coronation in the expensive way his brother had — the 1821 coronation had cost £ 240 @,@ 000 , of which £ 16 @,@ 000 was merely to hire the jewels . At William 's instructions , the Privy Council budgeted less than £ 30 @,@ 000 for the coronation . When traditionalist Tories threatened to boycott what they called the " Half Crown @-@ nation " , the King retorted that they should go ahead , and that he anticipated " greater convenience of room and less heat " . 
 After the rejection of the Second Reform Bill by the Upper House in October 1831 , agitation for reform grew across the country ; demonstrations grew violent in so @-@ called " Reform Riots " . In the face of popular excitement , the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat in the House of Lords , and re @-@ introduced the Bill , which still faced difficulties in the House of Lords . Frustrated by the Lords ' recalcitrance , Grey suggested that the King create a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill . The King objected — though he had the power to create an unlimited number of peers , he had already created 22 new peers in his Coronation Honours . William reluctantly agreed to the creation of the number of peers sufficient " to secure the success of the bill " . However , the King , citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the peerage , told Grey that the creations must be restricted as much as possible to the eldest sons and collateral heirs of existing peers , so that the created peerages would eventually be absorbed as subsidiary titles . This time , the Lords did not reject the bill outright , but began preparing to change its basic character through amendments . Grey and his fellow ministers decided to resign if the King did not agree to an immediate and large creation to force the bill through in its entirety . The King refused , and accepted their resignations . The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office , but Wellington had insufficient support to form a ministry and the King 's popularity sank to an all @-@ time low . Mud was slung at his carriage and he was publicly hissed . The King agreed to reappoint Grey 's ministry , and to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties . Concerned by the threat of the creations , most of the bill 's opponents abstained and the Reform Act 1832 was passed . The mob blamed William 's actions on the influence of his wife and brother , and his popularity recovered . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 William distrusted foreigners , particularly anyone French , which he acknowledged as a " prejudice " . He also felt strongly that Britain should not interfere in the internal affairs of other nations , which brought him into conflict with the interventionist Foreign Secretary , Lord Palmerston . William supported Belgian independence and , after unacceptable Dutch and French candidates were put forward , favoured Prince Leopold of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , the widower of his niece , Charlotte , as a candidate for the newly created Belgian throne . 
 Though he had a reputation for <unk> and buffoonery , William could be shrewd and diplomatic . He foresaw that the potential construction of a canal at Suez would make good relations with Egypt vital to Britain . Later in his reign , he flattered the American ambassador at a dinner by announcing that he regretted not being " born a free , independent American , so much did he respect that nation , which had given birth to George Washington , the greatest man that ever lived " . By exercising his personal charm , William assisted in the repair of Anglo @-@ American relations , which had been so deeply damaged during the reign of his father . 
 = = = King of Hanover = = = 
 William never visited Hanover as its king . His brother , Prince Adolphus , Duke of Cambridge , acted as viceroy there throughout William 's reign as he had throughout George IV 's reign . 
 Public perception in Germany was that Britain dictated Hanoverian policy . This was not the case . In 1832 , Metternich introduced laws that curbed fledgling liberal movements in Germany . Britain 's Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston opposed this , and sought William 's influence to cause the Hanoverian government to take the same position . The Hanoverian government instead agreed with Metternich , much to Palmerston 's dismay , and William declined to intervene . The conflict between William and Palmerston over Hanover was renewed the following year when Metternich called a conference of the German states , to be held in Vienna , and Palmerston wanted Hanover to decline the invitation . Instead , the Viceroy accepted , backed fully by William . 
 In 1833 , William signed a new constitution for Hanover , which empowered the middle class , gave limited power to the lower classes , and expanded the role of the parliament of Hanover . The constitution was revoked after William 's death by the new king , William 's brother , Ernest Augustus .

 For the remainder of his reign , William interfered actively in politics only once , in 1834 , when he became the last British sovereign to choose a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament . In 1834 , the ministry was facing increasing unpopularity and Lord Grey retired ; the Home Secretary , William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne , replaced him . Lord Melbourne retained most Cabinet members , and his ministry retained an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons . Some members of the Government , however , were anathema to the King , and increasingly left @-@ wing policies concerned him . The previous year Grey had already pushed through a bill reforming the Protestant Church of Ireland . The Church collected tithes throughout Ireland , supported multiple bishoprics and was wealthy . However , barely an eighth of the Irish population belonged to the Church of Ireland . In some parishes , there were no Church of Ireland members at all , but there was still a priest paid for by tithes collected from the local Catholics and Presbyterians , leading to charges that idle priests were living in luxury at the expense of the Irish living at the level of subsistence . Grey 's bill had reduced the number of bishoprics by half , abolished some of the sinecures and overhauled the tithe system . Further measures to appropriate the surplus revenues of the Church of Ireland were mooted by the more radical members of the Government , including Lord John Russell . The King had an especial dislike for Russell , calling him " a dangerous little Radical . " 
 In November 1834 , the Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer , John Charles Spencer , Viscount Althorp , inherited a peerage , thus removing him from the House of Commons to the Lords . Melbourne had to appoint a new Commons leader and a new Chancellor ( who by long custom , must be drawn from the Commons ) , but the only candidate whom Melbourne felt suitable to replace Althorp as Commons leader was Lord John Russell , whom William ( and many others ) found unacceptable due to his radical politics . William claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair and used the removal of Lord Althorp — who had previously indicated that he would retire from politics upon becoming a peer — as the pretext for the dismissal of the entire ministry . With Lord Melbourne gone , William chose to entrust power to a Tory , Sir Robert Peel . Since Peel was then in Italy , the Duke of Wellington was provisionally appointed Prime Minister . When Peel returned and assumed leadership of the ministry for himself , he saw the impossibility of governing because of the Whig majority in the House of Commons . Consequently , Parliament was dissolved to force fresh elections . Although the Tories won more seats than in the previous election , they were still in the minority . Peel remained in office for a few months , but resigned after a series of parliamentary defeats . Lord Melbourne was restored to the Prime Minister 's office , remaining there for the rest of William 's reign , and the King was forced to accept Russell as Commons leader . 
 The King had a mixed relationship with Lord Melbourne . Melbourne 's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy , such as the devolution of powers to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada , which greatly alarmed the King , who feared it would eventually lead to the loss of the colony . At first , the King bitterly opposed these proposals . William exclaimed to Lord Gosford , Governor General @-@ designate of Canada : " Mind what you are about in Canada ... mind me , my Lord , the Cabinet is not my Cabinet ; they had better take care or by God , I will have them impeached . " When William 's son Augustus FitzClarence enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during Ascot week , William gloomily replied , " I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers , and I would rather see the devil than any one of them in my house . " Nevertheless , William approved the Cabinet 's recommendations for reform . Despite his disagreements with Lord Melbourne , the King wrote warmly to congratulate the Prime Minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Lady Caroline Norton — he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought . The King and Prime Minister eventually found a modus vivendi ; Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for ; while William realised that his First Minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared . 
 Both the King and Queen were fond of their niece , Princess Victoria of Kent . Their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent , the young princess 's widowed mother . The King , angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife , took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score . Speaking to those assembled at the banquet , who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria , William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent . He said , " I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer ... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady , heiress presumptive to the Crown , and not in the hands of a person now near me , who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed . " The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears , while her mother sat in silence and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner ( the two left the next day ) . William 's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria 's tempered view of him as " a good old man , though eccentric and singular " . William survived , though mortally ill , to the month after Victoria 's coming of age . " Poor old man ! " , Victoria wrote as he was dying , " I feel sorry for him ; he was always personally kind to me . " 
 William was " very much shaken and affected " by the death of his eldest daughter , Sophia , Lady de L 'Isle and Dudley , in childbirth in April 1837 . A watercolour sketch made by her during her pregnancy in early 1837 shows how frail he had become . 
 William and his eldest son , George , Earl of Munster , were estranged at the time , but William hoped that a letter of condolence from Munster signalled a reconciliation . His hopes were not fulfilled and Munster , still thinking he had not been given sufficient money or patronage , remained bitter to the end . 
 Queen Adelaide attended the dying William devotedly , not going to bed herself for more than ten days . William IV died in the early hours of the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle , where he was buried . As he had no living legitimate issue , the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria of Kent , the only child of Edward Augustus , Duke of Kent , George III 's fourth son . Under Salic Law , a woman could not rule Hanover , and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III 's fifth son , Ernest Augustus , Duke of Cumberland . William 's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover , which had persisted since 1714 . The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan . Although William IV is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom , he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan , including Prime Minister David Cameron , TV presenter Adam Hart @-@ Davis , author and statesman Duff Cooper , and the first Duke of Fife , who married Queen Victoria 's granddaughter Louise . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 William 's reign was short , but eventful . The ascendancy of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords were marked by the Reform Crisis , and the King 's unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated a reduction in the political influence of the Crown and the King 's influence with the people . During the reign of George III , the King could have dismissed one ministry , appointed another , dissolved Parliament , and expected the people to vote in favour of the new administration . Such was the result of a dissolution in 1784 , after the dismissal of the Fox @-@ North Coalition , and 1807 , after the dismissal of Lord Grenville . But when William IV dismissed the Melbourne ministry , the Tories under Sir Robert Peel were not able to win the ensuing elections . The King 's ability to influence the opinion of the people , and therefore national policy , had been reduced . None of William 's successors has attempted to remove a government or appoint another against the wishes of Parliament . William understood that as a constitutional monarch he was powerless to act against the opinion of Parliament . He said , " I have my view of things , and I tell them to my ministers . If they do not adopt them , I cannot help it . I have done my duty . " 
 During his reign great reforms were enacted by Parliament including the Factory Act , preventing child labour , the Abolition Act , emancipating slaves in the colonies , and the Poor Law , standardising provision for the destitute . He attracted criticism from reformers , who felt that reform did not go far enough , and from reactionaries , who felt that reform went too far . The modern interpretation is that he failed to satisfy either political extreme by trying to find compromise between two bitterly opposed factions , but in the process proved himself more capable as a constitutional monarch than many had supposed .
