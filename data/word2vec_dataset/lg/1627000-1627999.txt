 Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating in the 0 – 100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics , calculated an average score of 74 based on 6 reviews , indicating " generally favorable " reaction . Based on 7 reviews collected by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film received an 86 % approval rating , with an average score of 7 @.@ 2 / 10 . Deborah Young of Variety commented that " The attention given to constructing each shot makes for a hypnotic visual experience , while lack of a progressive narrative telescopes film 's running time into infinity . " Brian McKay of <unk> gave the film 3 stars and summed up his review saying of the film " [ While it ] is a visually intriguing piece , it also ends up being highly repetitious and overlong . " The Village Voice praised the filmmaker for allowing the Ambassador Hotel , used many times previously as a film set , to represent itself and its own history . In their review wrote " In its abstract movie @-@ ness , O 'Neill 's 73 @-@ minute fantasia exudes a wistful longing to connect , not so much with Hollywood history as with the history of that history " . 
 Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine felt that " [ t ] he film 's superimpositions , movie @-@ dialogue samples , and audio @-@ visual burps collectively suggest an acid trip , and as such will have a different disorienting effect on everyone who picks up its frequency " . Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader called the film a " treasure chest of narrative fragments " which " lacks the itinerary and ' instructions for use ' that automatically comes with a linear story . " He offered that the threads of the various " implied " plot lines are a result " of O 'Neill 's all @-@ encompassing sense of form , which for better or worse is conceptual rather than technical or material " and wrote that the film evoked both Last Year at Marienbad ( 1961 ) and The Shining ( 1980 ) , but that " it doesn 't quite live up to the high standards " set by those earlier films . He concluded that while the film " seeps into one 's bones with a chilling conviction and leaves behind a poignant aftertaste " , the film 's lack of linear narrative makes its totality " less brilliant than its parts — despite the meditative possibilities that its nonlinearity offers . " 
 TV Guide reviewer Maitland McDonagh gave The Decay of Fiction nearly full marks ( 3 @.@ 5 stars out of 4 ) , saying that the result of the film was " hypnotic " . Time Out London 's film reviewer considered the film to be " all very elegant , teasing and occasionally haunting , but it does wear a little thin at times . " J. Hoberman wrote in his 2012 book Film After Film : ( Or , What Became of 21st Century Cinema ? ) that O 'Neill " spectrally populated the abandoned Ambassador Hotel " with his film . Doug Harvey of LA Weekly called the film " his most accomplished hybrid to date , superimposing intricately choreographed actors going through vague but archetypal film noir routines on top of gorgeous full @-@ color time @-@ lapse footage of the entropy @-@ shredded Ambassador Hotel " . Stephen Holden of The New York Times found the film to be an entertaining " luminous Hollywood ghost story " , and offered that if more experimental films were as entertaining , " the notion of a thriving avant @-@ garde cinema might not be so intimidating to the moviegoing public .

 = Hymns for the Amusement of Children = 
 Hymns for the Amusement of Children ( 1771 ) was the final work completed by English poet Christopher Smart . It was completed while Smart was imprisoned for outstanding debt at the King 's Bench Prison , and the work is his final exploration of religion . Although Smart spent a large portion of his life in and out of debt , he was unable to survive his time in the prison and died soon after completing the Hymns . 
 Smart 's Hymns are one of the first works of hymns dedicated to children , and they are intended to teach Christian virtues . Unlike some of the other works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum , such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs , this work was a success and went into many immediate editions . Part of the success of this work lies in the simplicity and accessibility of the text . However , Smart died before he ever saw the proceeds of the work and never learned of the book 's success . 
 = = Background = = 
 Smart was released from asylum in 1763 and published two religious works , A Song to David and Hymn and Spiritual Songs , soon after . These were quickly attacked by critics that declared Smart was still " mad " and subsequently failed to become popular . Smart continued to work on religious works as he struggled to publish and support himself . However , he quickly fell into debt and , on 20 April 1770 , he was arrested and sent to Debtors ' prison . 
 On January 11 , 1771 , he was recommended to the King 's Bench Prison . Although he was in prison , Charles Burney purchased the " Rules " ( allowing him some freedom ) in order to help make Smart 's final weeks peaceful although pathetic . In his final letter , written to Rev. Mr. Jackson , Smart begged for three shillings in order to purchase food . Soon after , Smart died , May 20 , 1771 , from either liver failure or pneumonia , after completing his final work , Hymns , for the Amusement of Children . 
 It is unknown how many poems published in the Hymns were written before Smart was imprisoned or during his final days , but at least one , titled " Against Despair " was produced during this time . A different version of the poem was published after his death in the Gentleman 's Magazine . This version included a note claiming , " <unk> by the late C. Smart , in the King 's @-@ Bench , " which verifies that he was writing hymns throughout this time , or , at least , editing them to create a better version . 
 Although five editions of the Hymns were published in the 18th century , only one edition was published before Smart died . This edition was published by his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Thomas Carnan , and was announced in the Public Advertiser 27 December 1770 . However , this edition did not list Smart as the author . It is possible that there was a sixth edition of the Hymns , but that has since " disappeared " ; there is also a possible pirated edition produced by Thomas Walker . Although the work made it as far as Boston , Massachusetts , as shown by an advertisement for selling the work in 1795 , no Boston editions have been found , but such editions could exist in addition to the Philadelphia , Pennsylvania edition . 
 Smart 's first children 's hymn was " A Morning Hymn , for all the little good boys and girls " in the Lilliputian Magazine in 1751 . During this time , there were only two models for him to base his children 's hymns on : the works of Isaac Watts and of Charles Wesley . Watts 's work attempted to amuse children while Wesley 's attempted to simplify morality for them . It is possible that Smart 's Hymns were not modelled on Watts 's or Wesley 's actual hymns or songs , but instead after a note in Watts 's work the Divine Songs which says : 
 A Slight Specimen of Moral Songs , such as I wish some happy and condescending genius would undertake for the use of children , and perform much better ... The sense and subjects might be borrow 'd plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon , from all the common appearances of nature , from all the occurrences in the civil life , both in city and country : ( which would also afford matter for other Divine Songs . ) Here the language and measures should be easy and flowing with <unk> , and without the solemnities of religion , or the sacred names of God and holy things ; that children might find delight and profit together . 
 The work was dedicated " to his Royal Highness Prince Frederick , Bishop of <unk> , these hymns , composed for his amusement , are , with all due Submission and Respect , humbly inscribed to him , as the best of Bishops , by his Royal Highness 's Most Obedient and Devoted Servant , Christopher Smart . " Although the prince , the second son of King George III , was only seven at the time , Smart was given special permission to dedicate the work to the boy through the intervention with the royal family by either Richard Dalton or the King 's Chaplain , William Mason . 
 = = Hymns for the Amusement of Children = = 
 In essence , the Hymns for the Amusement of Children is intended to teach children the specific virtues that make up the subject matter of the work . While trying to accomplish this goal , Smart emphasizes the joy of creation and Christ 's sacrifice that allowed for future salvation . However , he didn 't just try to spread joy , but structured his poems to treat valuable lessons about morality ; his subjects begin with the three Theological Virtues ( Faith , Hope , and Charity ) , then the four Cardinal Virtues ( Prudence , Justice , Temperance , and Fortitude ) and adds Mercy . The next six hymns deal with Christian duties and are followed by ten hymns on the Gospels . The final works introduce the miscellaneous Christian virtues that were necessary to complete Christopher 's original self @-@ proclaimed " plan to make good girls and boys . " 
 All but three of the hymns were provided with a corresponding woodblock illustration . The original illustrations either represented the scene of the hymn or a symbolic representation of the hymn . However , later editions of the work sometimes included illustrations that did not match the corresponding hymn , which was the fault of " a general deterioration of standards in book production " . With such possibilities , it is hard to justify an exact relationship between any particular hymn and illustration . 
 There are thirty @-@ nine hymns included in Hymns for the Amusement of Children : 
 = = = Mirth = = = 
 Besides the hymns that are " expected " in a book of hymns , Arthur Sherbo points out that the collection contains hymns " on learning and on ' good @-@ nature to animals ' . " In particular , he emphasizes Hymn XXV " Mirth " as " showing anew the love for flowers that is a recurring characteristic of his poetry " as it reads : 
 If you are merry sing away , 
 And touch the organs sweet ; 
 This is the Lord 's triumphant day , 
 Ye children in the gall <unk> gay , 
 Shout from each goodly seat . 
 It shall be May to @-@ morrow 's morn , 
 A field then let us run , 
 And deck us in the blooming thorn , 
 Soon as the cock begins to warn , 
 And long before the sun . 
 I give the praise to Christ alone , 
 My pinks already shew ; 
 And my streak 'd roses fully blown , 
 The sweetness of the Lord make known , 
 And to his glory grow . 
 To Sherbo , this poem is " a good example of the artless quality " of the whole collection of Hymns . 
 = = = Long @-@ Suffering of God = = = 
 According to Moira Dearnley , Hymn XXIX " Long @-@ Suffering of God " is " one of the more pathetic poems in Hymns for the Amusement of Children . " As a poem , it " restates Smart 's certainty that the long @-@ suffering God will eventually bestow his grace upon the barren human soul " as it reads : 
 Thus man goes on from year to year , 
 And bears no fruit at all ; 
 But gracious God , still <unk> , 
 Bids show 'rs of blessing fall . 
 The beams of mercy , dews of grace , 
 Our Saviour still <unk> 
 Ha ! ha ! the soul regains her place , 
 And sweetens all the skies . 
 This final poem fittingly ends in " manic exultation " and shows " that for Smart , <unk> of the grace and mercy of God were inseparable from madness . " 
 = = = The Conclusion of the Matter = = = 
 Smart 's final poem of the work , XXXIX " The Conclusion of the Matter " , demonstrates to Neil Curry that the " joy and optimism of [ Smart ] are unwavering . " Smart " does not look back , he looks forward and the sequence ends on a note of triumph " as it reads : 
 Fear God - obey his just decrees , 
 And do it hand , and heart , and knees ; 
 For after all our utmost care 
 There 's nought like penitence and prayer . 
 Then weigh the balance in your mind , 
 Look forward , not one glance behind ; 
 Let no foul fiend retard your pace , 
 Hosanna ! Thou hast won the race . 
 However , as Curry claims , " in this world Smart himself had won nothing . " Instead , Curry believes what Christopher Hunter stated about his uncle : " I trust he is now at peace ; it was not his portion here . " 
 = = Critical response = = 
 Although he wrote his second set of hymns , Hymns for the Amusement of Children , for a younger audience , Smart cares more about emphasizing the need for children to be moral instead of " innocent " . These works have been seen as possibly too complicated for " amusement " because they employ ambiguities and complicated theological concepts . In particular , Mark Booth questions " why , in this carefully polished writing .... are the lines sometimes relatively hard to read for their <unk> sense ? " Arthur Sherbo disagreed with this sentiment strongly and claims the Hymns " are more than mere hack work , tossed off with speed and indifference . They were written when Smart was in prison and despairing of rescue . Into these poems , some of them of a bare simplicity and naiveté that have few equals in literature of merit anywhere ... " However , he does admit some of the argument when he claims that " Generosity " , along with a handful other hymns , was " not so simple and surely proved too much for the children for whom they were bought . " 
 Not all critics agree that the work is too complex for children , and some , like Marcus Walsh and Karina Williamson , view that the works would have fit the appropriate level for children in the 18th century , especially with the short length of each hymn and a small illustration of the scene proceeding each one . This is not to say that the works are " simple " , because many words are complex , but , as Donald Davie explains , there is a " naiveté " in the work that allow them to be understood . In particular , Moira Dearnley claims that the hymns contain a " high @-@ spirited delight in the day @-@ to @-@ day life of children , the joy that characterizes the best the Hymns for the Amusement of Children .

 = Naraka ( Hinduism ) = 
 Naraka ( Sanskrit : <unk> ) is the Hindu equivalent of Hell , where sinners are tormented after death . It is also the abode of Yama , the god of Death . It is described as located in the south of the universe and beneath the earth . 
 The number and names of hells , as well as the type of sinners sent to a particular hell , varies from text to text ; however , many scriptures describe 28 hells . After death , messengers of Yama called Yamadutas bring all beings to the court of Yama , where he weighs the virtues and the vices of the being and passes a judgement , sending the virtuous to Svarga ( heaven ) and the sinners to one of the hells . The stay in Svarga or Naraka is generally described as temporary . After the quantum of punishment is over , the souls are reborn as lower or higher beings as per their merits . In a few texts , a hell is described as a bottomless pit of darkness where souls are trapped for eternity and deprived of rebirth . 
 = = Location = = 
 The Bhagavata Purana describes Naraka as beneath the earth : between the seven realms of the underworld ( Patala ) and the <unk> Ocean , which is the bottom of the universe . It is located in the South of the universe . <unk> , where the dead ancestors ( Pitrs ) headed by <unk> reside , is also located in this region . Yama , the Lord of Naraka , resides in this realm with his assistants . The Devi Bhagavata Purana mentions that Naraka is the southern part of universe , below the earth but above Patala . The Vishnu Purana mentions that it is located below the cosmic waters at the bottom of the universe . The Hindu epics too agree that Naraka is located in the South , the direction which is governed by Yama and is often associated with Death . <unk> is considered as the capital of Yama , from where Yama delivers his justice . 
 = = Administration = = 
 The god of Death , Yama , employs Yama @-@ <unk> ( messengers of Yama ) or Yama @-@ <unk> , who bring souls of all beings to Yama for judgement . Generally , all living beings , including humans and animals , go to Yama 's abode upon death where they are judged . However , very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga ( heaven ) . People devoted to charity , especially donors of food , and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama 's court . War @-@ heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama . Those who get moksha ( salvation ) also escape from the clutches of <unk> . Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement . The way is lighted for those who donated lamps , while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese . 
 Yama , as Lord of Justice , is called Dharma @-@ raja . Yama sends the virtuous to Svarga to enjoy the luxuries of paradise . He also assesses the vices of the dead and accords judgement , assigning them to appropriate hells as punishment commensurate with the severity and nature of their sins . A person is not freed of samsara ( the cycle of birth @-@ death @-@ rebirth ) and must take birth again after his prescribed pleasure in Svarga or punishment in Naraka is over . 
 Yama is aided by his minister <unk> , who maintains a record of all good and evil actions of every living being . Yama @-@ <unk> are also assigned the job of executing the punishments on sinners in the various hells . 
 = = Number and names = = 
 Naraka , as a whole , is known by many names conveying that it is the realm of Yama . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> mean the abode of Yama . <unk> ( the <unk> of Yama ) and its equivalents like <unk> use pun for the word <unk> , which can be mean abode or destruction . It is also called <unk> , " where only truth is spoken , and the weak torment the strong " , <unk> – the world of Death or of the dead and the " city of the king of ghosts " , <unk> . 
 The Agni Purana mentions only 4 hells . Some texts mention 7 hells : Put ( " childless " , for the childless ) , Avichi ( " <unk> " , for those waiting for reincarnation ) , <unk> ( " abandoned " , for evil beings ) , Tamisra ( " darkness " , where darkness of hells begin ) , <unk> ( " expelled " , where torments of hell begin ) , Kudmala ( " leprous " , the worst hell for those who are going to be reincarnated ) and <unk> ( " black poison " , the bottomless pit , for those who are eternally condemned to hell and have no chance of reincarnation ) . 
 The Manu Smriti mentions 21 hells : Tamisra , Andhatamisra , Maharaurava , Raurava , Kalasutra , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Kudmala , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Asipatravana and <unk> . The Yajnavalkya Smriti also lists twenty @-@ one : Tamisra , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Raurava , Kudmala , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Avichi , Andhatamisra , Kumbhipaka , Asipatravana and <unk> . 
 The Bhagavata Purana , the Vishnu Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana enlist and describe 28 hells ; however , they end the description by stating that there are hundreds and thousands of hells . The Bhagavata Purana enumerates the following 28 : Tamisra , Andhatamisra , Raurava , Maharaurava , Kumbhipaka , Kalasutra , Asipatravana , <unk> , <unk> , Krimibhojana , <unk> , Taptasurmi , Vajrakantaka @-@ salmali , <unk> , Puyoda , <unk> , <unk> , Lalabhaksa , <unk> , Avichi , Ayahpana , <unk> , Raksogana @-@ bhojana , <unk> , <unk> , Avata @-@ nirodhana , Paryavartana and <unk> . The Devi Bhagavata Purana agrees with the Bhagavata Purana in most of names ; however , a few names are slightly different . Taptasurmi , Ayahpana , Raksogana @-@ bhojana , Avata @-@ nirodhana , Paryavartana are replaced by <unk> , <unk> , Raksogana @-@ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> respectively . The Vishnu Purana mentions the 28 in the following order : Raurava , <unk> , <unk> , Tala , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Krimibhojana , Asipatravana , Krishna , Lalabhaksa , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Kalasutra , Tamas , Avichi , <unk> , <unk> ́ ha , and another Avichi . 
 = = Description of hells = = 
 Early texts like the Rigveda do not have a detailed description of Naraka . It is simply a place of evil and a dark bottomless pit . The Atharvaveda describes a realm of darkness , where murderers are confined after death . The Shatapatha Brahmana is the first text to mention the pain and suffering of Naraka in detail , while the Manu Smriti begins naming the multiple hells . The epics also describe Hell in general terms as a dense jungle without shade , where there is no water and no rest . The Yamadutas torment souls on the orders of their master . 
 The names of many of hells is common in Hindu texts ; however , the nature of sinners tormented in particular hells varies from text to text . 
 The summary of twenty @-@ eight hells described in the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana are as follows : 
 Tamisra ( darkness ) : It is intended for a person who grabs another 's wealth , wife or children . In this dark realm , he is bound with ropes and starved without food or water . He is beaten and reproached by Yamadutas till he faints . 
 Andhatamisra ( blind @-@ darkness ) : Here , a man – who deceives another man and enjoys his wife or children – is tormented to the extent he loses his consciousness and sight . The torture is described as cutting the tree at its roots . 
 Raurava ( fearful or hell of rurus ) : As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana , it is assigned for a person who cares about his own and his family 's good , but harms other living beings and is always envious of others . The living beings hurt by such a man take the form of savage serpent @-@ like beasts called rurus and torture this person . The Vishnu Purana deems this hell fit for a false witness or one who lies . 
 Maharaurava ( great @-@ fearful ) : A person who indulges at the expense of other beings is afflicted with pain by fierce rurus called <unk> , who eat his flesh . 
 Kumbhipaka ( cooked in a pot ) : A person who cooks animals and birds is cooked alive in boiling oil by Yamadutas here , for as many years as there were hairs on the bodies of their animal victims . 
 Kalasutra ( thread of Time / Death ) : The Bhagavata Purana assigns this hell to a murderer of a brahmin ( the Hindu priestly caste ) , while the Devi Bhagavata Purana allocates it for a person who disrespects his parents , elders , ancestors or brahmins . This realm is made entirely of copper and extremely hot , heated by fire from below and the red hot sun from above . Here , the sinner burns from within by hunger and thirst and the smouldering heat outside , whether he sleeps , sits , stands or runs . 
 Asipatravana / <unk> ( forest of sword leaves ) : The Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana reserve this hell for a person who digresses from the religious teachings of the Vedas and indulges in heresy . The Vishnu Purana states that wanton tree @-@ felling leads to this hell . Yamadutas beat them with whips as they try to run away in the forest where palm trees have swords as leaves . Afflicted with injury of whips and swords , they faint and cry out for help in vain . 
 <unk> ( hog 's mouth ) : It houses kings or government officials who punish the innocent or grant corporal punishment to a Brahmin . Yamadutas crush him as sugar cane is crushed to extract juice . He will yell and scream in agony , just as the guiltless suffered . 
 <unk> ( well with its mouth hidden ) : It is the hell where a person who harms others with the intention of malice and harms insects is confined . He is attacked by birds , animals , reptiles , mosquitoes , lice , worms , flies and others , who deprive him of rest and compel him to run hither and thither . 
 Krimibhojana / <unk> ( worm @-@ food ) : As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana , it is where a person who does not share his food with guests , elders , children or the gods , and selfishly eats it alone , and he who eats without performing the five yajnas ( <unk> ) is chastised . The Vishnu Purana states that one who loathes his father , Brahmins or the gods and who destroys jewels is punished here . This hell is a 100 @,@ 000 yojana lake filled with worms . The sinful person is reduced to a worm , who feeds on other worms , who in turn devour his body for 100 @,@ 000 years . 
 <unk> / <unk> ( hell of pincers ) : The Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana state that a person who robs a Brahmin or steals jewels or gold from someone , when not in dire need , is confined to this hell . However , the Vishnu Purana tells the violators of vows or rules endure pain here . His body is torn by red @-@ hot iron balls and tongs . 
 Taptasurmi / <unk> ( red @-@ hot iron statue ) : A man or woman who indulges in illicit sexual relations with a woman or man is beaten by whips and forced to embrace red @-@ hot iron figurines of the opposite sex . 
 Vajrakantaka @-@ salmali ( the silk @-@ cotton tree with thorns like thunderbolts / <unk> ) : A person who has sexual intercourse with animals or who has excessive coitus is tied to the Vajrakantaka @-@ salmali tree and pulled by Yamadutas so that the thorns tear his body . 
 <unk> / Vaitarna ( to be crossed ) : It is a river that is believed to lie between Naraka and the earth . This river , which forms the boundary of Naraka , is filled with excreta , urine , pus , blood , hair , nails , bones , marrow , flesh and fat , where fierce aquatic beings eat the person 's flesh . As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana , a person born in a respectable family – kshatriya ( warrior @-@ caste ) , royal family or government official – who neglects his duty is thrown into this river of hell . The Vishnu Purana assigns it to the destroyer of a bee @-@ hive or a town . 
 Puyoda ( water of pus ) : Shudras ( workmen @-@ caste ) and husbands or sexual partners of lowly women and prostitutes – who live like animals devoid of cleanliness and good behaviour – fall in Puyoda , the ocean of pus , excreta , urine , mucus , saliva and other repugnant things . Here , they are forced to eat these disgusting things . 
 <unk> ( obstruction to life ) : Some Brahmins , Kshatriyas and Vaishyas ( merchant caste ) indulge in the sport of hunting with their dogs and donkeys in the forest , resulting in wanton killing of animals . Yamadutas play archery sport with them as the targets in this hell . 
 <unk> ( murderous ) : The Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana mention that Yamadutas whip a person , who has pride of his rank and wealth and sacrifices animals as a status symbol , and finally kill him . The Vishnu Purana associates it with the maker of spears , swords , and other weapons . 
 Lalabhaksa ( saliva as food ) : As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana , a Brahmin , a <unk> or a Vaishya husband , who forces his wife to drink his semen out of lust and to enforce his control , is thrown in a river of semen , which he is forced to drink . The Vishnu Purana disagrees stating that one who eats before offering food to the gods , the ancestors or guests is brought to this hell . 
 <unk> ( hell of the sons of Sarama ) : <unk> who burn houses and poison people for wealth , and kings and other government officials who grab money of merchants , mass murder or ruin the nation , are cast into this hell . Seven hundred and twenty ferocious dogs , the sons of Sarama , with razor @-@ sharp teeth , prey on them at the behest of Yamadutas . 
 <unk> / <unk> ( waterless / <unk> ) : A person , who lies on oath or in business , is repeatedly thrown head @-@ first from a 100 yojana high mountain whose sides are stone waves , but without water . His body is continuously broken , but it is made sure that he does not die . 
 Ayahpana ( iron @-@ drink ) : Anybody else under oath or a Brahmin who drinks alcohol is punished here . Yamadutas stand on their chests and force them to drink molten @-@ iron . 
 <unk> ( acidic / saline mud / filth ) : One who in false pride , does not honour a person higher than him by birth , austerity , knowledge , behaviour , caste or spiritual order , is tortured in this hell . Yamadutas throw him head @-@ first and torment him . 
 Raksogana @-@ bhojana ( food of Rakshasas ) : Those who practise human @-@ sacrifice and cannibalism are condemned to this hell . Their victims , in the form of Rakshasas , cut them with sharp knives and swords . The Rakshasas feast on their blood and sing and dance in joy , just as the sinners slaughtered their victims . 
 <unk> ( pierced by sharp pointed spear / dart ) : Some people give shelter to birds or animals pretending to be their saviours , but then harass them poking with threads , needles or using them like lifeless toys . Also , some people behave the same way to humans , winning their confidence and then killing them with sharp tridents or lances . The bodies of such sinners , fatigued with hunger and thirst , are pierced with sharp , needle @-@ like spears . Ferocious carnivorous birds like vultures and herons tear and gorge their flesh . 
 <unk> ( snakes ) : Filled with envy and fury , some people harm others like snakes . These are destined to be devoured by five or seven hooded serpents in this hell . 
 Avata @-@ nirodhana ( confined in a hole ) : People who imprison others in dark wells , crannies or mountain caves are pushed into this hell , a dark well engulfed with poisonous fumes and smoke that suffocates them . 
 Paryavartana ( returning ) : A householder who welcomes guests with cruel glances and abuses them is restrained in this hell . Hard @-@ eyed vultures , herons , crows and similar birds gaze on them and suddenly fly and pluck his eyes . 
 <unk> ( needle @-@ face ) : An ever @-@ suspicious man is always wary of people trying to grab his wealth . Proud of his money , he sins to gain and to retain it . Yamadutas stitch thread through his whole body in this hell . 
 Though the Vishnu Purana mentions 28 hells , it gives information only about sinners condemned in 21 hells and does not give details about the punishments . The hells described in the Vishnu Purana , but not in the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana are as follows : 
 <unk> ( obstruction ) : A <unk> of abortion , a murderer of a cow , a plunderer or one who strangles a man is cast here .

 <unk> ( great @-@ fire ) : Incest with daughter or daughter @-@ in @-@ law brings one here . 
 <unk> ( salt ) : One who vilifies his guru , people superior to them or the Vedas go to this hell . 
 <unk> ( the place of bewildering ) : A thief or those who despise prescribed observances are tormented here . 
 <unk> ( hell of insects ) : One who uses magic to harm others is condemned here .

 <unk> ( food of dogs ) : A religious student who sleeps in the day and one who does not have spiritual knowledge and learns it from children are damned here .

 The Hindu religion regards Hell not as a place of lasting permanence , but as an alternate domain from which an individual can return to the present world after crimes in the previous life have been compensated for . These crimes are eventually nullified through an equal punishment in the next life . The concept of Hell has provided many different opportunities for the Hindu religion including narrative , social and economic functions . 
 = = = Narrative = = = 
 A narrative rational for the concept of Hell can be found in the Hindu epic , Mahabharata . This narrative ends with Yudhishthira 's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven . This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme . This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma , a primary theme within the Mahabharata . Dharma is not a black and white concept , and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil . As such , tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “ right way of living ” .

 A social rational for the Hindu concept of rebirth in Hell is evident in the metric work of the Manusmrti : a written discourse focused on the “ law of the social classes ” . A large portion of it is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds ( <unk> ) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths . The Manusmrti , however , does not go into explicit detail of each hell . For this we turn to the Bhagavata Purana . The Manusmrti lists multiple levels of hell in which a person can be reborn into . The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related the crimes ( <unk> ) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences . An opposite social facet to these hellish rebirths is the precise way in which a person can redeem oneself from a particular crime through a series of vows ( such as fasting , water purification rituals , chanting , and even sacrifices ) . These vows must take place during the same life cycle that the crimes were committed in . These religious lessons assist the societal structure by defining approved and unapproved social behavior .

 The last Hindu function for Hell @-@ based reincarnations is the text Preta <unk> in the Garuda Purana used by Hindu priests during Śrāddha rituals . During these rituals , the soul of a dying or deceased individual is given safe passage into the next life . This ritual is directly related to the economic prosperity of Hindu priests and their ability to “ save ” the dying soul from a hellish reincarnation through gifts given on behalf of the deceased to the priest performing the ritual . With each gift given , crimes committed during the deceased 's life are forgiven and the next life is progressively improved . 
 = Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II = 
 During the last weeks of World War II , warships of the United States Navy , the British Royal Navy , and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded industrial and military facilities in Japan . Most of these bombardments involved battleships and caused heavy damage to several of the factories targeted , as well as nearby civilian areas . A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle . However , the Japanese did not attempt to attack the Allied bombardment forces , and none of the involved warships suffered any damage . 
 The major bombardments began on 14 and 15 July 1945 , when US Navy warships attacked the cities of Kamaishi and Muroran . The next attack was made by a joint American and British force against the city of Hitachi during the night of 17 / 18 July . Groups of cruisers and destroyers subsequently shelled the Nojima Saki and Shionomisaki areas on 18 July and the night of 24 / 25 July , respectively . On 29 July , American and British warships attacked Hamamatsu , and on the night of 30 / 31 several American destroyers shelled Shimizu . The final bombardment took place on 9 August , when Kamaishi was attacked again by American , British and New Zealand warships . Two US Navy submarines conducted small @-@ scale attacks during June and July 1945 ; one of the submarines also landed a small raiding party . 
 The Allied naval bombardments disrupted industrial production in the cities targeted , and convinced many Japanese civilians that the war was lost . As many as 1 @,@ 739 Japanese were killed in the attacks , and up to 1 @,@ 497 were wounded . The only Allied casualties were 32 prisoners of war , who were killed in the bombardments of Kamaishi . 
 = = Background = = 
 By mid @-@ 1945 , cities and industrial facilities in the Japanese home islands were under sustained attack from United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) B @-@ 29 Superfortress heavy bombers based in the Mariana Islands . Attacks by Allied submarines and surface ships had also cut most of the country 's trade routes , and US Navy aircraft carrier task groups had raided locations in the home islands on several occasions . Shortages of fuel had confined most of the Imperial Japanese Navy 's surviving ships to port and forced them and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service to hold its air units in reserve against the Allied invasion that was expected to be launched late in the year . Prior to the war , the Japanese military had assessed that coastal artillery was no longer suited to the country 's circumstances . As a result , only a few strategic ports were protected by artillery capable of engaging enemy warships , and most of these guns were of relatively small calibers . 
 During the Pacific War , the US Navy 's fast battleships had mainly been used to escort the groups of aircraft carriers that formed the United States Pacific Fleet 's main striking force . They had also occasionally bombarded Japanese positions near the shore , and had fought some actions with Japanese warships . 
 Allied naval commanders decided to use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid @-@ 1945 . It was hoped that the Japanese military would respond to these bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve to respond to the planned invasion of Japan , thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft . However , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal , and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan . Instead , the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began .

 On 1 July 1945 , the United States Third Fleet sortied from Leyte Gulf in the Philippines under the command of Admiral William Halsey to attack the Japanese home islands . Halsey 's plans included the use of battleships and cruisers to bombard military facilities and factories . To prepare for these attacks , US Navy submarines sailed into Japan 's inshore waters to search for naval mines . USAAF B @-@ 29 Superfortress and B @-@ 24 Liberator aircraft also conducted photo reconnaissance flights over much of Japan in search of airfields and facilities which could be attacked by the Third Fleet . 
 The Third Fleet 's main component , Task Force 38 ( TF 38 ) , began striking targets in Japan on 10 July under the command of Vice Admiral John S. McCain . On this day , aircraft flying from the Task Force 's aircraft carriers attacked facilities around Tokyo . Task Force 38 sailed north , and on 14 July began raids on Hokkaido and northern Honshu . These areas were outside the range of the B @-@ 29 Superfortress bombers , and had at that point not been attacked in the war . The American aircraft met little opposition , and sank 11 warships and 20 merchant ships . A further eight warships and 21 merchant ships were damaged , and the carrier aviators claimed to have destroyed 25 Japanese aircraft . 
 The first Allied bombardment of a Japanese coastal town was conducted on 14 July in conjunction with the air attacks on Hokkaido and northern Honshu . A bombardment group commanded by Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth designated Task Unit 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 1 ( TU 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 1 ) was detached from TF 38 to attack the iron works at Kamaishi in northern Honshu . At the time the city had a population of 40 @,@ 000 and the iron works was among the largest in Japan . However , due to shortages of coking coal and other raw materials , the iron works was running at less than half its capacity . TU 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 1 comprised the battleships USS South Dakota , Indiana and Massachusetts as well as the heavy cruisers USS Quincy and Chicago and nine destroyers . Allied prisoners of war had been assigned to work at the Nippon Steel Company , and were housed in two camps in Kamaishi . 
 The bombardment group opened fire on the ironworks at 12 : 10 p.m. from a range of 29 @,@ 000 yd ( 27 @,@ 000 m ) . The ships then moved closer to the city , but did not cross the 100 @-@ fathom line as no minesweepers were available to clear the area of mines . The bombardment lasted for over two hours , during which time the force made six passes across the mouth of Kamaishi 's harbor and fired 802 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) shells , 728 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) shells and 825 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) shells . While most of the shells landed within the grounds of the ironworks , the concussion from their explosions caused kitchen fires to break out across Kamaishi . The resulting smoke prevented US Navy aircraft from being able to support or spot for the warships , which continued to fire accurately on predetermined targets . No Japanese aircraft or coastal guns responded to this bombardment . Allied aircraft photographed the ironworks following the attack , but photo interpreters underestimated the extent to which they had been damaged . This was one of the first times that photographic intelligence had been used to determine the extent of damage from a naval bombardment , and the interpreters placed too much weight on the fact that none of the ironworks ' buildings had been destroyed . The Allies learned after the war that the ironworks had been extensively damaged and forced to cease production for a period . This resulted in a loss of the equivalent of four weeks of pig iron production and two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half months of coke production . Five Allied prisoners of war were killed by the bombardment . 
 = = = Muroran = = = 
 On the night of 14 / 15 July , another bombardment unit — TU 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 2 — was detached from TF 38 to attack the town of Muroran on the south @-@ east coast of Hokkaido . TU 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 2 was commanded by Rear Admiral Oscar C. Badger and comprised the battleships Iowa , Missouri and Wisconsin , the light cruisers Atlanta and Dayton , and eight destroyers . Admiral Halsey accompanied this force on board Missouri . The targets of this attack were the Japan Steel Company 's facilities and the Wanishi Iron Works . Also that night , a force of four cruisers and six destroyers cruised along the east coast of Honshu seeking to attack Japanese shipping but did not locate any targets . 
 TU 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 2 's bombardment began at dawn on 15 July . The three battleships fired 860 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) shells at the city from a range of 28 @,@ 000 – 32 @,@ 000 yd ( 26 @,@ 000 – 29 @,@ 000 m ) . Aerial observation and spotting of damage was made difficult by hazy conditions , and only 170 shells landed within the grounds of the two plants . Nevertheless , considerable damage was inflicted on the industrial facilities , resulting in the loss of two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half months of coke production and slightly less pig iron production . Damage to buildings across the city was also extensive . As with the bombardment of Kamaishi , photo interpreters underestimated the scale of the damage . TU 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 2 was highly vulnerable to air attack throughout the more @-@ than @-@ six @-@ hour period in which it was visible from the shore of Hokkaido , and Halsey later wrote that these were the longest hours of his life . The failure of the Japanese to attack his ships convinced Halsey that they were preserving aircraft for use against the Allied invasion force . On 15 July , aircraft flying from TF 38 's aircraft carriers struck again at Hokkaido and northern Honshu , devastating the fleet of ships that carried coal between the two islands . 
 = = = Hitachi = = = 
 The attacks on Hokkaido and northern Honshu ended on 15 July , and TF 38 sailed away from the Japanese coast to refuel and rendezvous with the main body of the British Pacific Fleet , which was designated Task Force 37 ( TF 37 ) . On the morning of 17 July , the British and American carriers attacked targets to the north of Tokyo . Later that day , TU 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 2 detached from the carrier force to bombard targets around the city of Hitachi , which is located about 80 mi ( 130 km ) northeast of Tokyo . This force was commanded by Rear Admiral Badger and comprised the battleships Iowa , Missouri , Wisconsin , North Carolina , Alabama , and HMS King George V , light cruisers Atlanta and Dayton , and eight American and two British destroyers . King George V and her two escorts sailed astern of the American force , and operated independently . Halsey again accompanied this force on board Missouri . 
 The bombardment of the Hitachi area took place on the night of 17 / 18 July . Rain and fog made locating the targets difficult and prevented spotting aircraft from flying , but several carrier aircraft flew protective patrols over the bombardment force . The Allied warships opened fire at 11 : 10 p.m. , and aimed at their targets using radar and LORAN . The attackers targeted nine industrial facilities , and King George V was assigned similar targets to those engaged by the American battleships . By the time the bombardment ceased at about 1 : 10 a.m. , the American battleships had fired 1 @,@ 238 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) shells , and the British battleship 267 14 @-@ inch ( 360 mm ) shells . The two light cruisers also fired 292 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) shells at radar and electronics installations south of Hitachi . All firing was conducted at a range of 23 @,@ 000 – 35 @,@ 000 yd ( 21 @,@ 000 – 32 @,@ 000 m ) from the targets . 
 The attack on Hitachi had mixed results . Only three of the bombardment 's nine targets were hit , and the overall damage to the city 's industrial area was assessed as " slight " . However , the attack inflicted considerable damage on the city 's urban area and essential services . This damage was greatly increased by a B @-@ 29 raid on Hitachi on the night of 18 / 19 July that destroyed or damaged 79 percent of the city 's urban area . The official history of the US Navy in World War II states that " individual Japanese " considered the naval bombardment to have been more terrifying than the air attack . 
 = = = Nojima Saki and Shionomisaki = = = 
 On 18 July , TFs 37 and 38 conducted further air strikes in the Tokyo area , with the American force 's main effort being an attempt to sink the Japanese battleship Nagato at Yokosuka Naval Base . That night , Cruiser Division 17 ( CruDiv 17 ) , which comprised the light cruisers USS Astoria , Pasadena , Springfield and Wilkes @-@ Barre and six destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral J. Cary Jones , fired 240 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) shells at a radar station on Cape Nojima over a five @-@ minute period but did not score any hits . 
 After completing its strikes on the Tokyo region , the Allied fleet conducted an at @-@ sea replenishment from 21 to 23 July before attacking Kure and the Inland Sea from the 24th to the 28th of the month . On the night of 24 / 25 July , CruDiv 17 patrolled the Kii Channel and bombarded the naval seaplane base at Kushimoto , a landing field near Cape Shionomisaki , and a radio station . This attack lasted for only four minutes and caused little damage . 
 = = = Hamamatsu = = = 
 On 29 July , a group of warships was detached from the main body of the Allied fleet to bombard the city of Hamamatsu , which lies on the south coast of Honshu between Nagoya and Tokyo . This force comprised the same ships which had attacked Kamaishi on 14 July with the addition of King George V and the destroyers HMS Ulysses , Undine and Urania ; the four British ships were designated Task Unit 37 @.@ 1 @.@ 2 ( TU 37 @.@ 1 @.@ 2 ) . The city had previously suffered extensive damage from air attacks . 
 The British and American ships engaged their targets independently . King George V opened fire at the Japan Musical Instrument Company 's Plant No. 2 ( which was being used to manufacture aircraft propellers ) at 11 : 19 p.m. from a range of 20 @,@ 075 yd ( 18 @,@ 357 m ) . The battleship fired 265 14 @-@ inch ( 360 mm ) rounds at the plant in 27 minutes and was able to make use of artillery spotting aircraft , with visibility being good . Even so , little damage was inflicted on the facility . Massachusetts fired at Plant No. 1 but scored only a small number of hits . Despite the limited physical damage , the shelling caused increased labor absenteeism and disruption to vital services that caused the factory to cease production . The American ships also shelled the Imperial Government Railway locomotive works and three other industrial facilities . 
 Of these targets , the locomotive works ceased operations for about three months due to damage , but two of the other facilities had almost ceased production before the attack and the third was not damaged . Two bridges on the important Tōkaidō Main Line were fired upon but not hit , though damage to rail infrastructure in Hamamatsu closed the line for 66 hours . During the bombardment Undine twice opened fire on small groups of ships that were probably fishing boats . No Japanese aircraft or shore batteries responded to the Allied attack . The bombardment of Hamamatsu was the last time a British battleship fired its guns in anger . 
 = = = Shimizu = = = 
 The next bombardment of Japan took place on the night of 30 / 31 July . On that night Destroyer Squadron 25 ( <unk> 25 ) , which was commanded by Captain J.W. <unk> aboard USS John Rodgers , searched the Suruga Gulf for Japanese shipping to attack . No ships were located , and in the early hours of 31 July the squadron sailed deep into the gulf and fired 1 @,@ 100 rounds of 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) shells during seven minutes at a railway yard and aluminum plant in the town of Shimizu . While the aluminum plant was hit , this was of little importance as it had almost ceased production due to a shortage of raw materials . No damage was caused to the rail yard . 
 = = = Second attack on Kamaishi = = = 
 During the last days of July and into early August , the Allied fleet sailed away from the Japanese coast to avoid a typhoon and allow the ships to replenish their stocks of fuel and ammunition . The fleet then sailed north and , on both 9 and 10 August , the carrier aircraft attacked a large concentration of Japanese aircraft on airfields in northern Honshu . The carrier pilots claimed the destruction of 720 Japanese aircraft in this operation . 
 As part of these operations off northern Japan , Kamaishi was bombarded again on 9 August in the mistaken belief that the iron works had not been badly damaged . TU 34 @.@ 8 @.@ 1 conducted this attack , and comprised the ships that had bombarded the city in July with the addition of the heavy cruisers USS Boston and Saint Paul , British light cruiser HMS Newfoundland , Royal New Zealand Navy light cruiser HMNZS Gambia and destroyers HMS Terpsichore , Termagant and Tenacious . King George V did not participate in this action as mechanical problems affecting two of her propeller shafts meant that she was unable to sail at the speed specified for the bombardment force . 
 The Allied ships opened fire on the iron works and docks in Kamaishi at 12 : 54 p.m. The bombardment was conducted from an average range of 14 @,@ 000 yd ( 13 @,@ 000 m ) and lasted for almost two hours . During this time , the ships made four passes across Kamaishi harbor and fired 803 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) shells , 1 @,@ 383 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) shells and 733 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) shells . Gambia fired the final shots of the attack . During the bombardment , several Japanese aircraft approached the Allied ships and two were shot down by Allied naval fighters . This bombardment caused more damage than the attack conducted in July , and large quantities of pig iron were destroyed . The sounds of this bombardment were broadcast live on radio in the United States via a radio relay on board Iowa . One of the prisoner of war camps in Kamaishi was destroyed by the Allied attack , resulting in the deaths of 27 Allied prisoners . 
 A further bombardment by King George V , three light cruisers and escorting destroyers was planned to be conducted against an unspecified Japanese target on 13 August . This attack was cancelled due both to the battleship 's mechanical problems and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . The Allied fleet did not conduct any other bombardments as Japan surrendered on 15 August . 
 = = = Submarine attacks = = = 
 Two US Navy submarines attacked locations in the Japanese home islands during June and July 1945 . On 20 June USS Barb arrived off Japan 's northern islands under the command of Commander Gene <unk> . For this patrol the submarine had been fitted with an experimental 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) rocket launcher intended for shore bombardments . Shortly after midnight on 22 June the submarine fired 12 rockets at the town of Shari in north @-@ east Hokkaido . Barb then proceeded north , and on 2 July bombarded the town of Kaiyo in south @-@ east Sakhalin with its deck gun . This attack destroyed three sampans docked in the town , damaged a seal rookery and caused several fires to break out . The next day the submarine fired more rockets at the town of <unk> . A party of eight men from Barb was landed on the east coast of Sakhalin on 23 July and planted demolition charges on a railroad track . Shortly after the men began rowing back to the submarine the charges were triggered by a passing train ; 150 people , including civilians , were killed . On 24 July , Barb fired 32 rockets at the town of Shiritori and 12 rockets at <unk> . As the submarine returned to base it shelled the towns of <unk> on 25 July and <unk> the next day . 
 The other submarine bombardment took place during the morning of 24 June , when USS <unk> fired some shells at the island of Hirado Shima in the Tsushima Strait between Japan and Korea . This attack sought to convince the Japanese that a force of American submarines that had been operating in the Sea of Japan would attempt to depart via the Tsushima Strait , instead of their actual route far to the north through the La Pérouse Strait between Honshu and Sakhalin .

 Although the naval bombardments did not result in the reaction the Allies were hoping for from the Japanese military , they disrupted the country 's steel industry . While several of the factories attacked were operating at reduced capacity , the important Kamaishi and Wanishi Iron Works suffered heavy damage when they were bombarded in July and August . During both these attacks , the Allied gunnery was accurate and focused on the factories ' coke batteries , which were critical to continued production . Post @-@ war assessments found that the damage caused to industrial buildings by even 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) naval shells was less than that which could be inflicted by the 2 @,@ 000 lb ( 910 kg ) and 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) general @-@ purpose bombs that were used by Allied naval aircraft . While this supported a view put forward by Vice Admiral McCain that the aircraft assigned to protect the bombardment forces could have caused more damage than the ships themselves , the post @-@ war United States Strategic Bombing Survey judged that the naval bombardments were justified as there had been little risk to the ships involved . 
 The bombardments also affected Japanese morale . Japanese civilians who experienced both air and naval bombardment found the naval attacks to be more terrifying due to their unpredictability and longer duration . Several of the industrial facilities that suffered little damage in bombardments incurred a significant loss in production due to absenteeism and reduced productivity . This was not the case for all facilities that were attacked though , and the morale among workers in two of the bombarded factories was reported to have increased . The appearance of Allied warships just off the coast also convinced many Japanese that the war had been lost . However , such attitudes did not contribute to bringing the war to an end as the views of civilians had little influence on the Japanese Government 's decision to surrender . 
 In 1949 , the Japanese Economic Stabilization Agency calculated that the Allied naval bombardments and other forms of attack other than bombing had caused 3 @,@ 282 casualties , representing 0 @.@ 5 percent of all casualties inflicted by the Allies in the Japanese home islands . The casualties attributed to naval bombardments and other causes included 1 @,@ 739 fatalities , 46 persons who were still classified as missing and 1 @,@ 497 people who were wounded . 
 = Typhoon Bess ( 1974 ) = 
 Typhoon Bess , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Susang , was responsible for the disappearance of a United States Air Force weather reconnaissance aircraft . Developing out of a poorly organized system on October 8 to the east of the Philippines , Bess featured two centers of circulation . Initially the southern low was monitored ; however , a low to the north soon became the dominant center . Tracking generally west @-@ northwestward , the storm gradually intensified before striking northern Luzon as a minimal typhoon on October 11 . Temporary weakening took place due to interaction with land . After moving back over water the following morning , Bess regained typhoon intensity . This was short @-@ lived though , as conditions surrounding the cyclone soon caused it to weaken . Now moving due west , the weakening storm eventually struck Hainan Island as a tropical storm on October 12 before diminishing to a tropical depression . The depression briefly moved back over water before dissipating in northern Vietnam on October 14 . 
 Bess produced heavy rains throughout the Philippines , especially in Luzon where 782 @.@ 3 mm ( 30 @.@ 80 in ) was measured in Baguio . These rains triggered extensive flooding and landslides that killed 26 people and left 3 others missing . Many homes were destroyed and damage amounted to $ 9 @.@ 2 million ( 1974 USD ) . On October 12 , a reconnaissance plane , with a crew of six , investigating the periphery of the storm went missing . It is presumed that the entire crew was lost when the aircraft crashed off the coast of Luzon . Though the center remained offshore , strong winds and high tides also impacted Hong Kong , causing minor flooding . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On October 6 , 1974 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring a tropical disturbance several hundred miles southeast of Guam . Tracking quickly westward to west @-@ northwestward in response to a strong subtropical ridge to the north , the system gradually organized , passing near Ulithi atoll on October 7 . Accompanied by a broad monsoonal flow , the disturbance featured multiple centers of circulation . On October 8 , it developed into a tropical depression and soon into a tropical storm , at which time it was assigned the name Bess . Early on October 9 , an aircraft reconnaissance mission into Bess revealed that a new dominant center of circulation had developed to the north of the original low . The southern low soon dissipated as the northern one became a tropical storm . The northern system retained the name Bess and is considered the same storm by the JTWC . 
 After the northern circulation became the dominant center on October 9 , a deepening trough in the westerlies caused a decrease in synoptic pressures , resulting in Bess ' forward motion greatly decreasing . Maintaining a west @-@ northwesterly track , strong outflow developed , especially to the southwest of the circulation . The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October 10 as it approached the northern Philippines . Due to the cyclone 's proximity to the country , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang . Later that day , Bess made landfall in northern Luzon , roughly 95 km ( 60 mi ) south of <unk> Point , with winds estimated at 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC , the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) before the system moved ashore . Inland , a barometric pressure of 976 @.@ 9 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 85 inHg ) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55 km ( 35 mi ) to the north . 
 Due to the interaction with the high terrain of northern Luzon , Bess temporarily weakened to a tropical storm before regaining typhoon strength over the South China Sea during the afternoon of October 11 . As the storm emerged back over water , satellite images revealed a relatively large system with clouds spanning an area 485 km ( 300 mi ) in diameter . Upon reintensifying , Bess turned due west in response to a dominating high pressure area over Southern China . With a large difference in pressures between the two systems , a strong northeasterly flow developed between them . This resulted in gale @-@ force winds occurring up to 400 km ( 250 mi ) from Bess 's center . During the evening of October 12 , the combined effects of a winter monsoon and entrainment of cool , dry air from mainland China began to weaken the system . By the following morning , Bess had weakened to tropical storm as it passed 305 km ( 190 mi ) south of Hong Kong . The system later struck Hainan Island with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) before lessening to a tropical depression . The dissipating system emerged over the Gulf of Tonkin on October 14 and ultimately dissipated as it began moving ashore in northern Vietnam later that day . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Striking northern Luzon as a typhoon , Bess produced damaging winds and torrential rainfall across the region . Gusts peaked at 178 km / h ( 111 mph ) in Aparri , Cagayan while Baguio City experienced gusts of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Communication across the region was greatly disrupted as numerous power lines and trees were downed . While much of the peninsula received 130 to 150 mm ( 5 to 6 in ) of rain , a 24 ‑ hour maxima of 782 @.@ 3 mm ( 30 @.@ 8 in ) was reported in Baguio . The rainfall triggered widespread flash flooding and landslides , resulting in 26 fatalities and extensive damage . One death took place in Baguio after a girl was buried in a landslide . At least three other people were reported missing . In a town roughly 805 km ( 500 mi ) south of Manila , a landslide destroyed eight homes and a school . Flood waters inundated four villages in the central Philippines . The storm affected a total of 35 @,@ 562 people , of which about 4 @,@ 000 became homeless . Total losses amounted to $ 9 @.@ 2 million ( 1974 USD ) . 
 On October 11 , a level one warning signal was raised for Hong Kong , indicating that a tropical cyclone was approaching the region . This was soon raised to level three as strong winds were expected to affect the area . Although the center of Bess passed roughly 305 km ( 190 mi ) south of Hong Kong , the pressure gradient between the tropical storm and high pressure to the north resulted in strong winds across the region . On the Pratas Islands , ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) were reported . In Hong Kong itself , winds reached 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) and gusted to 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Gusts up to 113 km / h ( 71 mph ) occurred on Tate 's Cairn . In contrast to the unusually strong winds , Bess produced virtually no rainfall as it passed by , with only a trace of precipitation measured between October 11 and 14 in Hong Kong . Along the coast , abnormally high tides combined with storm surge flooded low @-@ lying areas of the city . Tides at Tai Po Kau reached 3 @.@ 6 m ( 12 ft ) with a surge of 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) . Sea water leaked into the city 's underground sewage system and caused minor flooding in the area 's western district . Some property damage was reported . 
 While over the South China Sea on October 12 , a United States Air Force WC @-@ 130H Hercules reconnaissance aircraft ( call sign Swan 38 ) , with a crew of six , went missing while collecting data on the cyclone . The plane took off from Clark Air Base during the night on October 12 and made its final contact six hours later roughly 95 km ( 60 mi ) north of Manila . A rescue team of five Air Force aircraft and the USS White Plains was dispatched to look for survivors . Search and rescue missions for the crew only found pieces of debris , such as an aircraft survival radio , soundproofing material , and orange cushion @-@ like material . All six crewmen were never found and are presumed dead . Following the incident , the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron established the Swan 38 Memorial Scholarship for outstanding students in the <unk> Wing . 
 Because of the damage and loss of life caused by the storm , the name Bess was retired and replaced with Bonnie . However , when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979 , the name was re @-@ introduced to the roster . Coincidentally , it was again retired in 1982 when a powerful storm named Bess caused extensive damage and loss of life in Japan . This marked the only occasion where a single name was removed twice in the same basin .

At sixteen , he came to San Francisco to study at the California School of Design beginning in 1903 ; he was influenced strongly by Arthur Frank Mathews , muralist and painter at the school . He met painter Helen Arnstein ( later Helen Salz ) while both were teenagers , and she became his first girlfriend . Arnstein , the daughter of wealthy Jewish art lovers and one year Stackpole 's senior , described him as " a remarkable draftsman " who painted and sketched constantly . She was less impressed with his sense of color than with his precision in line . Stackpole polished his craft by working with artists at the Montgomery Block , playfully called " Monkey Block " , a bohemian hangout which included studios for painting and sculpture . After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , he used a grant of US $ 200 ( $ 5 @,@ 300 in current value ) to travel to France to attend the École des Beaux @-@ Arts and Atelier <unk> in 1906 – 1908 , exhibiting at the Salon in 1910 . It was in Paris that he became friends with painter Diego Rivera He painted under Robert Henri in New York in 1911 .

 Stackpole returned to San Francisco in 1912 and married Adele Barnes , two months younger than he , an art student of Xavier Martinez and one of the first graduates of the California Academy of Arts and Crafts . Adele Stackpole was a perfectionist in many ways , including the precision of her bookplate engravings and the demands she placed on her relationships . On June 15 , 1913 , the <unk> ' son Peter was born in San Francisco . 
 Stackpole was part of the foursome that founded , early in 1913 , the California Society of <unk> ( CSE ) . The other founders were Robert B. <unk> , an etcher and art professor at Stanford University , etcher and educator Pedro Lemos , who taught at the San Francisco Institute of Art , and <unk> Piazzoni , an Italian @-@ American painter and muralist who was Stackpole 's master in France . The CSE exhibited twice in 1913 , and grew to 78 artist members and five associate after two years . In 1926 , the annual publication listed 46 artist members and 156 associate members : Stackpole was still a member . Decades later , the CSE merged with another group to become the California Society of <unk> .

 Around the same time , Stackpole was commissioned to sculpt architectural features for the 1915 Panama @-@ Pacific International Exposition , a major assignment that was to take two years to complete , even with the aid of assistants . To give a grand entrance portal to the Palace of Varied Industries , he completed a copy of the main entrance to the Hospice of Santa Cruz , built in Toledo , Spain in the 16th century . Stackpole 's design replaced the original figures of Catholic saints with figures of industry . His works for the Palace of Varied Industries included " Man with a pick " , " <unk> group of Varied Industries " , " New World Receiving Burdens of Old " , " Keystone figure " , and " Power of Industry " . Stackpole also sculpted figures of " Thought " on the columns flanking the half domes of the west facade of the Palace Group . At the Palace of Fine Arts , Stackpole produced a kneeling " Venus " on the Altar of Inspiration . Visitors wishing to view " Venus " were kept some 50 yards ( 50 m ) away by a man @-@ made lagoon . 
 = = = Modern trends = = = 
 With Piazzoni , Stackpole went to France again in 1922 , taking his family ; he enrolled his nine @-@ year @-@ old son in the École <unk> , a private school in Paris . The two artists wished to investigate the most modern trends in Europe , and they encountered Diego Rivera . While there , Stackpole 's marriage unraveled , and he returned to the Bay Area in 1923 with a 24 @-@ year @-@ old French still life artist and model named Francine Mazen , nicknamed " Ginette " ; his wife and son returned after the school year to take up residence across the bay in Oakland . Stackpole obtained a divorce , and then married Ginette in Mexico . 
 In late 1923 , Stackpole organized a major art exhibit , in partnership with Piazzoni . This was the first large @-@ scale art show in San Francisco since 1915 ; there had been no expected rush of artists after the Panama @-@ Pacific International Exposition . The exhibit , held in Polk Hall in the Civic Auditorium , was companion to a nearby print exhibit which included Gauguin and Matisse works . Critic and author Laura Bride Powers felt that the event was a disappointment — it displayed " inconspicuous examples " of leading artists , and failed to show any Picasso , avant @-@ garde or Dadaist works . 
 In 1926 , Stackpole delivered the William A. Coleman Fountain to the city of Sacramento , a Moderne work ( centrally located in what is now known as Cesar Chavez Park ) which celebrated the city 's completion of a difficult water filtration project . That same year , Stackpole traveled to Mexico City to see Rivera working on some of his 124 frescoes in the courtyard of the Secretariat of Public Education . Returning with a small Rivera painting , Stackpole gave it to San Francisco Arts Commission president William <unk> ( who was initially unimpressed ) , and began a several @-@ year effort to bring Rivera to work in California . 
 Stackpole accepted an offer to teach at his former school , its name changed to the California School of Fine Arts ( <unk> ) . For a stretch of almost twenty years , he taught a number of subjects . Dorr Bothwell studied sculpture under Stackpole , then the head of the Sculpture Department , and thought him to be sexist — she said he told the women in the class that " the place they really belonged was in bed . " 
 Kenneth Rexroth wrote of Stackpole in 1929 that " He knew everybody in town from top to bottom ... and he took us everywhere . " Stackpole 's sizable San Francisco studio at 716 Montgomery ( adjacent to Montgomery Block ) served as a social center for San Francisco 's artist community . Photographer Dorothea Lange rented upstairs studio space there in 1926 , and Helen Clark and Otis Oldfield , both artists , married there the same year . Lange 's husband Maynard Dixon had his studio next door , and the Stackpole and Dixon families were close — both men were members of the Bohemian Club . 
 Throughout the 1930s , Stackpole worked frequently with architect Timothy Pflueger on various commissions . Beginning in 1929 when the two men first met , Stackpole was given responsibility for selecting the artists who worked to execute and augment Pflueger 's basic design scheme for the San Francisco Stock Exchange and its associated Tower , especially the Luncheon Club occupying the top floors of the Tower . Stackpole said later of the experience , " the artists were in from the first . They were called in conference and assumed responsibility and personal pride in the building . " At the Sansome Street tower entrance , Stackpole worked on a scaffolding with a crew of assistants to direct carve heroic figures in stone . After the building was completed , Stackpole was finally successful in winning a commission for Rivera ; Pflueger became convinced that Rivera would be the perfect muralist for decorating the staircase wall and ceiling of the Stock Exchange Club . This was a controversial selection considering Rivera 's leftist political beliefs in contradiction to the Stock Exchange 's capitalist foundation . Into the mural , Rivera painted a figure of Stackpole 's son Peter holding a model airplane . 
 During his stay , Rivera and his wife Frida Kahlo lived and worked at the studio , becoming in the process lifelong friends with Stackpole and Ginette . They met tennis champion Helen Wills Moody , an avid painter @-@ hobbyist , who soon agreed to model for Rivera at the studio . Neighbor Dixon saw the attention , and the American money being given to Rivera , and with etcher Frank Van Sloun organized a short @-@ lived protest against the Communist artist . However , both Dixon and Van Sloun quickly realized that the San Francisco art world " oligarchy " who were obviously smitten with Rivera , including Stackpole 's well @-@ connected patrons , were the same group that they themselves would need to support their own art aspirations . 
 For much of 1931 , Stackpole partnered with other artists to decorate Pflueger 's Paramount Theatre in Oakland , an Art Deco masterpiece . A bas @-@ relief scene of horses , waves and a central winged figure was placed over the stage 's proscenium arch , finished in gold @-@ toned metal leaf — the work jointly designed by Stackpole and Robert Boardman Howard . The design worked into Pflueger 's metal grille ceiling grid likely came unattributed from Stackpole 's sketches . Pflueger was an able project leader ; Stackpole later described his involvement : " He was the boss alright , as an architect should be ... He would call the plays just as a symphony conductor does ... There wasn 't a lock , molding , or window that he did not inspect in the drawings and in the actual building with the utmost thoroughness and care . " 
 Stackpole worked through ten months of 1932 on a monumental pair of sculptures flanking the grand entrance of the Stock Exchange : a male and a female grouping showing the polarity of agriculture and industry , showing in their rounded human shapes the influence of Rivera . <unk> into 15 short tons ( 14 t ) of Yosemite granite , he wore goggles and a mask . The unveiling ceremony took place in the cold of New Year 's Eve , with Mayor Angelo Rossi joining Stackpole , Pflueger and artisans in smocks . 
 Stackpole took his son Peter to visit their photographer friend Edward Weston in Carmel in the early 1930s , and the two older men spent the day discussing photography , " the difference between making and taking a photograph , between the intended and the random " . This conversation , and the 1932 exhibit by Group f / 64 , a collection of innovative photographers such as Weston and Ansel Adams , was later seen as foundational to Peter Stackpole 's conception of photography . 
 In July 1933 , Stackpole completed a model of a design to be incorporated into the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge 's central anchorage on the western side . The anchorage , to be constructed of concrete rising 197 feet ( 60 m ) above the water , was to display over much of its height a bare @-@ chested male figure standing solidly between the two suspension spans . However , Arthur Brown , Jr . , Pflueger 's colleague on the Bay Bridge project , did not like the scale of the figure , which belittled the bridge . Engineer Ralph Modjeski agreed , writing " The gigantic figure which is proposed for the centre anchorage is out of place for a structure of this kind and would not harmonize with the end anchorage . " Stackpole 's design was abandoned in favor of a largely flat expanse of poured concrete . 
 In 1933 and 1934 , Stackpole took part in the Public Works of Art Project assignment to paint murals for Coit Tower . Many of the murals were executed in styles reminiscent of Rivera , and Stackpole himself was portrayed in five of them ; in one he is shown reading a newspaper announcing the destruction of a Rivera mural in New York . 
 In 1937 , Stackpole received a commission to sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell , for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior . It was to be a companion piece to Heinz Warneke 's portrayal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene , so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark to be one of them on land . Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940 , and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building 's auditorium . 
 = = = Golden Gate International Exposition = = = 
 Pflueger made certain that Stackpole was given a major commission for art in preparation for the Golden Gate International Exposition , also called the Pacific Pageant , a world 's fair to be held on Treasure Island between San Francisco and Oakland . Stackpole worked to create an 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) tall frame @-@ and @-@ stucco embodiment of Pacifica , the theme of the exposition . By November 1938 , when Life photographer Alfred <unk> was capturing images to promote the event , Pacifica was ready for his camera . The magazine carried the image of this , Stackpole 's most monumental work , " a peaceful , contemplative , almost prayer @-@ like female figure " intended only for temporary placement . The heroic sculpture stood in front of a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) tall " prayer curtain " of regular star @-@ shaped steel bangles that rippled in the wind . Vivid orange and blue lights washed the curtain at night , while Pacifica , the image of Peace , was brilliant in white . Over two years , 16 million visitors came to the exposition . When it was over , Stackpole proposed that the sculpture be recast in a more permanent form — steel , stone or concrete — and positioned prominently on an island in the San Francisco Bay , perhaps Alcatraz or Angel Island , in a manner similar to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor . The plan was not seriously considered by civic leaders whose attention was on the gathering war clouds in Asia and Europe . The sculpture and most of the exposition buildings were dynamited in 1942 , and the U.S. Navy took ownership of the island as a base in World War II . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In the early 1940s , Stackpole left the <unk> to teach privately . In April 1945 , he led a sculpting class at the California Labor School , a leftist organization advocating equal rights for workers . From 1941 to 1945 , he served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts , the first commission member from the West Coast . 
 In 1949 , Stackpole moved to <unk> in the Puy @-@ de @-@ Dôme area of central France , returning with his second wife Ginette to her birthplace . There , his art became less figurative and more abstract , both in sculpture and in painting . He kept a flow of correspondence with his old friends in San Francisco , including Helen Salz , who described his letters as devoid of any mention of sculpture or painting , or any project that Stackpole might have been working on — instead , he wrote of musicians and music , and of his encounters with people . Salz bought a Stackpole bust of poet George Sterling and donated it to the University of California in 1955 – 56 , to be displayed in <unk> Hall . In early 1964 , Stackpole visited San Francisco to see his family , and he called up his old friend Kenneth Rexroth . In his San Francisco Examiner newspaper column , Rexroth wrote of having lunch with the Stackpole family , and reminded his readers that the man had been known " for 20 years or more [ as ] San Francisco 's leading artist . " 
 Stackpole died in France in 1973 , his wife in 1978 . 
 Some of Stackpole 's sculptures , paintings and drawings were destroyed in the Oakland Firestorm of 1991 , a blaze which leveled the home of Peter Stackpole . Floyd Winter , a neighbor , helped rescue a very few items " moments before the conflagration consumed the house " .

 = Seventh generation of video game consoles = 
 In the history of video games , the seventh generation includes consoles released since late 2005 by Nintendo , Microsoft , and Sony Computer Entertainment . For home consoles , the seventh generation began on November 22 , 2005 with the release of Microsoft 's Xbox 360 and continued with the release of Sony Computer Entertainment 's PlayStation 3 on November 17 , 2006 , and Nintendo 's Wii on November 19 , 2006 . Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough in technology . The Xbox 360 offered games rendered natively at high @-@ definition video ( HD ) resolutions , the PlayStation 3 offered HD movie playback via a built @-@ in 3D Blu @-@ ray Disc player , and the Wii focused on integrating controllers with movement sensors as well as joysticks . Some of the Wii controllers could be moved about to control in @-@ game actions , which enabled players to simulate real @-@ world actions during gameplay ( e.g. , in the Wii sports tennis game , the user swings the controller to hit the on @-@ screen image of a tennis ball ) . Video game consoles had become an important part of the global IT infrastructure . It is estimated that video game consoles represented 25 % of the world 's general @-@ purpose computational power in the year 2007 . 
 Joining Nintendo in the motion market , Sony Computer Entertainment released the PlayStation Move in September 2010 . The PlayStation Move features motion sensing gaming , similar to that of the Wii . Microsoft joined the scene in November 2010 , with its Kinect ( previously announced under the working title " Project Natal " in June 2009 ) . Unlike the other two systems ( PlayStation 3 and Wii ) , Kinect does not use controllers of any sort and makes the users the " controller . " Having sold 8 million units in its first 60 days on the market , Kinect has claimed the Guinness World Record of being the " fastest selling consumer electronics device " . While the Xbox 360 offers wired controllers as a standalone product , all PlayStation 3 controllers can be used in wired and wireless configurations . Starting with handheld consoles , the seventh generation began on November 21 , 2004 with the North American introduction of the Nintendo DS as a " third pillar " , alongside Nintendo 's existing Game Boy Advance and GameCube consoles . 
 The Nintendo DS ( NDS ) features a touch screen and built @-@ in microphone , and supports wireless IEEE 802 @.@ 11 ( Wi @-@ Fi ) standards . Additionally , the revised version of the NDS , the Nintendo DSi , features two built in cameras , the ability to download games from the DSi store , and a web browser . The PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) released later the same year on December 12 , 2004 , followed a different pattern . It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format , Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) , as its primary storage media . Sony also gave the PSP robust multi @-@ media capability , connectivity with the PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 2 ( only on some games ) , other PSPs , as well as Internet connectivity . The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser , as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles . Despite high sales numbers for both consoles , PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS ; nevertheless , the PlayStation Portable has the distinction of being the best @-@ selling non @-@ Nintendo handheld gaming system . Sony announced in 2014 that they had discontinued the production of the PlayStation Portable worldwide , this follows Nintendo 's announcement in 2013 that it had discontinued its original line of the Nintendo DS family devices to move onto the Nintendo 3DS line . Microsoft also announced in 2016 , that they would discontinue the Xbox 360 at the end of April that year . 
 The multimillion @-@ dollar pre @-@ sale success of Ouya , an Android @-@ based microconsole initially founded through crowdfunding has raised open @-@ source development and the free @-@ to @-@ play model as key issues to be addressed in later firmware updates to the seventh generation consoles , as well as by the eighth generation consoles . The <unk> like Nvidia Shield Console , MOJO , Razer <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Ouya , and even more powerful PC @-@ based Steam Machine consoles are attempting to compete in the game console market ; but even though some of these are theoretically powerful on paper , they are however seldom referred to as " seventh generation " consoles . 
 = = Home consoles = = 
 = = = Wii = = = 
 Nintendo entered this generation with a new approach embodied by its Wii . The company planned to attract current hardcore and casual gamers , non @-@ gamers , and lapsed gamers by focusing on new gameplay experiences and new forms of interaction with games rather than cutting edge graphics and expensive technology . This approach was previously implemented in the portable market with the Nintendo DS . Nintendo expressed hope that the new control schemes it had implemented would render conventionally controlled consoles obsolete , leading to Nintendo capturing a large portion of the existing market as well . 
 This strategy paid off , with demand for the Wii outstripping supply throughout 2007 . Since Nintendo profited on each console right from the start unlike its competitors , it achieved very positive returns . With only a few exceptions , monthly worldwide sales for the Wii were higher than those of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , eroding Microsoft 's early lead and widening the gap between its market share and Sony 's . On September 12 , 2007 , it was reported by the British newspaper Financial Times that the Wii 's sales surpassed those of the Xbox 360 , which had been released one year previously , and became the market leader in worldwide home console sales for the generation . 
 As in previous generations , Nintendo provided strong support for its new console with popular first @-@ party franchises like Mario , The Legend of Zelda , Metroid , and Pokémon , among others . To appeal to casual and non @-@ gamers , Nintendo developed a group of core Wii games , consisting of Wii Sports , Wii Play , Wii Fit , and Wii Music , where players make use of the motion @-@ sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities . With the exception of Wii Music , the games and their sequels have all been highly successful . 
 Publishers such as Ubisoft , Electronic Arts , Capcom , and Majesco continued to release exclusive titles for the console , but the Wii 's strongest titles remained within its first @-@ party line @-@ up . Analysts speculated that this would change in time as the Wii 's growing popularity persuaded third @-@ party publishers to focus on it ; however , some third party developers expressed frustration at low software sales . Goichi Suda , developer of No More Heroes for the Wii , noted that " only Nintendo titles are doing well . This isn 't just because of the current situation in Japan , as this is happening outside Japan . I am very surprised about the reality about Wii , because before I was making this game , I wasn 't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non @-@ gamers . I expected more games for hardcore gamers . The reality is different to what I expected . " Conversely , the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game 's sales . Goichi Suda later retracted his comment , saying his " point was that No More Heroes , unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware , i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products that have been successful on this platform thus far . " 
 In early 2008 , the NPD Group revealed sales data showing that , while the Wii 's life @-@ to @-@ date attach rate was low , in December 2007 , it reached 8 @.@ 11 — higher than the attach rates for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in that month . The Wii 's low overall attach rate could be explained by reference to its rapidly increasing installed base , as financial analysts have pointed to the Xbox 360 's high attach rates as indicative of an unhealthy lack of installed base growth , and warned that what actually benefits third @-@ party developers is " quicker adoption of hardware and a rapidly growing installed base on which to sell progressively more game units , " which tends to lower the attach rate of a product . 
 On September 23 , 2009 , Nintendo announced its first price drops for the console . In the United States , the price was reduced by fifty dollars , resulting in a new Manufacturer 's Suggested Retail Price ( MSRP ) of $ 199 @.@ 99 , effective September 27 , 2009 . For Japan , the price dropped from ¥ 25 @,@ 000 to ¥ 20 @,@ 000 , effective October 1 , 2009 . In Europe ( with the exception of the United Kingdom ) , the price of a Wii console dropped from € 249 to € 199 . On May 3 , 2010 , Nintendo announced that Wii consoles sold in the Americas now would include Wii Sports Resort and Wii MotionPlus , effective May 9 , 2010 . Since May 15 , 2011 , the Wii Console is US $ 149 @.@ 99 and comes bundled with Mario Kart Wii . 
 = = = Xbox 360 = = = 
 Microsoft Xbox 360 gained an early lead in terms of market share , largely due to its established Xbox Live online gaming system , and its early launch date , which was one year before its rivals . Sales in North America and Europe have continued to be strong , even after the release of the Wii and PlayStation 3 . Like its predecessor , the Xbox 360 received a muted reception in Japan , attributed to the lack of content aimed at Japanese gamers . 
 This early launch did come with some trouble , as technical problems appeared in a portion of Xbox 360 units sold . The most well @-@ known problem is the " red ring of death " and Error <unk> , which received ( and still receives ) a great deal of attention due to some users having to replace their consoles multiple times . Microsoft attempted to address this by offering a three @-@ year warranty on all affected consoles and repairing them free of charge . It also retroactively reimbursed owners of affected systems who paid for repairs . According to The Mercury News , new models of the console featuring 65 @-@ nanometer technology will address this and other issues ; the new technology is expected to reduce heat production , which will lower the risk of overheating and system failures ; although , this has never been officially confirmed by Microsoft . 
 As they share many cross @-@ platform games and compete for the same audience as their predecessors , frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 . The PS3 uses the Blu @-@ ray format , while the Xbox 360 uses a standard <unk> . The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce , and analysts expect that a mid @-@ revision will allow Microsoft to break @-@ even on manufacturing costs , while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360 's conventional architecture is easier to develop for . 
 At the end of first half of 2007 , the console stabilized at 11 @.@ 6 million units shipped as sales dropped 60 % while its rival , Wii , gained momentum and Sony announced a competitive price drop on the PlayStation 3 . Microsoft 's strategy to boost sales with the release of the highly anticipated Halo 3 in September 2007 paid off , outselling the Wii that month in North America . Microsoft 's Entertainment and Devices Division experienced a huge increase in revenue , largely driven by the release of Halo 3 , and posted a quarterly profit for the first time in two years . 
 The Xbox 360 's advantage over its competitors owes itself to the release of high @-@ profile games , such as additions to the Halo franchise . The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform . By March 2008 , the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7 @.@ 5 games per console in the US ; the rate was 7 @.@ 0 in Europe , while its competitors were 3 @.@ 8 ( PS3 ) and 3 @.@ 5 ( Wii ) , according to Microsoft . At the 2008 Game Developers Conference , Microsoft announced that it expected over 1 @,@ 000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year . The Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives , including Devil May Cry , Ace Combat , Virtua Fighter , Grand Theft Auto IV , Final Fantasy XIII , Tekken 6 , Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance , and L.A. Noire . 
 In August 2007 , the first price drop was announced for all Stock Keeping Units ( SKU 's ) of the Xbox 360 . The Core system 's price was reduced in the United States by $ 20 , the Premium by $ 50 , and the Elite model by $ 30 . Also , the HDMI port , previously exclusive to the Elite system , was added to new models of the Premium and Arcade systems ; the Core system was discontinued . 
 At E3 2010 , Microsoft revealed a new US $ 299 @.@ 99 Xbox 360 SKU known officially as the Xbox 360 S and referred to as the " Slim " by various media outlets . It replaced the Elite and comes with an integrated 802.11n <unk> adapter , integrated <unk> port , 5 USB ports and a 250 GB HDD . It also does not require an additional power supply to make use of Microsoft Kinect motion control accessory . A US $ 199 @.@ 99 version was released on August 3 , 2010 in the US which replaced the Arcade model . It has 4 GB and a 250 GB model of internal memory , it has a matte or glossy finish and it comes with a headset . At E3 2013 Microsoft revealed the Xbox 360 E , the final iteration of the Xbox 360 series , to be succeeded by Xbox One . The Xbox 360 E was originally priced at US $ 199 @.@ 99 for a <unk> model , and US $ 299 @.@ 99 for the 250GB model . The 360 E featured a new square design with a simplified exterior akin to the Xbox One . 
 = = = PlayStation 3 = = = 
 Sony Computer Entertainment PlayStation 3 was released on November 11 , 2006 in Japan and November 17 , 2006 in the US and Canada . The system 's reliance on new technologies such as the Cell microprocessor and Blu @-@ ray format caused difficulties in manufacturing , especially the Blu @-@ ray diode , leading to shortages at launch and the delay of the PAL region launches ; however , by early December 2006 , Sony announced that all production issues had been resolved . Market analysts and Sony executives noted that the success of the PlayStation 3 and the Blu @-@ ray format were dependent on each other ; Rich Marty , VP of New Business Development at Sony Pictures Home Entertainment stated that the " PS3 is critical to the success of Blu @-@ ray , " while Phil Harrison stated that the PlayStation 3 's success would be ensured because " the growth of the Blu @-@ ray Disc movie market ... is a positive factor which will play more into the consumer psyche ... as more consumer electronics firms launch standalone disc players , as more Blu @-@ ray Disc movies become available , and as more shelf space is dedicated to the category at retail . " 
 Sony would provide support for its console with new titles from acclaimed first @-@ party franchises such as Gran Turismo , Team Ico , and God of War , and secured a number of highly anticipated third @-@ party exclusive titles , including Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , Yakuza 3 and Valkyria Chronicles . Titles that were originally exclusive or recognized with the platform , such as Devil May Cry , Ace Combat , Virtua Fighter , and Monster Hunter , have been released on other platforms . The previous Grand Theft Auto titles were originally timed exclusives on the PlayStation 2 , before making their release on other platforms , such as the Xbox , months later ; however , Grand Theft Auto IV , the latest installment , was released simultaneously on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 . Announced exclusives titles for the PlayStation 3 such as Assassin 's Creed ; <unk> : The Hundred Years ' War , and Fatal Inertia were released on Xbox 360 as well , with the latter making its release on Xbox 360 before the PlayStation 3 version . 
 The Katamari series , which has long been PlayStation 2 exclusives , found one of the more recent installments , Beautiful Katamari , exclusive to Xbox 360 . These releases fueled rumors and fear that Final Fantasy XIII and Tekken 6 , two highly anticipated exclusive PlayStation 3 games at the time , would also be available for Xbox 360 , the PlayStation 3 's primary competitor and at E3 2008 , it was announced that Final Fantasy XIII would be simultaneously released on the Xbox 360 in Europe and North America ; later on October 8 , 2008 , it was announced that Tekken 6 would also be releasing on the Xbox 360 . After the multiplatform releases of these games , the fifth installment of the Metal Gear series , Metal Gear Solid : Rising , has also been announced for the Xbox 360 ; L.A. Noire , which was announced as an exclusive since the beginning of its development , has also been released for the Xbox 360 ; Dark Souls , the spiritual successor to Demon 's Souls , has also been released on Xbox 360 ; the Persona series , which has a long history of being PlayStation exclusive , found the seventh generation installment , Persona 4 Arena multiplatform ; however , Metal Gear Solid 4 , Yakuza 3 , Tekken 5 : Dark Resurrection <unk> , and Disgaea 3 : Absence of Justice still remain PlayStation 3 exclusives . Sony has blamed lower @-@ than @-@ expected sales , loss of exclusive titles in the PlayStation 3 software library , its higher price , and stock shortages . 
 In July 2007 , Sony announced a drop in the price of the console by $ 100 . This measure only applied to the 60 GB models and was exclusive to the United States and Canada , where those models are no longer in production . On October 18 , 2007 , Sony announced a US $ 100 price drop for the 80 GB model and a new US $ 399 40 GB model to launch on November 2 , 2007 with reduced features such as the removal of backward compatibility with PS2 games .

 = = = = Backward compatibility = = = = 
 Early models of the Wii are fully backwards compatible with GameCube software and most of its accessories ; the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support . Early versions of the PlayStation 3 and all models of the Xbox 360 only offer partial support and use software emulation for backwards compatibility . Current versions of the PS3 do not offer PlayStation 2 compatibility , though PS1 compatibility is retained . Some models of the first generation of the PS3 offered full backwards compatibility for PS2 games . The Xbox 360 's compatibility is increased through game @-@ specific patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website and the PS3 's compatibility is expanded with firmware updates . 
 All three consoles provide titles from older consoles for download ; the Xbox 360 through the Xbox Originals service , the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store , and the Wii through the Virtual Console . When purchased , the game is saved to console 's internal memory or , optionally on the Wii , to an inserted SD / SDHC card . Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for backwards compatible games , but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games . No more games will be added to the list of backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360 . In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS3s , many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay / graphics as high @-@ definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu @-@ ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network .

 For video game handhelds , the seventh generation began with the release of the Nintendo DS on November 21 , 2004 . This handheld was based on a design fundamentally different from the Game Boy and other handheld video game systems . The Nintendo DS offered new modes of input over previous generations such as a touch screen , the ability to connect wirelessly using IEEE 802.11b , as well as a microphone to speak to in @-@ game NPCs . On December 12 , 2004 , Sony released its first handheld , PlayStation Portable . The PlayStation Portable was marketed at launch to an above @-@ 25 @-@ year @-@ old or " core gamer " market , while the Nintendo DS proved to be popular with both core gamers and new customers . 
 Nokia revived its N @-@ Gage platform in the form of a service for selected S60 devices . This new service launched on April 3 , 2008 . Other less @-@ popular handheld systems released during this generation include the Gizmondo ( launched on March 19 , 2005 and discontinued in February 2006 ) and the GP2X ( launched on November 10 , 2005 and discontinued in August 2008 ) . The GP2X Wiz , Pandora , and Gizmondo 2 were scheduled for release in 2009 . 
 Another aspect of the seventh generation was the beginning of direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices , and increasingly powerful PDA / cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch , and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes . Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction , but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented , with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband . 
 Sony announced in 2014 that they had discontinued the production of the PlayStation Portable worldwide , this follows Nintendo 's announcement in 2013 that it had discontinued its original line of DS family devices to move onto the 3DS line .

 = The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power = 
 " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power " is an article , written in 1991 by U.S. investigative journalist Richard Behar , which is highly critical of Scientology . 
 It was first published by Time magazine on May 6 , 1991 , as an eight @-@ page cover story , and was later published in Reader 's Digest in October 1991 . Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in Forbes magazine . He stated that he was investigated by attorneys and private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology while researching the Time article , and that investigators contacted his friends and family as well . Behar 's article covers topics including L. Ron Hubbard and the development of Scientology , its controversies over the years and history of litigation , conflict with psychiatry and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , the suicide of Noah Lottick , its status as a religion , and its business dealings . 
 After the article 's publication , the Church of Scientology mounted a public relations campaign to address issues in the piece . It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks , and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he considered to be an objective bias by the article 's author . Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly , because of Scientology 's efforts against the drug Prozac . The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar , and sued Reader 's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article 's publication there . The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996 , and the Church of Scientology 's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001 . 
 Behar received awards in honor of his work on the article , including the Gerald Loeb Award , the Worth Bingham Prize , and the Conscience @-@ in @-@ Media Award . The article has had ramifications in the current treatment of Scientology in the media , with some publications theorizing that journalists are wary of the litigation that Time Warner went through . The article has been cited by Anderson Cooper on CNN , in a story on Panorama 's 2007 program " Scientology and Me " on the BBC , and has been used as a reference for background on the history of Scientology , in books from both the cult and new religious movement perspectives . 
 = = Research for the article = = 
 Before penning " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power " , Behar had written a 1986 article in Forbes magazine , " The Prophet and Profits of Scientology " , which reported on the Church of Scientology 's business dealings and L. Ron Hubbard 's financial success . Behar wrote that during research for " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power " , he and a Time contributing editor were themselves investigated by ten attorneys and six private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology . According to Behar , investigators contacted his friends and previous coworkers to ask them if he had a history of tax or drug problems , and obtained a copy of his personal credit report that had been obtained illegally from a national credit bureau . Behar conducted 150 interviews in the course of his research for the article . 
 Behar wrote that the motive of these operatives was to " threaten , harass and discredit him " . He later learned that the Church of Scientology had assigned its head private investigator to direct the Church 's investigation into Behar . Anderson Cooper 360 ° reported that Behar had been contacted by Church of Scientology attorneys numerous times while doing research on the article . The parents of Noah Lottick , a Scientologist who had committed suicide , cooperated with Time and Reader 's Digest . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The full title of the article is " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power : Ruined lives . Lost fortunes . Federal crimes . Scientology poses as a religion but is really a ruthless global scam — and aiming for the mainstream " . The article reported on the founding of the Church of Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard and controversies involving the Church and its affiliated business operations , as well as the suicide of a Scientologist . The article related the May 11 , 1990 , suicide of Dr. Edward Lottick 's son Noah Antrim Lottick . Lottick was a Russian studies student who had taken a series of Scientology courses ; he died after jumping from a hotel tenth floor window . The Church of Scientology and Lottick 's family have differing positions on the effect Scientology coursework had on him . While none of the parties assigned blame , they expressed misgivings about his death . Initially , his father had thought that Scientology was similar to Dale Carnegie 's self @-@ improvement techniques ; however , after his ordeal , the elder Lottick came to believe that the organization is a " school for psychopaths " . Mike Rinder , the head of the Church of Scientology 's Office of Special Affairs and a Church spokesman , stated " I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror ... I think Ed Lottick made his son 's life intolerable " . 
 The article outlined a brief history of Scientology , discussing Hubbard 's initial background as a science fiction writer , and cited a California judge who had deemed Hubbard a " pathological liar " . The Church of Scientology 's litigation history was described , in addition to its conflicts with the Internal Revenue Service , with countries regarding whether or not to accept it as a religion , and its position against psychiatry . Behar wrote of the high costs involved in participation in the Church of Scientology , what he referred to as " front groups and financial scams " , and harassment of critics . He estimated that the Church of Scientology paid US $ 20 million annually to over one hundred attorneys . Behar maintained that though the Church of Scientology portrays itself as a religion , it was actually a " hugely profitable global racket " which intimidated members and critics in a Mafia @-@ like manner . 
 Cynthia Kisser , then director of the Cult Awareness Network , was quoted : " Scientology is quite likely the most ruthless , the most classically terroristic , the most litigious and the most lucrative cult the country has ever seen . No cult extracts more money from its members " .

 The Church of Scientology responded to the publication of " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power " by taking out color full @-@ page ads in USA Today in May and June 1991 , on every weekday for twelve weeks , denouncing the Time magazine cover article . Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled " Facts vs. Fiction , A Correction of <unk> Contained in the May 6 , 1991 , Issues of Time Magazine " , and " The Story That Time Couldn 't Tell " . Prior to the advertising campaign , Scientologists distributed 88 @-@ page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar 's article . The " Fact vs. Fiction " piece was a 1 ⁄ 4 @-@ inch @-@ thick ( 0 @.@ 64 cm ) booklet , which criticized Behar 's article and asserted " Behar 's article omits the information on the dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists ... which have been acknowledged by community officials " . One of the advertisements in USA Today accused Time of promoting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany , and featured a 1936 issue of Time which had Hitler 's picture on the front cover . The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning Time 's " horrible history of supporting fascism " , and said that the article was written because Time had been pressured by " vested interests " . When asked by the St. Petersburg Times whether this was the case , Time Executive Editor Richard Duncan responded " Good Lord , no " . Heber Jentzsch , at the time president of Church of Scientology International , issued a four @-@ page news release which stated " Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of getting its message and its side of the story out to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it " . 
 After the advertising run critiquing Time magazine in USA Today had completed , the Church of Scientology mounted a $ 3 million public relations campaign about Scientology in USA Today , in June 1991 . The Church of Scientology placed a 48 @-@ page advertising supplement in 1 @.@ 8 million copies of USA Today . In a statement to the St. Petersburg Times , Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained " What we are trying to do is put the actual facts of Dianetics and Scientology out there " . 
 In response to the Church of Scientology 's claims of inaccuracies in the article , a lawyer for Time responded " We 've reviewed all of their allegations , and find nothing wrong with the Time story . " In June 1991 , Newsweek reported that staffers for Time said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a paralegal for Time , who asked them if they had signed a confidentiality form about the article . Time editors sent staffers a computer memo , warning them about calls related to the article , and staffers told Newsweek that " sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time " . A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims " scurrilous " . 
 On February 14 , 1992 , Scientology leader David Miscavige gave Ted Koppel his first interview on Scientology on the ABC News program Nightline . The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar 's 1991 article . Behar appeared on the program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology , stating that the organization 's " ulterior motive " is really to get people to take high @-@ priced audit counseling . Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records . Later in the program , Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology 's response to the Time magazine article , particularly the $ 3 million the church spent advertising in USA Today . Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the Time article , and the rest of the twelve @-@ week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology . Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the Time article , and Miscavige called Behar " a hater " . Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the Time piece , and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped . When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this , Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article , and Behar had told them to " kidnap Scientologists out " . Koppel pressed further , noting that this was a serious charge to make , and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate , why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping . Miscavige said Koppel was " missing the issue " , and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece . 
 Miscavige alleged on Nightline that the article itself was published as a result of a request by Eli Lilly and Company , because of " the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac " . When Koppel asked Miscavige if he had affidavits or evidence to this effect , Miscavige responded " You think they 'd admit it ? " Miscavige stated that " Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750 @,@ 000 copies of Time magazine before it came out " , and that his attempts to investigate the matter with Eli Lilly and associated advertising companies were not successful .

The Church alleged false and defamatory statements were made concerning the Church of Scientology International in the Time article . More specifically , the Church of Scientology 's court statements claimed that Behar had been refining an anti @-@ Scientology focus since his 1986 article in Forbes , which included gathering negative materials about Scientology , and " never accepting anything a Scientologist said and uniformly ignoring anything positive he learned about the Church " . In its initial complaint filing , the Church quoted portions of the Behar article that it alleged were false and defamatory , including the quote from Cynthia Kisser , and Behar 's own assertion that Scientology was a " global racket " that intimidated individuals in a " Mafia @-@ like manner " . 
 Noah Lottick 's parents submitted affidavits in the case , in which they " affirmed the accuracy of each statement in the article " ; Edward Lottick " concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations , and that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral " of their son . During the litigation , the Church of Scientology attempted to subpoena Behar in a separate ongoing lawsuit with the Internal Revenue Service , and accused a federal magistrate of leaking information to him . Behar was questioned for over 190 hours during 30 days of depositions with Scientology attorneys in the libel case . One question was about Behar 's life in his parents ' home while he was still inside the womb . St. Petersburg Times explained that this question was prompted by Scientology teachings that certain problems come from prenatal memories . Behar told the St. Petersburg Times he " felt it was extremely excessive " . In a countersuit , Behar brought up the issues of Church of Scientology private investigators and what he viewed as harassment . By July 1996 , all counts of the libel suit had been dismissed . In the course of the litigation through 1996 , Time Warner had spent $ 7 @.@ 3 million in legal defense costs . The Church of Scientology also sued several individuals quoted in the Time article . 
 The Church of Scientology sued Reader 's Digest in Switzerland , France , Italy , the Netherlands , and Germany for publishing a condensed version of the Time story . The only court to provide a temporary injunction was in Lausanne , Switzerland . In France , Italy , and the Netherlands , the courts either dismissed the Church of Scientology 's motions , or set injunction hearings far beyond the date of actual publication . The company defied the injunction and mailed copies of the article , " Scientology : A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream " , to their 326 @,@ 000 Swiss subscribers . Worldwide editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Reader 's Digest , Kenneth Tomlinson , told The New York Times that " a publisher cannot accept a court prohibiting distribution of a serious journalistic piece . ... The court order violates freedom of speech and freedom of the press " . The Church of Scientology subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the Digest in Lausanne , and Mike Rinder stated it was in blatant violation of the law . By defying the Swiss court ban , the Reader 's Digest risked a fine of about $ 3 @,@ 400 , as well as a potential three months ' jail time for the Swiss Digest editor @-@ in @-@ chief . A hearing on the injunction was set for November 11 , 1991 , and the injunction was later lifted by the Swiss court . 
 In January 2001 , a United States federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of the Church of Scientology International 's case against Time Warner . In its opinion , the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power " with an actual intent of malice , a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups . On October 1 , 2001 , the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church 's libel case Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc . , 00 @-@ 1683 . Time Warner said it refused to be " intimidated by the church 's apparently limitless legal resources . " In arguments presented to the Supreme Court , the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had " committed improper acts " in the past , but also claimed that : " allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted , the result of the misunderstanding , suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion " . Of the rulings for Time Warner , the Church of Scientology complained that they " provide a safe harbor for biased journalism " . Behar commented on the Church of Scientology 's legal defeat , and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect : " It 's a tremendous defeat for Scientology ... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass , not to win , so from that perspective they hurt us all . They 've had a real chilling effect on journalism , both before and after my piece " . 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 As a result of writing the piece , Behar was presented with the 1992 Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished business and financial journalism , the Worth Bingham Prize , the Conscience @-@ in @-@ Media Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors , awarded to " those who have demonstrated singular commitment to the highest principles of journalism at notable personal cost or sacrifice , " and the Cult Awareness Network 's Leo J. Ryan Award , in honor of Congressman Leo J. Ryan . Paulette Cooper was also awarded the 1992 Conscience @-@ in @-@ Media Award by the American Society of Journalists and Authors , for her book The Scandal of Scientology . This was the only time in the history of the American Society of Journalists and Authors that the award was presented to more than one journalist in the same year . 
 In a February 1992 issue of Time , editor Elizabeth Valk congratulated Behar on his Conscience @-@ in @-@ Media Award , stating " Needless to say , we are delighted and proud " . Valk noted that the honor had only been awarded seven times in the previous seventeen years of its existence . Managing editor Henry Muller also congratulated Behar in an April 1992 issue of Time .

 Several authors have commented on the article and used it as a reference for background on Scientology . Not all analysis of the article has been positive . David Healy 's book criticizing the pharmaceutical industry , Let Them Eat Prozac , was critical : " The Time article was way over the top . Even Saddam Hussein was portrayed less badly . " Healy addressed the article 's claim that lawsuits were one of the Church 's key tactics against enemies . He noted that the Citizens Commission on Human Rights ( CCHR ) , a Church of Scientology affiliated group discussed in the article , had filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration inquiring what it was going to do about Prozac . Healy dismissed the notion that CCHR engaged in " orchestrated campaigns " , writing that very few of the 50 lawsuits filed against Prozac were related to the Church of Scientology . Mark Silk criticized Behar 's article in his book <unk> Media : Making News of Religion in America . Silk classified the work among what he referred to as the " false @-@ prophecy topos " , and characterized Behar 's account of Noah Lottick 's suicide as an " atrocity tale " . 
 Insane Therapy noted that Scientology " achieved more notoriety ... with the publication of the journalist Richard Behar 's highly critical article " . Larson 's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality described the cover design of the article as it appeared in Time , writing that it " shouted " the headline from the magazine cover . In a 2005 piece , Salon.com magazine noted that for those interested in the Church of Scientology , the Time article still remains a " milestone in news coverage " , and that those who back the Church believe it was " an outrageously biased account " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Church of Scientology 's use of private investigators was cited in a 1998 article in the Boston Herald , and compared to Behar 's experiences when researching " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power " . After the paper ran a five @-@ part series of critical articles in 1998 , Church of Scientology President Heber Jentzsch confirmed that a private investigative firm was hired to look into the personal life of Joseph <unk> , the reporter who wrote the articles . In a later piece titled " Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter — Investigation follows pattern of harassment " this investigation was likened to Behar 's assertions of harassment , as well as other reporters ' experiences from 1974 , 1988 , and 1997 . 
 Because of the history of conflict between Reader 's Digest and Scientology , the writer of a 2005 cover story on Tom Cruise agreed to certain demands , including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer 's profile of Cruise , submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers , and sending the writer of the article to a one @-@ day Church immersion course . Also in 2005 , an article in Salon questioned whether the tactics of the Church 's litigation and private investigations of Time Warner and other media sources had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press . A 2005 article in The Sunday Times cited the article , and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology 's lawsuit against Time Warner " served to warn off other potential investigations " , and that " The chill evidently lingers still " . 
 " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power " continues to be used today by journalists in the media , as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology . In April 2007 , CNN anchor Anderson Cooper interviewed former Office of Special Affairs director Mike Rinder , in a live piece on Anderson Cooper 360 ° titled " Inside Scientology " . The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a BBC Panorama investigative program , " Scientology and Me " . In the interview , Anderson Cooper quoted directly from " The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power " article , when asking Rinder about the history of Operation Snow White , and if those tactics were currently used by the Church . Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities , and that the incident was " ancient history " . Cooper then again referenced the Time magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article . Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against Time Warner , and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology 's appeals against Time Warner were eventually rejected . 
 The article has been cited as a reference used for background on Scientology in books which take a critical look at cults such as Larson 's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality and Insane Therapy : Portrait of a Psychotherapy Cult , those that analyze new religious movements including Understanding New Religious Movements and The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements , and in a work that includes researchers from both schools of thought , Misunderstanding Cults : Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field . 
 = Germanium = 
 Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32 . It is a lustrous , hard , grayish @-@ white metalloid in the carbon group , chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon . Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon . Like silicon , germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature . Unlike silicon , it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free ( elemental ) state . 
 Because it seldom appears in high concentration , germanium was discovered comparatively late in the history of chemistry . Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth 's crust . In 1869 , Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table , and called the element ekasilicon . Nearly two decades later , in 1886 , Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur , in a rare mineral called argyrodite . Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance , the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev 's predictions for a relative of silicon . Winkler named the element after his country , Germany . Today , germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite ( the primary ore of zinc ) , though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver , lead , and copper ores . 
 Germanium " metal " ( isolated germanium ) is used as a semiconductor in transistors and various other electronic devices . Historically , the first decade of semiconductor electronics was based entirely on germanium . Today , the amount of germanium produced for semiconductor electronics is one fiftieth the amount of ultra @-@ high purity silicon produced for the same . Presently , the major end uses are fibre @-@ optic systems , infrared optics , solar cell applications , and light @-@ emitting diodes ( LEDs ) . Germanium compounds are also used for polymerization catalysts and have most recently found use in the production of nanowires . This element forms a large number of organometallic compounds , such as tetraethylgermane , useful in organometallic chemistry . 
 Germanium is not thought to be an essential element for any living organism . Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals , though none have yet proven successful . Similar to silicon and aluminum , natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity . However , synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic , and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins . 
 = = History = = 
 In his report on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements in 1869 , the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev predicted the existence of several unknown chemical elements , including one that would fill a gap in the carbon family in his Periodic Table of the Elements , located between silicon and tin . Because of its position in his Periodic Table , Mendeleev called it ekasilicon ( Es ) , and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72 @.@ 0 . 
 In mid @-@ 1885 , at a mine near Freiberg , Saxony , a new mineral was discovered and named argyrodite because of the high silver content . The chemist Clemens Winkler analyzed this new mineral , which proved to be a combination of silver , sulfur , and a new element . Winkler was able to isolate the new element in 1886 and found it similar to antimony . Before Winkler published his results on the new element , he decided that he would name his element neptunium , since the recent discovery of planet Neptune in 1846 had been preceded by mathematical predictions of its existence . However , the name " neptunium " had already been given to another proposed chemical element ( though not the element that today bears the name neptunium , which was discovered in 1940 ) . So instead , Winkler named the new element germanium ( from the Latin word , Germania , for Germany ) in honor of his homeland . <unk> proved empirically to be <unk> . 
 Because this new element showed some similarities with the elements arsenic and antimony , its proper place in the periodic table was under consideration , but its similarities with Dmitri Mendeleev 's predicted element " ekasilicon " confirmed that place on the periodic table . With further material from 500 kg of ore from the mines in Saxony , Winkler confirmed the chemical properties of the new element in 1887 . He also determined an atomic weight of 72 @.@ 32 by analyzing pure germanium tetrachloride ( <unk> 
 4 ) , while Lecoq de Boisbaudran deduced 72 @.@ 3 by a comparison of the lines in the spark spectrum of the element . 
 Winkler was able to prepare several new compounds of germanium , including fluorides , chlorides , sulfides , dioxide , and tetraethylgermane ( Ge ( <unk> ) 4 ) , the first <unk> . The physical data from those compounds — which corresponded well with Mendeleev 's predictions — made the discovery an important confirmation of Mendeleev 's idea of element periodicity . Here is a comparison between the prediction and Winkler 's data : 
 Until the late 1930s , germanium was thought to be a poorly conducting metal . Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized . During World War II , small amounts of germanium were used in some special electronic devices , mostly diodes . The first major use was the point @-@ contact Schottky diodes for radar pulse detection during the War . The first silicon @-@ germanium alloys were obtained in 1955 . Before 1945 , only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year , but by the end of the 1950s , the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons . 
 The development of the germanium transistor in 1948 opened the door to countless applications of solid state electronics . From 1950 through the early 1970s , this area provided an increasing market for germanium , but then high @-@ purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors , diodes , and rectifiers . For example , the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors . Silicon has superior electrical properties , but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved in the early years of semiconductor electronics . 
 Meanwhile , the demand for germanium for fiber optic communication networks , infrared night vision systems , and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically . These end uses represented 85 % of worldwide germanium consumption in 2000 . The US government even designated germanium as a strategic and critical material , calling for a 146 ton ( 132 t ) supply in the national defense stockpile in 1987 . 
 Germanium differs from silicon in that the supply is limited by the availability of exploitable sources , while the supply of silicon is limited only by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and quartz . While silicon could be bought in 1998 for less than $ 10 per kg , the price of germanium was almost $ 800 per kg . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Under standard conditions , germanium is a brittle , silvery @-@ white , semi @-@ metallic element . This form constitutes an allotrope known as α @-@ germanium , which has a metallic luster and a diamond cubic crystal structure , the same as diamond . At pressures above 120 kbar , it becomes the allotrope β @-@ germanium with the same structure as β @-@ tin . Like silicon , gallium , bismuth , antimony , and water , germanium is one of the few substances that expands as it solidifies ( i.e. freezes ) from the molten state . 
 Germanium is a semiconductor . Zone refining techniques have led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 1010 , making it one of the purest materials ever obtained . The first metallic material discovered ( in 2005 ) to become a superconductor in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic field was an alloy of germanium , uranium , and rhodium . 
 Pure germanium spontaneously extrudes very long screw dislocations , and this is one of the primary reasons for the failure of older diodes and transistors made from germanium ; depending on what they eventually touch , they may lead to an electrical short . 
 = = = Chemistry = = = 
 Elemental germanium oxidizes slowly to GeO2 at 250 ° C. Germanium is insoluble in dilute acids and alkalis but dissolves slowly in hot concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids and reacts violently with molten alkalis to produce germanates ( [ GeO 
 3 ] 2 − ) . Germanium occurs mostly in the oxidation state + 4 although many + 2 compounds are known . Other oxidation states are rare : + 3 is found in compounds such as <unk> , and + 3 and + 1 are found on the surface of oxides , or negative oxidation states in <unk> , such as − 4 in <unk> 
 4 . Germanium cluster anions ( Zintl ions ) such as <unk> − , <unk> − , <unk> − , [ ( <unk> ) 2 ] 6 − have been prepared by the extraction from alloys containing alkali metals and germanium in liquid ammonia in the presence of ethylenediamine or a <unk> . The oxidation states of the element in these ions are not integers — similar to the ozonides O3 − . 
 Two oxides of germanium are known : germanium dioxide ( GeO 
 2 , <unk> ) and germanium monoxide , ( GeO ) . The dioxide , GeO2 can be obtained by roasting germanium disulfide ( GeS 
 2 ) , and is a white powder that is only slightly soluble in water but reacts with alkalis to form germanates . The monoxide , <unk> oxide , can be obtained by the high temperature reaction of GeO2 with Ge metal . The dioxide ( and the related oxides and germanates ) exhibits the unusual property of having a high refractive index for visible light , but transparency to infrared light . Bismuth germanate , <unk> , ( BGO ) is used as a scintillator . 
 Binary compounds with other chalcogens are also known , such as the disulfide ( GeS 
 2 ) , <unk> ( <unk> 
 2 ) , and the monosulfide ( GeS ) , selenide ( <unk> ) , and telluride ( <unk> ) . <unk> forms as a white precipitate when hydrogen sulfide is passed through strongly acid solutions containing Ge ( IV ) . The disulfide is appreciably soluble in water and in solutions of caustic alkalis or alkaline sulfides . Nevertheless , it is not soluble in acidic water , which allowed Winkler to discover the element . By heating the disulfide in a current of hydrogen , the monosulfide ( GeS ) is formed , which sublimes in thin plates of a dark color and metallic luster , and is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalis . Upon melting with alkaline carbonates and sulfur , germanium compounds form salts known as <unk> . 
 Four tetrahalides are known . Under normal conditions <unk> is a solid , <unk> a gas and the others volatile liquids . For example , germanium tetrachloride , GeCl4 , is obtained as a colorless fuming liquid boiling at 83 @.@ 1 ° C by heating the metal with chlorine . All the tetrahalides are readily hydrolyzed to hydrated germanium dioxide . GeCl4 is used in the production of organogermanium compounds . All four dihalides are known and in contrast to the tetrahalides are polymeric solids . Additionally <unk> and some higher compounds of formula <unk> + 2 are known . The unusual compound <unk> has been prepared that contains the <unk> unit with a <unk> structure . 
 <unk> ( GeH4 ) is a compound similar in structure to methane . <unk> — compounds that are similar to alkanes — with formula <unk> + 2 containing up to five germanium atoms are known . The <unk> are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues . GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline <unk> which contain the <unk> − anion . The germanium <unk> with one , two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids . 
 The first organogermanium compound was synthesized by Winkler in 1887 ; the reaction of germanium tetrachloride with <unk> yielded tetraethylgermane ( Ge ( C 
 2H 
 5 ) 
 4 ) . <unk> of the type <unk> ( where R is an alkyl ) such as <unk> ( Ge ( CH 
 3 ) 
 4 ) and tetraethylgermane are accessed through the cheapest available germanium precursor germanium tetrachloride and alkyl nucleophiles . Organic germanium hydrides such as <unk> ( ( CH 
 3 ) 
 <unk> 
 <unk> 
 3 ) were found to be less hazardous and may be used as a liquid substitute for toxic germane gas in semiconductor applications . Many germanium reactive intermediates are known : <unk> free radicals , <unk> ( similar to carbenes ) , and <unk> ( similar to <unk> ) . The organogermanium compound 2 @-@ <unk> was first reported in the 1970s , and for a while was used as a dietary supplement and thought to possibly have anti @-@ tumor qualities . 
 Using a ligand called <unk> ( 1 @,@ 1 @,@ 3 @,@ 3 @,@ 5 @,@ 5 @,@ 7 @,@ 7 @-@ <unk> @-@ s @-@ <unk> @-@ 4 @-@ yl ) germanium is able to form a double bond with oxygen ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Germanium occurs in 5 natural isotopes : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and 76Ge . Of these , 76Ge is very slightly radioactive , decaying by double beta decay with a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 78 × 1021 years . <unk> is the most common isotope , having a natural abundance of approximately 36 % . 76Ge is the least common with a natural abundance of approximately 7 % . When bombarded with alpha particles , the isotope <unk> will generate stable <unk> , releasing high energy electrons in the process . Because of this , it is used in combination with radon for nuclear batteries . 
 At least 27 radioisotopes have also been synthesized , ranging in atomic mass from 58 to 89 . The most stable of these is <unk> , decaying by electron capture with a half @-@ life of 270 @.@ 95 days . The least stable is <unk> , with a half @-@ life of 30 ms . While most of germanium 's radioisotopes decay by beta decay , <unk> and <unk> decay by β + delayed proton emission . <unk> through <unk> isotopes also exhibit minor β − delayed neutron emission decay paths . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 Germanium is created by stellar nucleosynthesis , mostly by the s @-@ process in asymptotic giant branch stars . The s @-@ process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars . Germanium has been detected in some of the most distant stars and in the atmosphere of Jupiter . 
 Germanium 's abundance in the Earth 's crust is approximately 1 @.@ 6 ppm . Only a few minerals like argyrodite , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> contain appreciable amounts of germanium , and none in mineable deposits . Some zinc @-@ copper @-@ lead ore bodies contain enough germanium to justify extraction from the final ore concentrate . An unusual natural enrichment process causes a high content of germanium in some coal seams , discovered by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt during a broad survey for germanium deposits . The highest concentration ever found was in Hartley coal ash with as much as 1 @.@ 6 % germanium . The coal deposits near <unk> , Inner Mongolia , contain an estimated 1600 tonnes of germanium . 
 = = Production = = 
 About 118 tonnes of germanium was produced in 2011 worldwide , mostly in China ( 80 t ) , Russia ( 5 t ) and United States ( 3 t ) . Germanium is recovered as a by @-@ product from sphalerite zinc ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0 @.@ 3 % , especially from low @-@ temperature sediment @-@ hosted , massive Zn – Pb – Cu ( – Ba ) deposits and carbonate @-@ hosted Zn – Pb deposits . A recent study found that at least 10 @,@ 000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves , particularly those hosted by Mississippi @-@ Valley type deposits , while at least 112 @,@ 000 t will be found in coal reserves . In 2007 35 % of the demand was met by recycled germanium . 
 While it is produced mainly from sphalerite , it is also found in silver , lead , and copper ores . Another source of germanium is fly ash of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain germanium . Russia and China used this as a source for germanium . Russia 's deposits are located in the far east of Sakhalin Island , and northeast of Vladivostok . The deposits in China are located mainly in the lignite mines near <unk> , Yunnan ; coal is also mined near <unk> , Inner Mongolia . 
 The ore concentrates are mostly sulfidic ; they are converted to the oxides by heating under air in a process known as roasting : 
 <unk> + 3 O2 → GeO2 + 2 SO2 
 Some of the germanium is left in the dust produced , while the rest is converted to germanates , which are then leached ( together with zinc ) from the cinder by sulfuric acid . After neutralization , only the zinc stays in solution while germanium and other metals precipitate . After removing some of the zinc in the precipitate by the Waelz process , the residing Waelz oxide is leached a second time . The dioxide is obtained as precipitate and converted with chlorine gas or hydrochloric acid to germanium tetrachloride , which has a low boiling point and can be isolated by distillation : 
 GeO2 + 4 HCl → GeCl4 + 2 H2O 
 GeO2 + 2 Cl2 → GeCl4 + O2 
 Germanium tetrachloride is either hydrolyzed to the oxide ( GeO2 ) or purified by fractional distillation and then hydrolyzed . The highly pure GeO2 is now suitable for the production of germanium glass . It is reduced to the element by reacting it with hydrogen , producing germanium suitable for infrared optics and semiconductor production : 
 GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O 
 The germanium for steel production and other industrial processes is normally reduced using carbon : 
 GeO2 + C → Ge + CO2

 The major end uses for germanium in 2007 , worldwide , were estimated to be : 35 % for fiber @-@ optics , 30 % infrared optics , 15 % polymerization catalysts , and 15 % electronics and solar electric applications . The remaining 5 % went into such uses as phosphors , metallurgy , and chemotherapy .

 The notable properties of <unk> ( GeO2 ) are its high index of refraction and its low optical dispersion . These make it especially useful for wide @-@ angle camera lenses , microscopy , and the core part of optical fibers . It has replaced <unk> as the dopant for silica fiber , eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle . At the end of 2002 , the fiber optics industry consumed 60 % of the annual germanium use in the United States , but this is less than 10 % of worldwide consumption . GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties , such as that used in rewritable DVDs . 
 Because germanium is transparent in the infrared wavelengths , it is an important infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows . It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14 micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot @-@ spot detection in military , mobile night vision , and fire fighting applications . It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors . It has a very high refractive index ( 4 @.@ 0 ) and must be coated with anti @-@ reflection agents . Particularly , a very hard special <unk> coating of diamond @-@ like carbon ( DLC ) , refractive index 2 @.@ 0 , is a good match and produces a diamond @-@ hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse .

 Silicon @-@ germanium alloys are rapidly becoming an important semiconductor material for high @-@ speed integrated circuits .

Silicon @-@ germanium is beginning to replace gallium arsenide ( GaAs ) in wireless communications devices . The <unk> chips , with high @-@ speed properties , can be made with low @-@ cost , well @-@ established production techniques of the silicon chip industry . 
 Solar panels are a major use of germanium . Germanium is the substrate of the wafers for high @-@ efficiency <unk> photovoltaic cells for space applications . High @-@ brightness LEDs , used for automobile headlights and to backlight LCD screens , are an important application . 
 Because germanium and gallium arsenide have very similar lattice constants , germanium substrates can be used to make gallium arsenide solar cells . The Mars Exploration Rovers and several satellites use triple junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells . 
 Germanium @-@ on @-@ insulator substrates are seen as a potential replacement for silicon on miniaturized chips . Other uses in electronics include phosphors in fluorescent lamps and solid @-@ state light @-@ emitting diodes ( LEDs ) . Germanium transistors are still used in some effects pedals by musicians who wish to reproduce the distinctive tonal character of the " fuzz " <unk> from the early rock and roll era , most notably the Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face .

 Germanium dioxide is also used in catalysts for polymerization in the production of polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) . The high brilliance of this polyester is especially favored for PET bottles marketed in Japan . In the United States , germanium is not used for polymerization catalysts . 
 Due to the similarity between silica ( SiO2 ) and germanium dioxide ( GeO2 ) , the silica stationary phase in some gas chromatography columns can be replaced by GeO2 . 
 In recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys . In sterling silver alloys , for instance , it reduces <unk> , increases tarnish resistance , and improves precipitation hardening . A tarnish @-@ proof silver alloy trademarked <unk> contains 1 @.@ 2 % germanium . 
 Semiconductor detectors made of single crystal high @-@ purity germanium can precisely identify radiation sources — for example in airport security . Germanium is useful for <unk> for <unk> used in single crystal neutron scattering and synchrotron X @-@ ray diffraction . The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy X @-@ ray applications . Crystals of high purity germanium are used in detectors for gamma spectroscopy and the search for dark matter . Germanium crystals are also used in X @-@ ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus , chlorine and sulfur . 
 = = = Germanium and health = = = 
 Germanium is not considered essential to the health of plants or animals . Germanium in the environment has little or no health impact . This is primarily because it usually occurs only as a trace element in ores and carbonaceous materials , and the various industrial and electronic applications involve very small quantities that are not likely to be ingested . For similar reasons , end @-@ use germanium has little impact on the environment as a biohazard . Some reactive intermediate compounds of germanium are poisonous ( see precautions , below ) . 
 Germanium supplements , made from both organic and inorganic germanium , have been marketed as an alternative medicine capable of treating leukemia and lung cancer . There is , however , no medical evidence of benefit ; some evidence suggests that such supplements are actively harmful . 
 Some germanium compounds have been administered by alternative medical practitioners as non @-@ FDA @-@ allowed injectable solutions . Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first , notably the citrate @-@ lactate salt , resulted in some cases of renal dysfunction , hepatic steatosis , and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them over a long term . Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals , several of whom died , were several orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels . A more recent organic form , beta @-@ <unk> sesquioxide ( <unk> ) , has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects . 
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration research has concluded that inorganic germanium , when used as a nutritional supplement , " presents potential human health hazard " . 
 Certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to mammals , but have toxic effects against certain bacteria .

 = Djibouti francolin = 
 The Djibouti francolin ( <unk> ochropectus ) is one of over forty species of francolins , a group of birds in the Phasianidae family . It is critically endangered and found only in Djibouti , a nation in the Horn of Africa . This species is grayish @-@ brown overall with white stripes and streaks on its underparts which become finer towards the upperparts . It has black markings on the head and a gray crown and has a short tail . It is 35 cm ( 1 @.@ 15 ft ) in length , and weighs 940 g ( 33 oz ) . 
 Its natural habitat is high altitude subtropical or tropical dry forests composed primarily of African juniper . However , the juniper forests preferred by the francolin are dying , so it may be found in other habitats , such as box @-@ tree forests . This bird is only known from two locations in Djibouti , one of which is largely unsurveyed . It can be found in small groups and is extremely shy . It is known to feed on berries , seeds , and termites , and it breeds between December and February . It is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90 % population decline in twenty years . The degrading of its juniper habitat through man @-@ made disturbances , such as overgrazing , is a major threat to the francolin 's survival . Ongoing conservation work includes the restoration of some juniper forest , and surveys to obtain accurate population counts and to raise awareness . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Birds in the Phasianidae family , such as the Djibouti francolin , are Old World ground @-@ dwelling <unk> , many of which are found in forests . <unk> are terrestrial birds of the that feed on insects , vegetable matter , and seeds . Most species have a hooked upper beak , tails with fourteen feathers , and in many of them the male has tarsal spurs . Of the 41 extant species , 36 are found solely in Africa . 
 The Djibouti francolin was originally collected on February 22 , 1952 by Captain <unk> , the military commander of Tadjoura in the Forêt du Day . It was then described by French ornithologists Jean Dorst and Christian Jouanin later that year as Francolinus ochropectus in L 'Oiseau et la Revue française d <unk> . Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> , which means " ochre " , and the Latin pectus , meaning " breast " . Other authors have since proposed moving the species to other genera , including <unk> and <unk> , the latter a move proposed in a recent attempt to reorganize Francolinus , and one which would include 23 other francolins . Though some still maintain all these in Francolinus , the split into multiple genera is becoming more widespread . 
 The distinctness of this species has been described as weak by some authors , although its status as a full species has been maintained . It forms a superspecies with Jackson 's francolin , handsome francolin , chestnut @-@ naped francolin , and <unk> 's francolin ; it is particularly closely related to the latter two species and is intermediate to them in both location and morphological features . The Djibouti francolin has no recognized subspecies . 
 This species has formerly been named as the ochre @-@ breasted francolin , the Tadjoura francolin , and the pale @-@ bellied francolin . To the native people of Djibouti , it is known as the <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 This francolin is a large , rotund bird of approximately 35 cm ( 1 @.@ 15 ft ) in length and 940 g ( 33 oz ) in weight . It is grayish @-@ brown overall with white stripes and streaks on its underparts which become finer toward the head . The bird is darker on its back than on its underside . The nape has a hint of rufous , while the top of the head is gray . The forehead , lore , and eye stripe form a black mask , and the chin and throat are whitish . The eyes are brown . The feathers on the body and neck have a gold or straw @-@ colored center that is bordered with dark brown and edged in white . The tail is short . The bill is black with some yellow on the lower mandible , and the Djibouti francolin 's legs are a greenish @-@ yellow . 
 The sexes are similar , although the male averages slightly larger than the female and has two prominent spurs on the legs , whereas the female is virtually <unk> . The female also has more rufous in its tail . The juvenile resembles the adults , but is duller , with buff barring , rather than streaking , on the underparts . 
 The call of this species is a rattling erk erk erk @-@ <unk> that descends into a chuckling gurgle . Feeding birds may give a low conversational clucking . 
 No other francolin share this bird 's restricted range ( although the yellow @-@ necked francolin occurs elsewhere in Djibouti ) so it is unlikely to be confused with any other species . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Djibouti francolin is endemic to Djibouti , a nation in eastern Africa , and is known from only two locations . One is the Forêt du Day in the Goda Mountains , approximately 25 km ( 16 mi ) north of the Gulf of Tadjoura . This site is only 15 km2 ( 3 @,@ 700 acres ) and is undergoing habitat changes . The other site is located in the Mabla Mountains , which are 80 km ( 50 mi ) northeast of the Forêt du Day and remain unsurveyed . This site has been exposed to more human disturbance than the Forêt du Day , and is therefore considered less viable . Combined , the total estimated range of this bird is 58 km2 ( 14 @,@ 000 acres ) . 
 This francolin prefers dense African juniper woodland with a closed canopy between 700 and 1 @,@ 780 m ( 2 @,@ 300 and 5 @,@ 840 ft ) in elevation , and preferably on a plateau . Mixed in with this forest habitat are box @-@ trees ( Buxus hildebrandtii ) and African olives ( Olea europaea africana ) . This francolin has been found in secondary woodland , box @-@ tree woodlands ( Buxus hildebrandtii ) , and acacia woodland ( Acacia <unk> ) . It is also known to venture into more open woodland and wadis following the breeding season . Much of the bird 's African juniper forest habitat has been damaged or destroyed due to human usage ; the ability of this dead woodland to support the Djibouti francolin remains unknown , although some juveniles have been seen in it . It is believed that the birds are reacting to the destruction of their juniper habitat by trying to find habitat as close to it as possible . It has been noted that due to the decline of the juniper , Buxus hildebrandtii is now the dominant tree in areas most frequently inhabited by the francolin . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 This species lives in small groups and is very shy , often remaining in dense vegetation to avoid detection , and therefore its ecology is very little studied . It is believed that the francolin may migrate from lower altitudes to higher altitudes and juniper forest in the warmer months . Its main predator is the common genet . The bird is most active and most likely to call between 6 am and 9 am . After this it may spend most of the day perched motionless in a tree up to 4 m ( 13 ft ) above the ground . It eats berries , seeds , termites and figs . It scratches the ground to collect seeds and , when it finds an area disturbed by warthogs , also scratches the ground for termites . It is monogamous and breeds between December and February . 
 Only one nest has been recorded ; this was located on a mountain ledge , and was a shallow grass @-@ lined depression in the earth . These birds roost in nearby trees at heights of 5 to 8 m ( 16 to 26 ft ) . It is probably monogamous , and local people say that the clutch is typically 7 – 9 eggs , but this is unconfirmed . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 This species is considered critically endangered by the IUCN because it underwent a 90 % population decrease over twenty years . In 1977 , there were an estimated 5600 birds in Forêt du Day , which was the only known location for the species at the time . By 1986 , this number had dropped to 1500 individuals . The species was discovered at its second site in the Mabla Mountains in 1986 . While the population in the Mabla Mountains has yet to be surveyed , numbers in the Forêt du Day continued to drop , with 500 – 1000 Djibouti francolins recorded in 1998 and only 115 – 135 in 2004 . The total world population in 2006 was estimated to be between 612 and 723 adults . 
 This species is threatened because of habitat destruction . At the Forêt du Day site , 95 % of its preferred juniper habitat is dead or dying and is unable to support this bird . While an overarching reason behind this destruction remains unknown , overgrazing by cattle , camels , and goats is believed to have been a significant contributor , along with rain , climate change , and a fungal disease . Hunting , the gathering of firewood , egg collecting , and general human disturbance are also believed to be threats . At the Mabla Mountains site , the habitat is also being degraded by the collection of firewood and overgrazing . 
 In 1937 , part of the Forêt du Day site was set aside as Day Forest National Park ; this designation is no longer valid . There have been studies of the area and the related environmental and economic issues involved ; very few of the suggestions made by these surveys have been implemented , partially due to the unrest in Djibouti since the early 1990s . In May 2008 , 1 @,@ 000 km2 ( 250 @,@ 000 acres ) of forest near the village of Day were set aside for a tree nursery in an attempt to restore some of the francolin 's damaged habitat . Surveys are under way to determine population sizes and current range , including plans to survey the largely unknown site in the Mabla Mountains and potentially suitable areas in between the two known sites . A promotional campaign in local schools took place in 2008 to raise awareness for the species . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 The majority of native people in areas surrounding the francolin 's range believe that the species is important , either because of its meat , which may be eaten by the Muslims who comprise the predominant religious group of the region , or because it is part of the natural heritage of the region . While the species is rarely eaten today due to its rarity , decades ago the species was so common that it was easily captured when it approached nearby villages . 
 The Djibouti francolin has been featured on two stamps : one in 1989 from Djibouti , and another from the French Territory of the <unk> and the <unk> , which was what Djibouti was known as under French rule , in 1972 .

 = Cactus = 
 A cactus ( plural : cacti , cactuses , or cactus ) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae , a family comprising ca 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order <unk> . The word " cactus " derives , through Latin , from the Ancient Greek κάκτος , <unk> , a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain . Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes . Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought . Many live in extremely dry environments , even being found in the Atacama Desert , one of the driest places on earth . Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water . Almost all cacti are succulents , meaning they have thickened , fleshy parts adapted to store water . Unlike many other succulents , the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place . Most species of cacti have lost true leaves , retaining only spines , which are highly modified leaves . As well as defending against herbivores , spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade . In the absence of leaves , enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis . Cacti are native to the Americas , ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north — except for Rhipsalis baccifera , which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka . 
 Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles , a kind of highly reduced branch . Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti . As well as spines , areoles give rise to flowers , which are usually tubular and <unk> . Many cacti have short growing seasons and long <unk> , and are able to react quickly to any rainfall , helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorb any water reaching the ground surface . Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted , which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain , followed by long drought periods . Like other succulent plants , most cacti employ a special mechanism called " crassulacean acid metabolism " ( CAM ) as part of photosynthesis . <unk> , during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes , does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis , but instead occurs at night . The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid , retaining it until daylight returns , and only then using it in photosynthesis . Because transpiration takes place during the cooler , more humid night hours , water loss is significantly reduced . 
 Many smaller cacti have globe @-@ shaped stems , combining the highest possible volume for water storage , with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration . The tallest [ 1 ] free @-@ standing cactus is Pachycereus <unk> , with a maximum recorded height of 19 @.@ 2 m ( 63 ft ) , and the smallest is <unk> <unk> , only about 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter at maturity . A fully grown saguaro ( Carnegiea gigantea ) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons ( 760 l ; 170 imp gal ) of water during a rainstorm . A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family . At least superficially , plants of the genus Pereskia resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them . They have persistent leaves , and when older , bark @-@ covered stems . Their areoles identify them as cacti , and in spite of their appearance , they , too , have many adaptations for water conservation . Pereskia is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved . In tropical regions , other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes ( plants that grow on trees ) . Their stems are typically flattened , almost leaf @-@ like in appearance , with fewer or even no spines , such as the well @-@ known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus ( in the genus Schlumbergera ) . 
 Cacti have a variety of uses : many species are used as ornamental plants , others are grown for fodder or forage , and others for food ( particularly their fruit ) . Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 The 1 @,@ 500 to 1 @,@ 800 species of cacti mostly fall into one of two groups of " core cacti " : opuntias ( subfamily Opuntioideae ) and " cactoids " ( subfamily Cactoideae ) . Most members of these two groups are easily recognizable as cacti . They have fleshy succulent stems that are major organs of photosynthesis . They have absent , small , or transient leaves . They have flowers with ovaries that lie below the sepals and petals , often deeply sunken into a fleshy receptacle ( the part of the stem from which the flower parts grow ) . All cacti have areoles — highly specialized short shoots with extremely short internodes that produce spines , normal shoots , and flowers . 
 The remaining cacti fall into only two genera , Pereskia and Maihuenia , and are rather different , which means any description of cacti as a whole must frequently make exceptions for them . Pereskia species superficially resemble other tropical forest trees . When mature , they have woody stems that may be covered with bark and long @-@ lasting leaves that provide the main means of photosynthesis . Their flowers may have superior ovaries ( i.e. , above the points of attachment of the sepals and petals ) , and areoles that produce further leaves . The two species of Maihuenia have small , globe @-@ shaped bodies with prominent leaves at the top . 
 = = = Growth habit = = = 
 Cacti show a wide variety of growth habits , which are difficult to divide into clear , simple categories . They can be tree @-@ like ( <unk> ) , meaning they typically have a single more @-@ or @-@ less woody trunk topped by several to many branches . In the genus Pereskia , the branches are covered with leaves , so the species of this genus may not be recognized as cacti . In most other cacti , the branches are more typically cactus @-@ like , bare of leaves and bark , and covered with spines , as in Pachycereus <unk> or the larger opuntias . Some cacti may become tree @-@ sized but without branches , such as larger specimens of Echinocactus <unk> . Cacti may also be described as shrubby , with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down , such as in Stenocereus <unk> . 
 Smaller cacti may be described as columnar . They consist of erect , cylinder @-@ shaped stems , which may or may not branch , without a very clear division into trunk and branches . The boundary between columnar forms and tree @-@ like or shrubby forms is difficult to define . Smaller and younger specimens of <unk> <unk> , for example , are columnar , whereas older and larger specimens may become tree @-@ like . In some cases , the " columns " may be horizontal rather than vertical . Thus , Stenocereus <unk> has stems growing along the ground , rooting at intervals . 
 Cacti whose stems are even smaller may be described as globular ( or globose ) . They consist of shorter , more ball @-@ shaped stems than columnar cacti . Globular cacti may be solitary , such as Ferocactus <unk> , or their stems may form clusters that can create large mounds . All or some stems in a cluster may share a common root . 
 Other cacti have a quite different appearance . In tropical regions , some grow as forest climbers and epiphytes . Their stems are typically flattened , almost leaf @-@ like in appearance , with fewer or even no spines . Climbing cacti can be very large ; a specimen of <unk> was reported as 100 meters ( 330 ft ) long from root to the most distant stem . <unk> cacti , such as species of Rhipsalis or Schlumbergera , often hang downwards , forming dense clumps where they grow in trees high above the ground . 
 = = = Stems = = = 
 The leafless , spiny stem is the characteristic feature of the majority of cacti ( and all of those belonging to the largest subfamily , the Cactoideae ) . The stem is typically succulent , meaning it is adapted to store water . The surface of the stem may be smooth ( as in some species of Opuntia ) or covered with protuberances of various kinds , which are usually called tubercles . These vary from small " bumps " to prominent , nipple @-@ like shapes in the genus Mammillaria and outgrowths almost like leaves in Ariocarpus species . The stem may also be ribbed or fluted in shape . The prominence of these ribs depends on how much water the stem is storing : when full ( up to 90 % of the mass of a cactus may be water ) , the ribs may be almost invisible on the swollen stem , whereas when the cactus is short of water and the stems shrink , the ribs may be very visible . 
 The stems of most cacti are some shade of green , often bluish or brownish green . Such stems contain chlorophyll and are able to carry out photosynthesis ; they also have stomata ( small structures that can open and close to allow passage of gases ) . Cactus stems are often visibly waxy . 
 = = = Areoles = = = 
 Areoles are structures unique to cacti . Although variable , they typically appear as woolly or hairy areas on the stems from which spines emerge . Flowers are also produced from areoles . In the genus Pereskia , believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti , the areoles occur in the axils of leaves ( i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem ) . In leafless cacti , areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been . 
 Areoles are highly specialized and very condensed shoots or branches . In a normal shoot , nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem ( internodes ) . In an areole , the nodes are so close together , they form a single structure . The areole may be circular , elongated into an oval shape , or even separated into two parts ; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way ( e.g. by a groove in the stem ) or appear entirely separate ( a dimorphic areole ) . The part nearer the top of the stem then produces flowers , the other part spines . Areoles often have multicellular hairs ( trichomes ) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance , sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown . 
 In most cacti , the areoles produce new spines or flowers only for a few years , and then become inactive . This results in a relatively fixed number of spines , with flowers being produced only from the ends of stems , which are still growing and forming new areoles . In Pereskia , a genus close to the ancestor of cacti , areoles remain active for much longer ; this is also the case in Opuntia and <unk> . 
 = = = Leaves = = = 
 The great majority of cacti have no visible leaves ; photosynthesis takes place in the stems ( which may be flattened and leaflike in some species ) . Exceptions occur in three groups of cacti . All the species of Pereskia are superficially like normal trees or shrubs and have numerous leaves . Many cacti in the opuntia group ( subfamily Opuntioideae , <unk> ) also have visible leaves , which may be long @-@ lasting ( as in Pereskiopsis species ) or be produced only during the growing season and then be lost ( as in many species of Opuntia ) . The small genus Maihuenia also relies on leaves for photosynthesis . The structure of the leaves varies somewhat between these groups . Pereskia species have " normal " leaves , with a midrib and a flattened blade ( lamina ) on either side . <unk> and Maihuenia have leaves that appear to consist only of a midrib . 
 Even those cacti without visible photosynthetic leaves do usually have very small leaves , less than 0 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 02 in ) long in about half of the species studied and almost always less than 1 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 06 in ) long . The function of such leaves cannot be photosynthesis ; a role in the production of plant hormones , such as auxin , and in defining axillary buds has been suggested . 
 = = = Spines = = = 
 <unk> , " spines " are distinguished from " thorns " : spines are modified leaves , and thorns are modified branches . Cacti produce spines , always from areoles as noted above . Spines are present even in those cacti with leaves , such as Pereskia , Pereskiopsis and Maihuenia , so they clearly evolved before complete <unk> . Some cacti only have spines when young , possibly only when seedlings . This is particularly true of tree @-@ living cacti , such as Rhipsalis or Schlumbergera , but some ground @-@ living cacti , such as Ariocarpus , also lack spines when mature . 
 The spines of cacti are often useful in identification , since they vary greatly between species in number , color , size , shape and hardness , as well as in whether all the spines produced by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds . Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved , and are described as hair @-@ like , bristle @-@ like , needle @-@ like or awl @-@ like , depending on their length and thickness . Some cacti have flattened spines ( e.g. <unk> <unk> ) . Other cacti have hooked spines . Sometimes , one or more central spines are hooked , while outer spines are straight ( e.g. , Mammillaria <unk> ) . 
 In addition to normal @-@ length spines , members of the subfamily Opuntioideae have relatively short spines , called <unk> that are barbed along their length and easily shed . These enter the skin and are difficult to remove , causing long @-@ lasting irritation . 
 = = = Roots = = = 
 Most ground @-@ living cacti have only fine roots , which spread out around the base of the plant for varying distances , close to the surface . Some cacti have taproots ; in genera such as Copiapoa , these are considerably larger and of a greater volume than the body . <unk> may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti . Climbing , creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots , produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium . 
 = = = Flowers = = = 
 Like their spines , cactus flowers are variable . Typically , the ovary is surrounded by material derived from stem or receptacle tissue , forming a structure called a <unk> . Tissue derived from the petals and sepals continues the <unk> , forming a composite tube — the whole may be called a floral tube , although strictly speaking only the part furthest from the base is floral in origin . The outside of the tubular structure often has areoles that produce wool and spines . Typically , the tube also has small scale @-@ like bracts , which gradually change into <unk> @-@ like and then petal @-@ like structures , so the sepals and petals cannot be clearly differentiated ( and hence are often called " tepals " ) . Some cacti produce floral tubes without wool or spines ( e.g. <unk> ) or completely devoid of any external structures ( e.g. Mammillaria ) . Unlike the flowers of other cacti , Pereskia flowers may be borne in clusters . 
 Cactus flowers usually have many stamens , but only a single style , which may branch at the end into more than one stigma . The stamens usually arise from all over the inner surface of the upper part of the floral tube , although in some cacti , the stamens are produced in one or more distinct " series " in more specific areas of the inside of the floral tube . 
 The flower as a whole is usually radially symmetrical ( actinomorphic ) , but may be bilaterally symmetrical ( zygomorphic ) in some species . Flower colors range from white through yellow and red to magenta . 
 = = Adaptations for water conservation = = 
 All cacti have some adaptations to promote efficient water use . Most cacti — opuntias and cactoids — specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments ( i.e. they are <unk> ) , but the first ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought . A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes , often in tropical forests , where water conservation is less important . 
 = = = Leaves and spines = = = 
 The absence of visible leaves is one of the most striking features of most cacti . Pereskia ( which is close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved ) does have long @-@ lasting leaves , which are , however , thickened and succulent in many species . Other species of cactus with long @-@ lasting leaves , such as the <unk> Pereskiopsis , also have succulent leaves . A key issue in retaining water is the ratio of surface area to volume . Water loss is proportional to surface area , whereas the amount of water present is proportional to volume . Structures with a high surface area @-@ to @-@ volume ratio , such as thin leaves , necessarily lose water at a higher rate than structures with a low area @-@ to @-@ volume ratio , such as thickened stems . 
 Spines , which are modified leaves , are present on even those cacti with true leaves , showing the evolution of spines preceded the loss of leaves . Although spines have a high surface area @-@ to @-@ volume ratio , at maturity they contain little or no water , being composed of fibers made up of dead cells . Spines provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species , and assist in water conservation in several ways . They trap air near the surface of the cactus , creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and transpiration . They can provide some shade , which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus , also reducing water loss . When sufficiently moist air is present , such as during fog or early morning mist , spines can condense moisture , which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots . 
 = = = Stems = = = 
 The majority of cacti are stem succulents , i.e. , plants in which the stem is the main organ used to store water . Water may form up to 90 % of the total mass of a cactus . Stem shapes vary considerably among cacti . The cylindrical shape of columnar cacti and the spherical shape of globular cacti produce a low surface area @-@ to @-@ volume ratio , thus reducing water loss , as well as minimizing the heating effects of sunlight . The ribbed or fluted stems of many cacti allow the stem to shrink during periods of drought and then swell as it fills with water during periods of availability . A mature saguaro ( Carnegiea gigantea ) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons ( 760 l ; 170 imp gal ) of water during a rainstorm . The outer layer of the stem usually has a tough cuticle , reinforced with waxy layers , which reduce water loss . These layers are responsible for the grayish or bluish tinge to the stem color of many cacti . 
 The stems of most cacti have adaptations to allow them to conduct photosynthesis in the absence of leaves . This is discussed further below under Metabolism . 
 = = = Roots = = = 
 Many cacti have roots that spread out widely , but only penetrate a short distance into the soil . In one case , a young saguaro only 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) tall had a root system with a diameter of 2 m ( 7 ft ) , but no more than 10 cm ( 4 in ) deep . Cacti can also form new roots quickly when rain falls after a drought . The concentration of salts in the root cells of cacti is relatively high . All these adaptations enable cacti to absorb water rapidly during periods of brief or light rainfall . Thus , Ferocactus <unk> reportedly can take up a significant amount of water within 12 hours of as little as 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) of rainfall , becoming fully hydrated in a few days . 
 Although in most cacti , the stem acts as the main organ for storing water , some cacti have in addition large taproots . These may be several times the length of the above @-@ ground body in the case of species such as Copiapoa <unk> , which grows in one of the driest places in the world , the Atacama Desert in northern Chile . 
 = = = Metabolism = = = 
 Photosynthesis requires plants to take in carbon dioxide gas ( CO2 ) . As they do so , they lose water through transpiration . Like other types of succulents , cacti reduce this water loss by the way in which they carry out photosynthesis . " Normal " leafy plants use the C3 mechanism : during daylight hours , CO2 is continually drawn out of the air present in spaces inside leaves and converted first into a compound containing three carbon atoms ( 3 @-@ <unk> ) and then into products such as carbohydrates . The access of air to internal spaces within a plant is controlled by stomata , which are able to open and close . The need for a continuous supply of CO2 during photosynthesis means the stomata must be open , so water vapor is continuously being lost . Plants using the C3 mechanism lose as much as 97 % of the water taken up through their roots in this way . A further problem is that as temperatures rise , the enzyme that captures CO2 starts to capture more and more oxygen instead , reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis by up to 25 % . 
 <unk> acid metabolism ( CAM ) is a mechanism adopted by cacti and other succulents to avoid the problems of the C3 mechanism . In full CAM , the stomata open only at night , when temperatures and water loss are lowest . CO2 enters the plant and is captured in the form of organic acids stored inside cells ( in vacuoles ) . The stomata remain closed throughout the day , and photosynthesis uses only this stored CO2 . CAM uses water much more efficiently at the price of limiting the amount of carbon fixed from the atmosphere and thus available for growth . CAM @-@ cycling is a less efficient system whereby stomata open in the day , just as in plants using the C3 mechanism . At night , or when the plant is short of water , the stomata close and the CAM mechanism is used to store CO2 produced by respiration for use later in photosynthesis . CAM @-@ cycling is present in Pereskia species . 
 By studying the ratio of 14C to 13C incorporated into a plant — its isotopic signature — it is possible to deduce how much CO2 is taken up at night and how much in the daytime . Using this approach , most of the Pereskia species investigated exhibit some degree of CAM @-@ cycling , suggesting this ability was present in the ancestor of all cacti . Pereskia leaves are claimed to only have the C3 mechanism with CAM restricted to stems . More recent studies show that " it is highly unlikely that significant carbon assimilation occurs in the stem " ; Pereskia species are described as having " C3 with inducible CAM . " <unk> cacti carry out all their photosynthesis in the stem , using full CAM . As of February 2012 , it is not clear whether stem @-@ based CAM evolved once only in the core cacti , or separately in the opuntias and cactoids ; CAM is known to have evolved convergently many times . 
 To carry out photosynthesis , cactus stems have undergone many adaptations . Early in their evolutionary history , the ancestors of modern cacti ( other than one group of Pereskia species ) developed stomata on their stems and began to delay developing bark . However , this alone was not sufficient ; cacti with only these adaptations appear to do very little photosynthesis in their stems . Stems needed to develop structures similar to those normally found only in leaves . Immediately below the outer epidermis , a <unk> layer developed made up of cells with thickened walls , offering mechanical support . Air spaces were needed between the cells to allow carbon dioxide to diffuse inwards . The center of the stem , the cortex , developed " <unk> " – a plant tissue made up of relatively unspecialized cells containing chloroplasts , arranged into a " spongy layer " and a " palisade layer " where most of the photosynthesis occurs . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 Naming and classifying cacti has been both difficult and controversial since the first cacti were discovered for science . The difficulties began with Carl Linnaeus . In 1737 , he placed the cacti he knew into two genera , Cactus and Pereskia . However , when he published Species Plantarum in 1753 — the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature — he relegated them all to one genus , Cactus . The word " cactus " is derived through Latin from the Ancient Greek κάκτος ( <unk> ) , a name used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant , which may have been the <unk> ( Cynara <unk> ) . 
 Later botanists , such as Philip Miller in 1754 , divided cacti into several genera , which , in 1789 , Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae . By the early 20th century , botanists came to feel Linnaeus 's name Cactus had become so confused as to its meaning ( was it the genus or the family ? ) that it should not be used as a genus name . The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae . It did , however , conserve the name Cactaceae , leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named . 
 The difficulties continued , partly because giving plants scientific names relies on " type specimens " . Ultimately , if botanists want to know whether a particular plant is an example of , say , Mammillaria <unk> , they should be able to compare it with the type specimen to which this name is permanently attached . Type specimens are normally prepared by compression and drying , after which they are stored in herbaria to act as definitive references . However , cacti are very difficult to preserve in this way ; they have evolved to resist drying and their bodies do not easily compress . A further difficulty is that many cacti were given names by growers and horticulturalists rather than botanists ; as a result , the provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( which governs the names of cacti , as well as other plants ) were often ignored . Curt <unk> , in particular , is said to have named or renamed 1 @,@ 200 species without one of his names ever being attached to a specimen , which , according to David Hunt , ensured he " left a trail of nomenclatural chaos that will probably vex cactus taxonomists for centuries . " 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 In 1984 , it was decided that the Cactaceae Section of the International Organization for <unk> Plant Study should set up a working party , now called the International Cactaceae Systematics Group ( ICSG ) , to produce consensus classifications down to the level of genera . Their system has been used as the basis of subsequent classifications . Detailed treatments published in the 21st century have divided the family into around 125 – 130 genera and 1 @,@ 400 – 1 @,@ 500 species , which are then arranged into a number of tribes and subfamilies . The ICSG classification of the cactus family recognizes four subfamilies , the largest of which is divided into nine tribes . The subfamilies are : 
 Subfamily <unk> K. Schumann 
 The only genus is Pereskia . It has features considered closest to the ancestors of the Cactaceae . Plants are trees or shrubs with leaves ; their stems are smoothly round in cross section , rather than being ribbed or having tubercles . Two systems may be used in photosynthesis , both the " normal " C3 mechanism and <unk> acid metabolism ( CAM ) — an " advanced " feature of cacti and other succulents that conserves water . 
 Subfamily Opuntioideae K. Schumann 
 Some 15 genera are included in this subfamily . They may have leaves when they are young , but these are lost later . Their stems are usually divided into distinct " joints " or " pads " ( cladodes ) . Plants vary in size from the small cushions of <unk> to <unk> species of Opuntia , rising to 10 m ( 33 ft ) or more . 
 Subfamily <unk> P. Fearn 
 The only genus is Maihuenia , with two species , both of which form low @-@ growing mats . It has some features that are primitive within the cacti . Plants have leaves , and <unk> acid metabolism is wholly absent . 
 Subfamily Cactoideae 
 Divided into nine tribes , this is the largest subfamily , including all the " typical " cacti . Members are highly variable in habit , varying from tree @-@ like to epiphytic . Leaves are normally absent , although sometimes very reduced leaves are produced by young plants . Stems are usually not divided into segments , and are ribbed or tuberculate . Two of the tribes , Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae , contain climbing or epiphytic forms with a rather different appearance ; their stems are flattened and may be divided into segments . 
 Molecular phylogenetic studies have supported the monophyly of three of these subfamilies ( not <unk> ) , but have not supported all of the tribes or even genera below this level ; indeed , a 2011 study found only 39 % of the genera in the subfamily Cactoideae sampled in the research were monophyletic . Classification of the cacti currently remains uncertain and is likely to change . 
 = = Phylogeny and evolution = = 
 = = = Phylogeny = = = 
 A 2005 study suggested the genus Pereskia was basal within the Cactaceae , but confirmed earlier suggestions it was not monophyletic , i.e. , did not include all the descendants of a common ancestor . The Bayesian consensus cladogram from this study is shown below . 
 A more recent 2011 study using fewer genes but more species also found that Pereskia was divided into these two clades , but was unable to resolve the members of the " core cacti " clade . It was accepted that the relationships shown above are " the most robust to date . " 
 The two clades of Pereskia differ in their geographical distribution ; with one exception , clade A is found around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea , whereas clade B occurs south of the Amazon Basin . Species of Pereskia within clade A always lack two key features of the stem present in most of the remaining " caulocacti " : like most non @-@ cacti , their stems begin to form bark early in the plants ' life and also lack stomata — structures that control admission of air into a plant and hence control photosynthesis . By contrast , caulocacti , including species of Pereskia clade B , typically delay forming bark and have stomata on their stems , thus giving the stem the potential to become a major organ for photosynthesis . ( The two highly specialized species of Maihuenia are something of an exception . ) 
 The first cacti are thought to have been only slightly succulent shrubs or small trees whose leaves carried out photosynthesis . They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought . If Pereskia clade A is a good model of these early cacti , then , although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby , they had already evolved strategies to conserve water ( some of which are present in members of other families in the order <unk> ) . These strategies included being able to respond rapidly to periods of rain , and keeping transpiration low by using water very efficiently during photosynthesis . The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata . Like Pereskia species today , early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C3 mechanism , where carbon dioxide is used continuously in photosynthesis , to CAM cycling , in which when the stomata are closed , carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in photosynthesis . 
 Pereskia clade B marks the beginnings of an evolutionary switch to using stems as photosynthetic organs . Stems have stomata and the formation of bark takes place later than in normal trees . The " core cacti " show a steady increase in both stem succulence and photosynthesis accompanied by multiple losses of leaves , more @-@ or @-@ less complete in the Cactoideae . One evolutionary question at present unanswered is whether the switch to full CAM photosynthesis in stems occurred only once in the core cacti , in which case it has been lost in Maihuenia , or separately in Opuntioideae and Cactoideae , in which case it never evolved in Maihuenia . 
 Understanding evolution within the core cacti clade is difficult as of February 2012 , since phylogenetic relationships are still uncertain and not well related to current classifications . Thus , a 2011 study found " an extraordinarily high proportion of genera " were not monophyletic , so were not all descendants of a single common ancestor . For example , of the 36 genera in the subfamily Cactoideae sampled in the research , 22 ( 61 % ) were found not monophyletic . Nine tribes are recognized within Cactoideae in the International Cactaceae Systematics Group ( ICSG ) classification ; one , <unk> , comprises a single genus , <unk> . Only two of the remaining eight , <unk> and Rhipsalideae , were shown to be monophyletic in a 2011 study by Hernández @-@ Hernández et al . For a more detailed discussion of the phylogeny of the cacti , see Classification of the Cactaceae . 
 = = = Evolutionary history = = = 
 No known fossils of cacti exist to throw light on their evolutionary history . However , the geographical distribution of cacti offers some evidence . Except for a relatively recent spread of Rhipsalis baccifera to parts of the Old World , cacti are plants of South America and mainly southern regions of North America . This suggests the family must have evolved after the ancient continent of Gondwana split into South America and Africa , which occurred during the Early Cretaceous , around 145 to 101 million years ago . Precisely when after this split cacti evolved is less clear . Older sources suggest an early origin around 90 – 66 million years ago , during the Late Cretaceous . More recent molecular studies suggest a much younger origin , perhaps in very Late Eocene to early Oligocene periods , around 35 – 30 million years ago . Based on the phylogeny of the cacti , the earliest diverging group ( Pereskia clade A ) may have originated in Central America and northern South America , whereas the caulocacti , those with more @-@ or @-@ less succulent stems , evolved later in the southern part of South America , and then moved northwards . Core cacti , those with strongly succulent stems , are estimated to have evolved around 25 million years ago . A possible stimulus to their evolution may have been uplifting in the central Andes , some 25 – 20 million years ago , which was associated with increasing and varying aridity . However , the current species diversity of cacti is thought to have arisen only in the last 10 – 5 million years ( from the late Miocene into the Pliocene ) . Other succulent plants , such as the <unk> in South Africa , the Didiereaceae in Madagascar and the genus Agave in the Americas , appear to have diversified at the same time , which coincided with a global expansion of arid environments . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Cacti inhabit diverse regions , from coastal plains to high mountain areas . With one exception , they are native to the Americas , where their range extends from Patagonia to British Columbia and Alberta in western Canada . A number of centers of diversity exist . For cacti adapted to drought , the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States ; the southwestern Andes , where they are found in Peru , Bolivia , Chile and Argentina ; and eastern Brazil , away from the Amazon Basin . Tree @-@ living epiphytic and climbing cacti necessarily have different centers of diversity , as they require moister environments . They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil ; in Bolivia , which is the center of diversity for the subfamily Rhipsalideae ; and in forested regions of Central America , where the climbing Hylocereeae are most diverse . 
 Rhipsalis baccifera is the exception ; it is native to both the Americas and the Old World , where it is found in tropical Africa , Madagascar , and Sri Lanka . One theory is it was spread by being carried as seeds in the digestive tracts of migratory birds ; the seeds of Rhipsalis are adapted for bird distribution . Old World populations are polyploid , and regarded as distinct subspecies , supporting the idea that the spread was not recent . The alternative theory is the species initially crossed the Atlantic on European ships trading between South America and Africa , after which birds may have spread it more widely . 
 Many other species have become naturalized outside the Americas after having been introduced by people , especially in Australia , Hawaii , and the Mediterranean region . In Australia , species of Opuntia , particularly Opuntia stricta , were introduced in the 19th century for use as natural agricultural fences and in an attempt to establish a cochineal industry . They rapidly became a major weed problem , but are now controlled by biological agents , particularly the moth <unk> <unk> . The weed potential of Opuntia species in Australia continues however , leading to all <unk> cacti except O. ficus @-@ indica being declared Weeds of National Significance by the Australian Weeds Committee in April 2012 . 
 = = Reproductive ecology = = 
 Cactus flowers are pollinated by insects , birds and bats . None are known to be wind @-@ pollinated and self @-@ pollination occurs in only a very few species ; for example the flowers of some species of <unk> do not open ( <unk> ) . The need to attract pollinators has led to the evolution of pollination syndromes , which are defined as groups of " floral traits , including rewards , associated with the attraction and utilization of a specific group of animals as pollinators . " 
 Bees are the most common pollinators of cacti ; bee @-@ pollination is considered to have been the first to evolve . Day @-@ flying butterflies and nocturnal moths are associated with different pollination syndromes . Butterfly @-@ pollinated flowers are usually brightly colored , opening during the day , whereas moth @-@ pollinated flowers are often white or pale in color , opening only in the evening and at night . As an example , Pachycereus <unk> is pollinated by a particular species of moth , <unk> virescens , which also lays its eggs among the developing seeds its caterpillars later consume . The flowers of this cactus are funnel @-@ shaped , white to deep pink , up to 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) long , and open at night . 
 Hummingbirds are significant pollinators of cacti . Species showing the typical hummingbird @-@ pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red end of the spectrum , anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower , and a shape that is not radially symmetrical , with a lower lip that bends downwards ; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content . Schlumbergera species , such as S. truncata , have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome . Other hummingbird @-@ pollinated genera include <unk> and <unk> . 
 Bat @-@ pollination is relatively uncommon in flowering plants , but about a quarter of the genera of cacti are known to be pollinated by bats — an unusually high proportion , exceeded among <unk> by only two other families , both with very few genera . Columnar cacti growing in semidesert areas are among those most likely to be bat @-@ pollinated ; this may be because bats are able to travel considerable distances , so are effective pollinators of plants growing widely separated from one another . The pollination syndrome associated with bats includes a tendency for flowers to open in the evening and at night , when bats are active . Other features include a relatively dull color , often white or green ; a radially symmetrical shape , often tubular ; a smell described as " musty " ; and the production of a large amount of sugar @-@ rich nectar . Carnegiea gigantea is an example of a bat @-@ pollinated cactus , as are many species of Pachycereus and <unk> . 
 The fruits produced by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably ; many are fleshy , although some are dry . All contain a large number of seeds . Fleshy , colorful and sweet @-@ tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds . The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their droppings . Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals ; giant tortoises are reported to distribute Opuntia seeds in the Galápagos Islands . Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera , such as <unk> . Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind . 
 = = Uses = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 As of March 2012 , there is still controversy as to the precise dates when humans first entered those areas of the New World where cacti are commonly found , and hence when they might first have used them . An archaeological site in Chile has been dated to around 15 @,@ 000 years ago , suggesting cacti would have been encountered before then . Early evidence of the use of cacti includes cave paintings in the Serra da <unk> in Brazil , and seeds found in ancient middens ( waste dumps ) in Mexico and Peru , with dates estimated at 12 @,@ 000 – 9 @,@ 000 years ago . Hunter @-@ gatherers likely collected cactus fruits in the wild and brought them back to their camps . 
 It is not known when cacti were first cultivated . <unk> ( prickly pears ) were used for a variety of purposes by the Aztecs , whose empire , lasting from the 14th to the 16th century , had a complex system of horticulture . Their capital from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan ( now Mexico City ) ; one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the Nahuatl word <unk> , referring to the fruit of an opuntia . The coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake , an image at the center of the myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan . The Aztecs symbolically linked the ripe red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts ; just as the fruit quenches thirst , so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the sun would keep moving . 
 Europeans first encountered cacti when they arrived in the New World late in the 15th century . Their first landfalls were in the West Indies , where relatively few cactus genera are found ; one of the most common is the genus Melocactus . Thus , <unk> were possibly among the first cacti seen by Europeans . Melocactus species were present in English collections of cacti before the end of the 16th century ( by 1570 according to one source , ) where they were called <unk> , later shortened to Melocactus by Joseph Pitton de <unk> in the early 18th century . Cacti , both purely ornamental species and those with edible fruit , continued to arrive in Europe , so Carl Linnaeus was able to name 22 species by 1753 . One of these , his Cactus opuntia ( now part of Opuntia ficus @-@ indica ) , was described as " <unk> <unk> ... nunc in Hispania et Lusitania " ( with larger fruit ... now in Spain and Portugal ) , indicative of its early use in Europe . 
 = = = Food = = = 
 The plant now known as Opuntia ficus @-@ indica , or the Indian fig cactus , has long been an important source of food . The original species is thought to have come from central Mexico , although this is now obscure because the indigenous people of southern North America developed and distributed a range of horticultural varieties ( cultivars ) , including forms of the species and hybrids with other opuntias . Both the fruit and pads are eaten , the former often under the Spanish name tuna , the latter under the name <unk> . Cultivated forms are often significantly less spiny or even spineless . The <unk> industry in Mexico was said to be worth US $ 150 million in 2007 . The Indian fig cactus was probably already present in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived , and was soon after brought to Europe . It spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area , both naturally and by being introduced — so much so , early botanists assumed it was native to the area . Outside the Americas , the Indian fig cactus is an important commercial crop in Sicily , Algeria and other North African countries . Fruits of other opuntias are also eaten , generally under the same name , tuna . Flower buds , particularly of Cylindropuntia species , are also consumed . 
 Almost any fleshy cactus fruit is edible . The word <unk> or <unk> ( usually considered to have been taken into Spanish from Haitian creole ) can be applied to a range of " scaly fruit " , particularly those of columnar cacti . The fruit of the saguaro ( Carnegiea gigantea ) has long been important to the indigenous peoples of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States , including the Sonoran Desert . It can be preserved by boiling to produce syrup and by drying . The syrup can also be fermented to produce an alcoholic drink . Fruits of Stenocereus species have also been important food sources in similar parts of North America ; Stenocereus <unk> is cultivated for its fruit . In more tropical southern areas , the climber <unk> <unk> provides <unk> <unk> , now widely grown in Asia under the name dragon fruit . Other cacti providing edible fruit include species of <unk> , Ferocactus , Mammillaria , <unk> , Pachycereus , <unk> and <unk> . The bodies of cacti other than opuntias are less often eaten , although Anderson reported that <unk> <unk> is prepared and eaten like potatoes in upland Bolivia . 
 = = = Psychoactive agents = = = 
 A number of species of cacti have been shown to contain psychoactive agents , chemical compounds that can cause changes in mood , perception and cognition through their effects on the brain . Two species have a long history of use by the indigenous peoples of the Americas : peyote , <unk> williamsii , in North America , and the San Pedro cactus , Echinopsis <unk> , in South America . Both contain mescaline . 
 L. williamsii is native to northern Mexico and southern Texas . Individual stems are about 2 – 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) high with a diameter of 4 – 11 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 3 in ) , and may be found in clumps up to 1 m ( 3 ft ) wide . A large part of the stem is usually below ground . <unk> is concentrated in the photosynthetic portion of the stem above ground . The center of the stem , which contains the growing point ( the apical meristem ) , is sunken . Experienced collectors of peyote remove a thin slice from the top of the plant , leaving the growing point intact , thus allowing the plant to regenerate . Evidence indicates peyote was in use more than 5 @,@ 500 years ago ; dried peyote buttons presumed to be from a site on the Rio Grande , Texas , were radiocarbon dated to around <unk> – <unk> BC . Peyote is perceived as a means of accessing the spirit world . Attempts by the Roman Catholic church to suppress its use after the Spanish conquest were largely unsuccessful , and by the middle of the 20th century , peyote was more widely used than ever by indigenous peoples as far north as Canada . It is now used formally by the Native American Church . 
 Echinopsis <unk> is native to Ecuador and Peru . It is very different in appearance from L. williamsii . It has tall stems , up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) high , with a diameter of 6 – 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) , which branch from the base , giving the whole plant a shrubby or tree @-@ like appearance . Archaeological evidence of the use of this cactus appears to date back to 2 @,@ 000 – 2 @,@ 300 years ago , with carvings and ceramic objects showing columnar cacti . Although church authorities under the Spanish attempted to suppress its use , this failed , as shown by the Christian element in the common name " San Pedro cactus " — Saint Peter cactus . Anderson attributes the name to the belief that just as St Peter holds the keys to heaven , the effects of the cactus allow users " to reach heaven while still on earth . " It continues to be used for its psychoactive effects , both for spiritual and for healing purposes , often combined with other psychoactive agents , such as Datura ferox and tobacco . Several other species of Echinopsis , including E. peruviana , also contain mescaline . 
 = = = Ornamental plants = = = 
 Cacti were cultivated as ornamental plants from the time they were first brought from the New World . By the early 1800s , enthusiasts in Europe had large collections ( often including other succulents alongside cacti ) . Rare plants were sold for very high prices . Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild , in addition to growing their own . In the late 1800s , collectors turned to orchids , and cacti became less popular , although never disappearing from cultivation . 
 Cacti are often grown in greenhouses , particularly in regions unsuited to the cultivation of cacti outdoors , such the northern parts of Europe and North America . Here , they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground . Cacti are also grown as houseplants , many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere . Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios , and then kept under cover during the winter . Less drought @-@ resistant epiphytes , such as <unk> hybrids , Schlumbergera ( the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus ) and Hatiora ( the Easter cactus ) , are widely cultivated as houseplants . 
 Cacti may also be planted outdoors in regions with suitable climates . Concern for water conservation in arid regions has led to the promotion of gardens requiring less watering ( xeriscaping ) . For example , in California , the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer @-@ dry climates . Cacti are one group of drought @-@ resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening . 
 = = = Other uses = = = 
 Cacti have many other uses . They are used for human food and as fodder for animals , usually after burning off their spines . In addition to their use as psychoactive agents , some cacti are employed in herbal medicine . The practice of using various species of Opuntia in this way has spread from the Americas , where they naturally occur , to other regions where they grow , such as India . 
 Cochineal is a red dye produced by a scale insect that lives on species of Opuntia . Long used by the peoples of Central and North America , demand fell rapidly when European manufacturers began to produce synthetic dyes in the middle of the 19th century . Commercial production has now increased following a rise in demand for natural dyes . 
 Cacti are used as construction materials . Living cactus fences are employed as barricades . The woody parts of cacti , such as Cereus <unk> and Echinopsis <unk> , are used in buildings and in furniture . The frames of wattle and daub houses built by the Seri people of Mexico may use parts of Carnegiea gigantea . The very fine spines and hairs ( trichomes ) of some cacti were used as a source of fiber for filling pillows and in weaving . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 All cacti are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , which " lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled . " Control is exercised by making international trade in most specimens of cacti illegal unless permits have been issued , at least for exports . Some exceptions are allowed , e.g. , for " naturalized or artificially propagated plants " . Some cacti , such as all Ariocarpus and <unk> species , are included in the more restrictive Appendix I , used for the " most endangered " species . These may only be moved between countries for scientific purposes , and only then when accompanied by both export and import permits . 
 The three main threats to cacti in the wild are development , grazing and over @-@ collection . Development takes many forms . The construction of a dam near <unk> , Mexico , caused the destruction of a large part of the natural habitat of Echinocactus <unk> . Urban development and highways have destroyed cactus habitats in parts of Mexico , New Mexico and Arizona , including the Sonoran Desert . The conversion of land to agriculture has affected populations of Ariocarpus <unk> in Mexico , where dry plains were plowed for maize cultivation , and of Copiapoa and <unk> in Chile , where valley slopes were planted with vines . Grazing , in many areas by introduced animals , such as goats , has caused serious damage to populations of cacti ( as well as other plants ) ; two examples cited by Anderson are the Galápagos Islands generally and the effect on <unk> <unk> in Peru . Over @-@ collection of cacti for sale has greatly affected some species . For example , the type locality of <unk> <unk> near <unk> , Mexico , was virtually denuded of plants , which were dug up for sale in Europe . Illegal collecting of cacti from the wild continues to pose a threat . 
 Conservation of cacti can be in situ or ex situ . In situ conservation involves preserving habits through enforcement of legal protection and the creation of specially protected areas such as national parks and reserves . Examples of such protected areas in the United States include Big Bend National Park , Texas ; Joshua Tree National Park , California ; and Saguaro National Park , Arizona . Latin American examples include Parque Nacional del <unk> , Sonora , Mexico and Pan de <unk> National Park , Chile . Ex situ conservation aims to preserve plants and seeds outside their natural habitats , often with the intention of later reintroduction . Botanical gardens play an important role in ex situ conservation ; for example , seeds of cacti and other succulents are kept in long @-@ term storage at the Desert Botanical Garden , Arizona . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 The popularity of cacti means many books are devoted to their cultivation . Cacti naturally occur in a wide range of habitats and are then grown in many countries with different climates , so precisely replicating the conditions in which a species normally grows is usually not practical . A broad distinction can be made between semidesert cacti and epiphytic cacti , which need different conditions and are best grown separately . This section is primarily concerned with the cultivation of semidesert cacti in containers and under protection , such as in a greenhouse or in the home , rather than cultivation outside in the ground in those climates that permit it . For the cultivation of epiphytic cacti , see Cultivation of Schlumbergera ( Christmas or Thanksgiving cacti ) , and Cultivation of <unk> hybrids . 
 = = = Growing medium = = = 
 The purpose of the growing medium is to provide support and to store water , oxygen and dissolved minerals to feed the plant . In the case of cacti , there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air content is important . When cacti are grown in containers , recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly ; Miles Anderson says that if asked to describe a perfect growing medium , " ten growers would give 20 different answers " . Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial <unk> growing medium , one part hydroponic clay and one part coarse pumice or perlite , with the addition of soil from earthworm castings . The general recommendation of 25 – 75 % organic @-@ based material , the rest being inorganic such as pumice , perlite or grit , is supported by other sources . However , the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others ; Hecht says that cacti ( other than epiphytes ) " want soil that is low in or free of humus " , and recommends coarse sand as the basis of a growing medium . 
 = = = Watering = = = 
 Semi @-@ desert cacti need careful watering . General advice is hard to give , since the frequency of watering required depends on where the cacti are being grown , the nature of the growing medium , and the original habitat of the cacti . Brown says that more cacti are lost through the " untimely application of water than for any other reason " and that even during the dormant winter season , cacti need some water . Other sources say that water can be withheld during winter ( November to March in the Northern Hemisphere ) . Another issue is the hardness of the water ; where it is necessary to use hard water , regular re @-@ potting is recommended to avoid the build up of salts . The general advice given is that during the growing season , cacti should be allowed to dry out between thorough <unk> . A water meter can help in determining when the soil is dry . 
 = = = Light and temperature = = = 
 Although semi @-@ desert cacti may be exposed to high light levels in the wild , they may still need some shading when subjected to the higher light levels and temperatures of a greenhouse in summer . Allowing the temperature to rise above 32 ° C ( 90 ° F ) is not recommended . The minimum winter temperature required depends very much on the species of cactus involved . For a mixed collection , a minimum temperature of between 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) and 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) is often suggested , except for cold @-@ sensitive genera such as Melocactus and <unk> . Some cacti , particularly those from the high Andes , are fully frost @-@ hardy when kept dry ( e.g. <unk> <unk> survives temperatures down to − 9 ° C ( 16 ° F ) in cultivation ) and may flower better when exposed to a period of cold . 
 = = = Propagation = = = 
 Cacti can be propagated by seed , cuttings or grafting . Seed sown early in the year produces seedlings that benefit from a longer growing period . Seed is sown in a moist growing medium and then kept in a covered environment , until 7 – 10 days after germination , to avoid drying out . A very wet growing medium can cause both seeds and seedlings to rot . A temperature range of 18 – 30 ° C ( 64 – 86 ° F ) is suggested for germination ; soil temperatures of around 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) promote the best root growth . Low light levels are sufficient during germination , but afterwards semi @-@ desert cacti need higher light levels to produce strong growth , although acclimatization is needed to conditions in a greenhouse , such as higher temperatures and strong sunlight . 
 Reproduction by cuttings makes use of parts of a plant that can grow roots . Some cacti produce " pads " or " joints " that can be detached or cleanly cut off . Other cacti produce offsets that can be removed . Otherwise , stem cuttings can be made , ideally from relatively new growth . It is recommended that any cut surfaces be allowed to dry for a period of several days to several weeks until a callus forms over the cut surface . Rooting can then take place in an appropriate growing medium at a temperature of around 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) . 
 <unk> is used for species difficult to grow well in cultivation or that cannot grow independently , such as some chlorophyll @-@ free forms with white , yellow or red bodies , or some forms that show abnormal growth ( e.g. , <unk> or <unk> forms ) . For the host plant — the " stock " — growers choose one that grows strongly in cultivation and is compatible with the plant to be propagated — the scion . The grower makes cuts on both stock and scion and joins the two , binding them together while they unite . Various kinds of graft are used — flat grafts , where both scion and stock are of similar diameters , and cleft grafts , where a smaller scion is inserted into a cleft made in the stock . 
 Commercially , huge numbers of cacti are produced annually . For example , in 2002 in Korea alone , 49 million plants were propagated , with a value of almost US $ 9 million . Most of them , 31 million plants , were propagated by grafting . 
 = = = Pests and diseases = = = 
 A range of pests attack cacti in cultivation . Those that feed on sap include : mealybugs , living on both stems and roots ; scale insects , generally only found on stems ; whiteflies , which are said to be an " infrequent " pest of cacti ; red spider mites , which are very small but can occur in large numbers , constructing a fine web around themselves and badly marking the cactus via their sap sucking , even if they do not kill it ; and thrips , which particularly attack flowers . Some of these pests are resistant to many insecticides , although there are biological controls available . Roots of cacti can be eaten by the larvae of <unk> flies and fungus gnats . Slugs and snails also eat cacti . 
 Fungi , bacteria and viruses attack cacti , the first two particularly when plants are over @-@ watered . Fusarium rot can gain entry through a wound and cause rotting accompanied by red @-@ violet mold . " <unk> rot " is caused by <unk> <unk> ( syn . <unk> <unk> ) ; Phytophthora species also cause similar rotting in cacti . Fungicides may be of limited value in combating these diseases . Several viruses have been found in cacti , including cactus virus X. These appear to cause only limited visible symptoms , such as chlorotic ( pale green ) spots and mosaic effects ( streaks and patches of paler color ) . However , in an Agave species , cactus virus X has been shown to reduce growth , particularly when the roots are dry . There are no treatments for virus diseases . 
 = No Rest for the Wicked ( Supernatural ) = 
 " No Rest for the Wicked " is the third season finale of the CW television series Supernatural . It is the sixteenth episode of the third season , and is the show 's sixtieth episode overall . Written by series creator Eric Kripke and directed by Kim Manners , the episode was first broadcast on May 15 , 2008 . The narrative follows the series ' protagonists Sam ( Jared Padalecki ) and Dean Winchester ( Jensen Ackles ) — brothers who travel the continental United States hunting supernatural creatures — as they attempt to save the latter 's soul from damnation . Having made a year @-@ long demonic pact in the previous season finale , Dean has just one day left to live . The brothers must track down the demonic overlord Lilith , who holds Dean 's contract . Lilith , meanwhile , is entertaining herself by possessing a young girl ( Sierra McCormick ) and terrorizing her family , a homage to the Twilight Zone episode " It 's a Good Life " . 
 Marking the final appearance of Katie Cassidy as the demon Ruby , the episode was originally intended to feature the return of Samantha Ferris as recurring character Ellen Harvelle . The writers initially intended that Sam would save Dean by giving into his demonic abilities , but the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented the development of that storyline throughout the season . Dean is instead killed ; the final scene of him in Hell was the " most complicated shot [ the ] visual effects department has ever done " . 
 The episode received high ratings for the season , and garnered generally positive reviews from critics . The decision to follow through with Dean 's Hell @-@ bound contract was praised , as were the performances of Padalecki and Ackles . General consensus was that McCormick was " creepy " as Lilith , but lacked the menace of Fredric Lehne 's Azazel of the second season .

 Supernatural follows brothers Sam ( Padalecki ) and Dean Winchester ( Ackles ) as they travel the continental United States hunting supernatural creatures that pose a threat to society . At times , they are assisted by fellow " hunter " and family friend Bobby Singer ( Jim Beaver ) . Their greatest enemies come in the form of demons , corrupted human souls that have escaped from Hell . A cloud of black smoke in their true form , they take possession of human hosts . 
 Twenty @-@ two years earlier than the series ' main storyline , the demonic tyrant Azazel fed his blood to Sam and other infants , to imbue them with demonic abilities . He gathers them together in the second season finale " All Hell Breaks Loose " and coerces the young adults into a fight to the death to determine a leader for his demonic army . Sam is killed by the super @-@ strong Jake Talley , but Dean sells his own soul to a crossroads demon in exchange for Sam 's resurrection , a contract that leaves Dean with only a year to live . The Winchesters , Bobby , and fellow hunter Ellen Harvelle kill Jake and Azazel , but are too late to prevent the release of hundreds of demons from Hell . 
 One of the freed demons is Ruby ( Cassidy ) , a former witch who claims to oppose the demonic world . She frequently helps the brothers throughout the third season with her demon @-@ killing knife and knowledge of witchcraft , but Dean mistrusts her manipulative nature . As the deadline approaches , the Winchesters learn that Azazel 's successor , Lilith , holds the contract to Dean 's deal . He now only has one day remaining before he is sent to Hell . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode begins with Dean Winchester ( Ackles ) being chased through a forest by a hellhound ; as it mauls him , he awakens from his dream . His brother , Sam ( Padalecki ) , tells him that Bobby has devised a way to locate Lilith , but unconvinced that it will succeed , Dean suggests he live up the rest of his time . Sam insists that he will be saved , but Dean feigns reassurance as he hallucinates a demonic @-@ looking Sam . 
 Bobby tracks Lilith to New Harmony , Indiana . Dean does not want to attack unprepared , but he refuses to seek help from Ruby . Sam secretly summons her and asks for her knife , and Ruby tells him that his dormant psychic abilities could easily kill Lilith , whose guard is down as she is on " shore leave " . Sam considers the alternative , but Dean shows up and tricks Ruby into a devil 's trap — mystical symbols capable of rendering a demon powerless — and the brothers take her knife and leave . Despite Dean 's objections , Bobby insists that he accompany them , and draws attention to Dean 's hallucinations . With his demise rapidly approaching , Dean has begun " piercing the veil " , allowing him to glimpse the demons ' true forms . 
 When the trio arrive in New Harmony , they discover that Lilith is possessing a young girl ( McCormick ) and terrorizing her family . Pretending to be their daughter , Lilith kills the family dog when it is " mean " towards her and snaps the grandfather 's neck after he seeks help from neighbors . As Bobby blesses a waterline running to the sprinklers of the family 's home , Sam and Dean dispatch some of the demons who have taken over the neighborhood . Ruby appears and angrily confronts them , but is stopped short by an oncoming horde of demons . The three of them run into the house as Bobby activates the sprinklers , creating a barrier of holy water . While Dean takes the girl 's father to safety in the basement , Sam and Ruby go upstairs and split up in search of Lilith . Sam finds the possessed girl in her bedroom , and although initially hesitant he prepares to strike until he is stopped by Dean , who reveals that Lilith has left her . As midnight approaches , they take the rest of the family into the basement . 
 Sam begs Ruby to teach him how to use his abilities , but she tells him that it is too late . Dean accepts his fate as the clock strikes midnight , but runs from the approaching hellhound . The three barricade themselves inside a room , but Dean quickly realizes that Lilith has taken over Ruby 's host . Claiming to have sent Ruby " far , far away " , Lilith telekinetically pins the brothers down and lets in the hellhound . As Dean is mauled to death , Lilith blasts Sam with white energy from her hand . Horrified to see that it has no effect , she flees her host before Sam can retaliate . A devastated Sam cradles Dean , whose soul is then shown in Hell hanging from a vast landscape of chains and <unk> while fruitlessly screaming for Sam .

 " No Rest for the Wicked " marked the final appearance of Katie Cassidy as the demon Ruby . Dismissed for budgetary reasons , the actress was replaced by Genevieve Cortese for the fourth season . The writers intended Samantha Ferris to return as hunter Ellen Harvelle , a guest stint Ferris believed would have ended in her character 's demise . She ultimately declined the offer because it " could cost [ her ] money and work " . Following the mythological Lilith 's role of " destroyer of children " , the demon takes on a child host portrayed by Sierra McCormick . Series writer Sera Gamble commented that it was an " interesting " choice because it presented Lilith as " creepy and kind of <unk> " . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Originally entitled " No Quarter " , the episode was written by series creator Eric Kripke . Much of the storyline served as a homage to the Twilight Zone episode " It 's a Good Life " , in which a powerful child terrorizes his town . Although Kripke found it difficult to write many of the episode 's scenes , the terrorizing sequences " just came right out " because they were " just so fun " . 
 The writers initially intended that Sam would save Dean from Hell , possibly even before " No Rest for the Wicked " , by giving in to his demonic powers and becoming " this fully operational dark force " who would then want to go after Lilith . The battle would have been " much more climactic " , with the Winchesters " going to war to save Dean 's life " . By the middle of the season , however , the writers realized the costs associated with depicting such an engagement and scaled it down . To make matters worse , the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented them from fleshing out Sam 's evolving abilities throughout the season , and his entire story arc was pushed back into the fourth season . With Sam 's storyline no longer <unk> with Dean 's , the writers " [ never had ] any doubt in [ their ] minds " to send Dean to Hell . Kripke disliked that the second season finale " just ended " , and he felt that this episode provided a cliffhanger ending that had people " biting their nails " . Although the viewers ' expectations that Dean would be saved was " reason enough " , his imprisonment in Hell also served as a " turning point " for both the character and the series . Kripke commented , " You need huge moves to happen that can cause radical shifts in the characters , that set them off in a new direction . So what happens to Dean in Hell and how Dean gets out become primary concerns of season four . " 
 = = = Hell = = = 
 The episode 's final moments linger on Dean " meat @-@ hooked in the center of what looks like a thousand mile spiderweb of rusty chains " , a scene Kripke described as " M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser " . The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a " really nasty , bloody slaughterhouse , hanging from meat hooks " . Here , Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him . Discussions between Kripke , Manners , and Hayden led to the decision to present " one epic glimpse " of Hell , though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals . Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations . Though the scene matched with the many versions of " chains and people being ripped apart " , art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it " a little more mysterious and dark " . He commented , " My opinion is , the vaguer the better , because you let the imagination take over . People have different fears , and Hell 's such a personal torment . " In series writer Sera Gamble 's opinion , Dean 's location is more of the " waiting room " — the place " they stick you before they hand you the sign @-@ in sheet " — a far cry from what he will experience " once he gets into the first chamber of Hell " . 
 The sequence was miserable for Ackles , who spent four hours in make @-@ up having the various hooks and other prosthetics applied . Wired cuffs around his wrists and ankles , as well as a harness around his waist , were used to lift him 13 feet into the air in front of a green screen . To his discomfort , the harness slipped , causing its buckle to continuously dig into his hip throughout the scene 's three or four takes . The actor , who " had tears rolling down [ his ] face " as he was lowered down , deemed it the most physical pain he has endured for a single shot . 
 The visual effects department also found it quite a challenge , often referring to the ten @-@ day process as the " Hell Shot " . Initially planned as 12 – 13 seconds , the shot ended up running 35 seconds , a huge feat to render on high @-@ definition film . They were also required to digitally remove the wires attached to Ackles , and add in chains . Lightning strikes occur throughout the scene , based on practical lightning effects done during the shoot to meet Manners ' and cinematographer Serge Ladouceur 's demands . This " [ slaved the department ] into the frequency of the lightning " , forcing them to " reverse @-@ engineer the randomness " . Because of the vast complications and expenses in presenting Hell to such an extent , future representations are restricted to " very tight angles " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography took place in Vancouver , British Columbia . The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul @-@ de @-@ sac of million @-@ dollar homes , and production housed the residents in hotels for two nights to allow for filming . Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from inside one of the houses , the actors were actually standing on a two @-@ story scaffolding across the street , looking through fake windows . Shots of them inside the house in the same scene made use of one of the basements . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The episode 's synthesized orchestral score was written by Jay Gruska , who especially enjoyed working on the episode due to his friendship with an actor from " It 's a Good Life " . The music , however , was not influenced by The Twilight Zone , as Gruska prefers to base his scores on an episode 's visuals . The terrorizing scenes thus featured child sounds such as the high register of a toy piano , which used a " low approach underneath it " to make it " absolutely sinister " . 
 In addition to the score , the episode followed the series tradition of a rock soundtrack . On their drive to New Harmony , Sam and Dean sing along to Bon Jovi 's " Wanted Dead or Alive " . To mask Ackles ' " very impressive singing voice " , Kripke asked the actor to sing off @-@ key . 
 = = Reception = = 
 On its initial broadcast , the episode was watched by 2 @.@ 998 million viewers . It received generally positive reviews from critics , with TV Guide ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of " TV 's Top 100 Episodes of All Time " . BuddyTV 's Don Williams deemed the finale " absolutely fantastic " , and ranked it tenth on his list of the top Supernatural episodes of the first three seasons . Although he " respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [ Dean 's ] deal " — the ending was a " complete jaw @-@ dropper " — he pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected . Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing " Wanted Dead or Alive " , and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness . Likewise , TV Guide 's Tina Charles described the episode as " creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome " , and felt it came close to outdoing the first season finale " Devil 's Trap " . Especially praised were the actors ' performances . Padalecki " totally stepped up to the plate and knocked one out of the park " , and Ackles was " nine kinds of awesome " . On the latter , Charles noted , " From acting out Dean 's stubborn ways , his inappropriate humor , those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean 's death , the man can play it all . " McCormick was described as " creepy " , leading to Charles ' " huge compliment " of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone . For the critic , the " totally unexpected " Bon Jovi sing @-@ along " totally rocked " and has " instantly become a classic " . Her main disappointment with the episode , however , was the lack of Sam " going dark side " . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the episode as one of the " gems " of the third season , and believed it likely to end up as one of her " Favorite ' Supernatural ' Episodes of All Time " . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune 's Karla Peterson agreed , giving the episode a grade of A- . Although it " got off to a shaky start with some weirdly paced scenes " , it ended up a " finale that wrapped us in sticky threads of old fears , mind @-@ bending new business and one awesome Bon Jovi song " . 
 Brett Love of TV Squad , on the other hand , " [ stopped ] short of calling [ it ] an excellent finale " . While the deal 's payoff was " fantastic " — he was surprised by Dean 's death , and looked forward to its implications for the fourth season — Love was slightly disappointed with Lilith . McCormick " impressed " him as Lilith , but he did not find her as " menacing and scary " as Fredric Lehne 's Azazel . The villain 's storyline of terrorizing a family would have made a " great regular episode " , but was not epic enough for a finale . Diana Steenbergen of IGN felt the scenes of Lilith 's shore leave briefly " [ dragged ] the episode down " because the viewers " understood the situation quickly enough " . She otherwise liked the episode , and gave it a score of 8 @.@ 9 out of 10 . Steenbergen enjoyed the " first @-@ rate brotherly scenes " , and was happy that the series followed through with its promise of sending Dean to Hell , commenting that the related hellhound attack was " one of the scariest things the show has done yet " . Like Charles , she applauded the acting , noting that " we feel [ Dean 's ] fear as the deadline approaches " . She went on to write that Padalecki 's " best moments are in the barely contained rage at his inability to save his brother , and in his grief at losing Dean " , while " Lilith and her little girl mannerisms in Ruby 's body were far more chilling , and interesting , than Ruby 's tough chick persona ever has been " .

When the Serbian is recognized at the airport by facial identification software as Ranko Zamani ( Jamie Jackson ) , the division head answers to Reddington ’ s demands in order to get his help catching Zamani . Reddington insists on working exclusively with Elizabeth Keen ( Megan Boone ) , a profiler who had just been hired . Reddington knows quite a bit about Keen , which convinces her and the SAIC to acquiesce to Reddington ’ s plan . Zamani plans to kidnap and booby trap the daughter of a general responsible for destroying a chemical weapons factory that poisoned Zamani 's family . 
 Keen gets to the girl first but loses her in a daring raid by Zamani 's forces . Now aware of Keen , Zamani attacks her husband , Tom , in their home , gravely wounding him . Keen notes a stamp on the man ’ s hand and deduces the attack will take place at a zoo . Reddington briefly escapes custody to meet with Zamani , revealing that unbeknownst to the FBI , he masterminded the ploy , as well as the attack on Tom . Reddington removes the tracking device and places it with Zamani , which helps the FBI track down and kill the latter . Keen finds the daughter and a bomb in her backpack . Reddington calls in a clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb , who then escapes with it . Reddington tells Elizabeth that her husband , with whom she is trying to adopt a baby , is not what he appears to be . 
 Returning to the FBI , Reddington offers to provide information on a number of the world ’ s dangerous criminals , his “ blacklist , ” in order to commute sentence and work with Keen .

 Despite being set in Washington , D.C. , the series is mainly filmed in the same Manhattan studio where Law & Order was filmed for 20 years . Producer Richard <unk> said they chose to film specific Washington , D.C. locations for " Pilot " because they were " iconic American locations " . These locations included the Lincoln Memorial , the Washington Monument , and the National Mall . In March 2013 , NBC filmed the bridge action scene for " Pilot " on the Michael Valente Memorial Bridge in Long Beach . Since it took two days to film that scene , northbound traffic had to be diverted onto one lane of the southbound bridge .

 = Familial hypercholesterolemia = 
 Familial hypercholesterolemia ( abbreviated FH , also spelled familial hypercholesterolaemia ) is a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels , specifically very high levels of low @-@ density lipoprotein ( LDL , " bad cholesterol " ) , in the blood and early cardiovascular disease . Since individuals with FH underlying body biochemistry is slightly different , their high cholesterol levels are less responsive to the kinds of cholesterol control methods which are usually more effective in people without FH ( such as dietary modification and statin tablets ) . Nevertheless , treatment ( including higher statin doses ) is usually effective . 
 Many people have mutations in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein , which normally removes LDL from the circulation , or apolipoprotein B ( ApoB ) , which is the part of LDL that binds with the receptor ; mutations in other genes are rare . People who have one abnormal copy ( are heterozygous ) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40 . Having two abnormal copies ( being homozygous ) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood . Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder , inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , occurring in 1 : 500 people in most countries ; homozygous FH is much rarer , occurring in 1 in a million births . 
 Heterozygous FH is normally treated with statins , bile acid sequestrants , or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels . New cases are generally offered genetic counseling . Homozygous FH often does not respond to medical therapy and may require other treatments , including LDL apheresis ( removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis ) and occasionally liver transplantation . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 = = = Physical signs = = = 
 High cholesterol levels normally do not cause any symptoms . Yellow deposits of cholesterol @-@ rich fat may be seen in various places on the body such as around the eyelids ( known as xanthelasma <unk> ) , the outer margin of the iris ( known as arcus <unk> <unk> ) , and in the tendons of the hands , elbows , knees and feet , particularly the Achilles tendon ( known as a tendon <unk> ) . 
 = = = Cardiovascular disease = = = 
 Accelerated deposition of cholesterol in the walls of arteries leads to atherosclerosis , the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease . The most common problem in FH is the development of coronary artery disease ( atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart ) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population . This may lead to angina pectoris ( chest pain or tightness on exertion ) or heart attacks . Less commonly , arteries of the brain are affected ; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks ( brief episodes of weakness on one side of the body or inability to talk ) or occasionally stroke . Peripheral artery occlusive disease ( obstruction of the arteries of the legs ) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke ; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest ( intermittent <unk> ) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet ( such as gangrene ) . <unk> risk is increased further with age and in those who smoke , have diabetes , high blood pressure and a family history of cardiovascular disease . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Approximately 85 % of individuals with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid @-@ lowering treatments . Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH . <unk> xanthomas are seen in 20 @-@ 40 % of individuals with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition . A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen . These common signs are supportive of the diagnosis , but are non @-@ specific findings . 
 = = = Lipid measurements = = = 
 Cholesterol levels may be determined as part of health screening for health insurance or occupational health , when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma , <unk> , arcus are noticed , symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop , or a family member has been found to have FH . A pattern compatible with <unk> type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found : raised level of total cholesterol , markedly raised level of low @-@ density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , normal level of high @-@ density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , and normal level of triglycerides . Total cholesterol levels of 350 – 550 mg / dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650 – 1000 mg / dL are typical of homozygous FH . The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile , that is , 75 % of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level . Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese . 
 = = = Mutation analysis = = = 
 On the basis of the isolated high LDL and clinical criteria ( which differ by country ) , genetic testing for LDL receptor mutations and ApoB mutations can be performed . Mutations are detected in between 50 and 80 % of cases ; those without a mutation often have higher triglyceride levels and may in fact have other causes for their high cholesterol , such as combined hyperlipidemia due to metabolic syndrome . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 FH needs to be distinguished from familial combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia . Lipid levels and the presence of <unk> can confirm the diagnosis . <unk> and <unk> <unk> are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas . The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations , cataracts , diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities . 
 = = Genetics = = 
 The most common genetic defects in FH are LDLR mutations ( prevalence 1 in 500 , depending on the population ) , ApoB mutations ( prevalence 1 in 1000 ) , PCSK9 mutations ( less than 1 in 2500 ) and LDLRAP1 . The related disease <unk> , which has many similarities with FH and also features cholesterol accumulation in tissues , is due to <unk> and <unk> mutations . 
 = = = LDL receptor = = = 
 The LDL receptor gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 19 ( <unk> @-@ 13 @.@ 3 ) . It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb , and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form . A single abnormal copy ( heterozygote ) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40 % of cases . Having two abnormal copies ( homozygote ) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood , including its complications . The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor ( LDLR ) . Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2 % , while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2 – 25 % , depending on the nature of the mutation . Over 1000 different mutations are known . 
 There are five major classes of FH due to LDLR mutations : 
 Class I : LDLR is not synthesized at all .
