 At their hotel , McNeill 's Rangers private Sprigg Lynn was directed to Melvin 's room first , and then to Kelley 's . The men were forced to dress at gunpoint and were taken captive along with Crook , who had been staying at the Revere House hotel . Melvin , Kelley , and Crook were sent to Libby Prison in Richmond , and were exchanged for Confederate general Isaac R. Trimble and a guarantee from General Ulysses S. Grant that the treatment of captured McNeill 's Rangers imprisoned at Fort McHenry would be improved . An article published in Richmond 's Enquirer newspaper claimed that Melvin had been caught in bed with " a blushing bride " by McNeill 's men during his capture ; however , Wheeling 's Daily Intelligencer newspaper reminded its readers that the story was baseless , as Melvin was unmarried . 
 Following his release , Melvin served as an adjutant until the end of the war in 1865 . That year , he was honorably discharged as a brevet colonel from the Union Army in recognition of his meritorious services in the line of duty .

 In the fall of 1865 , Melvin was elected prosecuting attorney of Hardy County in the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia . In 1866 he relocated to Wellsburg in Brooke County where he resumed the practice of law . He became a Republican following the war and remained affiliated with the party until his death although he was never a strong partisan . In 1866 , he was again elected as the prosecuting attorney for Hancock County , despite residing in Brooke County . 
 In 1866 , Melvin was nominated as the Republican candidate for Attorney General of West Virginia , and he won his election to the position with 23 @,@ 509 votes , receiving the highest number of votes cast for an attorney in West Virginia 's brief three @-@ year history . On January 1 , 1867 , Melvin began his one @-@ year tenure as attorney general ; he was renominated on June 4 , 1868 at the West Virginia Republican Convention and reelected to the position in fall 1868 . He served in the office until his resignation on July 1 , 1869 . Melvin resigned his post as attorney general to accept an appointment to a circuit judgeship of the First Judicial District of West Virginia which comprised Brooke , Hancock , Marshall , and Ohio counties . He had been appointed to the judgeship by West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Elbert H. Caldwell . 
 While serving as a circuit judge , Melvin was appointed by the governor to assist in completing the codification of West Virginia state laws . Following a dispute between Charles Town and Shepherdstown over the location of Jefferson County 's court , he was selected to serve as the circuit court judge in Charles Town for the fall term , which began on September 12 , 1872 . On August 24 , 1872 , Melvin was elected for a full eight @-@ year term as judge of the First Judicial District , which began on January 1 , 1873 . 
 In 1873 , Melvin refused to transfer the case of Taylor Strauder , a black man , to a federal court following his indictment by an all @-@ white Ohio County grand jury for the murder of his wife . Strauder and his lawyers argued that he would not receive equal treatment in the West Virginia courts due to its all @-@ white jury law and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1866 for a transfer to a federal court . Following Melvin 's ruling , Strauder 's murder trial proceeded in the Ohio County court in May 1873 , and he was inevitably convicted by an all @-@ white jury . Strauder appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States , where his case Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 ( 1879 ) was decided on March 1 , 1880 . The Supreme Court held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries for no other reason than their race violated the Equal Protection Clause , and Strauder 's conviction was overturned due to the Ohio County court 's violation of United States constitutional criminal procedure . 
 On October 12 , 1880 , Melvin was reelected with 7 @,@ 730 votes alongside a second judge to serve the First Judicial District , and he commenced his new term on January 1 , 1881 . He resigned his circuit judgeship on November 19 , 1881 , after tiring of the " wool sack " , which is what he called his judicial court dress . Former West Virginia Governor John Jeremiah Jacob was appointed by Governor Jacob B. Jackson to fill the remainder of Melvin 's unexpired term . 
 Melvin resumed the practice of law in Wheeling . In 1881 , he joined the law practice of J. Dallas Ewing and Thomas S. Riley under the name of Ewing , Melvin & Riley . The law firm became one of the strongest in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia . In 1898 , Melvin and his law partner , Riley , argued on behalf of the West Virginia Board of Public Works before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case , Pittsburgh & c . <unk> v. Board of Public Works of West Virginia 172 U.S. 32 ( 1898 ) , in which the Pittsburgh , Cincinnati , Chicago and St. Louis Railroad sought to avoid paying taxes on its usage of the West Virginia section of a railroad bridge crossing the Ohio River between Steubenville and Wheeling Junction . The court 's decision upheld the law in the Code of West Virginia of 1891 , c . 29 , ยง 67 , that taxed railroad bridges . The court 's decision stated : " A railroad bridge across a navigable river forming the boundary line between two states is not , by reason of being an instrument of interstate commerce , exempt from taxation by either state upon the part within it . " 
 Following the death of Judge Joseph R. Paull in 1899 , Melvin was appointed by Governor George W. Atkinson to fill the unexpired term of Paull 's judicial seat with the unanimous urging of members of the judicial district 's bar . 
 On June 3 , 1900 , Melvin granted an injunction that prevented the Wheeling Stogies baseball team from playing Sunday games in Wheeling . The Stogies had begun holding Sunday games to increase attendance , but received warrants sworn by Wheeling Island residents and a fine on April 29 , 1900 , during their first Sunday game on the island . The Stogies continued to play Sunday games , claiming them to be for charity 's sake ; however , the team 's players were again fined by Judge J. R. LaRue . A local federation of churches and other people opposed to Sunday baseball games applied to Melvin and the circuit court for an injunction to restrict the Stogies and other baseball clubs from playing on Sunday because it was a " public nuisance " . His injunction , the violation of which was a fine of $ 2 @,@ 000 , followed . The team 's lawyers argued that Sunday games met the recreational needs of working @-@ class people , but Melvin and the court did not buy the argument , and Sunday baseball games did not become prevalent in West Virginia for another two decades . 
 Melvin served the remainder of Paull 's unexpired term , and was nominated by both Democratic and Republican parties and reelected for another eight @-@ year term without opposition in November 1900 . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Melvin served out his term until October 31 , 1906 , when he suffered a stroke while holding a session of the circuit court in Wellsburg . He was paralyzed and lost consciousness as a result of the stroke , and was assisted from the bench and taken to Wheeling City Hospital in Ward 5 . By the following day physicians had given up hope for his recovery . Melvin died at 16 : 00 on November 9 , 1906 , at the hospital as a result of apoplexy . His body was taken to the <unk> Hotel on November 10 , where it lay in state until November 12 . Melvin was interred next to his father and mother in his family 's graveyard at United Methodist Cemetery in his hometown of Fairview ( present @-@ day New Manchester ) in Hancock County . 
 Melvin 's estate was valued at $ 30 @,@ 000 . His heirs included his sister , Mrs. S. T. Moore of Fairview , his nephews James and Paul Melvin of Fairview , his nephew John Melvin of New Cumberland , and his niece Mrs. John <unk> of Steubenville . While not an heir , Melvin was also survived by his brother , J. A. B. Melvin , who was president of the Altoona Trust Company . 
 Following his death , lawyer Frank W. Nesbitt was appointed by Governor William M. O. Dawson to fulfill his unexpired term on the circuit court bench .

 Following his death , Melvin was memorialized by the West Virginia Bar Association at its annual meeting in December 1906 . The association averred , " Judge Melvin 's name and character , both as a Judge and as a man , was not only well known and recognized in the Circuit in which he so long occupied the Bench , but known and honored throughout the entire state of West Virginia . " In his Bench and Bar of West Virginia ( 1919 ) , former Governor George W. Atkinson remarked of Melvin 's judicial career : " He sought only to be just and fair , and rarely if ever , failed in deciding right . It was a rare occurrence for one of his decisions to be reversed by the Appellate Court . Furthermore he was one of the most courteous , urbane of men , and was at all times absolutely honest and sincere . "

 Melvin never married . He was a member of the Wheeling Shakespeare Club and was active in several Union veterans ' organizations and reunions . In October 1871 , Melvin delivered an address to welcome the soldiers and attendees of the Army of West Virginia Soldiers ' Reunion in Wheeling . He was later a member of the Society of the Army of West Virginia , later known as the Army of West Virginia Association . In 1883 , and again on September 9 , 1897 , Melvin was elected a vice president of the organization . Melvin was also a member of the 1st West Virginia Association , of which he was elected president on September 6 , 1894 . In addition , Melvin belonged to the Holliday Post of the Grand Army of the Republic and participated in the decoration of local Union graves on Memorial Day in 1897 , 1898 , and 1899 .

 Bedingfield finished recording the album in July 2010 . The project 's title was unveiled through Bedingfield 's official Twitter page on 15 July 2010 . She described the album as " be [ ing ] the next level from what I 've already done .... It 's just more vibrant and exciting . And I can 't wait for people to hear it . " In an interview with Billboard , Bedingfield said : 
 " I 've titled the album Strip Me because its about stripping down who we are as humans . We 're united about our needs , our desires and our pain , all the different things we go through together . Strip Me felt like it explains what the songs are about more than any other title I could think of .

 = Peking opera = 
 Peking opera or Beijing opera ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) is a form of traditional Chinese theatre which combines music , vocal performance , mime , dance , and acrobatics . It arose in the late 18th century and became fully developed and recognized by the mid @-@ 19th century . The form was extremely popular in the Qing dynasty court and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China . Major performance troupes are based in Beijing and Tianjin in the north , and Shanghai in the south . The art form is also preserved in Taiwan ( Republic of China ) , where it is known as <unk> ( traditional Chinese : <unk> ; simplified Chinese : <unk> ; literally : " National theatre " ) . It has also spread to other countries such as the United States and Japan . 
 Peking opera features four main types of performers . Performing troupes often have several of each variety , as well as numerous secondary and tertiary performers . With their elaborate and colorful costumes , performers are the only focal points on Peking opera 's characteristically sparse stage . They use the skills of speech , song , dance , and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive , rather than realistic . Above all else , the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements . Performers also adhere to a variety of stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production . The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music . The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi ( <unk> ) and Erhuang ( <unk> ) styles . Melodies include arias , fixed @-@ tune melodies , and percussion patterns . The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1 @,@ 400 works , which are based on Chinese history , folklore , and , increasingly , contemporary life . 
 Peking opera was denounced as ' feudalistic ' and ' bourgeois ' during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s , and replaced with the eight revolutionary model operas as a means of propaganda and indoctrination . After the Cultural Revolution , these transformations were largely undone . In recent years , Peking opera has attempted numerous reforms in response to sagging audience numbers . These reforms , which include improving performance quality , adapting new performance elements , and performing new and original plays , have met with mixed success . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 " Peking opera " is the English term for the art form ; the term entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1953 . Beijing opera is a more recent equivalent . 
 In China , the art form has been known by many other names in different times and places . The earliest Chinese name was a combination of the Xipi and Erhuang melodies , and was called Pi Huang . As it increased in popularity , its name became Jingju or Jingxi , which reflected its start in the capital city , Jing , and the form of the performance , Xi . From 1927 to 1949 , Beijing was known as Beiping , and Peking opera was known as <unk> or Pingju ( Traditional <unk> , Simplified <unk> ) to reflect this change . Finally , with the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , the name of the capital city was reverted to Beijing , and the formal name of Beijing theatre in Mainland China was established as Jingju . The Taiwanese name for this type of opera , <unk> , national theatre style , reflects disputes over the true seat of the Chinese government . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Peking opera was born when the ' Four Great Anhui Troupes ' brought Anhui opera , or what is now called <unk> , in 1790 to Beijing , for the eightieth birthday of the Qianlong Emperor on 25 September . It was originally staged for the court and only made available to the public later . In 1828 , several famous Hubei troupes arrived in Beijing and performed jointly with Anhui troupes . The combination gradually formed Peking opera 's melodies . Peking opera is generally regarded as having fully formed by 1845 . Although it is called Peking opera ( Beijing theatre style ) , its origins are in the southern Anhui and eastern Hubei , which share the same dialect of <unk> Mandarin ( Lower Yangtze Mandarin ) . Peking opera 's two main melodies , Xipi and Erhuang , were derived from Han Opera after about 1750 . The tune of Peking opera is extremely similar to that of Han opera , therefore Han opera is widely known as the Mother of Peking opera . Xipi literally means ' Skin Puppet Show ' , referring to the puppet show that originated in Shaanxi province . Chinese puppet shows always involve singing . Much dialogue is also carried out in an archaic form of Mandarin Chinese , in which the <unk> Mandarin dialects of Henan and Shaanxi are closest . This form of Mandarin is recorded in the book <unk> <unk> . It also absorbed music from other operas and local Zhili musical art forms . Some scholars believe that the Xipi musical form was derived from the historic <unk> , while many conventions of staging , performance elements , and aesthetic principles were retained from Kunqu , the form that preceded it as court art . 
 Thus , Peking opera is not a monolithic form , but rather a coalescence of many older forms . However , the new form also creates its own innovations . The vocal requirements for all of the major roles were greatly reduced for Peking opera . The Chou , in particular , rarely has a singing part in Peking opera , unlike the equivalent role in Kunqu style . The melodies that accompany each play were also simplified , and are played with different traditional instruments than in earlier forms . Perhaps most noticeably , true acrobatic elements were introduced with Peking opera . The form grew in popularity throughout the 19th century . The Anhui troupes reached their peak of excellence in the middle of the century , and were invited to perform in the court of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom that had been established during the Taiping Rebellion . Beginning in 1884 , the Empress Dowager Cixi became a regular patron of Peking opera , cementing its status over earlier forms like Kunqu . The popularity of Peking opera has been attributed to the simplicity of the form , with only a few voices and singing patterns . This allowed anyone to sing the arias themselves . 
 Peking opera was initially an exclusively male pursuit . The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772 . The appearance of women on the stage began unofficially during the 1870s . Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men . They were given a venue for their talents when Li <unk> , himself a former Peking @-@ opera performer , founded the first female Peking @-@ opera troupe in Shanghai . By 1894 , the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai . This encouraged other female troupes to form , which gradually increased in popularity . As a result , theatre artist Yu <unk> petitioned for the lifting of the ban after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911 . This was accepted , and the ban was lifted in 1912 , although male Dan continued to be popular after this period . 
 = = = Model " revolutionary opera " and Peking opera in Taiwan = = = 
 After the Chinese Civil War , Peking opera became a focal point of identity for both involved parties . When the Communist Party of China came to power in Mainland China in 1949 , the newly formed government moved to bring art into line with Communist ideology , and " to make art and literature a component of the whole revolutionary machine " . To this end , dramatic works without Communist themes were considered subversive , and were ultimately banned during the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 โ 1976 ) . 
 The use of opera as a tool to transmit communist ideology reached its climax in the Cultural Revolution , under the purview of Jiang Qing , wife of Mao Zedong . The ' model operas ' were considered one of the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution , and were meant to express Mao 's view that " art must serve the interests of the workers , peasants , and soldiers and must conform to proletarian ideology . " 
 Among the eight model plays eventually retained during that time were five Peking operas . Notable among these operas was The Legend of the Red Lantern , which was approved as a concert with piano accompaniment based on a suggestion from Jiang Qing . Performances of works beyond the eight model plays were allowed only in heavily modified form . The endings of many traditional plays were changed , and visible stage assistants in Peking opera were eliminated . After the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s , traditional Peking opera began to be performed again . Peking opera and other theatrical art forms were a controversial subject both before and during the Twelfth National People 's Congress in 1982 . A study carried in the People 's Daily revealed that over 80 percent of musical dramas staged in the country were traditional plays from the pre @-@ Communist era , as opposed to newly written historical dramas promoting socialist values . In response , Communist party officials enacted reforms to curb liberalism and foreign influence in theatrical works . 
 After the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan in 1949 , Peking opera there took on a special status of " political symbolism " , in which the Kuomintang government encouraged the art form over other forms of performance in an attempt to claim a position as the sole representative of Chinese culture . This often occurred at the expense of traditional Taiwanese opera . Due to its status as a prestigious art form with a long history , Peking opera has indeed been studied more and received more monetary support than other forms of theater in Taiwan . However , there has also been a competing movement towards advocating native opera to differentiate Taiwan from the mainland . In September 1990 , when the Kuomintang government participated in a state @-@ sponsored mainland cultural event for the first time , a Taiwanese opera group was sent , possibly to emphasize " <unk> " . 
 = = = Modern Peking opera = = = 
 During the second half of the 20th century , Peking opera witnessed a steady decline in audience numbers . This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life . Furthermore , the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles , which hampered the development of the form . The influence of Western culture has also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera . In response , Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s . Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality , employing modern elements to attract new audiences , and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon . However , these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult . 
 In addition to more formal reform measures , Peking @-@ opera troupes during the 1980s also adopted more unofficial changes . Some of those seen in traditional works have been called " technique for technique 's sake " . This has included the use of extended high pitch sequences by female Dan , and the addition of lengthier movement sections and percussion sequences to traditional works . Such changes have generally met with disdain from Peking @-@ opera performers , who see them as ploys to gain immediate audience appeal . Plays with repetitive sequences have also been shortened to hold audience interest . New works have naturally experienced a greater freedom to experiment . Regional , popular , and foreign techniques have been adopted , including Western style makeup and beards and new face paint designs for Jing characters . The spirit of reform continued during the 1990s . To survive in an increasingly open market , troupes like the Shanghai Peking Opera Company needed to bring traditional Peking opera to new audiences . To do this , they have offered an increasing number of free performances in public areas . 
 There has also been a general feeling of a shift in the creative attribution of Peking @-@ opera works . The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking @-@ opera works . However , perhaps following the lead of the West , Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model . Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking @-@ opera producers .

 In addition to its presence in China , Peking opera has spread to many other places . It can be found in Hong Kong , Taiwan , and overseas Chinese communities elsewhere . 
 Mei Lanfang , one of the most famous Dan performers of all time , was also one of the greatest <unk> of Peking opera abroad . During the 1920s , he performed Peking opera in Japan . This inspired an American tour in February 1930 . Although some , such as the actor Otis Skinner , believed that Peking opera could never be a success in the United States , the favorable reception of Mei and his troupe in New York City disproved this notion . The performances had to be relocated from the 49th Street Theater to the larger National Theater , and the duration of the tour extended from two weeks to five . Mei traveled across the United States , receiving honorary degrees from the University of California and Pomona College . He followed this tour with a tour in the Soviet Union in 1935 .

 = = = Training = = = 
 Becoming a Peking opera performer requires a long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age . Before the 20th century , pupils were often handpicked at a young age by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child 's parents . Since the teacher fully provided for the pupil during this period , the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings . After 1911 , training took place in more formally organized schools . Students at these schools rose as early as five o 'clock in the morning for exercises . Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat , and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening . If they made any mistakes during such performances , the entire group was beaten with bamboo canes . Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930 , but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion . New schools were not opened until 1952 . 
 Performers are first trained in acrobatics , followed by singing and gestures . Several performing schools , all based on the styles of famous performers , are taught . Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school , the Cheng <unk> school , the Ma <unk> school , and the Qi <unk> school . Students previously trained exclusively in the art of performance , but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well . Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary , secondary , or tertiary characters accordingly . Students with little acting talent often become Peking @-@ opera musicians . They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers , attendants , and servants that is present in every Peking @-@ opera troupe . In Taiwan , the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking @-@ opera training school . 
 = = = Sheng = = = 
 The Sheng ( ็ ) is the main male role in Peking opera . This role has numerous subtypes . The laosheng is a dignified older role . These characters have a gentle and cultivated disposition and wear sensible costumes . One type of laosheng role is the <unk> , a red @-@ faced older male . The only two <unk> roles are Guan Gong , the Chinese god of sworn brotherhood , loyalty and righteousness , and Zhao Kuang @-@ yin , the first Song Dynasty emperor . Young male characters are known as xiaosheng . These characters sing in a high , shrill voice with occasional breaks to represent the voice changing period of adolescence . Depending on the character 's rank in society , the costume of the xiaosheng may be either elaborate or simple . On @-@ stage , xiaosheng actors are often involved with beautiful women by virtue of the handsome and young image they project . The <unk> is a martial character for roles involving combat . They are highly trained in acrobatics , and have a natural voice when singing . Troupes will always have a laosheng actor . A xiaosheng actor may also be added to play roles fitting to his age . In addition to these main Sheng , the troupe will also have a secondary laosheng . 
 = = = Dan = = = 
 The Dan ( ๆฆ ) refers to any female role in Peking opera . Dan roles were originally divided into five subtypes . Old women were played by <unk> , martial women were <unk> , young female warriors were <unk> , virtuous and elite women were <unk> , and vivacious and unmarried women were <unk> . One of Mei Lanfang 's most important contributions to Peking opera was in pioneering a sixth type of role , the <unk> . This role type combines the status of the <unk> with the sensuality of the <unk> . A troupe will have a young Dan to play main roles , as well as an older Dan for secondary parts . Four examples of famous Dans are Mei Lanfang , Cheng <unk> , Shang <unk> , and Xun <unk> . In the early years of Peking opera , all Dan roles were played by men . Wei <unk> , a male Dan performer in the Qing court , developed the cai <unk> , or " false foot " technique , to simulate the bound feet of women and the characteristic gait that resulted from the practice . The ban on female performers also led to a controversial form of brothel , known as the <unk> tangzi , in which men paid to have sex with young boys dressed as females . Ironically , the performing skills taught to the youths employed in these brothels led many of them to become professional Dan later in life . 
 = = = Jing = = = 
 The Jing ( ๅ ) is a painted face male role . Depending on the repertoire of the particular troupe , he will play either primary or secondary roles . This type of role will entail a forceful character , so a Jing must have a strong voice and be able to exaggerate gestures . Peking opera boasts 15 basic facial patterns , but there are over 1000 specific variations . Each design is unique to a specific character . The patterns and coloring are thought to be derived from traditional Chinese color symbolism and divination on the lines of a person 's face , which is said to reveal personality . Easily recognizable examples of coloring include red , which denotes uprightness and loyalty , white , which represents evil or crafty characters , and black , which is given to characters of soundness and integrity . Three main types of Jing roles are often seen . These include <unk> , roles that heavily involve singing , <unk> , roles with less emphasis on singing and more on physical performance , and <unk> , martial and acrobatic roles . 
 = = = Chou = = = 
 The Chou ( ไธ ) is a male clown role . The Chou usually plays secondary roles in a troupe . Indeed , most studies of Peking opera classify the Chou as a minor role . Chou roles can be divided into Wen Chou , civilian roles such as merchants and jailers , and Wu Chou , minor military roles . The Wu Chou is one of the most demanding in Peking opera , because of its combination of comic acting , acrobatics , and a strong voice . Chou characters are generally amusing and likable , if a bit foolish . Their costumes range from simple for characters of lower status to elaborate , perhaps overly so , for high status characters . Chou characters wear special face paint , called <unk> , that differs from that of Jing characters . The defining characteristic of this type of face paint is a small patch of white chalk around the nose . This can represent either a mean and secretive nature or a quick wit . Originally , there were five roles in Beijing Opera , but the last role " Mo " became a part of " Chou " . 
 Beneath the whimsical persona of the Chou , a serious connection to the form of Peking opera exists . The Chou is the character most connected to the <unk> , the drums and clapper commonly used for musically accompaniment during performances . The Chou actor often uses the <unk> in solo performance , especially when performing Shu Ban , light @-@ hearted verses spoken for comedic effect . The clown is also connected to the small gong and cymbals , percussion instruments that symbolize the lower classes and the raucous atmosphere inspired by the role . Although Chou characters do not sing frequently , their arias feature large amounts of improvisation . This is considered a license of the role , and the orchestra will accompany the Chou actor even as he bursts into an unscripted folk song . However , due to the standardization of Peking opera and political pressure from government authorities , Chou improvisation has lessened in recent years . The Chou has a vocal timbre that is distinct from other characters , as the character will often speak in the common Beijing dialect , as opposed to the more formal dialects of other characters . 
 = = Visual performance elements = = 
 Peking @-@ opera performers use four main skills . The first two are song and speech . The third is dance @-@ acting . This includes pure dance , pantomime , and all other types of dance . The final skill is combat , which includes both acrobatics and fighting with all manner of weaponry . All of these skills are expected to be performed effortlessly , in keeping with the spirit of the art form . 
 = = = Aesthetic aims and principles of movement = = = 
 Peking opera follows other traditional Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning , rather than accuracy . The highest aim of performers is to put beauty into every motion . Indeed , performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training . Additionally , performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera . The four skills of Peking opera are not separate , but rather should be combined in a single performance . One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play , but this does not mean that other actions should cease . Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form , and gestures , settings , music , and character types are determined by long held convention . This includes conventions of movement , which are used to signal particular actions to the audience . For example , walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance , and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak . Some conventions , such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs , are more readily apparent . 
 Many performances deal with behaviors that occur in daily life . However , in accordance with the overriding principle of beauty , such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage . Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality . Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo , mimes or imitation , that is found in western dramas . Peking opera should be suggestive , not imitative . The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters . The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness . Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines . A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object . Similarly , a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right . This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three @-@ dimensional movement as well ; reversals of orientation often take the form of a smooth , S @-@ shaped curve . All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well . 
 = = = Staging and costumes = = = 
 Peking opera stages have traditionally been square platforms . The action on stage is usually visible from at least three sides . The stage is divided into two parts by an embroidered curtain called a <unk> . Musicians are visible to the audience on the front part of the stage . Traditional Peking opera stages were built above the line of sight of the viewers , but some modern stages have been constructed with higher audience seating . Viewers are always seated south of the stage . Therefore , north is the most important direction in Peking opera , and performers will immediately move to " center north " upon entering the stage . All characters enter from the east and exit from the west . In line with the highly symbolic nature of Peking opera , the form uses very few props . This reflects seven centuries of Chinese performance tradition . The presence of large objects is frequently indicated through conventions . The stage will almost always have a table and at least one chair , which can be turned through convention into such diverse objects as a city wall , a mountain , or a bed . Peripheral objects will often be used to signify the presence of a larger , main object . For example , a whip is used to indicate a horse and an oar symbolizes a boat . 
 The length and internal structure of Peking @-@ opera plays is highly variable . Prior to 1949 , zhezixi , short plays or plays made up of short scenes from longer plays , were often performed . These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include all four of the main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers . This format has become less prevalent in recent times , but plays of one act are still performed . These short works , as well as individual scenes within longer works , are marked by an emotional progression from the beginning of the play to the end . For example , the concubine in the one act play The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated begins in a state of joy , and then moves to anger and jealousy , drunken playfulness , and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation . A full @-@ length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes . The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes . Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes , or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists . There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression . It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later zhezixi productions . Some of the most complex plays may even have an emotional progression from scene to scene . 
 Due to the scarcity of props in Peking opera , costumes take on added importance . Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played . Emperors and their families wear yellow robes , and high @-@ ranking officials wear purple . The robe worn by these two classes is called a <unk> , or python robe . It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character , featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery , often in the design of a dragon . Persons of high rank or virtue wear red , lower @-@ ranking officials wear blue , young characters wear white , the old wear white , brown , or olive , and all other men wear black . On formal occasions , lower officials may wear the kuan yi , a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back . All other characters , and officials on informal occasions , wear the <unk> , a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank . All three types of gowns have water sleeves , long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water , attached to facilitate emotive gestures . Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery . Hats are intended to blend in with the rest of the costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery . Shoes may be high or low soled , the former being worn by characters of high rank , and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters . 
 = = Aural performance elements = = 
 = = = Vocal production = = = 
 Vocal production in Peking opera is conceived of as being composed of " four levels of song " : songs with music , verse recitation , prose dialogue , and non @-@ verbal vocalizations . The conception of a sliding scale of vocalization creates a sense of smooth continuity between songs and speech . The three basic categories of vocal production technique are the use of breath ( <unk> ) , pronunciation ( <unk> ) , and special Peking @-@ opera pronunciation ( <unk> ) . 
 In Chinese opera , breath is based in the pubic region and supported by the abdominal muscles . Performers follow the basic principle that " Strong centralized breath moves the melodic @-@ passages " ( <unk> qi xing <unk> ) . Breath is visualized being drawn up through a central breathing cavity extending from the pubic region to the top of the head . This " cavity " must be under the performer 's control at all times , and he or she develops special techniques to control both entering and exiting air . The two major methods of taking in breath are known as " exchanging breath " ( <unk> qi ) and " stealing breath " ( tou qi ) . " <unk> breath " is a slow , unhurried process of breathing out old air and taking in new . It is used at moments when the performer is not under time constraint , such as during a purely instrumental musical passage or when another character is speaking . " Stealing breath " is a sharp intake of air without prior exhalation , and is used during long passages of prose or song when a pause would be undesirable . Both techniques should be invisible to the audience and take in only the precise amount of air required for the intended vocalization . The most important principle in exhalation is " saving the breath " ( cun qi ) . Breath should not be expended all at once at the beginning of a spoken or sung passage , but rather expelled slowly and evenly over its length . Most songs and some prose contain precise written intervals for when breath should be " exchanged " or " stolen " . These intervals are often marked by carats . 
 Pronunciation is conceptualized as shaping the throat and mouth into the shape necessary to produce the desired vowel sound , and clearly articulating the initial consonant . There are four basic shapes for the throat and mouth , corresponding to four vowel types , and five methods of articulating consonants , one for each type of consonant . The four throat and mouth shapes are " opened @-@ mouth " ( <unk> ) , " level @-@ teeth " ( <unk> ) , " closed @-@ mouth " ( <unk> or <unk> ) , and " scooped @-@ lips " ( <unk> ) . The five consonant types are denoted by the portion of the mouth most critical to each type 's production : throat , or larynx ( hou ) ; tongue ( she ) ; molars , or the jaws and palate ( chi ) ; front teeth ( ya ) ; and lips ( chun ) . 
 Some syllables ( written Chinese characters ) have special pronunciations in Peking opera . This is due to the collaboration with regional forms and <unk> that occurred during the development of Peking opera . For example , <unk> , meaning " you " , may be pronounced li , as it is in the Anhui dialect , rather than the Standard Chinese ni . <unk> , meaning " I " and pronounced wo in Standard Chinese , becomes <unk> , as it is pronounced in the dialect of Suzhou . In addition to pronunciation differences that are due to the influence of regional forms , the readings of some characters have been changed to promote ease of performance or vocal variety . For example , zhi , chi , shi , and ri sounds do not carry well and are difficult to sustain , because they are produced far back in the mouth . Therefore , they are performed with an additional i sound , as in <unk> . 
 These techniques and conventions of vocal production are used to create the two main categories of vocalizations in Peking opera : stage speech and song . 
 = = = Stage speech = = = 
 Peking opera is performed using both Classical Chinese and Modern Standard Chinese with some slang terms added for color . The social position of the character being played determines the type of language that he or she uses . Peking opera features three major types of stage speech ( <unk> ) . Monologues and dialogue , which make up the majority of most plays , consist of prose speeches . The purpose of prose speech is to advance the plot of the play or inject humor into a scene . They are usually short , and are performed mostly using vernacular language . However , as Elizabeth Wichmann points out , they also have rhythmic and musical elements , achieved through the " stylized articulation of monosyllabic sound units " and the " stylized pronunciation of speech @-@ tones " , respectively . Prose speeches were frequently improvised during the early period of Peking opera 's development , and chou performers carry on that tradition today . 
 The second main type of stage speech consists of quotations drawn from classical Chinese poetry . This type is rarely used in Peking opera ; plays have one or two such quotations at most , and often none at all . In most instances , the use of classical poetry is intended to heighten the impact of a scene . However , Chou and more whimsical Dan characters may misquote or misinterpret the classical lines , creating a comical effect . 
 The final category of stage speech is conventionalized stage speeches ( <unk> <unk> ) . These are rigid formulations that mark important transition points . When a character enters for the first time , an " entrance speech " ( <unk> ) or " self @-@ introduction speech " ( zi bao <unk> ) is given , which includes a prelude poem , a set @-@ the @-@ scene poem , and a prose set @-@ the @-@ scene speech , in that order . The style and structure of each entrance speech is inherited from earlier Yuan Dynasty , Ming Dynasty , folk , and regional forms of Chinese opera . Another conventionalized stage speech is the exit speech , which may take the form of a poem followed by a single spoken line . This speech is usually delivered by a supporting character , and describes his or her present situation and state of mind . Finally , there is the recapitulation speech , in which a character will use prose to recount the story up to that point . These speeches came about as a result of the zhezixi tradition of performing only one part of a larger play . 
 = = = Song = = = 
 There are six main types of song lyrics in Peking opera : emotive , condemnatory , narrative , descriptive , <unk> , and " shared space separate sensations " lyrics . Each type uses the same basic lyrical structure , differing only in kind and degree of emotions portrayed . Lyrics are written in couplets ( lian ) consisting of two lines ( ju ) . <unk> can consist of two ten character lines , or two seven character lines . The lines are further subdivided into three dou ( lit . " pause " ) , typically in a 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 or 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 pattern . Lines may be " padded " with extra characters for the purpose of clarifying meaning . Rhyme is an extremely important device in Peking opera , with thirteen identified rhyme categories . Song lyrics also use the speech tones of Mandarin Chinese in ways that are pleasing to the ear and convey proper meaning and emotion . The first and second of Chinese 's four tones are normally known as " level " ( ping ) tones in Peking opera , while the third and fourth are called " oblique " ( ze ) . The closing line of every couplet in a song ends in a level tone . 
 Songs in Peking opera are proscribed by a set of common aesthetic values . A majority of songs are within a pitch range of an octave and a fifth . High pitch is a positive aesthetic value , so a performer will pitch songs at the very top of his or her vocal range . For this reason , the idea of a song 's key has value in Peking opera only as a technical tool for the performer . Different performers in the same performance may sing in different keys , requiring the accompanying musicians to constantly retune their instruments or switch out with other players . Elizabeth Wichmann describes the ideal basic timbre for Peking opera songs as a " controlled nasal tone " . Performers make extensive use of vocal vibrato during songs , in a way that is " slower " and " wider " than vibrato used in Western performances . The Peking opera aesthetic for songs is summed up by the expression zi zheng qiang yuan , meaning that the written characters should be delivered accurately and precisely , and the melodic passages should be weaving , or " round " . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The accompaniment for a Peking opera performance usually consists of a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments . The lead melodic instrument is the jinghu , a small , high @-@ pitched , two @-@ string spike fiddle . The jinghu is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs . Accompaniment is <unk> โ the jinghu player follows the basic contours of the song 's melody , but diverges in pitch and other elements . The jinghu often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings , and does so an octave lower . During rehearsal , the jinghu player adopts his or her own signature version of the song 's melody , but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations on the part of the performer due to changed performance conditions . Thus , the jinghu player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer . 
 The second is the circular bodied plucked lute , the <unk> . Percussion instruments include the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The player of the gu and ban , a small high pitch drum and clapper , is the conductor of the entire ensemble . The two main musical styles of Peking opera , Xipi and Erhuang , originally differed in subtle ways . In the Xipi style , the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed , possibly reflecting the style 's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the <unk> opera of northwestern China . It is commonly used to tell joyous stories . In Erhuang , on the other hand , the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low , soft , and despondent folk tunes of south @-@ central Hubei province , the style 's place of origin . As a result , it is used for lyrical stories . Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar . The two musical styles share six different tempos , including <unk> ( a slow tempo ) , <unk> ( a standard , medium @-@ fast tempo ) , <unk> <unk> ( " leading beat " ) , <unk> ( " leading beat " ) , <unk> ( " rubato beat " ) , and <unk> ( " shaking beat " ) . The <unk> style also uses several unique tempos , including <unk> ( " two @-@ six " ) , and <unk> ( a fast tempo ) . Of these tempos , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are most commonly seen . The tempo at any given time is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director . Erhuang has been seen as more improvisational , and Xipi as more tranquil . The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today . 
 The melodies played by the accompaniment mainly fall into three broad categories . The first is the aria . The arias of Peking opera can be further divided into those of the Erhuang and Xipi varieties . An example of an aria is <unk> <unk> , an aria in the Xipi style that is sung by a young Sheng to indicate heightened emotion . The second type of melody heard in Peking opera is the fixed @-@ tune melody , or <unk> . These are instrumental tunes that serve a wider range of purposes than arias . Examples include the " Water Dragon Tune " ( shui long yin ) , which generally denotes the arrival of an important person , and " Triple Thrust " ( ji san qiang ) , which may signal a feast or banquet . The final type of musical accompaniment is the percussion pattern . Such patterns provide context to the music in ways similar to the fixed @-@ tune melodies . For example , there are as many as 48 different percussion patterns that accompany stage entrances . Each one identifies the entering character by his or her individual rank and personality . 
 = = Repertoire = = 
 The repertoire of Peking opera includes nearly 1 @,@ 400 works . The plays are mostly taken from historical novels or traditional stories about civil , political and military struggles . Early plays were often adaptations from earlier Chinese theatre styles , such as <unk> . Nearly half of 272 plays listed in 1824 were derived from earlier styles . Many classification systems have been used to sort the plays . Two traditional methods have existed since Peking opera first appeared in China . The oldest and most generally used system is to sort plays into civil and martial types . Civil plays focus on the relationships between characters , and feature personal , domestic , and romantic situations . The element of singing is frequently used to express emotion in this type of play . Martial plays feature a greater emphasis on action and combat skill . The two types of play also feature different arrays of performers . Martial plays predominantly feature young sheng , jing , and chou , while civil plays have a greater need for older roles and dan . In addition to being civil or martial , plays are also classified as either <unk> ( serious ) or <unk> ( light ) . The performance elements and performers used in serious and light plays greatly resemble those used in martial and civil plays , respectively . Of course , the aesthetic principle of synthesis frequently leads to the use of these contrasting elements in combination , yielding plays that defy such dichotomous classification . 
 Since 1949 , a more detailed classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play 's creation . The first category in this system is <unk> , traditional plays that were in performance before 1949 . The second category is <unk> de <unk> , historical plays written after 1949 . This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution , but is a major focus today . The final category is <unk> , contemporary plays . The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond . Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature , and may incorporate Western influences . In the second half of the 20th century , Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera . The works of Shakespeare have been especially popular . The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre . Peking opera in particular has seen versions of A Midsummer Night 's Dream and King Lear , among others . 
 = = Film = = 
 Peking opera and its stylistic devices have appeared in many Chinese films . It often was used to signify a unique " <unk> " in contrast to sense of culture being presented in Japanese films . Fei Mu , a director of the pre @-@ Communist era , used Peking opera in a number of plays , sometimes within " Westernized " , realistic plots . King Hu , a later Chinese film director , used many of the formal norms of Peking opera in his films , such as the parallelism between music , voice , and gesture . In the 1993 film Farewell My Concubine , by Chen <unk> , Peking opera serves as the object of pursuit for the protagonists and a backdrop for their romance . However , the film 's portrayal of Peking opera has been criticized as one @-@ dimensional . Chen returned to the subject again in 2008 with the Mei Lanfang biopic Forever <unk> . Peking opera is also featured in Peking Opera Blues by Tsui Hark . 
 = = Peking @-@ opera houses in Beijing = = 
 Fundamental to the performance and overall ambience of traditional Peking opera is the venue . There are many restored venues in Beijing dating from the late 17th century onwards , the opera stage at Prince Gong Mansion , <unk> @-@ xi @-@ <unk> and Huguang Guild Hall , being among them . However , modern venues for the general operatic and theatre stage are also common , such as the National Centre for the Performing Arts , and the Chang 'an Grand Theatre located on the East Chang 'an Avenue is an example of modern Peking opera theatre . 
 = Squab pie = 
 Squab pie is a traditional dish from South West England , with early records showing it was associated with Cornwall , Devon and Gloucestershire . Although the name suggests it contains squab ( young domestic pigeon ) , in fact it contains mutton and apples . The pie was eaten around the world in the 1900s , though outside South West England it generally did contain pigeon . It is no longer a popular dish , with less than 3 % of British teenagers surveyed having eaten it . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Although it is not known exactly where squab pie was first made , it is clear that it was somewhere in South West England . There are references to it originating in Gloucestershire , Devon and Cornwall . Although it appears that squab pie did originally contain pigeons , mutton and apples have been used as a substitute since at least 1737 using a recipe that has remained in cookbooks for years afterwards . This <unk> has meant that the pie is considered to be a surprise . Squab is described as tender with a mild berry flavour , and so it is possible that the combination of mutton and apples created a similar flavour . There is also a theory that the name squab pie is short for " squabble pie " , as it stems from a disagreement over whether to have a meat or apple pie . 
 There are many variations to the squab pie in England , although it traditionally includes mutton , it has come to mean a pie with many ingredients or a " scraps pie " . Squab pie in Devon can be served with clotted cream . Alternatively , in America , it is cooked with squab , and is synonymous with pigeon pie . 
 = = Recipe = = 
 Squab pie is a mutton pie with a shortcrust pastry lid . It should be made with at least one layer of onions , followed by alternating layers of sliced apples and mutton chops . The mixture should be covered with water , though less than in some pies , covered with pastry and baked in the oven for about two hours . 
 = = = Variations = = = 
 Within the UK , the most common variation is to use lamb instead of mutton . Gloucester Squab pie did not require lamb and suggests any leftover meat could be used . Other ingredients can be included , for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard @-@ boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with clotted cream and adds cream to thicken . 
 Outside of England , the concept of squab pie does exist , but in a more literal form actually containing squab . Known as <unk> All <unk> , one Italian chef explains that he is aware that the recipe does not match the traditional English version , but he " [ does ] not care a fig " . In America , squab pie still uses squab . It was included in a " Cooking for profit " book in San Francisco , to make a pie using 18 squabs in a gravy . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 In 2009 , less than 3 % of British teenagers had tried the dish and it has been listed amongst the " at risk " British Classics . A prominent critic of squab pie was Charles Dickens ' journal All the Year Round : 
 Of all the west country pies , squab pie is , in our humble estimation , the most incongruous and the most detestable . The odious composition is made of fat clumsy mutton chops , embedded in layers of sliced apples , shredded onions , and โ O <unk> ! O mores ! โ brown sugar ! The result is nausea , unsociability , and , in course of time , hatred of the whole human race . The greasy sugary , <unk> taste is associated , in our mind , with the detested name of Bideford . 
 Using its many ingredients definition , squab pie was used by <unk> as an analogy for New York City . This is a positive comparison , explaining that New York does " not smell bad ... nor look uninviting " and that it is " a wonder and a success " . 
 = = = Poetry = = = 
 Squab pie has been the subject of poetry . In " The Squab @-@ Pie . A Devonshire Tale " published in 1827 , John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip . A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny , though it was not meant to be his . Set on a Sunday , the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker so that they would not have to cook , try to find it , but to no avail . Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday , you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you . 
 The ingredients are given in verse by a Cornishman from Bodmin , during William Sandys ' 1846 tour around Cornwall . Sandys also includes a story of Christmas @-@ time in Cornwall which includes the pie served with mashed potatoes and pilchards . In " Verses Occasioned by Ben Tyrrell 's Mutton Pies " , published in 1772 , Thomas Warton also confirmed that the squab pie was mutton based and came from Cornwall . The Devon author , William Crossing , writing in 1911 , discusses a short folk rhyme about squab pie : " Mutton , onions , apples and dough , Make a good pie as any I know . " He does not say , however , from where he heard it . In the song " Glorious Devon " written by Sir Edward German in 1905 , several Devonshire dishes receive praise : " Squab pie , junket and cider brew , Richest cream of the cow , What ' ud Old England without ' em do ? " 
 = = = The Devil in Cornwall = = = 
 Another legend surrounding squab pie , along with the other unusual pies of Cornwall , is that they were the reason that the Devil never came to Cornwall . In his book Popular Romances of the West of England ; or , The drolls , traditions , and superstitions of old Cornwall , a collection of Cornish traditions , Robert Hunt explains that the Devil crossed the River Tamar to Torpoint . The chapter , entitled " The Devil 's <unk> , etc . " , reasons that the Devil discovered the Cornish would put anything in a pie and decided to leave before they took a fancy to a " <unk> " pie , returning to Devon . 
 = 1884 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1884 Atlantic hurricane season was one of only three Atlantic hurricane seasons , along with 1852 and 1858 , in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status . Overall , four tropical cyclones developed , three of which made landfall . The first system was initially observed over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean on September 1 . It struck Newfoundland the following day , but impact there is unknown . On September 3 , the next hurricane developed , though it did not effect land in its duration . The third hurricane struck Georgia , accompanied by damaging waves in north Florida . 
 The final storm was last noted on October 17 . These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic . Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously . The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica , resulting in eight deaths . This storm also left damage to crops and vessels in portions of the Bahamas and Cuba . Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s , historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive . An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated . 
 The season 's activity was quantified by an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 72 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm intensity .

 The first storm of the season was spotted by the steamship State of Nebraska , while located about midway between Bermuda and Sable Island at 00 : 00 UTC on September 1 . Initially , sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) were observed , equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane . Later on September 1 , the bark Engelbert lost spars and sail to the east of Sable Island . Additionally , the Naupactus encountered heavy seas and lost of portion of its deckload . Early on September 2 , the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm . Shortly thereafter , it made landfall in southeastern Newfoundland . Accelerating northeastward , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 00 : 00 UTC on September 3 , while located about 460 mi ( 740 km ) northeast of St. John 's , Newfoundland and Labrador . The extratropical remnants moved east @-@ northeastward across the Atlantic and struck Ireland , before dissipating late on September 6 . This hurricane was added to HURDAT based on a study by Jose F. Partagas and Henry F. Diaz in 1996 .

 Another tropical storm was first observed by the bark <unk> at 00 : 00 UTC on September 3 , while located about 850 mi ( 1 @,@ 370 km ) northeast of Cayenne , French Guiana . Moving west @-@ northwestward , the storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on September 5 . The brig <unk> was damaged by the hurricane and was leaky and dismasted upon arrival in Saint Thomas , U.S. Virgin Islands . By midday on September 6 , the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane . Early the following day , the system further intensified into a Category 3 hurricane while curving northeastward . 
 At 12 : 00 UTC on September 7 , the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 957 mbar ( 28 @.@ 3 inHg ) . Early the following day , the system weakened to a Category 2 hurricane . Around 00 : 00 UTC on September 12 , the storm deteriorated further to a Category 1 hurricane . The next day , the hurricane began accelerating to the northeast . The steamship Marseille encountered the storm on September 14 and suffered damage . By midday on September 15 , the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and dissipated late on September 16 , while located about 575 mi ( 925 km ) west @-@ southwest of Ireland .

 Early on September 10 , the steamship City of Palatka encountered a tropical storm , while located about 90 mi ( 140 km ) east @-@ northeast of Cape Canaveral , Florida . Heading northwestward , the storm made landfall in a rural area of McIntosh County , Georgia at 01 : 00 UTC on September 11 , with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Hours later , the system weakened to a tropical depression . Late on September 12 , the depression re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and soon re @-@ strengthened into a tropical storm . Thereafter , the storm headed southeastward and then eastward while slowly intensifying . By September 14 , the system turned southward and became a Category 1 hurricane . It curved west @-@ southwestward on September 15 , then doubled @-@ back by the following day . 
 The hurricane accelerated east @-@ northeastward starting on September 17 , before turning northeastward on September 18 . Around 06 : 00 UTC , the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 979 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) . At 00 : 00 UTC on September 20 , the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated about 575 mi ( 925 km ) east of St. John 's , Newfoundland and Labrador . Unusually high tides were reported at St. Johns , Florida , causing considerable damage to wharves and freight between September 15 and September 18 , long after the storm moved offshore the Southeastern United States .

 The final known tropical cyclone of the season was first observed in the Caribbean Sea by the steamship Cienfuegos on October 7 , while located about 120 mi ( 190 km ) south @-@ southeast of Kingston , Jamaica . That day , the storm dropped heavy rainfall on the island , resulting in at least eight fatalities . Moving north @-@ northeastward , the system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on October 8 . Early the next day , the hurricane made landfall in Cuba near modern @-@ day Guantรกnamo Bay with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . While crossing the island , the system weakened to a tropical storm on October 9 . In Oriente Province , " some heavy damage " and several injuries were reported . Around midday on October 9 , the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Frank Paรญs , Cuba . 
 Continuing northward , the system became a Category 1 hurricane again on October 11 . In the Bahamas , considerable damage was inflicted upon crops and fruit plantations . A number of shipping vessels were also lost . The brigantine Emma L. Hall , which was carrying 12 @,@ 000 bushels of salt , suffered severe damage . At Grand Turk Island , the hurricane was considered the worst storm in 25 years . After moving north of the Bahamas , the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on October 14 and peaked with sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . Shortly thereafter , the hurricane curved north @-@ northeastward and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane on the next day . Further weakening occurred and the system fell to tropical storm intensity by October 17 . The storm was last noted about 450 mi ( 720 km ) southeast of Bermuda . 
 = Wacht @-@ class aviso = 
 The Wacht class was a pair of avisos built by the Imperial German Navy in the late @-@ 1880s ; the class comprised two ships , Wacht and Jagd . They were laid down in 1886 and 1887 and completed by 1888 and 1889 , respectively . The ships were based on the previous aviso , SMS Greif , which had proved to be an unsuccessful design due to its lack of torpedo armament . As a result , the Wacht @-@ class ships were equipped with three torpedo tubes to improve their combat power ; they were also the first German avisos to carry armor protection . 
 Both ships served in the main German fleet for the entirety of their active duty careers . They were primarily employed in the peacetime routine of unit and fleet training maneuvers . In September 1901 , Wacht was accidentally rammed by the ironclad SMS Sachsen during the annual fleet maneuvers . The collision caused serious damage to Wacht and she quickly sank . Jagd continued in service for another three years , after which she was withdrawn from service and used in various roles over the following sixteen years . She was sold for scrapping in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Imperial Navy began building small avisos in the 1880s to serve in the main fleet in German waters . These vessels were intended to support the battle line , and so unlike the contemporary German unprotected cruisers , their designs emphasized offensive capability and high speed rather than a long cruising radius . The Wacht class followed the previous aviso , SMS Greif . The ship had proved to be a disappointment in service , since it carried no torpedo armament . As a result , the Wacht design returned to the torpedo as its primary armament like earlier vessels such as the Blitz class . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Wacht @-@ class ships were 84 meters ( 276 ft ) long at the waterline and 85 @.@ 5 m ( 281 ft ) long overall . They had a beam of 9 @.@ 66 m ( 31 @.@ 7 ft ) and a maximum draft of 3 @.@ 74 m ( 12 @.@ 3 ft ) forward and 4 @.@ 67 m ( 15 @.@ 3 ft ) aft . They displaced 1 @,@ 246 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 226 long tons ; 1 @,@ 373 short tons ) as designed and up to 1 @,@ 499 t ( 1 @,@ 475 long tons ; 1 @,@ 652 short tons ) at full combat load . Their hulls were constructed from transverse steel frames . Wacht and Jagd each had a crew of 7 officers and 134 enlisted men . The ships carried several smaller boats , including one picket boat , one yawl , one dinghy , and one cutter . They were poor sea boats ; they rolled and pitched badly and were very wet . They were also not particularly maneuverable vessels . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 Their propulsion system consisted of two angled 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines that each drove a 3 @.@ 3 m ( 11 ft ) wide three @-@ bladed screw . Steam for the engines was provided by four coal @-@ fired locomotive boilers trunked into a single funnel amidships . In 1891 โ 93 , new boilers manufactured by Schichau @-@ Werke and the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Wilhelmshaven were installed . The ships were equipped with a pair of electric generators with a combined output of 20 kilowatts ( 27 hp ) at 67 volts . 
 The ships ' propulsion system provided a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) and was rated at 4 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 000 kW ) , though neither ship reached that horsepower in service . They carried up to 230 t ( 230 long tons ; 250 short tons ) of coal , which enabled them to steam for approximately 2 @,@ 860 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 300 km ; 3 @,@ 290 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Steering was controlled by a single rudder . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 As built , the ships were armed with three 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) K L / 35 guns placed in single pivot mounts . The guns were supplied with a total of 180 rounds of ammunition and had a range of 7 @,@ 000 m ( 23 @,@ 000 ft ) . Wacht and Jagd also carried three 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , one mounted submerged in the bow and the other two in deck @-@ mounted launchers on the broadside . In 1891 , four 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns in single mounts replaced the 10 @.@ 5 cm guns . 
 The ships were the first German aviso to carry armor : a 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) thick deck with 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick sloped sides protected the magazines and engine rooms . The conning tower was protected with 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) of armor plating on the sides and 10 mm on the roof . The coaming around the funnel was 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The armor consisted of compound wrought iron . For protection against underwater attack , the hull was divided into twelve watertight compartments below the armored deck and ten compartments above it . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Wacht and Jagd were both built by the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen . Wacht was laid down in 1886 and Jagd followed in 1887 . Wacht was launched on 27 August 1887 and commissioned into the German fleet on 9 August 1888 after fitting @-@ out work was completed . Jagd was launched on 7 July 1888 and completed by 25 June 1889 , when she was commissioned into the fleet . 
 Both Wacht and Jagd served with the German fleet in home waters ; Wacht in the Maneuver Squadron from 1889 and Jagd in the Training Squadron from 1891 . Wacht and the rest of the Maneuver Squadron went on a major cruise in the Mediterranean Sea in 1889 โ 90 . In 1893 , Jagd joined Wacht in the Maneuver Squadron , and both ships served there , alternating between the I and II Divisions for the rest of the decade . Their activities consisted of periodic divisional and squadron training maneuvers , which culminated in the annual autumn fleet maneuvers in late August and early September . 
 On 4 September 1901 , Wacht accidentally collided with the ironclad Sachsen during training exercises . Sachsen , which was equipped with a ram bow , tore a hole in Wacht 's hull below the waterline . The battleship Weissenburg attempted to tow Wacht to shallow water where she could be grounded , but the flooding proved to be impossible to control and Wacht quickly sank . Jagd meanwhile remained in service until 1904 , when she was withdrawn and used as a harbor ship . She was stricken in May 1910 and subsequently hulked . Later , she was moved to Friedrichsort , outside Kiel , where she was used as a firing platform for torpedo training through World War I. In 1920 , she was sold for scrap . 
 = U.S. Route 77 in Iowa = 
 U.S. Highway 77 ( US 77 ) is the shortest U.S. Highway in the state of Iowa . It crosses into Iowa over the Missouri River from South Sioux City , Nebraska , at Sioux City and runs approximately three @-@ tenths mile ( 500 m ) to an interchange with Interstate 29 where the road continues north as Wesley Parkway . Like all other state highways in Iowa , the route is maintained by the Iowa Department of Transportation . 
 US 77 has never been a long route in Iowa . When it was extended into the state in 1929 , it only traveled 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) in Sioux City before crossing the Big Sioux River into South Dakota . After I @-@ 29 was built in Sioux City during the late 1950s , US 77 was moved onto the new Interstate Highway . At both historic ends of the highway in Iowa , bridge failures have caused US 77 to be detoured around Sioux City . In the mid @-@ 1980s , the national end of the highway was moved to the interchange with I @-@ 29 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 77 in Iowa begins on the <unk> Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Missouri River . It heads north along Wesley Parkway where it comes to an interchange with Interstate 29 ( I @-@ 29 ) , U.S. Highway 20 Business ( US 20 Business ) , and Iowa Highway 12 ( Iowa 12 ) . On either side of the interchange Iowa 12 is an unsigned highway ; east of the interchange , the route is signed as US 20 Business , while on the west side it is a duplicate route with I @-@ 29 . US 20 Business exits Wesley Parkway and briefly overlaps I @-@ 29 . US 77 ends at the center of the interchange . The entire route is 0 @.@ 315 mi ( 1 @,@ 660 ft ; 507 m ) long . 
 At 0 @.@ 31 miles ( 500 m ) , US 77 is the shortest U.S. Highway in the state and the second shortest state highway overall .

 US 77 has never been a long route in Iowa . It was extended into Iowa in 1929 , overlapping US 20 across the Combination Bridge and onto Perry Street . US 20 turned east onto 5th Street and US 77 turned west one block north onto Riverside Avenue , now known as 4th Street . It followed Riverside west and onto a curvy section near the confluence of the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers . The route curved back to the north along the banks of the Big Sioux River . It turned west onto Military Road and crossed the river into South Dakota shortly thereafter . The route at its longest extent was 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) . The portion of the route west of US 20 replaced a section of Primary Road No. 141 , which followed a route parallel to US 77 's . 
 In 1951 , Gordon Drive , which carried US 20 east of the Combination Bridge , was extended westward along the banks of the Missouri River . It connected to Riverside Avenue near the river confluence . US 77 was moved onto the new road which removed the curvy section of Riverside . In the late 1950s when construction of I @-@ 29 began , its route was planned along the banks of the Missouri River generally following the path of US 275 , US 75 , and US 77 . The first section of I @-@ 29 , from a point along Gordon Drive east of the Combination Bridge to the Big Sioux River opened around October 1 , 1958 . US 77 was moved onto the new interstate from the Combination Bridge to the Riverside Boulevard interchange . 
 After sections of I @-@ 29 in South Dakota opened up , allowing traffic to utilize bridges crossing the Big Sioux that were built in 1958 , US 77 was moved onto the interstate completely . However , the arrangement did not last long . On April 2 , 1962 , surging flood waters from the Big Sioux brought down the northbound bridge over the river . An investigation of the collapse found the surging waters scoured the dirt and rocks away from around the bridge piers , which caused them to fail . Both directions of traffic were routed along US 77 's old alignment while the bridges were repaired . 
 US 77 faced more bridge problems at its other end . In the late @-@ 1970s and early @-@ 1980s , a steel , tied arch bridge was built to replace the Combination Bridge , which opened in 1895 . The <unk> Veterans Memorial Bridge opened to traffic in January 1981 and was dedicated months later on July 22 . This too , would not last long . During routine bridge washing on May 6 , 1982 , an Iowa DOT worker discovered a 30 @-@ inch @-@ long ( 76 cm ) crack across a box girder . The crack was approximately 1 โ 32 inch ( 0 @.@ 79 mm ) wide and was rusted , which told the workers it had been there for some time . The bridge was immediately closed down for repairs . Traffic was rerouted south to cross the Missouri at the I @-@ 129 bridge . The bridge would not be fully opened again until May 1983 . 
 Within a couple years , US 77 would be truncated to the I @-@ 29 interchange . The completion of Interstate 29 in South Dakota , which generally followed US 77 northward , meant the end of the U.S. Highway 's importance . Maps published by the Iowa DOT in 1983 and traffic logs from 1984 show and list US 77 extending into South Dakota . Highway maps and traffic logs from 1986 show US 77 ending at I @-@ 29 , meaning the route was shortened at some time in those two years .

 = Siege of Fort William Henry = 
 The Siege of Fort William Henry was conducted in August 1757 by French General Louis @-@ Joseph de Montcalm against the British @-@ held Fort William Henry . The fort , located at the southern end of Lake George , on the frontier between the British Province of New York and the French Province of Canada , was garrisoned by a poorly supported force of British regulars and provincial militia led by Lieutenant Colonel George Monro . After several days of bombardment , Monro surrendered to Montcalm , whose force included nearly 2 @,@ 000 Indians from a large number of tribes . The terms of surrender included the withdrawal of the garrison to Fort Edward , with specific terms that the French military protect the British from the Indians as they withdrew from the area . 
 In one of the most notorious incidents of the French and Indian War , Montcalm 's Indian allies violated the agreed terms of surrender and attacked the British column , which had been deprived of ammunition , as it left the fort . They killed and scalped a significant number of soldiers , took as captives women , children , servants , and slaves , and slaughtered sick and wounded prisoners . Early accounts of the events called it a massacre , and implied that as many as 1 @,@ 500 people were killed , though it is unlikely more than 200 people ( less than 10 % of the British fighting strength ) were actually killed in the massacre . 
 The exact role of Montcalm and other French leaders in encouraging or defending against the actions of their allies , and the total number of casualties incurred as a result of their actions , is a subject of historical debate . The memory of the killings influenced the actions of British military leaders , especially those of British General Jeffery Amherst , for the remainder of the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 The French and Indian War started in 1754 over territorial disputes between the North American colonies of France and Great Britain in areas that are now western Pennsylvania and upstate New York . The first few years of the war had not gone particularly well for the British . A major expedition by General Edward Braddock in 1755 ended in disaster , and British military leaders were unable to mount any campaigns the following year . In a major setback , a French and Indian army led by General Louis @-@ Joseph de Montcalm captured the garrison and destroyed fortifications in the Battle of Fort Oswego in August 1756 . In July 1756 the Earl of Loudoun arrived to take command of the British forces in North America , replacing William Shirley , who had temporarily assumed command after Braddock 's death . 
 = = = British planning = = = 
 Loudoun 's plan for the 1757 campaign was submitted to the government in London in September 1756 , and was focused on a single expedition aimed at the heart of New France , the city of Quebec . It called for a purely defensive postures along the frontier with New France , including the contested corridor of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain between Albany , New York and Montreal . Following the Battle of Lake George in 1755 , the French had begun construction of Fort Carillon ( now known as Fort Ticonderoga ) near the southern end of Lake Champlain , while the British had built Fort William Henry at the southern end of Lake George , and Fort Edward on the Hudson River , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) south of Fort William Henry . The area between William Henry and Carillon was a wilderness dominated by Lake George that historian Ian Steele described as " a military waterway that left opposing cannons only a few days apart . " 
 Loudoun 's plan depended on the expedition 's timely arrival at Quebec , so that French troops would not have the opportunity to move against targets on the frontier , and would instead be needed to defend the heartland of the province of Canada along the Saint Lawrence River . However , political turmoil in London over the progress of the Seven Years ' War both in North America and in Europe resulted in a change of power , with William Pitt the Elder rising to take control over military matters . Loudoun consequently did not receive any feedback from London on his proposed campaign until March 1757 . Before this feedback arrived he developed plans for the expedition to Quebec , and worked with the provincial governors of the Thirteen Colonies to develop plans for a coordinated defence of the frontier , including the allotment of militia quotas to each province . 
 When William Pitt 's instructions finally reached Loudoun in March 1757 , they called for the expedition to first target Louisbourg on the Atlantic coast of รle Royale , now known as Cape Breton Island . Although this did not materially affect the planning of the expedition , it was to have significant consequences on the frontier . The French forces on the Saint Lawrence would be too far from Louisbourg to support it , and would consequently be free to act elsewhere . Loudoun assigned his best troops to the Louisbourg expedition , and placed Brigadier General Daniel Webb in command of the New York frontier . He was given about 2 @,@ 000 regulars , primarily from the 35th and 60th ( Royal American ) Regiments . The provinces were to supply Webb with about 5 @,@ 000 militia . 
 = = = French planning = = = 
 Following the success of his 1756 assault on Fort Oswego , Montcalm had been seeking an opportunity to deal with the British position at Fort William Henry , since it provided the British with a launching point for attacks against Fort Carillon . He was initially hesitant to commit his limited resources against Fort William Henry without knowing more about the disposition of British forces . Intelligence provided by spies in London arrived in the spring , indicating that the British target was probably Louisbourg . This suggested that troop levels on the British side of the frontier might be low enough to make an attack on Fort William Henry feasible . This idea was further supported after the French questioned deserters and captives taken during periodic scouting and raiding expeditions that both sides conducted , including one resulting in the January Battle on Snowshoes . 
 As early as December 1756 , New France 's governor , the Marquis de Vaudreuil , began the process of recruiting Indians for the following summer 's campaign . Fueled by stories circulated by Indian participants in the capture of Oswego , this drive was highly successful , drawing nearly 1 @,@ 000 warriors from the Pays d 'en Haut ( the more remote regions of New France ) to Montreal by June 1757 . Another 800 Indians were recruited from tribes that lived closer to the Saint Lawrence . 
 = = = British preparations = = = 
 Fort William Henry , built in the fall of 1755 , was a roughly square fortification with bastions on the corners , in a design that was intended to repel Indian attacks but was not necessarily sufficient to withstand attack from an enemy that had artillery . Its walls were 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) thick , with log facings surrounding an earthen filling . Inside the fort were wooden barracks two stories high , built around the parade ground . Its magazine was in the northeast bastion , and its hospital was located in the southeast bastion . The fort was surrounded on three sides by a dry moat , with the fourth side sloping down to the lake . The only access to the fort was by a bridge across the moat . The fort was only capable of housing four to five hundred men ; additional troops were quartered in an entrenched camp 750 yards ( 690 m ) southeast of the fort , near the site of the 1755 Battle of Lake George . 
 During the winter of 1756 โ 57 , Fort William Henry was garrisoned by several hundred men from the 44th Foot under Major Will Eyre . In March 1757 the French sent an army of 1 @,@ 500 to attack the fort under the command of the governor 's brother , Pierre de Rigaud . Composed primarily of colonial troupes de la marine , militia , and Indians , and without heavy weapons , they besieged the fort for four days , destroying outbuildings and a large number of watercraft before retreating . Eyre and his men were replaced by Lieutenant Colonel George Monro and the 35th Foot in the spring . Monro established his headquarters in the entrenched camp , where most of his men were located .

 The Indians that assembled at Montreal were sent south to Fort Carillon , where they joined the French regiments of Bรฉarn and Royal Roussillon under Franรงois @-@ Charles de Bourlamaque , and those of La Sarre , Guyenne , Languedoc , and la Reine under Franรงois de Gaston , Chevalier de Lรฉvis . Combined with the troupes de la marine , militia companies , and the arriving Indians , the force accumulated at Carillon amounted to 8 @,@ 000 men . 
 While at Carillon , the French leadership had difficulty controlling the behaviour of its Indian allies . Although they did stop one group from forcing a British prisoner to run the <unk> , a group of Ottawas were not stopped when it was observed that they were ritually cannibalizing another prisoner . French authorities were also frustrated in their ability to limit the Indians ' taking of more than their allotted share of rations . Montcalm 's aide , Louis Antoine de Bougainville , observed that attempts to curb this activity would have resulted in the loss of some of these forces . In another prelude of things to come , a large number of prisoners were taken on 23 July in the Battle of Sabbath Day Point , some of whom were also ritually cannibalized before Montcalm managed to convince the Indians to instead send the captives to Montreal to be sold as slaves . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Webb , who commanded the area from his base at Fort Edward , received intelligence in April that the French were accumulating resources and troops at Carillon . News of continued French activity arrived with a captive taken in mid @-@ July . Following an attack by Joseph Marin de la Malgue on a work crew near Fort Edward on 23 July , Webb travelled to Fort William Henry with a party of Connecticut rangers led by Major Israel Putnam , and sent a detachment of them onto the lake for reconnaissance . They returned with word that Indians were encamped on islands in the lake about 18 miles ( 29 km ) from the fort . Swearing Putnam and his rangers to secrecy , Webb returned to Fort Edward , and on 2 August sent Lieutenant Colonel John Young with 200 regulars and 800 Massachusetts militia to reinforce the garrison at William Henry . This raised the size of the garrison to about 2 @,@ 500 , although several hundred of these were ill , some with smallpox . 
 = = Siege = = 
 While Montcalm 's Indian allies had already begun to move south , his advance force of French troops departed from Carillon on 30 July under Lรฉvis ' command , travelling overland along Lake George 's western shore because the expedition did not have enough boats to carry the entire force . Montcalm and the remaining forces sailed the next day , and met with Lรฉvis for the night at <unk> Bay . The next night , Lรฉvis camped just 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from Fort William Henry , with Montcalm not far behind . Early on the morning of 3 August , Lรฉvis and the Canadians blocked the road between Edward and William Henry , skirmishing with the recently arrived Massachusetts militia . Montcalm summoned Monro to surrender at 11 : 00 am . Monro refused , and sent messengers south to Fort Edward , indicating the dire nature of the situation and requesting reinforcements . Webb , feeling threatened by Lรฉvis , refused to send any of his estimated 1 @,@ 600 men north , since they were all that stood between the French and Albany . He wrote to Monro on 4 August that he should negotiate the best terms possible ; this communication was intercepted and delivered to Montcalm . 
 Montcalm , in the meantime , ordered Bourlamaque to begin siege operations . The French opened trenches to the northwest of the fort with the objective of bringing their artillery to bear against the fort 's northwest bastion . On 5 August , French guns began firing on the fort from 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) , a spectacle the large Indian contingent relished . The next day a second battery opened fire from 900 feet ( 270 m ) further along the same trench , creating a crossfire . The effect of the garrison 's return fire was limited to driving French guards from the trenches , and some of the fort 's guns were either dismounted or burst due to the stress of use . On 7 August , Montcalm sent Bougainville to the fort under a truce flag to deliver the intercepted dispatch . By then the fort 's walls had been breached , many of its guns were useless , and the garrison had taken significant casualties . After another day of bombardment by the French , during which their trenches approached another 250 yards ( 230 m ) , Monro raised the white flag to open negotiations . 
 = = Massacre = = 
 The terms of surrender were that the British and their camp followers would be allowed to withdraw , under French escort , to Fort Edward , with the full honours of war , on condition that they refrain from fighting for 18 months . They were allowed to keep their muskets and a single symbolic cannon , but no ammunition . In addition , British authorities were to release French prisoners within three months . 
 Montcalm , before agreeing to these terms , tried to make sure that his Indian allies understood them , and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men . This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp , which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present . The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp , and Monro was quartered in the French camp . The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it , butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind . The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out of that area , and it took significant effort to prevent plunder and scalping there . Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning , but after seeing the Indian bloodlust , decided to attempt the march that night . When the Indians became aware that the British were getting ready to move , a large number of them massed around the camp , causing the leaders to call off the march until morning . 
 The next morning , even before the British column began to form up for the march to Fort Edward , the Indians renewed attacks on the largely defenceless British . At 5 am , Indians entered huts in the fort housing wounded British who were supposed to be under the care of French doctors , and killed and scalped them . Monro complained that the terms of capitulation had been violated , but his contingent was forced to surrender some of its baggage in order to even be able to begin the march . As they marched off , they were harassed by the swarming Indians , who snatched at them , grabbing for weapons and clothing , and pulling away with force those that resisted their actions , including many of the women , children , servants and slaves . As the last of the men left the encampment , a war whoop sounded , and a contingent of Abenaki warriors seized a number of men at the rear of the column . 
 Although Montcalm and other French officers attempted to stop further attacks , others did not , and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British . At this point , the column dissolved , as some tried to escape the Indian onslaught , while others actively tried to defend themselves . Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened . He fled into the woods , and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August . 
 " At last with great difficulty the troops got from the Retrenchment , but they were no sooner out than the savages fell upon our rear , killing and scalping , which occasioned an order for a halt , done in great confusion at last , but , as soon as those in the front knew what was doing in the rear they again pressed forward , and thus the confusion continued & <unk> till we came to the advanced guard of the French , the savages still carrying away Officers , privates , women and children , some of which later they kill 'd & <unk> in the road . This horrid scene of blood and slaughter obliged our officers to apply to the French Guard for protection , which they refus 'd told them they must take to the woods and shift for themselves ... " 
 Estimates of the numbers killed , wounded , and taken captive during this time vary widely . Ian Steele has compiled estimates ranging from 200 to 1 @,@ 500 . His detailed reconstruction of the siege and its aftermath indicates that the final tally of British missing and dead ranges from 69 to 184 , at most 7 @.@ 5 % of the 2 @,@ 308 who surrendered .

 On the afternoon after the massacre , most of the Indians left , heading back to their homes . Montcalm was able to secure the release of 500 captives they had taken , but they still took with them another 200 . The French remained at the site for several days , destroying what remained of the British works before leaving on 18 August and returning to Fort Carillon . For unknown reasons , Montcalm decided not to follow up his victory with an attack on Fort Edward . Many reasons have been proposed justifying his decision , including the departure of many ( but not all ) of the Indians , a shortage of provisions , the lack of draft animals to assist in the portage to the Hudson , and the need for the Canadian militia to return home in time to participate in the harvest . 
 Word of the French movements had reached the influential British Indian agent William Johnson on 1 August . Unlike Webb , he acted with haste , and arrived at Fort Edward on 6 August with 1 @,@ 500 militia and 150 Indians . In a move that infuriated Johnson , Webb refused to allow him to advance toward Fort William Henry , apparently believing a French deserter 's report that the French army was 11 @,@ 000 men strong , and that any attempt at relief was futile given the available forces . 
 = = = Return of captives = = = 
 On 14 August , Montcalm wrote letters to Loudoun and Webb , apologising for the behaviour of the Indians , but also attempting to justify it . Many captives that were taken to Montreal by the Indians were also eventually repatriated through prisoner exchanges negotiated by Governor Vaudreuil . On 27 September a small British fleet left Quebec , carrying paroled or exchanged prisoners taken in a variety of actions including those at Fort William Henry and Oswego . When the fleet arrived at Halifax , about 300 people captured at Fort William Henry were returned to the colonies . The fleet continued on to Europe , where a few more former captives were released ; some of these also eventually returned to the colonies . 
 = = = Consequences = = = 
 General Webb was recalled because of his actions ; William Johnson wrote that Webb was " the only Englishman [ I ] ever knew who was a coward . " Lord Loudoun was also recalled , although this occurred primarily because of the failure of the Louisbourg expedition . Colonel Monro died in November 1757 , of apoplexy that some historians have suggested was caused by anger over Webb 's failure to support him . 
 Lord Loudoun , upset over the event , delayed implementing the release of French prisoners promised as part of the terms of surrender . General James Abercrombie , who succeeded Loudoun as commander @-@ in @-@ chief , was asked by paroled members of the 35th Foot to void the agreement so that they would be free to serve in 1758 ; this he did , and they went on to serve under Jeffery Amherst in his successful British expedition against Louisbourg in 1758 . Amherst , who also presided over the surrender of Montreal in 1760 , refused the surrendering garrisons at Louisbourg and Montreal the normal honours of war , due in part to the French failure to uphold the terms of capitulation in this action . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The British ( and later Americans ) never rebuilt anything on the site of Fort William Henry , which lay in ruins for about 200 years . In the 1950s , excavation at the site eventually led to the reconstruction of Fort William Henry as a tourist destination for the town of Lake George . 
 Many colonial accounts of the time focused on the plundering perpetrated by the Indians , and the fact that those who resisted them were killed , using words like " massacre " even though casualty numbers were uncertain . The later releases of captives did not receive the same level of press coverage . The events of the battle and subsequent killings were depicted in the 1826 novel The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper and in film adaptations of the book . Cooper 's description of the events contains numerous inaccuracies , but his work , and the sometimes lurid descriptions of the event by early historians like Benson Lossing and Francis Parkman , led to the belief that many more people died than actually did . Lossing wrote that " fifteen hundred [ people ] were butchered or carried into hopeless captivity " , when many more were captured than killed , and even many of those captured were eventually freed . 
 Historians disagree on where to assign responsibility for the Indian actions . Francis Jennings contends that Montcalm anticipated what was going to happen , deliberately ignored it when it did happen , and only stepped in after the atrocities were well under way . In his opinion , the account by Bougainville , who left for Montreal on the night of 9 August and was not present at the massacre , was written as a whitewash to protect Montcalm . Parkman is more vigorous in his defence of Montcalm , claiming that he and other French officers did what they could to prevent atrocities , but were powerless to stop the onslaught . 
 Ian Steele notes that two primary accounts dominate much of the historical record . The first is the record compiled by Montcalm , including the terms of surrender and his letters to Webb and Loudoun , which received wide publication in the colonies ( both French and British ) and in Europe . The second was the 1778 publication of a book by Jonathan Carver , an explorer who served in the Massachusetts militia and was present at the siege . According to Steele , Carver originated , without any supporting analysis or justification , the idea that as many as 1 @,@ 500 people had been " killed or made prisoner " in his widely popular work . Yale College president Timothy Dwight , in a history published posthumously in 1822 , apparently coined the phrase " massacre at Fort William Henry " , based on Carver 's work ; his book and Carver 's were likely influences on Cooper , and tended to fault Montcalm for the Indian transgressions . Steele himself adopts a more nuanced view of the underlying cause of the massacre . Montcalm and the French leaders repeatedly promised the Indians opportunities for the glory and trophies of war , including plunder , scalping , and the taking of captives . In the aftermath of the Battle of Sabbath Day Point , captives taken were ransomed , meaning the Indians had no visible trophies . The terms of surrender at Fort William Henry effectively denied the Indians any significant opportunities for plunder : the war provisions were claimed by the French army , and personal effects of the British were to stay with them , leaving nothing for the Indians . According to Steele , this bred resentment , as it appeared that the French were conspiring with their enemies ( the British ) against their friends ( the Indians ) , leaving them without any promised war trophies . 
 = = Participating Indian nations = = 
 According to historian William Nester , a large number of tribal nations were present during the siege . Some were only represented by a few individual warriors . Some individuals were estimated to travel 1 @,@ 500 miles ( 2 @,@ 400 km ) to join the French , coming from as far away as the Mississippi River and Hudson Bay . Nester claims that some of the atrocities , which included the murder and scalping of sick individuals and the digging up of bodies for plunder and scalping , may have resulted in many Indians becoming infected with smallpox , which they then carried into their communities . The devastation wrought by the disease in the following years had a notable effect on Indian participation in the French campaigns of the following years . The tribes that Nester lists are : 
 = Typhoon Mitag ( 2002 ) = 
 Typhoon Mitag , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Basyang , was the first super typhoon on record in the month of March . The second storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season , Mitag developed from a trough near the equator on February 25 near the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) . It moved westward through the archipelago and intensified into a typhoon before passing near Yap on March 2 . High winds and heavy rainfall affected the state , resulting in an islandwide power outage and destroying hundreds of houses . Mitag caused severe crop damage that resulted in food shortages . The rainfall and storm surge flooded much of the coastline as well as Yap 's capital , Colonia . Damage totaled $ 150 million , mostly from crop damage . There was one death related to the storm 's aftermath . 
 After affecting Yap , Mitag turned to the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough . It passed to the north of Palau , contributing to one death there . Despite predictions of weakening , the typhoon continued to intensify , reaching peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph 10 minute sustained ) on March 5 . The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly . Only four days after reaching peak winds , the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Typhoon Mitag were from a trough near the equator in late February 2002 . A circulation developed on February 25 south of Pohnpei , which initially had disorganized convection due to moderate wind shear . After further organization , the system developed into a tropical depression on February 26 . Located south of the subtropical ridge , it moved generally westward , intensifying into Tropical Storm Mitag near Chuuk State in the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) on February 28 . This was based off analysis from the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) ; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated that the system intensified into a tropical storm a day prior . It passed just south of Weno in Chuuk while continuing westward , intensifying quickly due to decreasing wind shear . The JTWC upgraded the storm to a typhoon on March 1 , and the JMA followed suit a day later . 
 Despite being early in the season , Mitag intensified significantly to the east of the Philippines . On March 2 , an eye was observed on satellite imagery in the center of the deepest convection . Late that day , Mitag passed just south of the island of Yap in the FSM . On March 3 , the typhoon entered the area of warning responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) ; the agency gave it the local name " Basyang " . An approaching deep @-@ layer trough turned the typhoon to the northwest and later to the north . Although southwesterly wind shear was expected to restrict intensification , Mitag turned to the northeast in the same direction as the shear , causing the outflow to increase . After completing an eyewall replacement cycle , very deep convection surrounded the eye , and Dvorak numbers peaked at 7 @.@ 0 . On this basis , the JTWC upgraded Mitag to a super <unk> on March 5 , estimating peak winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph 1 minute sustained ) while the storm was located about 610 km ( 380 mi ) east of Catanduanes in the Philippines . This made it the only super typhoon on record in the month until Typhoon Maysak of 2015 . Also on March 5 , the JMA estimated peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph 10 minute sustained ) , PAGASA assessed the same intensity as JMA , and the National Meteorological Centre of China estimated peak winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph 10 minute sustained ) . For about a day , the typhoon maintained its peak winds , before increasing wind shear and cool , dry air imparted significant weakening . In a 24 โ hour period , the JTWC estimated that winds decreased by 110 km / h ( 70 mph 1 minute sustained ) while the storm turned to the northeast , and on March 7 , Mitag weakened below typhoon @-@ force . A surge in the monsoon combined with the upper @-@ level Westerlies displaced the low @-@ level circulation from the upper @-@ level center , causing the low @-@ level system to turn to the east and south . On March 8 , the JTWC issued its last advisory , and Mitag dissipated on March 9 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Tropical Storm Mitag first affected Chuuk State in the FSM , producing a wind gust of 76 km / h ( 47 mph ) and heavy rainfall up to 176 mm ( 6 @.@ 94 in ) . The rains caused a few minor landslides and flooded some homes on Weno Island . 
 Later , Mitag passed near several islands in Yap State , first affecting Woleai . On the island , high wind gusts of around 170 km / h ( 105 mph ) knocked out power and downed breadfruit and coconut trees . The winds destroyed a few houses , forcing residents to evacuate to a local school . Mitag dropped heavy rainfall while passing by Yap state , peaking at 255 mm ( 10 @.@ 05 in ) on Ngulu Atoll . On Yap , the typhoon produced sustained winds of 56 km / h ( 35 mph ) , with gusts to 141 km / h ( 87 mph ) . The winds also caused an islandwide power outage that lasted for about two days , and damaged the roof of the Yap International Airport terminal . High waves and storm surge damaged coastal structures and flooded areas up to 150 m ( 500 ft ) inland . The seawall at the capital city of Colonia was damaged , and portions of the town were flooded 1 @.@ 5 m ( 5 ft ) deep . The storm destroyed over 150 houses on Yap , leaving hundreds staying in shelters . Across the island , the winds knocked down trees onto roads , and saltwater intrusion caused severe crop damage ; most of the taro and banana crops were destroyed . Damage in the FSM totaled $ 150 million , of which $ 100 million from crop damage . 
 Lastly , the typhoon passed about 320 km ( 200 mi ) north of Palau , producing gusty winds but no damage . There was an indirect death on the island after a person was crushed by a tree ; he had been helping a friend cut down the tree out of fear it could cause damage during the storm . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After Mitag struck Yap , the state 's governor declared a 30 day state of emergency and asked for aid from the national government . On May 29 , United States President George W. Bush declared a major disaster for Yap , which allocated funding for repairing storm damage and storm damage mitigation . Crop damage from Mitag caused food shortages in Yap and Chuuk , and health problems related to the storm killed one person on <unk> . Residents and businesses in Palau sent $ 3 @,@ 000 in donations and other relief supplies to Yap , as well as $ 3 @,@ 000 worth of oil . The state government sent about $ 2 @,@ 000 to storm victims . Hospitals in Guam sent medical teams to Yap with blankets , clothing , and medical supply . 
 = <unk> = 
 A khanjar ( Arabic : <unk> , Persian : <unk> , Turkish : <unk> ) is a traditional dagger originating from Yemen . Worn by men for ceremonial occasions , it is a short curved sword shaped like the letter " J " and resembles a hook . It can be made from a variety of different materials , depending on the quality of its craftsmanship . It is a popular souvenir among tourists and is sold in <unk> throughout the region . 
 = = History = = 
 Although it is not known when the Omani khanjar was first created , rock carvings epitomizing the dagger were found on gravestones located in the central part of the Ru โ us al Jibal region . These are believed to have predated the Wahhabi revival , which occurred in the late 1700s . They were also mentioned in an account by Robert <unk> of the Dutch Republic , who journeyed to Muscat in June 1672 . Historically , only men from the royal family could wear the khanjar . However , all civilian men were permitted to do so after 1970 , the year when Qaboos bin Said al Said โ the current Sultan of Oman โ overthrew his father Said bin <unk> and began to institute reforms to modernize the country . 
 = = Usage and symbolism = = 
 = = = Composition and manufacturing = = = 
 Depending on the quality of its craftsmanship , the Omani khanjar can be made using a variety of different metals and other materials . Gold or silver would be used to make khanjar of the finest quality ( e.g. for royalty ) , while brass and copper would be utilized for daggers made by local craftsmen . For instance , a sheath adorned with gold was historically limited to the Omani upper class . Traditionally , the dagger is designed by its future owner himself , with the craftsman taking into account the " specifications " and " preferences " stipulated by the former . The time it takes to manufacture a khanjar can range from three weeks to several months . 
 The most elemental sections of the khanjar are its handle and blade , with the material utilized in the former playing a significant role influencing the final price of the dagger . Bone โ specifically rhinoceros horn and elephant tusk โ was once the common standard , as it was " considered the best material " to make the hilt out of . However , with the international ban on the ivory trade , the usage of other materials โ such as wood , plastic , and camel bone โ has become more prevalent . Typically , the top of the hilt is flat , but the one designed for the royal family is in the shape of a cross . 
 = = = Custom = = = 
 The Omani khanjar is tucked underneath a waist belt and is situated at the front and centre of the wearer 's body . It used to form part of everyday attire ; however , it is now carried as a " ceremonial dagger " , and worn only for formal events and ceremonies โ such as weddings , parades , meetings , and diplomatic functions โ among many other occasions . Labelled a " ubiquitous sign of masculinity " by John M. Willis in the The Arab Studies Journal , the khanjar is a symbol of " manhood , power and authority " , as well as serving as a status symbol for the person wearing it . As a result , it is sometimes given by families to their sons when they reach adolescence , and is a common wedding gift to the groom . 
 Although the khanjar was originally created as a weapon to attack and defend , it is utilized solely for ceremonial and practical purposes today . The latter situation would occur in the desert , where it is used as a tool for hunting and skinning animals , as well as for slicing ropes . Because of this development , it is now considered a " social taboo " in Oman to pull out one 's khanjar from its scabbard , since the only time men would do this would be to seek vengeance or to defend oneself . 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 While the khanjar is most prevalent in Oman given its symbolic status there , it is also worn by men in Yemen and the United Arab Emirates , forming an integral component of " traditional dress " in those countries . It can also be found and is sold in other Gulf Arab states , such as the Souq <unk> in Doha , Qatar . The khanjar is a popular keepsake among tourists , and is the Sultanate 's best @-@ selling memento .

 As the khanjar is a national symbol of Oman , it is featured on the sultanate 's national emblem . It has been a symbol on the royal crest of the Al Said dynasty since the 18th century , which subsequently became the national emblem . It is also depicted on the Omani rial โ the country 's currency โ specifically on the one rial note , as well as on postage stamps issued by the sultanate . Furthermore , there are statues of khanjar on buildings housing government ministries and at various roundabouts throughout the country . 
 = = = Commercial = = = 
 The khanjar was previously shown prominently on the logo and planes of Oman Air โ the country 's flag carrier โ until it was removed under a rebranding in 2008 . The logo of <unk> also illustrates a stylized khanjar ; it was retained in the logotype 's motif after the telecommunications company merged with Oman Mobile in 2010 . Moreover , the perfume company <unk> โ which is owned by the Sultan of Oman and his royal family โ incorporates the dagger into the design of its bottles . The cap on its Gold for Men perfume bottle resembles the handle of a khanjar , complimenting the Gold for Women cap which evokes the dome of <unk> Mosque . 
 = Dovecot at Blackford Farm = 
 The Dovecot At Blackford Farm in Selworthy on Exmoor within the English county of Somerset was probably built in the 11th century . It is a Grade II * listed building , and scheduled monument . 
 The cylindrical stone dovecote has a cone shaped roof . It contains over 300 nest boxes . The pigeons would have been domesticated for food , possibly by Montacute Priory or by the local lord of the manor . It is now owned by the National Trust and used as a store for the neighbouring farm . 
 = = History = = 
 The earliest written record of the dovecote was in 1393 although the exact date of construction is not known . It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875 . The manor previously belonged to Montacute Priory , a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order , founded between 1078 and 1102 although it is not known if the construction of the dovecote was undertaken by the priory or the <unk> family who later held the manor . Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs , flesh ( squab ) , and dung . 
 The dovecote which forms part of the property of the Holnicote Estate , was donated to the National Trust by Sir Richard Thomas Dyke Acland , 15th Baronet in 1944 . It was scheduled as an ancient monument in 1949 and designated as a Grade II * listed building in 1969 . Repairs were undertaken to the dovecote in 1993 . The building is used as a store by the neighbouring farmer . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The building is cylindrical with an external diameter of 23 feet 6 inches ( 7 @.@ 16 m ) and is 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high to the eaves . The walls , which are 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) thick , are built of Devonian sandstone . The doorway was widened to its current height of 6 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 91 m ) high and 3 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 07 m ) wide in the 19th century replacing a much smaller door which would have been present when it was used as a dovecote . 
 It contains over 300 nest holes . These are arranged into 11 tiers with an irregular pattern . Each of the boxes is approximately 11 inches ( 280 mm ) wide and 20 inches ( 510 mm ) wide but the opening is smaller than the interior of the box . The lowest boxes are about 2 feet 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) above the earth floor which kept them above the damp and away from brown rats which became common in the area in the 18th century . 
 The original hole in the roof for the entry of the pigeons was covered by a flat stone and is now covered with glass to keep the interior dry . The interior of the roof has putlog holes rather than nesting boxes but may also have been used by pigeons . 
 = Bambi , a Life in the Woods = 
 Bambi , a Life in the Woods , originally published in Austria as Bambi . Eine <unk> aus dem Walde is a 1923 Austrian novel written by Felix Salten and published by Ullstein Verlag . The novel traces the life of Bambi , a male roe deer , from his birth through childhood , the loss of his mother , the finding of a mate , the lessons he learns from his father and experience about the dangers posed by human hunters in the forest . An English translation by Whittaker Chambers was published in North America by Simon & Schuster in 1928 , and the novel has since been translated and published in over 20 languages around the world . Salten published a sequel , <unk> Kinder , eine Familie im Walde ( Bambi 's Children ) , in 1939 . 
 The novel was well received by critics and is considered a classic , as well as one of the first environmental novels ever published . It was adapted into a theatrical animated film , Bambi , by Walt Disney Productions in 1942 , two Russian live @-@ action adaptations in 1985 and 1986 , and a stage production in 1998 . A ballet adaptation was written by an Oregon troupe , but never premiered . Janet Schulman published a children 's picture book adaptation in 2000 that featured realistic oil @-@ paintings and many of Salten 's original words . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Bambi is a roe deer fawn born in a thicket to a young doe in late spring one year . Over the course of the summer , his mother teaches him about the various inhabitants of the forest and the ways deer live . When she feels he is old enough , she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open . After some initial fear over his mother 's caution , Bambi enjoys the experience . On a subsequent trip , Bambi meets his Aunt Ena , and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo . They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest . While they are playing , they encounter princes , male deer , for the first time . After the stags leave , the fawns learn that those were their fathers , but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young . 
 As Bambi grows older , his mother begins to leave him alone . While searching for her one @-@ day , Bambi has his first encounter with " He " โ the animals ' term for humans โ which terrifies him . The man raises a firearm and aims at him ; Bambi flees at top speed , joined by his mother . After he is scolded by a stag for crying for his mother , Bambi gets used to being alone at times . He later learns the stag is called the " Old Prince , " the oldest and largest stag in the forest who is known for his cunning and aloof nature . During the winter , Bambi meets Marena , a young doe , <unk> , an old doe who no longer bears young , and two princes <unk> and <unk> . Mid @-@ winter , hunters enter the forest , killing many animals including Bambi 's mother . Gobo also disappears and is presumed dead . 
 After this , the novel skips ahead a year , noting that Bambi was cared for by <unk> , and that when he got his first set of antlers he was abused and harassed by the other males . It is summer and Bambi is now sporting his second set of antlers . He is reunited with his cousin Faline . After he battles and defeats first <unk> then <unk> , Bambi and Faline fall in love with each other . They spend a great deal of time together . During this time , the old Prince saves Bambi 's life when he nearly runs towards a hunter imitating a doe 's call . This teaches the young buck to be cautious about blindly rushing toward any deer 's call . During the summer , Gobo returns to the forest having been raised by a man who found him collapsed in the snow during the hunt where Bambi 's mother was killed . While his mother and Marena welcome him and celebrate him as a " friend " of man , the old Prince and Bambi pity him . Marena becomes his mate , but several weeks later Gobo is killed when he approaches a hunter in the meadow , falsely believing the halter he wore would keep him safe from all men . 
 As Bambi continues to age , he begins spending most of his time alone , including avoiding Faline though he still loves her in a melancholic way . Several times he meets with the old Prince who teaches him about snares , shows him how to free another animal from one , and encourages him not to use trails , to avoid the traps of men . When Bambi is later shot by a hunter , the Prince shows him how to walk in circles to confuse the man and his dogs until the bleeding stops , then takes him to a safe place to recover . They remain together until Bambi is strong enough to leave the safe haven again . When Bambi has grown gray and is " old " , the old Prince shows him that man is not all @-@ powerful by showing him the dead body of a man who was shot and killed by another man . When Bambi confirms that he now understands that " He " is not all @-@ powerful , and that there is " Another " over all creatures , the stag tells him that he has always loved him and calls him " my son " before leaving to die . 
 At the end of the novel , Bambi meets with twin fawns who are calling for their mother and he scolds them for not being able to stay alone . After leaving them , he thinks to himself that the girl fawn reminded him of Faline , and that the male was promising and that Bambi hoped to meet him again when he was grown .

 Salten penned Bambi : Eine <unk> aus dem Walde after World War I , targeting an adult audience . The novel was first published in Vienna in serialized form in the Neue Freie Presse newspaper from 15 August to 21 October 1922 , and as a book in Austria by Ullstein Verlag in 1923 , and republished in 1926 in Vienna . 
 = = = Translations = = = 
 Max Schuster , a co @-@ founder of Simon & Schuster , became intrigued with the novel and contracted with the author to publish it in North America . Clifton Fadiman , an editor at the firm , engaged his Columbia University classmate Whittaker Chambers to translate it . Simon & Schuster published this first English edition in 1928 , with illustrations by Kurt Wiese , under the title Bambi . A Life in the Woods . The New York Times praised the prose as " admirably translated " . The New York Herald Tribune did not comment on the translation . 
 Over 200 editions of the novel have been published , with almost 100 German and English editions alone , and numerous translations and reprintings in over 20 other languages . It has also been published in a variety of formats , including printed medium , audiobook , Braille , and E @-@ book formats . 
 = = = Copyright dispute = = = 
 When Salten originally published Bambi in 1923 , he did so under Germany 's copyright laws , which required no statement that the novel was copyrighted . In the 1926 republication , he did include a United States copyright notice , so the work is considered to have been copyrighted in the United States in 1926 . In 1936 , Salten sold some rights to the novel to MGM producer Sidney Franklin who passed them on to Walt Disney for the creation of a film adaptation . After Salten 's death in 1945 , his daughter Anna Wyler inherited the copyright and renewed the novel 's copyrighted status in 1954 . In 1958 , she formulated three agreements with Disney regarding the novel 's rights . Upon her death in 1977 , the rights passed to her husband , Veit Wyler , and her children , who held on to them until 1993 when he sold the rights to the publishing house Twin Books . Twin Books and Disney disagreed on the terms and validity of Disney 's original contract with Anna Wyler and Disney 's continued use of the Bambi name . 
 When the two companies were unable to reach a solution , Twin Books filed suit against Disney for copyright infringement . Disney argued that because Salten 's original 1923 publication of the novel did not include a copyright notice , by American law it was immediately considered a public domain work . It also argued that as the novel was published in 1923 , Anna Wyler 's 1954 renewal occurred after the deadline and was invalid . The case was reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , which ruled that the novel was copyrighted upon its publication in 1923 , and not a public domain work then . However , in validating 1923 as the publication date , this confirmed Disney 's claim that the copyright renewal was filed too late and the novel became a public domain work in 1951 . 
 Twin Books appealed the decision , and in March 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the original decision , stating that the novel was a foreign work in 1923 that was not in its home country 's public domain when published , therefore the original publication date could not be used in arguing American copyright law . Instead , the 1926 publication date , the first in which it specifically declared itself to be copyrighted in the United States , is considered the year when the novel was copyrighted in America . As such , Anna Wyler 's renewal was timely and valid , thereby upholding Twin Books ' ownership of the copyright . 
 The Twin Books decision is still regarded as controversial by many copyright experts . David Nimmer , in a 1998 article , argued that the Twin Books ruling meant that an ancient Greek epic , if only published outside the U.S. without the required formalities , would be eligible for copyright protection . Although Nimmer concluded that Twin Books required this finding ( within the Ninth Circuit ) , he characterized the result as " patently absurd . " 
 The American copyright of the novel is currently set to expire on January 1 , 2022 , while in the European union it entered the public domain in 1 January 2016 .

 While living in exile in Switzerland , after being forced to flee Nazi @-@ occupied Austria , Salten wrote a sequel to Bambi that follows the birth and lives of Bambi 's twin offspring , Geno and <unk> . The young fawns interact with various deer , and are educated and watched over by Bambi and Faline as they grow . They also learn more about the ways of man , including both hunters and the gamekeeper seeking to protect the deer . Due to Salten 's exiled status โ he had lost his Austrian publisher Paul <unk> Verlag โ the English translation of the novel was published first , in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs @-@ Merrill , but it would take a year before the sequel was published in the original German language in Switzerland by his new publisher .

 Bambi was " hugely popular " after its publication , becoming a " book @-@ of @-@ the @-@ month " selection and selling 650 @,@ 000 copies in the United States by 1942 . However , it was subsequently banned in Nazi Germany in 1936 as " political allegory on the treatment of Jews in Europe . " Many copies of the novel were burned , making original first editions rare and difficult to find . 
 When Felix Salten visited the United States as a member of a European delegation of journalists in May โ July 1930 , he was greeted warmly because of Bambi wherever the delegation went , as was testified by the Finnish member of the delegation , Urho <unk> . In his own travel book , Salten did not boast about this ; only when describing his visit to a โ Negro college โ of Atlanta , he mentions <unk> that the children praised his books . 
 In his foreword of the novel , John Galsworthy called it a " delicious book " and a " little masterpiece " that shows a " delicacy of perception and essential truth " . He notes that while reading the galley proof of the novel while crossing the English Channel , he , his wife , and his nephew read each page in turn over the course of three hours in " silent absorption . " The New York Times reviewer John Chamberlain praised Salten 's " tender , lucid style " that " takes you out of yourself " . He felt that Salten captured the essence of each of the creatures as they talked , catching the " rhythm of the different beings who people his forest world " and showed particular " comprehension " in detailing the various stages of Bambi 's life . He also considered the English translation " admirably " done . A reviewer for Catholic World praised the approach of the subject , noting that it was " marked by poetry and sympathy [ with ] charming reminders of German folklore and fairy tale " . However , they disliked the " transference of certain human ideals to the animal mind " and the vague references to religious allegory . The Boston Transcript called it a " sensitive allegory of life " . The Saturday Review considered it " beautiful and graceful " piece that showed a rare " individuality " . The Times Literary Supplement stated that the novel is a " tale of exceptional charm , though untrustworthy of some of the facts of animal life . " Isabel Ely Lord , reviewing the novel for the American Journal of Nursing , called the novel a " delightful animal story " and Salten a " poet " whose " picture of the woods and its people is an unforgettable one . " In comparing Bambi to Salten 's later work Perri โ in which Bambi makes a brief cameo โ Louise Long of the Dallas Morning News considered both to be stories that " quietly and completely [ captivate ] the heart " . Long felt the prose was " poised and mobile and beautiful as poetry " and praises Salten for his ability to give the animals seemingly human speech while not " [ violating ] their essential natures . " 
 Vicky Smith of Horn Book Magazine felt the novel was gory compared to the later Disney adaptation and called it a " weeper " . While criticizing it as one of the most notable anti @-@ hunting novels available , she concedes the novel is not easily forgettable and praises the " linchpin scene " where Bambi 's mother dies , stating " the understated conclusion of that scene , ' Bambi never saw his mother again , ' masterfully evokes an uncomplicated emotional response " . She questions Galsworthy 's recommendation of the novel to sportsmen in the foreword , wondering " how many budding sportsmen might have had conversion experiences in the face of Salten 's unrelieved harangue and how many might have instead become alienated . " In comparing the novel to the Disney film , Steve Chapple of Sports <unk> felt that Salten viewed Bambi 's forest as a " pretty scary place " and the novel as a whole had a " lot of dark adult undertones . " Interpreting it as an allegory for Salten 's own life , Chapple felt Salten " [ came ] across [ as ] a little morbid , a bleeding heart of a European intellectual . " The Wall Street Journal 's James P. <unk> also considered it an " <unk> allegory " and sarcastically notes that " you 'll find it in the children 's section at the library , a perfect place for this 293 @-@ page volume , packed as it is with blood @-@ and @-@ guts action , sexual conquest and betrayal " and " a forest full of cutthroats and miscreants . I count at least six murderers ( including three child @-@ killers ) among Bambi 's associates . "

 With World War II looming , Max Schuster aided the Jewish Salten 's flight from Nazi Germany and helped introduce him , and Bambi , to Walt Disney Productions . Sidney Franklin , a producer and director at Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , purchased the film rights in 1933 , initially desiring to make a live @-@ action adaptation of the work . Deciding such a film would be too difficult to make , he sold the rights to Walt Disney in April 1937 in hopes of it being adapted into an animated film instead . Disney began working on the film immediately , intending it to be the company 's second feature @-@ length animated film and his first to be based on a specific , recent work . 
 The original novel , written for an adult audience , was considered too " grim " and " somber " for the young audience Disney was targeting , and with the work required to adapt the novel , Disney put production on hold while it worked on several other works . In 1938 , Disney assigned Perce Pearce and Carl <unk> to develop the film 's storyboards , but attention was soon drawn away as the studio began working on Fantasia . Finally , on 17 August 1939 , production on Bambi began in earnest , although it progressed slowly due to changes in the studio personnel , location and the methodology of handling animation at the time . The writing was completed in July 1940 , by which time the film 's budget had swelled to $ 858 @,@ 000 . Disney was later forced to slash 12 minutes from the film before final animation , to save costs on production . 
 Heavily modified from the original novel , Bambi was released to theaters in the United States on 8 August 1942 . Disney 's version severely downplays the naturalistic and environmental elements found in the novel , giving it a lighter , friendlier feeling . The addition of two new characters , Thumper the Rabbit and Flower the Skunk , two sweet and gentle forest creatures , contributed to giving the film the desired friendlier and lighter feeling . Considered a classic , the film has been called " the crowning achievement of Walt Disney 's animation studio " and was named as the third best film in the animation genre of the AFI 's 10 Top 10 " classic " American film genres .

 The Oregon Ballet Theatre adapted Bambi into an evening @-@ length ballet entitled Bambi : Lord of the Forest . It was slated to premiere in March 2000 as the main production for the company 's 2000 โ 2001 season . A collaboration between artistic director James Canfield and composer Thomas Lauderdale , the ballet 's production was to be an interpretation of the novel rather than the Disney film . In discussing the adaptation , Canfield stated that he was given a copy of the novel as a Christmas present and found it to be a " classic story about coming of age and a life cycle . " He went on to note that the play was inspired solely by the novel and not the Disney film . After the initial announcements , the pair began calling the work The Collaboration , as Disney owns the licensing rights for the name Bambi and they did not wish to fight for usage rights . The local press began calling the ballet alternative titles , including Not @-@ Bambi which Canfield noted to be his favorite , out of derision at Disney . Its premiere was delayed for unexplained reasons , and it has yet to be performed .

 In 1999 , the novel was adapted into an illustrated hardback children 's book by Janet Schulman , illustrated by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher , and published by Simon & Schuster as part of its " Atheneum Books for Young Readers " imprint . In the adaptation , Schulman attempted to retain some of the lyrical feel of the original novel . She notes that rather than rewrite the novel , she " replicated Salten 's language almost completely . I reread the novel a number of times and then I went through and highlighted the dialogue and poignant sentences Salten had written . " Doing so retained much of the novel 's original lyrical feel , though the book 's brevity did result in a sacrifice of some of the " majesty and mystery " found in the novel . The illustrations were created to appear as realistic as possible , using painted images rather than sketches . In 2002 , the Schulman adaptation was released in audiobook format by Audio Bookshelf , with Frank Dolan as the reader .

The book is a firsthand account , written by Tim Guest at the age of 27 , years after his experiences . The book was published in 2004 by Granta Books .

Guest 's mother moved to many different communes , and had leadership roles within the movement , eventually running a commune in Suffolk . Guest recounts how he regretted the absence of his mother 's presence during this time , and describes controversial living conditions with other children at the various ashrams . Guest and his mother moved to the 64 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 260 km2 ) commune in Oregon , but his mother was demoted in position and sent to live at a different commune in Cologne .

 Tim Guest 's mother Anne was born in 1950 into a Catholic family . She took courses in psychology at the University of Sheffield . His father was a psychologist on staff at the university . She gave birth to Tim Guest in 1975 . Guest 's mother fell in love with another man when Guest was six months old . She became a feminist , studied Ronald David Laing , and experimented with sex and drugs . Guest 's mother became a follower of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh when Guest was a toddler , after listening to a cassette tape of Rajneesh which displayed the cover text " Surrender to me , and I will transform you " , and was titled : " Meditation : the art of ecstasy " . Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh taught his followers his perspective on chaotic therapy , sexual freedom and mysticism . She brought her son into the movement in 1979 . She was given the name of " Ma Prem <unk> " ( Sanskrit : Mother Love Wonder ) , and dyed all of her clothes orange . 
 In 1981 , his mother took him to live on an ashram operated by Rajneesh in Poona , India . Guest was renamed as " Yogesh " by Rajneesh . As the Rajneesh movement grew in influence and became involved in controversy , Guest 's mother became more involved in the movement . Guest was moved to various Rajneeshee communes , including London , Devon , India , Oregon and Germany . Guest was moved at times to communes and sent to live without his mother . Guest 's mother was involved in running the commune and his father lived in the United States . He was raised by other members of the Rajneesh movement , and lived with other children in the ashrams . 
 His mother ran a commune called " Medina Rajneesh " in Suffolk , and Guest went to a school run on the commune where no history classes were given . Guest describes multiple rules he disliked which he had to observe while living on the Osho commune , including a restricted diet and mandated worship . His stuffed animals and books were taken away from him . He did not spend much time with his mother , because she was frequently working for the movement . When Rajneesh moved from India to Oregon , Guest and his mother moved to Oregon as well , and though Guest enjoyed roaming on the 64 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 260 km2 ) commune he still wished to spend time with his mother . 
 His mother was later demoted in leadership status by other members of the female leadership of the commune , and sent with Guest to a commune in Cologne . Guest had difficulty learning German , and spent time hiding behind a pile of mattresses with a book and playing with Legos . He describes his childhood in the Rajneesh movement as " somewhere in between Peter Pan and Lord of the Flies " , and writes that he had 200 " mothers " , but did not spend time with his own mother . According to Guest , group leaders in the Rajneesh movement often initiated fourteen and fifteen @-@ year @-@ old girls into sex . Guest and his mother left the movement when he was a teenager , and she burned all of her orange clothing . Guest himself left at first ; he phoned his mother at age 10 to inform her he was leaving to live with his father in San Francisco . 
 When his mother left the group , Guest moved back with her to the United Kingdom . Guest , his mother and stepfather Martin moved to north London , and he began the process of experiencing adolescence in a society different from that inside the Rajneesh movement . Guest reentered society at age 11 , and faced confusion over the contrast in experiences between his childhood in the Rajneesh movement and his new experiences as a teenager in London . He enrolled in the Haverstock School in north London , but had trouble during his teen years with drugs and alcohol . He had difficult relations with his stepfather , and had not spent much time with him prior to the move to London . Anne and Martin went through a period of time where they thought they were beings from a different world , and read books on UFOs .

My Life in Orange was highlighted among Kirkus Reviews " Best books for reading groups " . In his review of the book for M2 Best Books , Peter Haswell concluded : " A thoroughly enjoyable read and a fascinating insight into the workings of a commune along with the people , their beliefs and their attitudes . Both amusing and sad . Pretty much something for everyone . " 
 The book received a favorable review in New Statesman , and William Leith wrote : " This is an excellent study of what happens when a charismatic leader comes into contact with a group of rudderless , dispirited people . They follow him blindly . They let him get away with anything . " Montagu Curzon of The Spectator wrote that " Guest makes an astonishingly mature debut ( he is 27 ) and has the rare ability to describe childhood as a small child lives it ; accepting , helpless , curious . " Lois Kendall gave the book a positive review in Cultic Studies Review , and wrote : " The book is deep , yet light and readable , both for those who have had similar life experiences and who , I am sure , will find solace in this book , and for those with no such personal experience , who will find the narrative fascinating . " Publishers Weekly characterized My Life in Orange as " Honest and vivid , this is an absorbing book about survival and good intentions gone awry .

" Christopher Hart gave the book a positive review in The Sunday Times , and wrote : " Tim Guest โ s extraordinary account of his childhood in the communes of Bhagwan , the notorious Indian guru , is a survivor โ s tale , poignant , funny and wise . " 
 A review in The Daily Telegraph commented that " the main failure of Guest 's otherwise excellent book is the absence of character : even his mother comes across rather as a history than a personality . " " My Life in Orange , though slightly patchwork in its construction , is an absorbing piece of writing , all the more compelling for begging as many questions as it answers and for the author 's refusal to ask for pity , " wrote Geraldine Bedell in a review of the book in The Observer . Director of the Cheltenham Festival of Literature , Christopher Cook , characterized My Life in Orange as " the most extraordinary account of his [ Tim Guest 's ] childhood and the bravest writing I 've read in ages " . <unk> Datta of the Indian Express described the book as " a postcard from the past that the Osho ashram may not rave about . " Datta noted though that after having been angry with his mother and Rajneesh , Guest had reconciled with his family , reclaimed his childhood and come to see Rajneesh as " a loveable rogue who got away with doing his own thing " . Catherine A. Powers of The Boston Globe characterized the book as a " moving , superbly written account of growing up in the midst of ... cruel madness " . Michael E. Young of The Dallas Morning News gave the book a favorable review , and wrote : " The book offers a glimpse into the thoughts of the followers , and examines the fine line between spirituality and insanity , between religion and cult . " Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times characterized the book as " an intriguing and often humorous mix of straightforward 1980s nostalgia and cult delusion " .

 Takanohana ( II ) Kลji ( <unk> <unk> , Takanohana Kลji , born August 12 , 1972 as Kลji Hanada ( <unk> <unk> Hanada Kลji ) ) is a Japanese former sumo wrestler . He was the 65th man in history to reach sumo 's highest rank of yokozuna , and he won 22 tournament championships between 1992 and 2001 , the sixth highest total ever . The son of a popular ลzeki ranked wrestler from the 1970s , Takanohana 's rise through the ranks alongside his elder brother Wakanohana and his rivalry with the foreign born yokozuna Akebono saw interest in sumo and attendance at tournaments soar during the early 1990s . 
 Takanohana was the youngest ever to reach the top division at just 17 , and he set a number of other age @-@ related records . He had a solid but aggressive style , looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents ' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring . He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori @-@ kiri , or force out . In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries , and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30 . He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and a senior member of the Japan Sumo Association . 
 = = Background = = 
 Takanohana comes from a family with a great sumo history , sometimes called the " Hanada Dynasty . " His uncle Wakanohana Kanji I was a yokozuna from 1958 to 1962 , and his father Takanohana Kenshi had held the second highest rank of ลzeki for a then record 50 tournaments from 1972 to 1981 . Upon his retirement his father established the training stable ( <unk> ) Fujishima stable . The young Kลji Hanada had been practising sumo since elementary school and won the equivalent of a yokozuna title at junior high school . Upon his graduation in 1988 he formally joined his father 's stable . His elder brother Masaru had been planning to complete high school but dropped out so as not to lag behind his brother . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Takanohana and his brother made their professional debuts together in March 1988 , with future rival Akebono also beginning his career in the same month . The two brothers had to move from the family quarters in the stable and join the communal room with all the other new recruits . They were also instructed not to refer to their parents as " father " and " mother " any more but as " oyakata " and " <unk> " ( coach and coach 's wife ) . Kลji initially wrestled under the name Takahanada , and it was understood that he would only be allowed to adopt his father 's <unk> of Takanohana ( meaning noble flower ) when he reached the champion ลzeki rank . 
 Their early career attracted much publicity , with each divisional promotion regarded by the media as part of an inevitable rise to the top ranks . Takahanada 's progress was rapid and he set numerous age @-@ related records , including the youngest ever <unk> division tournament champion ( 16 years 9 months ) , youngest ever promoted to the second highest jลซryล division ( 17 years 3 months ) , and the youngest ever promoted to the top makuuchi division ( 17 years 8 months ) . 
 In March 1991 , in his fourth top division tournament , Takahanada was runner @-@ up with twelve wins , and became the youngest ever <unk> or special prize winner , receiving awards for Fighting Spirit and Technique . In the following tournament in May 1991 he defeated veteran yokozuna Chiyonofuji in a match watched by 44 percent of the Japanese population on TV , and became the youngest ever to defeat a yokozuna . Chiyonofuji retired two days afterwards . In January 1992 , he became the youngest ever top division tournament champion ( 19 years 5 months ) . He was too young to drink the celebratory sake at the after tournament party , and had to make do with oolong tea instead . After his second championship in September 1992 , followed by two good scores of 10 @-@ 5 and 11 @-@ 4 in the next two tournaments , he was promoted to ลzeki in January 1993 , the same tournament in which Akebono was elevated to yokozuna . 
 During this period the two brothers created a so @-@ called " Waka @-@ Taka boom " and were credited with restoring sumo 's popularity , particularly amongst younger audiences . Interest in sumo rose to its highest level since the era of <unk> in the 1930s , with official tournaments ( honbasho ) selling out of tickets for every day . Both Takahanada and his brother became sex symbols . 
 = = Promotion to yokozuna = = 
 Now known as Takanohana , he was also the youngest ever to be promoted to ลzeki at 20 years 5 months . With the foreign born Akebono as sumo 's only yokozuna , there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to make the next step up . However , his lack of consistency , and Akebono 's dominance , delayed his promotion to yokozuna . He won his third championship in May 1993 , but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July , and even produced a make @-@ <unk> or losing score of 7 @-@ 8 in November . In 1994 , a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems , Takanohana won the January and May tournaments , but was then outshone by Musashimaru , who won in July with a perfect 15 @-@ 0 record . After taking the September 1994 championship , Takanohana now had six top division titles , but none had been won consecutively . No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo 's highest rank . The Sumo Association nominated him for yokozuna after the September tournament , but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two @-@ thirds majority , the first time this had happened in twenty five years . They insisted that two consecutive championships were required , having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion . In November 1994 , Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments , with his second consecutive unbeaten 15 @-@ 0 score , and his promotion was confirmed . He had been at the ลzeki rank for 11 tournaments , or nearly two years . However , at 22 years and 3 months , he was still the third youngest yokozuna ever at the time . 
 = = Yokozuna career = = 
 = = = 1995 โ 1997 = = = 
 Takanohana 's total of seven tournament championships by the start of 1995 was the same as the total won by Akebono , who had reached the yokozuna rank two years before him . However , Takanohana now pulled ahead of his rival . He was at his peak as a yokozuna between 1995 and 1997 , during which time he won 11 of the 17 tournaments he entered , finishing runner @-@ up in the other six . He produced two more perfect scores of 15 @-@ 0 , in September 1995 and September 1996 . Overall he won 80 out of 90 bouts he fought in 1995 , 70 out of 75 in 1996 , and 78 out 90 in 1997 , far ahead of any other wrestler . In three of the tournaments Takanohana did not win during this period , he was defeated by stablemates in playoffs : once to Wakanohana and twice to ลzeki Takanonami . Sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same <unk> meeting in regular tournament bouts ( playoffs excepted ) which meant Takanohana avoided not only his brother and Takanonami but also <unk> <unk> and Takatลriki . The merger of his father 's Fujishima stable with his uncle 's Futagoyama stable in 1993 had added even more top division wrestlers to this list , giving him an advantage over Akebono , who had to face them all . By September 1996 Takanohana had won 15 tournament championships , and was still only 24 years old . However , after sitting out the first tournament of his career in November 1996 due to a back injury suffered on a regional tour , he put on more weight and began to be more susceptible to injury and illness . 
 = = = 1998 โ 2000 = = = 
 Takanohana was affected by a liver disorder in the first half of 1998 , which caused him withdraw from the January 1998 tournament and miss the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Nagano ( his place was taken by Akebono ) . He pulled out of the March 1998 tournament as well and was still below his best in May . <unk> the traditional treatment methods available from his stable , he turned instead to a physical therapist called Tashiro Tomita , who had a considerable influence over him . He became increasingly isolated from his father and brother , with his father claiming Takanohana had been " brainwashed " by Tomita . Despite his brother 's promotion to yokozuna that year , creating the first ever sibling grand champions , the two were barely on speaking terms . Takanohana recovered to win the July and September 1998 tournaments , and was runner @-@ up that November . In 1999 , however , he was even more badly affected by injuries , including a dislocated shoulder , and managed only one score in double figures all year . 
 After making peace with his family , Takanohana regained some of his consistency in 2000 , although he was temporarily sidelined by an elbow injury suffered in the July tournament . His brother had retired in March , and several other members of his stable were now past their best . With Akebono dominant once more his best results that year were two runner @-@ up performances . 
 = = = 2001 โ 2003 = = = 
 Takanohana won his first tournament in over two years in January 2001 , winning his first fourteen bouts and then defeating fellow yokozuna Musashimaru in a playoff on the final day . He won his final championship in May 2001 , again in a playoff against Musashimaru , but it came at a great cost . He had suffered serious knee ligament damage in a loss to <unk> on the 14th day but he insisted on fighting on to the end of the tournament . As a result , he then missed an unprecedented seven consecutive tournaments , undergoing surgery in Paris in July 2001 and having a lengthy recuperation after that . 
 Takanohana finally returned to the ring in September 2002 , after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire . He finished behind Musashimaru on 12 @-@ 3 , the 16th time he had been a tournament runner @-@ up . Considering how long he had been away , it was seen as an impressive comeback . However , he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury . He made another comeback in January 2003 , making a late decision to compete . A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days , and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement . He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo . His father spoke of his relief at the decision , after seeing his son battle through so many injuries . Takanohana 's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history , behind only Taihล , Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time . Junichiro Koizumi , the Prime Minister , was among those paying tribute . His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era . 
 Takanohana 's <unk> @-@ shiki , or official retirement ceremony , was held at the Ryลgoku Kokugikan on June 1 , 2003 . The ceremony , and the party held afterwards at the Imperial Hotel , were both broadcast live on Fuji TV . 
 = = Fighting style = = 
 Takanohana was largely a yotsu @-@ sumo wrestler , favouring techniques which involved grabbing his opponent 's mawashi or belt . His preferred grip was <unk> @-@ yotsu ( right hand inside , left hand outside his opponent ) . His most common winning kimarite by far was yori @-@ kiri , a simple force out , which accounted for 52 percent of his victories . He also regularly employed <unk> , or overarm throw , and this was the technique he used to defeat Asashลryลซ in the second of their two meetings , in September 2002 . 
 = = Retirement from sumo = = 
 After his retirement he became an elder ( or member ) of the Japan Sumo Association . Because of his great achievements in sumo he was given a bonus of 130 million yen and was also made a " one generation " elder without having to purchase a share in the Association . This enabled him to keep his fighting name and he is now known as Takanohana <unk> . With his father 's health failing , he took over the operation of his training stable in January 2004 , renaming it Takanohana stable . Its last sekitori , Takanonami retired shortly afterwards . During 2008 , he added four new recruits to his stable , the first for several years , bringing the total number of wrestlers in his charge up to ten . These include his first foreign recruit , a Mongolian with amateur sumo experience named <unk> , and two twins . In July 2012 Takanohana produced his first sekitori level wrestler when <unk> was promoted to the second highest jลซryล division . He won the jลซryล championship in January 2013 and a year later was promoted to the top makuuchi division . 
 Takanohana became a <unk> or judge of tournament bouts in February 2004 , only a year after his retirement , a role for which elders normally have to wait at least four years . After the election of the Association 's Board of Directors in February 2008 , the Association appointed Takanohana as Associate Manager of Judging ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , replacing former yokozuna Chiyonofuji ( Kokonoe @-@ oyakata ) who was elected to serve the Board as a director . For an organization that tends to follow seniority over achievement in its organization appointment , it was highly unusual for them to place a 35 @-@ year @-@ old to such an influential position . However both former yokozuna , Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji whom Takanohana is often compared to , served a stint as Associate Manager of Judging prior to their becoming the Board director . In February 2009 he was moved from the judging department to the <unk> ( regional tour ) department , a less high @-@ profile position . 
 Takanohana mentioned in October 2009 that he was interested in running for a spot on the Board of Directors in the February 2010 elections , and confirmed in January that he would stand , despite the fact that this would mean opposing the two officially sanctioned candidates of the <unk> ichimon or group of stables . As a result , Takanohana and six of his supporters , <unk> ( the former Takatลriki ) , Futagoyama ( the former <unk> ) , <unk> ( the former Takanonami ) , <unk> ( the former <unk> ) , <unk> ( the former <unk> Hiroo ) , and <unk> ( the former Wakanohana II ) left the <unk> ichimon . Takanohana told a press conference , " I will leave the faction . I bid farewell to everyone in my greetings at the meeting . I have stepped into the race as a candidate . " The first contested elections since 2002 , they took place by secret ballot on February 1 , and Takanohana was elected to the board , replacing ลshima . Seen as a reformer , he favours revamping the current ticket sales system and improving support for ex @-@ <unk> , as well as encouraging sumo in primary schools , raising the pay of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and making public the Sumo Association 's accounts and assets . His victory was praised by the Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama , who said Takanohana had let in " a new wind of change . " In 2014 , the JSA made the decision to recognize the Takanohana group formed from the stables ousted in 2010 , as an official ichimon . 
 In July 2010 , in the wake of a scandal involving several wrestlers admitting to illegal gambling , he denied he had connections with members of the yakuza underworld after media reports that he was seen with a mobster during a visit to Ehime prefecture to recruit new apprentices . 
 Following the election of <unk> as the new head of the Sumo Association in August 2010 , Takanohana returned to the judging department as director of judging . The following month he and his wife were awarded ยฅ 8 @.@ 47 million in damages by the Tokyo High Court over 13 articles published by the <unk> Gendai and <unk> Gendai in 2004 and 2005 concerning match @-@ fixing allegations and the controversy over his father 's inheritance . 
 Having reached a peak weight of 160 kg ( 350 lb ) as an active wrestler , he has lost a great deal of weight since his retirement ( more than retired wrestlers typically do ) and is now around 90 kg ( 200 lb ) . In 2009 he published a book detailing his weight loss methods . 
 = = Relationship with family = = 
 The Hanada family had generally received very positive press coverage while Takanohana and Wakanohana were active wrestlers , with the press holding them up as the ideal Japanese family and tending to ignore any splits between them . Their different attitudes towards both sumo philosophy and the outside world had been noted , with Takanohana being regarded as somewhat aloof and reserved and <unk> having a warmer personality . However , upon their father 's death from cancer in May 2005 , a bitter rift between the brothers was widely reported in the Japanese media . Takanohana felt he should be the chief mourner at the funeral as he had remained in the Sumo Association whilst his brother had left to become a TV celebrity , but the role went to Wakanohana as the elder brother , as is traditional . However , with their father reported to have left no will , it was suggested that the feud revolved around control of his estate . 
 Takanohana also condemned his mother for her extramarital affair , which led to her divorce from Futagoyama and exit from the stable in July 2001 , and had only been rumoured up to that point . She has now reverted to her old name of Noriko Fujita and published a book and appeared on TV , revealing details of life as a stablemaster 's wife that are seldom heard outside the sumo world . Takanohana has rarely spoken to her since . In June 2008 he spoke of his distress at the news that she had been named as a defence witness in a civil lawsuit brought by the Sumo Association against the tabloid magazine Shลซkan Gendai over allegations that his father benefited from a thrown match for the championship in 1975 , saying , " she will essentially be fighting against me . " He said he would take responsibility by resigning from the Sumo Association if she took the stand . In a radio interview Fujita said she would not testify , saying , " I will not drag my child down " . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 In late 1992 Takanohana announced his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa , news which sparked a similar amount of coverage to the royal wedding held that year . However the engagement was broken off the following year , reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana 's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife . The role of the wife of a head coach in looking after the stable 's recruits and liaising with supporter 's groups is regarded as a full @-@ time job . In May 1995 Takanohana married television announcer Keiko Kono , eight years older than him . The couple have a son and two daughters .

 = Premiership of John Edward Brownlee = 
 John Edward Brownlee was Premier of Alberta , Canada , from 1925 to 1934 as leader of the United Farmers of Alberta ( UFA ) caucus in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta . After a number of early successes , his popularity and his government 's suffered from the hardships of the Great Depression . In 1934 , he was embroiled in a sex scandal when a family friend sued him for seduction . Though Brownlee denied the events she alleged , when the jury found in her favour he announced his resignation as premier . 
 Brownlee became premier on November 23 , 1925 , when , at the request of the UFA caucus , he took over from the indecisive Herbert Greenfield , in whose cabinet he had served as attorney @-@ general . After winning the 1926 election for the UFA , Brownlee achieved a number of successes . In 1929 he signed an agreement with the federal government that transferred control of Alberta 's natural resources to its provincial government , which had been a priority of his three immediate predecessors as premier . In 1928 he divested the government of the money @-@ losing railways it had acquired after the syndicates that founded them went out of business , by selling them to Canadian Pacific and Canadian National . This was part of his program to balance the provincial budget , at which he was successful beginning in 1925 . His government also introduced a controversial sexual sterilization program to prevent the mentally disabled from procreating . 
 His government 's fortunes entered a decline following the 1930 election . Agricultural prices collapsed , throwing many of Alberta 's farmers into abject poverty . Urban unemployment shot up , and the government had no choice but to return to deficit spending . Brownlee tried to broker deals between farmers and banks , but found neither side eager to compromise . Political radicalism increased , as communism , the new Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation , and William Aberhart 's social credit movement gained new adherents . The UFA itself elected as its president radical socialist Robert Gardiner . In 1933 , Prime Minister R. B. Bennett named Brownlee to the Royal Commission on Banking and Currency as a representative of western interests and unorthodox viewpoints . In this capacity Brownlee travelled the country questioning witnesses , especially bankers and farmers . While he concurred with the commission 's ultimate recommendation for the creation of a central bank , he also made a series of recommendations of his own , including that the central bank be controlled entirely by the government . 
 In 1934 Brownlee was sued for the seduction of Vivian MacMillan , a family friend and a secretary in his government 's attorney @-@ general 's office . MacMillan claimed that she and Brownlee had carried on an affair for three years . Though Brownlee denied MacMillan 's story completely , and though his lawyer exposed inconsistencies in cross @-@ examination , the jury sided with MacMillan . In deference to public outrage over the charges , John Brownlee resigned as premier July 10 , 1934 , and was succeeded by Richard Gavin Reid .

 Brownlee became Premier November 23 , 1925 , when Lieutenant Governor of Alberta William Egbert , at the behest of much of the UFA caucus , asked him to form a government . Previously , Brownlee had been Attorney @-@ General in the government of Herbert Greenfield . Greenfield was a weak and indecisive premier , and UFA Members of the Legislative Assembly ( MLAs ) began increasingly to look to Brownlee to leadership . Though Brownlee resisted early calls to assume the premiership out of loyalty to Greenfield , he was eventually persuaded by the advice of UFA President Henry Wise Wood and Greenfield 's assurances that he would happily step aside in Brownlee 's favour . 
 When Brownlee became premier it had already been more than four years since the last election . The law required an election at least every five years , and Brownlee called one for June 28 , 1926 . The Liberals were the official opposition and the UFA 's major opponent in the election ; in 1924 , with Greenfield still premier , Liberal leader John R. Boyle had predicted a Liberal victory . Boyle had since been appointed to the bench , and the party was now led by Joseph Tweed Shaw . Shaw had served as the Labour Member of Parliament for Calgary West from 1921 until 1925 ; in this capacity he had been endorsed by and enjoyed warm relations with the UFA . Now , running against the UFA government , this previous relationship and his recorded sentiments about it were handicaps . 
 The Conservatives were led by A. A. McGillivray , an outstanding courtroom lawyer and friend of Brownlee 's who the latter had , as attorney @-@ general , hired to prosecute Emilio Picariello . McGillivray had released his party 's entire platform shortly after becoming leader in 1925 , and so had little new to say during the campaign . While Brownlee admired his intellect , he considered that he was out of touch with voters ' views , likening him to federal Conservative leader Arthur Meighen . 
 During the campaign , Brownlee travelled the province speaking to public meetings . He emphasized his record and the UFA 's , pointing to the province 's improving financial position and to its involvement in the establishment of the Alberta Wheat Pool . He touted the period since the last election as " five years of progress " . In keeping with the UFA 's view of good government as being the non @-@ partisan administration of business rather than any clash of ideologies , he concluded his speeches by asking " Are we going to return in this Province to Government based on the two @-@ party system , or are we going to continue to work for a better [ way ] ? " 
 The UFA contested 46 of Alberta 's 60 seats , including lawyer John Lymburn 's candidacy in Edmonton ( the first time the rural UFA had run a candidate in either of the province 's two major cities ) . Of these 46 candidates , 43 โ including Lymburn and Brownlee , who was acclaimed in his Ponoka riding โ were elected . This was an increase from the 38 who were elected in 1921 . Seven Liberals and four Conservatives were elected . The remaining six seats went to Labour candidates who were generally friendly with the UFA , though Labour MLA Alex Ross , who had served in Brownlee 's cabinet , was defeated in Calgary . 
 = = = Relationship with King government = = = 
 At the time that Brownlee became premier , provincial governments were still the junior partners in the Canadian federation . Amendments to the Constitution of Canada expanding provincial powers were still years in the future , as was the advent of the welfare state , which expanded the importance of such provincial responsibilities as health care and education . Brownlee was reliant on cooperation from the federal government for virtually all of his major objectives . Liberal William Lyon Mackenzie King was Prime Minister of Canada for almost all of the first five years of Brownlee 's premiership . 
 During this period King led a minority government that relied for its survival in the Canadian House of Commons on a block of Progressive and allied members of Parliament ( MPs ) . Eleven of this group sat as members of the UFA , and Brownlee met with several of them shortly after taking office to coordinate strategy on Alberta 's objectives . These MPs were doubly influential with King because of his desire to absorb them into the Liberal Party ; he viewed Progressives as " Liberals in a hurry " . In Saskatchewan , Liberal Premier Charles Avery Dunning remained in office with the support of the progressive farmers ' movement , but in Alberta Brownlee and the UFA were strong enough to govern without the support of the provincial Liberals , who remained bitter opponents of his government . 
 The relationship between Brownlee and King was helped by the former 's preference for the Liberals over the Conservatives . After King lost his seat in the 1925 federal election , he sought and received Brownlee 's advice on running in a by @-@ election in any of the four Liberal @-@ controlled Alberta constituencies . Brownlee 's preferences were not shared by all in the UFA : his Railways Minister , Vernor Smith , was accused of actively lobbying UFA MPs to vote with Arthur Meighen 's Conservatives during the King โ Byng Crisis . Moreover , not all of King 's ministers shared his desire to cooperate with Progressives : his cabinet 's Alberta representative , Charles Stewart , was implacably opposed to Brownlee and the UFA , which had defeated him in the 1921 provincial election when he was the Liberal Premier of Alberta . 
 King held Brownlee in high regard : he considered recruiting him to his cabinet as a replacement for Stewart in 1925 . He put this plan on hold when Brownlee became premier , but did not abandon it . When he made another attempt in 1929 , Brownlee expressed interest , reasserting his support for the federal Liberals , but indicated that he was not politically ambitious and that he would expect the right to resign if he disagreed with government policy . King found this response discouraging , and decided to await the results of the 1930 election before pressing the issue . King 's defeat in the 1930 federal election rendered the question moot . 
 = = = Natural resources = = = 
 On no issue was Brownlee 's relationship with the King government more critical than it was for the control of natural resources . The terms under which Alberta , like Saskatchewan and Manitoba , entered Canada left control of its natural resources with the federal government ; the British North America Act gave control of the older provinces ' natural resources to their provincial governments . While Alberta did receive compensation in the form of an annual grant , Brownlee , like his three immediate predecessors , felt that it was insufficient . The federal government had been committed since 1920 to the principle of transferring resource control to the province ; only the specific terms of the transfer remained to be established . Alberta , though willing to give up the grant , felt that it was owed compensation for land grants and mineral leases that were made by the federal government , but which Alberta would be expected to honour after the resources were transferred . 
 After years of wrangling between the federal government and Herbert Greenfield 's Alberta government โ wrangling in which Brownlee , as Greenfield 's attorney @-@ general , played a major role โ it initially appeared that the transfer was agreed upon : Brownlee met with King in Ottawa in January 1926 and signed the agreement ( subject to ratification by the federal Parliament and the Legislative Assembly of Alberta . However , the next month federal lawyer O. M. Biggar came to Edmonton to discuss minor changes to the agreement . One of these changes was a requirement that Alberta administer school lands and the school lands fund " for the support of schools organized and carried on therein , in accordance with the provisions of Section 17 of the Alberta Act " . Understanding this to mean only that the province would be required to use the school lands fund to support schools โ a proposition to which Brownlee had no objection โ he agreed . It soon emerged that what was actually intended was that Alberta continue to support separate Roman Catholic schools . Brownlee took exception to this , less from any objection to funding Catholic schools than on the principle that education was a matter of provincial jurisdiction , but King would not allow him to rescind his agreement . In fact , the change had been made at the instigation of Ernest Lapointe , King 's Quebec lieutenant , who wanted to placate Quebec nationalist leader Henri Bourassa , and in Tim Byrne 's opinion " was obviously a political move that had little to do with the agreement " . Brownlee countered by putting a modified version of the agreement to his legislature , one that replaced the offending language with " organized in accordance with the laws of the Province " . It passed unanimously . 
 This remained a point of contention until 1929 , when Brownlee and King agreed on a new wording : " organized in accordance with the laws of the Province , but in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the constitution . " The federal government had already agreed to continue the resource subsidy in perpetuity , but Brownlee objected to its plans to base the amount on Alberta 's 1929 population , which would see it receive less than Saskatchewan in perpetuity despite having a much faster @-@ growing population . When the federal Turgeon Commission recommended that Manitoba , in addition to a perpetual subsidy , receive a one @-@ time payment of more than $ 4 million , Brownlee demanded the same for Alberta . King countered that the purpose of that one time payment was to compensate Manitoba for years during which it , unlike Alberta and Saskatchewan , did not receive a subsidy ; Brownlee responded that the federal government had given away more than three times as much of Alberta 's land as Manitoba 's to the railways . King left the meeting in protest against this new demand , but he was determined to settle with Manitoba and Alberta in order to isolate Saskatchewan Premier James Thomas Milton Anderson and his more extravagant demands . He eventually accepted Brownlee 's terms , and an agreement was signed December 14 , 1929 . The agreement provided for an annual subsidy of $ 562 @,@ 000 until Alberta 's population reached 800 @,@ 000 and $ 750 @,@ 000 until it reached 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 , after which it would be $ 1 @,@ 125 @,@ 000 . 
 Brownlee was hailed as a hero in Alberta ; he had succeeded where every previous premier had failed . Despite sub @-@ zero temperatures , 3 @,@ 000 people greeted him at the railway station on his return to Edmonton , where he was feted by a band , a bonfire , and fireworks . As Lakeland College historian and Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster wrote , Brownlee was " at the peak of his political career " . In Byrne 's view , " this was the greatest achievement of Brownlee 's career as premier " and would , had he retired at the time , allowed him to " [ enter ] history as one of Alberta 's great premiers " . 
 = = = Railways = = = 
 In 1925 , the Alberta government owned four small railways whose founding syndicates , on whose behalf the government had made guarantees to financiers , had collapsed . The Greenfield government 's attempts to sell these lines to one or both of Canadian Pacific ( CP ) or Canadian National ( CN ) had failed . By 1925 , the money @-@ losing lines represented an annual drain of $ 1 @.@ 5 million on the provincial budget . Brownlee reprised old attempts in January 1926 , making direct offers to CN President Henry Thornton and CP President Edward Wentworth Beatty , but neither was interested , owing to the Alberta lines ' debts and operating losses . Faced with no buyers , potential <unk> willing to operate the lines only on terms unfavourable to the province , and in Vernor Smith a Minister of Railways who vigorously supported public ownership , Brownlee 's government opted to take over direct operation of the lines in 1927 . It also moved its contract for the transcontinental transport of the lines ' freight from CP to CN , in the hopes that doing so would ensure that both companies would have firsthand knowledge of the lines ' freight levels and be interested in acquiring them in better economic times . 
 Late in 1927 , Brownlee began to advocate for joint acquisition of the lines by CN and CP . When , in early 1928 , the lines began to show a profit thanks to the management of Deputy Minister of Railways John Callaghan , he began to pursue the idea with more vigour . One of the lines , the Lacombe and North Western , was sold to CP for $ 1 @.@ 5 million , and CP and CN made a joint offer of $ 15 million for the Edmonton , Dunvegan and British Columbia , the largest of the lines . Brownlee recommended against acceptance of the latter offer , believing that the price was too low , the terms of payment too unfavourable ( none would be made until 1930 , and the interest rate applied was only one and a half percent โ less than Brownlee believed that the province could earn in operating profits by keeping the railway ) , and the result of Alberta being left with a department of railways responsible for a single railway too undesirable . 
 This caution paid off later in the year when the province received and accepted a $ 25 million offer from CP ( with CN holding an option to acquire 50 % ownership ) to purchase the remaining lines . Brownlee 's negotiating skill was widely praised in the aftermath of the deal . 
 = = = Budget and fiscal policy = = = 
 As attorney @-@ general in the Greenfield government , Brownlee had been critical of its large deficits , and putting a stop to them was one of his priorities on taking office . He accomplished this objective sooner than he might have expected : though the government had projected a deficit for 1925 , on February 11 , 1926 , he announced to the legislature that the year 's accounts had actually recorded a surplus of $ 188 @,@ 019 . A second small surplus was recorded in 1926 . Securing control of natural resources and disposing of the railways were two elements of Brownlee 's strategy for ensuring that these surpluses continued , but he also took other measures . For example , on a trip to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1927 , he met with international financiers in an effort to increase their confidence in the creditworthiness of his government . 
 Brownlee advocated austerity despite surpluses . In November 1927 , at a First Ministers ' conference , he complained of increased public demand for spending in areas of provincial jurisdiction , such as education , health , and welfare . In the meantime , the federal government 's relatively reduced role in public spending allowed it the political credit that comes with running surpluses , reducing its debt , and cutting taxes . The following year he recommended that Alberta not opt @-@ in to the new federal @-@ provincial old age pension program because he felt that Alberta 's share was too onerous . The legislature accepted his recommendation for one year , to give him time to persuade the federal government to take on a greater share of the cost , but opted into the program after that even though no greater commitment from the federal government was forthcoming . 
 In 1928 , the Alberta government ran a surplus of $ 1 @,@ 578 @,@ 823 , the largest in its history and the second largest in the country . Despite this , Brownlee held firm to his desire to limit spending , warning of serious problems if the economy should go into recession . His resulting " Scrooge @-@ like " reputation began to take a toll on his popularity . 
 = = = Agricultural policy = = = 
 At Brownlee 's instigation , the Greenfield government had implemented a Debt Adjustment Act , which allowed farmers in Alberta 's drought @-@ stricken southeast to access credit counselling services and provided a way to settle creditors ' claims without ruining farmers or resorting to litigation . At the time , Brownlee had wanted to extend it province @-@ wide , but had been dissuaded by the opposition of moneylenders . In 1928 , as premier , Brownlee tried again . Lending institutions again objected , and threatened to withdraw from the province if the act was extended . Brownlee felt that these threats were disingenuous , noting that similar measures already existed to protect merchants . However , it was a prosperous time for farmers , and so mobilized support for the legislation was in shorter supply than it might have been during a time of economic hardship ; Brownlee , newly disillusioned with bankers , withdrew the bill . 
 In autumn 1928 , an early frost reduced farm incomes by between ten and 25 percent . Farmers began to demand the extension of the Debt Adjustment Act over the entire province , along with more radical measures . Citing the example of R. W. Barritt , a farmer near Mirror who had lost his farm at the end of 1928 to Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation despite diligent efforts to pay off his debt , they demanded legislation that would spread the burden of failed crops between debtor and creditor , rather than leaving it all on farmers . Brownlee rejected such calls : " Unless we are to say that individuals or companies who lend money in this Province in good faith must wait indefinitely for repayment , whatever may be the contract or agreement at the time , there comes a limit to the extent to which the Government is justified in interfering " . 
 As attorney @-@ general , Brownlee had played a major role in the creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool . As premier , he continued his support of it . In May 1927 he attended the Second International Cooperative Wheat Pool Conference in Kansas City , where he spoke on the importance of wheat pools in ensuring that farmers received " not occasionally , but with reasonable regularity , the cost of production plus an adequate and substantial return for [ their ] labor and investment " . On his return to Alberta , he participated in a rally to encourage farmers to sign on with the pool ; the effort enticed several new farmers , including the manager of the Prince of Wales ' ranch , to join . On a July 1927 trip to Europe , he investigated the possibility of marketing Alberta wheat directly to European millers , rather than passing it through multiple grain buyers , exporters , shippers , and importers , but found that European millers feared that buying directly from foreign sources would alienate domestic producers . 
 = = = Educational policy = = = 
 In 1927 , Perren Baker , Brownlee 's Minister of Education , had announced as his priorities improving the quality of teaching and ensuring that sufficient schools existed for the growing number of students wishing to earn a high school diploma . In pursuit of these objectives , he released a new School Act in 1929 , whose major initiative was to consolidate Alberta 's thousands of autonomous school districts , each with control over its own finances , into a smaller number of school divisions . The act also moved responsibility for teacher salaries and employment conditions from the school districts to the provincial government and standardized educational mill rates across the province . Educational reformers supported the legislation as a vehicle for coherent reform of the sort that was impossible under the decentralized status quo , but a large majority of rural residents , the staple of the UFA 's support base , opposed it for fear that it would lead to the closure of local schools and greater travel distances for rural students . While Brownlee strongly supported the bill , he ordered it withdrawn in deference to public opinion . 
 In 1928 , Brownlee 's government had to select a replacement for Henry Marshall Tory , the first President of the University of Alberta , who was leaving to become the first head of the National Research Council . After narrowing the candidates to Premier of Manitoba John Bracken and University of Manitoba geologist Robert Charles Wallace , Brownlee privately consulted friend and former Progressive leader Thomas Crerar , who knew both men . Crerar reported that in his opinion and those of his close friends Bracken was the better choice , owing to his superior administrative experience . Brownlee eventually opted for Wallace , both because of concern for Bracken 's health and for fear that he would be seen as a political appointment . 
 = = = Sexual sterilization = = = 
 The 1920s Progressive movement of which the Brownlee government was a part advocated eugenics , including the sexual sterilization of so @-@ called " mental defectives " to improve the genetic quality of the human race . First @-@ wave feminists such as Nellie McClung made public appeals to " save " mentally retarded girls from pregnancy . The medical profession suggested that many inmates of insane asylums could be safely released but for the concern that they would procreate . In 1928 , the Brownlee government introduced the Sexual Sterilization Act , allowing a Board of Examination โ jointly nominated by the University of Alberta Senate and the College of Physicians โ to mandate the sterilization of any psychiatric patient if it was " unanimously of the opinion that the patient might be safely discharged if the danger of procreation with its attendant risk of multiplication of the evil by transmission of the disability to progeny were eliminated " . Permission of the patient was nominally required , but permission of the nearest relative could be substituted in cases where the board considered the patient not mentally competent . 
 The Liberals and Conservatives opposed the bill , as did two of the five Labour members . Nor were the UFA members unanimous in the legislation 's support : Maurice Conner abstained , and thirteen others โ including Archibald Matheson , who had made early attempts to have the bill die on the order paper โ were absent for the final vote . Even so , the bill passed by a vote of 31 to 11 . The next day , posters appeared along Jasper Avenue advocating the sterilization of George Hoadley , Brownlee 's Minister of Health and the bill 's sponsor . 
 = = = Relationship with the UFA = = = 
 During the first part of Brownlee 's premiership , the presidency of the UFA was still held by his old friend and ally Henry Wise Wood . Wood 's considerable influence helped hold in check the organization 's more radical elements , who were generally antagonistic to the cautious and conservative Brownlee . Even so , Foster and Byrne suggest that towards the beginning of Brownlee 's term , he started to replace Wood as the " centre " of the UFA in a way that Greenfield had not . Despite this , his relationship with the UFA grassroots was sometimes stormy . The 1929 UFA convention saw vocal criticisms of Brownlee 's failure to adopt the old age pension and his decision to withdraw the Debt Adjustment Act in the face of opposition from banks . He also rejected the notion , dear to many UFA members , that a UFA government should be bound by the resolutions of the UFA membership . He felt that the heated atmosphere of UFA conventions did not lend itself to the development of prudent policy , and that the government of Alberta ought to be accountable not only to UFA members but to the population at large . 
 Not helping matters , the UFA , once a populist mass movement , was beginning to lose touch with its grassroots . In advance of the 1926 election , several constituencies had trouble generating the interest necessary for a nomination meeting . While the UFA membership strongly endorsed Baker 's proposed educational reforms , it soon emerged that a large majority of farmers opposed them . Such incidents only reinforced Brownlee 's disinclination to accept marching orders from UFA convention resolutions . 
 = = Depression and scandal ( 1930 โ 34 ) = = 
 = = = 1930 election = = = 
 Brownlee wanted to call an election in 1929 after his government won control of Alberta 's natural resources , but could not convince his cabinet or his caucus . Taking advantage of a period of increased popularity to call an early election was considered immoral by many in the UFA , the sort of thing that the old @-@ style parties might try but which the UFA had been elected to hold itself above . As such , an election was not held until June 19 , 1930 , four years less nine days after the previous one . 
 Brownlee was the campaign 's dominant figure , and gave 67 speeches around the province . He stressed the UFA government 's experience and contrasted it with the Liberals ' and Conservatives ' lack thereof . Having signed the resource agreement , he asked for a mandate to administer its implementation . In response to claims that a strong opposition was needed to exercise a check on his certain @-@ to @-@ be @-@ re @-@ elected government , he restated his view of government as " the administration of business " by saying " an opposition is a thing that is no more needed in the public business of this Province ... than in the management of the affairs of any of our large corporations . " Byrne suggests that Brownlee arrived at this belief rationally but , once he had done so , " adhered to [ it ] with an almost religious conviction " . 
 The election gave the UFA a slightly reduced majority , with 39 of the legislature 's 63 seats . Labour candidates , on behalf of many of whom Brownlee campaigned , won a further four . The Liberals remained the official opposition with eleven members , while the Conservatives returned six . The remaining three seats were won by independent candidates . 
 = = = Collapse of agricultural prices = = = 
 In the 1920s and 1930s , Alberta 's economy was heavily reliant on wheat , and in 1930 the price of wheat began to fall drastically . From its peak of $ 1 @.@ 78 per bushel in summer 1929 , by February 1930 it had fallen to $ 1 @.@ 07 because of world oversupply and dumping by the Soviet Union and Argentina . By March it had reached $ 1 @.@ 00 , a level at which most Alberta wheat farmers could not profit . By the fall , it had had fallen below $ 0 @.@ 60 and by the end of the year to $ 0 @.@ 45 . Other agricultural products , especially cattle , poultry , and eggs , saw similar or greater price decreases . 
 In February 1930 Brownlee advocated a federally guaranteed minimum price to farmers of $ 0 @.@ 70 per bushel of wheat . In November he asked new Prime Minister R. B. Bennett , with whom he had practiced law in Calgary nearly twenty years previous , to stabilize wheat " at some reasonable price " . Bennett replied that price decreases were inevitable in the face of a global oversupply of 400 million bushels . Brownlee also sought assistance from Bennett in dealing with banks ' increasing reluctance to loan money to farmers , many of whom would not be able to purchase seed for the 1931 crop without loans . Brownlee himself offered such farmers limited assistance , but only quietly and only in the last resort ; he was concerned that a well @-@ publicized and widespread program of loan guarantees would induce banks to loan money under predatory terms , knowing that if the farmers could not make the repayments the province would . When he reluctantly agreed to guarantee banks ' loans to farmers for binder twine , he insisted that these guarantees be kept secret to discourage farmers from shifting loans that they could pay off themselves to the provincial government . To address the problem of farmers being forced to pledge one third of their crop as security on loans , he threatened to implement legislation capping such crop share guarantees at one quarter . As he had hoped , this threat enhanced lenders ' willingness to negotiate with his government for less radical solutions ; these eventually included caps that applied only in low yield areas of the province and an agreement to give three to four weeks notice before initiating foreclosures and to initiate them only where farmers ' payments did not even cover interest . Despite these minor successes , Brownlee 's strategy of negotiation and relying on the reasonableness of all parties rather than imposing strong legislation left his popularity among farmers diminished . It was not enhanced when he supported unpopular federal legislation requiring farmers to plant less wheat , part of an international agreement aimed at addressing worldwide oversupply . 
 A second consequence of collapsing wheat prices was the threat they posed to the Alberta Wheat Pool ( AWP ) . Falling prices and the attendant tightened credit conditions led the Pool , along with its counterparts in Saskatchewan and Manitoba , to seek help from its provincial government in 1930 . Brownlee guaranteed loans to the Pool , but told the legislature that he did not expect this guarantee to prove necessary , since the large portions of the 1929 crop already sold at higher prices would provide sufficient cushioning unless wheat prices fell " to a level never reached on Canadian markets " . In October 1930 , with the Pool receiving a price for its wheat well below the $ 1 @.@ 00 per bushel that it guaranteed its farmers , the banks refused to loan more money unless the Pool appointed to its Central Selling Agency ( CSA ) a general manager acceptable to the banks . Brownlee and Premiers John Bracken of Manitoba and James Thomas Milton Anderson of Saskatchewan met in Ottawa with acting Prime Minister Sir George Perley , seeking direct federal aid to the Pools . The premiers ' pleas rejected , CSA President Alexander James McPhail offered the banks the names of two possible general managers . The first was John McFarland , former president of the Alberta Pacific Grain Company . The second was Brownlee . The banks chose McFarland . Brownlee too imposed conditions on the AWP as a condition of provincial assistance : he wanted the provincial government to be consulted on all AWP managerial decisions and given the right to veto capital expenditures , and he required it to increase its sales commission from three quarters of a cent per bushel to one cent . While these conditions met with resistance from farmer leaders who believed that they would transform the AWP from a farmers ' organization to a grain company like any other , Brownlee was supported by UFA President Henry Wise Wood , the AWP was reliant on provincial support , and the conditions were accepted . 
 = = = Urban unemployment = = = 
 The effects of the Great Depression were not felt only on Alberta 's farms . By the winter of 1930 โ 1931 , unemployment in Edmonton and Calgary was at record levels , which were only exacerbated by a migration of farmers ' offspring , hoping to find work , to the cities . Brownlee , who had long advocated curtailed immigration to the western provinces , urged the federal government to prevent new migrants from swelling the ranks of Alberta 's unemployed . He also asked that it shoulder a greater share of ever @-@ rising relief payments ; by 1932 , it started to do so . 
 Unemployment bred labour militancy . In December 1930 , Brownlee asked John Lymburn , his attorney @-@ general , to prepare a list of known Communist leaders so he could arrange for their deportation where possible . He staunchly opposed the activities of organizations that he viewed as communist , including the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association and the Farmers ' Unity League . In December 1932 , labour organizers staged a " Hunger March " , at which 1 @,@ 000 unemployed met in Edmonton 's Market Square and marched to the legislature building . Brownlee refused to grant permission for the march and requested and received police assistance in breaking it up . While he pronounced himself willing to meet with a delegation of the march 's leaders , he believed that the atmosphere at the march would be dangerously volatile and refused to address it . One participant said " A lot of us understood that [ Brownlee ] couldn 't do too much , but we figured since it 's a farmers ' government , least he can do is come out and explain . But they wouldn 't let us near the Parliament Building . " 
 = = = Deteriorating provincial finances = = = 
 The shrinking provincial economy and increasing relief payments brought about the return of public deficits to Alberta . Brownlee , a fiscal conservative in good times , became still more aggressive in cutting spending . In 1931 the government closed all but two of the province 's agricultural colleges , the creation of which by the Liberal government of Arthur Sifton had been a major UFA victory . The civil service shrank from 2 @,@ 566 at the beginning of 1930 to 1 @,@ 600 at the end of 1931 . Government spending on advertising fell from $ 36 @,@ 000 in 1929 to less than $ 8 @,@ 000 in 1932 . In 1932 the government disbanded the Alberta Provincial Police and asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to take over policing in the province . The same year , government employees earning more than $ 100 per month took 10 % pay cuts ; in Brownlee 's case , this translated into an annual reduction of nearly $ 1 @,@ 500 . 
 Brownlee 's government also took action to increase government revenues : the 1932 budget increased corporate taxes and imposed a new personal income tax on individuals earning more than $ 750 per year and couples earning more than $ 1 @,@ 500 ; fewer than 100 farmers in the province earned enough to pay it . In 1933 he joined Bracken and Anderson in protesting to Bennett that nothing more could be done : in Brownlee 's view , the province 's impoverished people could not pay more taxes , and yet expectations of provincial governments were constantly growing . Left to their own devices , the premiers said , they would have to either drastically cut relief payments or default on debt payments . They asked that the federal government increase its share of unemployment relief from one third to one half and that it loan the provinces the money they needed to pay their share . Bennett replied by chastising the premiers for not doing enough to " work into a position of self @-@ reliance " and decreed that federal support would be cut off unless budget deficits were limited to $ 1 million . In a separate letter to Brownlee , he praised him for doing " better than any one of the Western Provinces " but said that , in the interests of equality , he was imposing the same conditions on Alberta as on the others . 
 Despite Brownlee 's efforts , Alberta 's budgetary position worsened . In 1931 the government ran a deficit of $ 2 @.@ 5 million , the first of Brownlee 's premiership ; 1932 's deficit surpassed $ 4 million . Also in 1932 , the Alberta government came within hours of defaulting on a $ 3 million bond , and was saved only by a loan from the federal government . Over the longer @-@ term , it funded its operations by a $ 15 million issue at record interest rates ; even this was taken up only because of guarantees from the federal government . 
 = = = Political radicalism = = = 
 Henry Wise Wood declined to seek re @-@ election as UFA President at its 1931 convention , and was replaced by Robert Gardiner . In contrast to Wood , Gardiner was firmly entrenched on the progressive movement 's left @-@ wing . He denounced Brownlee 's approach to economic policy , saying that his austerity only exacerbated the problem of <unk> . Under Gardiner , the UFA moved increasingly to the left , well out of step with the Brownlee government , and passed resolutions calling for the nationalization of land , radio broadcasting , and hydroelectricity , along with the cancellation of interest payments as long as the price of agricultural commodities was less than the cost of their production . In 1932 , prominent UFA members โ including MP William Irvine โ attended the founding convention of the Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation in Calgary . This new federal party advocated socialism and considered itself a partnership between farmers and labourers ; Brownlee wanted no part of its policies . 
 At around the same time , Calgary radio evangelist William Aberhart began to preach a new economic theory called social credit . Though the theory required control of monetary policy , a federal responsibility , it became increasingly popular among former UFA supporters who , following Aberhart 's instructions , began to form local social credit " study groups " . Brownlee argued against social credit on the basis that its application by a provincial government would be unconstitutional and that it would do nothing to create markets for Alberta 's unsold wheat , which he viewed as the source of Alberta 's woes . The legislature held a series of hearings to investigate the theory , and both Aberhart and C. H. Douglas , the theory 's originator , testified at them . Brownlee questioned both on how the introduction of " credit certificates " issued by the Alberta government could help people so heavily dependent on interprovincial and international trade ; neither answered the question to his satisfaction . 
 In defending his conservatism , Brownlee emphasized that " history has yet to record a single instance of the revolutionary method that has not resulted in a welter of discord and misery " and mused that " if the results were not so tragical , [ sic ] I would like to see Canada put under the most extreme form of socialistic or communistic Government in order that our people could have the actual experience of what would happen and learn for themselves the lesson that in our present day world situation , one nation cannot fashion for itself any level of prosperity regardless of the position of the rest of the world " . Even as he rejected the radical solutions posed by others , Brownlee had no solutions of his own to offer but government thrift and moderate debt adjustment . 
 = = = Royal commission = = = 
 While Brownlee was viewed as an orthodox conservative in his approach to economic matters within Alberta , elsewhere in Canada he was still regarded as a leader of the country 's radical farmer movement . Accordingly , when Bennett struck a royal commission to examine the government 's role in economic and monetary management , he asked Brownlee to serve on it as a representative of Western and unorthodox views . Though he was concerned that the commission 's other two Canadian members , <unk> Leman and William Thomas White , were involved in the banking industry , Brownlee agreed to the appointment . He was formally appointed with the rest of the members July 31 , 1933 , and the commission began its work in Ottawa on August 8 . 
 The royal commission conducted hearings across the country . In Victoria , Brownlee questioned witnesses on how poverty among prairie farmers was hurting British Columbia 's lumber and salmon packing industries . In Calgary he drew testimony from farmers that farming conditions were excellent โ in contrast with the wide belief in eastern Canada that western farmers ' troubles were caused by drought and land unsuited for agriculture โ and that the problem was " not due to Acts of God but to Acts of Man " . 
 The UFA 's submission , presented in Calgary by Gardiner , emphasized these points and accused the banks of charging predatory interest rates . It called on the commission to recommend a government @-@ owned central bank and controls on interest , and concluded that " the monetary system has failed " . Brownlee himself wrote the Alberta government 's submission , though it was presented at the commission 's Edmonton hearings by Acting Premier George Hoadley . It echoed the UFA 's points about interest rates and the importance of a government @-@ owned central bank , and accused the banks of treating the west unequally to the east . The commission concluded its hearings in Ottawa in September , where representatives of the banks testified . Brownlee criticized them for " discounting " , a practice whereby banks charged higher de facto interest rates than the legal maximum by requiring loan recipients to consent to having a portion of their loan withheld . 
 The commission 's report , issued September 29 , recommended the establishment of a central bank and an inquiry on the availability of credit to farmers . Brownlee supported both recommendations , and attached a minority report calling for banks to end their disparate treatment of eastern and western debtors , urging that a statutory maximum interest rate be maintained and possibly lowered , and recommending that the proposed central bank be entirely government owned and controlled . This last recommendation came to pass in 1938 , when the Bank of Canada , originally controlled by a mix of public and private interests , was reorganized as a federal Crown corporation .

 Provincially , Brownlee had always enjoyed better relations with the Conservatives than the Liberals . A. A. McGillivray , Conservative leader from 1925 until 1929 , was a friend of his , as was his successor David Duggan . The Liberals despised Brownlee and the UFA , and in 1932 selected William R. Howson , one of their most militant MLAs , as leader . Howson was aggressive in trying to uncover evidence of scandal and malfeasance , including the sensational divorce of Oran McPherson . He was aided in these attacks by the unabashedly Liberal Edmonton Bulletin , which distributed free copies of issues containing coverage of the divorce in McPherson 's southern Little Bow riding . As the depression and , later , Brownlee 's sex scandal took their toll on Brownlee 's government , Howson was certain that he would imminently become premier . 
 Brownlee 's relations with the federal parties were somewhat more harmonious . While he personally preferred the Liberals , his history with Bennett led to a cordial working relationship . Both parties made overtures towards Brownlee : King had invited him to join his cabinet while he was still attorney @-@ general , and in 1932 sent an emissary to encourage union of all political parties opposed to the Conservatives . Brownlee reiterated his policy to deal " equally with Liberals and Conservatives in Ottawa " , and declined King 's overtures . So too did Alberta Liberals , led by Howson and Charles Stewart , who sought to replace Brownlee rather than join with him . In 1934 , the Conservatives sent H. R. Milner to raise the possibility of the UFA and the Conservatives joining together against the Liberals and Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation ; Brownlee expressed interest , but made no move to enact such a coalition . A frustrated Bennett dismissed him as " a time server whose one object , apparently , is to retain office . " 
 = = = Sex scandal = = = 
 On September 22 , 1933 , Liberal lawyer Neil MacLean filed a statement of claim on behalf of Vivian MacMillan and her father Allan MacMillan , suing Brownlee for the seduction of Vivian . It alleged that Brownlee had lured her to Edmonton from her home in Edson in 1930 with the promise of a job in the provincial attorney @-@ general 's office . Upon her arrival , she had become a close friend of the family 's . One night Brownlee had told her that because of his wife Florence 's ill health , they were unable to have a sexual relationship , and that MacMillan must yield to him to prevent him from resuming a sexual relationship with Florence that would likely kill her . MacMillan had eventually yielded , and the ensuing affair lasted until July 1933 . Brownlee denied MacMillan 's story completely and counter @-@ sued MacMillan and her fiance , John Caldwell , for conspiracy . 
 A sensational trial ensued in June 1934 , which was reported in lurid detail by the Bulletin . Despite Brownlee 's exposure of contradictions in MacMillan 's story , the jury found in favour of the plaintiffs and awarded Vivian $ 10 @,@ 000 and her father $ 5 @,@ 000 . Trial judge William Carlos Ives disagreed with the jury 's finding and ruled that even if Vivian MacMillan 's story had been true , as a matter of law there could be no successful suit for seduction without damages being proved . He overturned the jury 's finding and ruled in Brownlee 's favour . The case was eventually appealed to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council , at the time Canada 's highest court of appeal , which found in favour of the plaintiffs . 
 The legal processes and arguments were irrelevant to John Brownlee 's political career : as soon as the jury found that he had seduced Vivian MacMillan , he announced that he would resign as premier as soon as a successor could be found . On July 10 , 1934 , he was succeeded as Premier of Alberta by Richard Gavin Reid . 
 = Mario Andretti = 
 Mario Gabriele Andretti ( born February 28 , 1940 ) is an Italian American former racing driver , one of the most successful Americans in the history of the sport . He is one of only two drivers to win races in Formula One , IndyCar , World Sportscar Championship and NASCAR ( the other being Dan Gurney ) . He also won races in midget cars , and sprint cars . During his career , Andretti won the 1978 Formula One World Championship , four IndyCar titles ( three under USAC @-@ sanctioning , one under CART ) , and IROC VI . To date , he remains the only driver ever to win the Indianapolis 500 ( 1969 ) , Daytona 500 ( 1967 ) and the Formula One World Championship , and , along with Juan Pablo Montoya , the only driver to have won a race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series , Formula One , and an Indianapolis 500 . No American has won a Formula One race since Andretti 's victory at the 1978 Dutch Grand Prix . Andretti had 109 career wins on major circuits . 
 Andretti had a long career in racing . He was the only person to be named United States Driver of the Year in three decades ( 1967 , 1978 , and 1984 ) . He was also one of only three drivers to win races on road courses , paved ovals , and dirt tracks in one season , a feat that he accomplished four times . With his final IndyCar win in April 1993 , Andretti became the first driver to win IndyCar races in four different decades and the first to win automobile races of any kind in five . 
 In American popular culture , his name has become synonymous with speed , similar to Barney Oldfield in the early twentieth century and Stirling Moss in the United Kingdom . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mario Andretti and his twin brother Aldo were born to Alvise Andretti , a farm administrator , and his wife , Rina , in Montona , Istria ( now Motovun , Croatia ) . Istria was then part of the Kingdom of Italy , but it was annexed by Yugoslavia at the end of World War II , as confirmed by the Treaty of Paris . The Andretti family left Montona in 1948 , during the Istrian exodus , ending up in a refugee camp in Lucca , Italy . They emigrated to the United States of America in 1955 , settling in Nazareth in Pennsylvania 's Lehigh Valley with just $ 125 to their name . Andretti became a naturalized United States citizen in 1964 .

 The twins ' mother Rina said that when they were two years old , they would take pot lids out of the cupboards and run around the kitchen , going " Vroom , vroom , " like they were driving cars โ this before they had seen a car . In 1945 , at the age of five , he and Aldo were racing their hand @-@ crafted wooden cars through the steep streets of their hometown . Later , the brothers were hired by a garage to park cars , Andretti described the experience in his book What 's It Like Out There : " The first time I fired up a car , felt the engine shudder and the wheel come to life in my hands , I was hooked . It was a feeling I can 't describe . I still get it every time I get into a race car . " Andretti 's first racing experience was in a new youth racing league called Formula Junior in Ancona , Italy when he was thirteen years old . However , the Formula Junior story is likely apocryphal . In an interview during an <unk> Evening with Mario Andretti , Mr. Andretti recounts the story of his early days of Dirt Track racing in Pennsylvania with his brother , Aldo , and implies that he and his brother made up the story of racing in the Formula Junior league because they looked the part after having purchased racing suits from Italy . 
 He had two fond childhood memories of watching a stretch of the Mille Miglia race in 1954 which caused him to become captivated by Italian two @-@ time Formula One world champion Alberto Ascari , who won the race , which got him to go to Monza for the Italian Grand Prix , where he saw Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio race against each other .

 Mario and Aldo were surprised to find a half @-@ mile dirt racing track when they moved to Nazareth . The twins worked on a 1948 Hudson Commodore modified funded by money that they earned in their uncle 's garage in 1959 . They took turns racing the old Hudson on oval dirt tracks near Nazareth in 1959 . They did not tell their parents that they were racing . The twins each had two wins after their first four races . Aldo was seriously hurt near the end of the season , and their parents were unhappy to find out that the twins were racing . Mario had 21 modified <unk> wins in 46 races in 1960 and 1961 .

 Andretti 's goal was to race in single @-@ seater open wheel cars . Andretti said " Aldo and I were winning in the <unk> . But my objective was to get into open @-@ wheelers . " 
 Andretti raced midget cars from 1961 to 1963 . He started racing 3 / 4 ( sized ) midget cars in the American Three Quarter Midget Racing Association in the winter to be seen by full @-@ sized midget car owners . He raced in over one hundred events in 1963 . Andretti won three feature races at two different tracks on Labor Day in 1963 . He won an afternoon feature at Flemington , New Jersey , and swept twin features at Hatfield , Pennsylvania . 
 The next rung on the racing ladder on the East Coast of the United States was to race in sprint cars in the United Racing Club ( URC ) . Andretti was able to get a ride for individual races in the URC sprint car racing series , but was unable to secure a full @-@ time ride . He once drove from Canada to Mechanicsburg , Pennsylvania hoping to find a ride in an event , but he went empty @-@ handed . He bypassed the series when he was offered a full @-@ time ride in a United States Automobile Club sprint car for 1964 .

 = = = = IndyCar career ( 1964 โ 1974 ) = = = = 
 From 1956 to 1979 , the top open wheel racing series in North America was the USAC National Championship . It was often referred to as Champ car racing , or Indycar racing , referring to the famous Indianapolis 500 race which was the centerpiece of the championship . The races were run on a mixture of paved and dirt ovals , and in later years also included some road courses . 
 Andretti made his Champ Car debut on April 19 , 1964 at the New Jersey State fairgrounds in Trenton , New Jersey . He started sixteenth and finishing eleventh . Andretti was introduced by his USAC sprint car owner , Rufus Gray , to veteran mechanic Clint Brawner . Brawner was not impressed since sprint car drivers Stan Bowman and Donnie Davis had recently died , and Brawner 's current driver , Chuck Hulse , had been critically injured . Chris Economaki recommended Andretti to Brawner , so Brawner watched Andretti race at Terre Haute , Indiana . Brawner was convinced that he had found the new driver for his team . The two stayed together for six years . Andretti finished eleventh in the USAC National Championship that season . Andretti won his first championship car race at the Hoosier Grand Prix on a road course at Indianapolis Raceway Park in 1965 . His third @-@ place finish at the 1965 Indianapolis 500 in the Brawner Hawk ( a mechanical copy of the current Brabham Formula 1 design ) earned him the race 's Rookie of the Year award , and contributed towards Andretti winning the series championship . He was the youngest national champion in series history at age 25 . He repeated as series champion in 1966 , winning eight of fifteen events . He also won the pole at the 1966 Indianapolis 500 . Andretti finished second in the IndyCars in 1967 and 1968 . He also won a single non @-@ championship drag race in 1967 in a Ford Mustang . In both 1967 and 1968 , Andretti lost the season USAC championship to A. J. Foyt and Bobby Unser , respectively , in the waning laps of the last race of the season at Riverside , California โ each by the smallest points margin in history . 
 Andretti won nine races in 1969 , the 1969 Indianapolis 500 , and the season championship . He also won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb , which was part of the USAC National Championship . He was named ABC 's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year . Between 1966 and 1969 he won 29 of 85 USAC championship races . 
 In 1973 , USAC split its National Championship into dirt and pavement championships . Andretti had one win on the pavement and finished fifth in the season points , and finished second in the dirt championship . He competed in USAC 's dirt track division in 1974 , and won the dirt track championship while competing in both series . Andretti also competed in the North American Formula 5000 series in 1973 and 1974 , and finished second in the championship in both seasons .

 Formula One is the highest form of open wheel racing sanctioned by the Fรฉdรฉration Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) , motorsport 's international governing body . Although originating in Europe , by the 1960s it included races worldwide . At Andretti 's first Indianapolis 500 , in 1965 , he met Colin Chapman , owner of the Lotus Formula One team , who was running eventual race winner Jim Clark 's car . Andretti told Chapman of his ambition to compete in Formula One and was told " When you 're ready , call me . " By 1968 Andretti felt he was ready . Chapman gave him a car , and the young American took the pole position on his debut at the 1968 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen in his Lotus 49 . 
 Andretti drove sporadically in Formula One over the next four years for Lotus , March , and Ferrari , while continuing to focus on his racing career in America . At the 1971 South African Grand Prix , on his debut for Ferrari , he won his first Grand Prix . Three weeks later , at the non @-@ championship <unk> Grand Prix in the U.S. , he brought the Italian team a second victory . 
 = = = = = Full @-@ time status ( 1975 โ 1981 ) = = = = = 
 It wasn 't until 1975 that Andretti drove a full Formula One season , for the American Parnelli team . The team was new to Formula One , although it had been successful in both Formula 5000 and IndyCar racing in America with Andretti driving . The team had run Andretti in the two North American end @-@ of @-@ season races in 1974 with promising results . Andretti qualified fourth and led the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix for nine laps before his suspension failed . He scored five championship points in the season . Andretti continued to compete in IndyCar , missing two Formula One races in the middle of the season to do so . 
 When the Parnelli team pulled out of Formula One after two races of the 1976 season , Andretti returned to Chapman 's Lotus team , for whom he had already driven at the season @-@ opening Brazilian Grand Prix . Lotus was then at a low point , having failed to produce a competitive car to replace 1970 's Lotus 72 . Andretti 's ability at developing a racing car contributed to Lotus ' return to the front of the Formula One grid , culminating in lapping the field in his victory at the season ending race at the Mount Fuji circuit in Japan . Since mid @-@ 1975 Lotus had been developing the use of ground effect , shaping the underside of the car to generate downforce with little penalizing drag . For his part , Andretti worked at setting up his cars for the races , exploiting subtle differences in tire size ( ' stagger ' ) and suspension set up ( ' cross weighting ' ) on each side of the car to optimize it for each track , an approach imported from his extensive oval racing experience in the United States . In 1977 , at Long Beach , he became the only American to win the United States Grand Prix West , and the last American as of 2015 to win any US Grand Prix . The Lotus 78 " wing car " proved to be the most competitive car of 1977 , but despite winning four races , more than any other driver , reliability problems and collisions with other drivers meant Andretti finished only third in the championship . The following year , the Lotus 79 exploited ground effect even further and Andretti took the title with six wins . He clinched the championship at the Italian Grand Prix . There was no championship celebration because his teammate and close friend Ronnie Peterson crashed heavily at the start of the race ; he was hospitalised and died that night from complications resulting from his injuries . 
 Andretti would find little success after 1978 in Formula One โ he failed to win another grand prix . He had a difficult year in 1979 , as the new Lotus 80 was not competitive , and the team had to rely on the Lotus 79 which had been overtaken by the second generation of ground effect cars . In 1980 , he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis , and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell , but the team was again unsuccessful . 
 Andretti had an unsuccessful 1981 with the Alfa Romeo team . Like other drivers of the period he did not like the ground effect cars of the time : " the cars were getting absurd , really crude , with no suspension movement whatever . It was toggle switch driving with no need for any kind of delicacy ... it made leaving Formula One a lot easier than it would have been . " 
 = = = = = Brief returns with Williams and Ferrari ( 1982 ) = = = = = 
 The next year Andretti raced once for the Williams team , after their driver Carlos Reutemann suddenly quit , before replacing the seriously injured Didier Pironi at Ferrari for the last two races of the year . Suspension failure dropped him out of the last race of the season , but at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza he took the pole position and finished third in the race . 
 In a 2012 interview , 1980 World Champion Alan Jones stated that Ferrari , looking for a proven top class driver , had actually contacted him to drive for the team in late 1982 . Jones however was enjoying his time back in Australia and took too long to give Ferrari an answer ( a move Jones regrets ) so instead they contacted Andretti who had no such hesitations . Ironically , Jones later decided to make a comeback to F1 in 1983 ( unlike Andretti ) and had he taken the seat at Ferrari its likely they would have kept the former World Champion for that year which would have seen him drive a very competitive car ( Ferrari won the Constructors ' Championship in 1983 ) . 
 There was almost a return to F1 for Andretti at the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix when the Renault team put Mario on standby to replace regular driver Patrick Tambay if the Frenchman had been unable to race , as was the case at the previous race in Canada . However , in the event , Tambay was able to take part in the race . 
 Andretti was also considered as a replacement , again for Tambay who had been injured in Canada , at the 1986 Detroit Grand Prix , this time for the Carl Haas owned Haas Lola team . Mario declined however , but recommended his son Michael Andretti for the drive . Unfortunately for Michael he was unable to obtain the FIA <unk> required to allow him to race in Formula One . Instead the drive went to Eddie Cheever . 
 = = = = Return to IndyCar racing ( 1982 โ 1994 ) = = = = 
 Andretti had continued to race , and occasionally win , in the USAC National Championship during his time in the Formula One world championship . In 1979 a new organization , Championship Auto Racing Teams , had set up the Indycar world series as a rival to the USAC National Championships that Andretti had won three times in the 1960s . The new series had rapidly become the top open wheel racing series in North America . 
 It was to this arena that Andretti returned full @-@ time in 1982 , driving for Patrick Racing . He returned to the 1982 Indianapolis 500 as well . After starting in row 2 Andretti got victimized by a controversial wreck during the pace @-@ laps when rookie Kevin Cogan suddenly spun out for no apparent reason . Andretti was livid and engaged in a shoving match with Cogan . In an interview 3 minutes after the wreck Andretti was heard saying " This is what happens when you have children doing a man 's job up front . " 
 In 1983 he joined the new Newman / Haas Racing team , set up by Carl Haas and actor Paul Newman using cars built by British company Lola . Andretti took the team 's first win at Elkhart Lake in 1983 . He won the pole for nine of sixteen events in 1984 , and claimed his fourth Champ Car title at the age of 44 . He edged out Tom <unk> by 13 points . It was the first series title for the second year team . 
 Mario 's son Michael joined Newman / Haas in 1989 . Together , they made history as the first father / son team to compete in both IMSA GT and Champ Car racing , as for the former , it was their fourth time in an endurance race together as co @-@ drivers . Mario finished seventh in points for the 1991 season , the year that Michael won the championship . Mario 's last victory in IndyCar racing came in 1993 at Phoenix International Raceway , the year that Michael left Newman / Haas to race in Formula One . The win made Mario the oldest recorded winner in an IndyCar event ( 53 years , 34 days old ) . Andretti qualified on the pole at the Michigan 500 later that year with a speed of 234 @.@ 275 miles per hour ( 377 @.@ 029 km / h ) . The speed was a new closed course world record . Andretti 's final season , in 1994 , was dubbed " The Arrivederci Tour " . He raced in the last of his 407 Indy car races that September . 
 = = = = Indianapolis 500 = = = = 
 Andretti won once at the Indianapolis 500 in 29 attempts . Andretti has had so many incidents and near victories at the track that critics have dubbed the family 's performance after Mario 's 1969 Indianapolis 500 victory the " Andretti Curse " . 
 Andretti finished all 500 miles ( 800 km ) just five times , including his 1969 Indianapolis 500 victory . Andretti was the first driver to exceed 200 miles per hour ( 320 km / h ) while practising for the 1977 Indianapolis 500 . In 1969 , after 4 years of bad luck and 4 drop @-@ outs , Andretti dominated the Indianapolis 500 en route to his first victory in the race . The race is notable as it is the only Indy 500 in history where the winning driver ran the whole race on only 1 set of tires . 
 Between his 1969 victory in the race and 1981 , Andretti dropped out of the races due to part failures or crashes . His luck seemed to turn around in 1981 . Andretti finished second in the 1981 Indianapolis 500 by eight seconds behind Bobby Unser . The following day Unser was penalized one lap for passing cars under a caution flag , and Andretti was declared the winner . Unser and his car owner Roger Penske appealed the race stewards ' decision . USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later , and penalized Unser with a $ 40 @,@ 000 fine . 
 At the start of the 1982 Indianapolis 500 , second @-@ year driver Kevin Cogan , teammate to polesitter Rick Mears , suddenly spun right when accelerating for the green flag . Cogan bounced off A. J. Foyt , slamming Foyt 's steering rod . That contact turned Cogan 's car left at a 90 degree angle to the field where he was promptly t @-@ boned by Mario . Andretti was livid and engaged in a shoving match with Cogan before walking off . In an interview , 3 minutes after the wreck , an irked Andretti was heard saying " This is what happens when you have children doing a man 's job up front . " Andretti 's Patrick Racing teammate that year was the eventual race winner , Gordon Johncock , who started next to Andretti in the middle of row two . In later years , Johncock pointed out that Andretti had jumped the start , and could have avoided the spinning car of Cogan had he been lined up properly in the second row next to Gordy . 
 In the 1985 Indianapolis 500 , he was passed for the lead by Danny Sullivan in Turn One on lap 139 . Immediately after completing the pass , Sullivan spun in front of Andretti . A caution for the spin , minimized the time Sullivan would lose to Andretti by pitting to replace 20 laps later Sullivan took the lead for good when he passed Andretti without incident . Andretti dominated the 1987 Indianapolis 500 , leading 170 of the first 177 laps of the race . His lead was so large , that he was advised to slow his pace to preserve his equipment . In a cruel twist of fate , when Andretti started running slower , his reduced engine rpm 's created a harmonic imbalance in his turbocharged <unk> / Chevrolet V8 that led to a broken valve spring with 20 laps to go . 
 The 1992 Indianapolis 500 was run in extremely cold weather which resulted in a large number of wrecks by cars on cold tires . Andretti accelerated off of turn three for the restart at the end of the 83rd lap . Under acceleration , Mario 's car got loose in the middle of turn four and rotated 270 degrees to smash nose first into the wall . Andretti was taken to the hospital with 6 of his toes broken and would shortly be joined by his son Jeff Andretti who smashed both legs after a wheel came loose on his race car on the 109th lap of the race . Mario would only miss one race due to his injuries , and returned to run 6th in a race just four weeks after his crash . The 1993 Indianapolis 500 was Andretti 's last notable run , and he had just come off a victory at Phoenix . On pole day , Andretti was the first car to complete a qualifying run , and sat on the provisional pole position . Andretti 's speed held up all afternoon , but with less than an hour to go , Arie <unk> topped his speed , and took the pole . On race day , Andretti was a factor most of the afternoon , leading the most laps ( 72 ) . While leading on lap 134 , Andretti was penalized for entering the pits while they were closed . A stop @-@ and @-@ go penalty dropped him only down to second place . In the final 50 laps , he began developing handling problems because of his tires , and slid down the standings to finish 5th . Andretti 's last race at Indy was the 1994 Indianapolis 500 . 
 On April 23 , 2003 , in the lead up to the 2003 Indy 500 , Andretti took to the track for the first time in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63 . He participated in a test session for son Michael 's AGR IndyCar team . One of the team 's regular drivers , Tony Kanaan , suffered a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi . If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time , tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him . He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day , though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race . During the test , Andretti ran at competitive speeds , but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash . Andretti was able to walk away from the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin . This was Andretti 's last significant on @-@ track activity at Indianapolis . 
 = = = Sports cars = = = 
 Andretti won three 12 Hours of Sebring endurance races ( 1967 , 1970 , 1972 ) , and the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1972 . In early sportscar races he competed for the Holman Moody team , but later often drove for Ferrari . He signed with Ferrari in 1971 , and won several races with co @-@ driver Jacky Ickx . In 1972 he shared wins in the three North American rounds of the championship and at Brands Hatch in the UK , contributing to Ferrari 's dominant victory in that year 's World Championship for Makes . He also competed in the popular North American Can @-@ Am series in the late 1960s and early 1970s .

 Andretti competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in four decades . In 1966 he shared a Holman Moody Ford MKII with Lucien Bianchi . They retired after their car dropped a valve at 10 : 30 pm In 1967 , during a 3 : 30 am pit stop , a mechanic inadvertently installed a front brake pad backward on his Ford <unk> . As Andretti passed under the Dunlop Bridge before the <unk> , he touched his brake pedal for the first time since leaving the pits .
