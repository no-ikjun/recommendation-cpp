 White grew up in Victoria and was keen to return to Melbourne after he was drafted to the Fremantle Dockers in Western Australia . He is married to Stacy , and in Melbourne they lived at Sandringham . The pair met on the Gold Coast , and married there in October 2005 . On 5 May 2007 , Stacy gave birth to the couple 's first child , son Kalani Jordan . White has stated his desire to move to the Gold Coast once his playing career in Melbourne is finished , and has mooted that a role with the proposed Gold Coast AFL team is possible in either a development or coaching capacity . In September 2008 , he launched a sports classified website , <unk> , which is a specialised networking site for athletes . White wanted to impart his knowledge of social media to other athletes , which grew into his own business , White Echo , launched in 2009 . White is an avid golfer and is a member of the <unk> Golf Club , and also plays regularly at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club . He plays off of a handicap of 5 . At his final press @-@ conference with Melbourne , he jokingly stated that a card on the seniors ' Champions Tour was a potential aim once his football career is finished .

 White played for the Dandenong Stingrays in the TAC Cup in 1993 and 1994 . He was drafted with the number 1 pick in the 1994 AFL Draft — the first Dandenong player to be drafted with the highest pick . Travis Johnstone — who was White 's team @-@ mate at Melbourne for 10 years — is the only other Dandenong player to be selected with the first pick in an AFL draft . White was one of six Dandenong players selected to play for Vic Metro at the Teal Cup — the national under 18 championships — in 1994 . Following his performances for Vic Metro , he was named as an All @-@ Australian at Under 18 level .

 White was drafted by the Fremantle Dockers as the number 1 pick , which Fremantle were granted by the AFL because 1995 was the club 's first season in the competition . White made his debut in Round 3 of Fremantle 's inaugural season in a victory over Fitzroy . He played six matches in 1995 , kicking three goals but averaging less than three hit @-@ outs per game . The 1996 season saw him play 13 matches and kick 13 goals and greatly improve his average number of disposals . He was nominated for the AFL Rising Star award in Round 19 in a 24 @-@ point win against Collingwood . He had 22 disposals , 11 marks , kicked a goal and received three Brownlow Medal votes for his stand @-@ out performance for the season . In his final season at Fremantle , White took on greater responsibility of the ruck @-@ work , and averaged 10 hit @-@ outs per game for the season . He played the first 12 matches of the season , but was then dropped for nine matches until the final match of the season — and of his Fremantle career . Fremantle 's performances were largely consistent during White 's three seasons with them , as they finished 13th in both 1995 and 1996 , and 12th in 1997 . 
 White was handed the number 34 guernsey at Fremantle and he wore the number for the rest of his career . He credits Percy Johnson with guiding his ruck style in his time with Fremantle . He played 32 games and kicked 18 goals with the Dockers between 1995 and 1997 , before being traded back to his home state of Victoria to play for Melbourne . Salary @-@ cap breaches involved in White 's trade caused Melbourne to forfeit their highest selection ( pick number 5 ) in the 1999 draft to Fremantle .

 Melbourne traded their two highest selections in the 1997 draft ( picks 2 and 18 ) to Fremantle in return for White . He was a key signing in Melbourne 's attempt to rebuild its squad , and in his first season at Melbourne he shared the <unk> duties with Jim Stynes , the latter mentoring White in their only season together . He played in all of Melbourne 's 25 matches for the season as they reached the preliminary final , where they lost to North Melbourne . He received 11 votes in the Brownlow Medal for the season . After a promising start to his career in Melbourne , 1999 was less successful . White 's disposals and scoring statistics dropped significantly , and he tellingly failed to record any votes in the Brownlow Medal . In 2000 , he was a key member of the Melbourne side that reached the Grand Final , with many pundits seeing White as the best Melbourne player on the ground in the loss to Essendon , as he had 24 hit @-@ outs and 14 disposals . He kicked 16 goals and averaged 21 hit @-@ outs per game for the season , and as in 1998 , he recorded 11 Brownlow Medal votes . He effected the most number of hit @-@ outs in the league for the season , with 499 . 
 White played all but one of Melbourne 's matches in 2001 , and after a commanding performance against his former club in Round 21 where had 33 possessions , kicked two goals , and received three Brownlow Medal votes , then @-@ Fremantle coach Ben Allan responded to a suggestion that White may leave Melbourne at the end of the season by saying " we 'll have him back " . White recorded the most hit @-@ outs in the league in 2002 , with 561 , playing in all of Melbourne 's matches in a run that saw them narrowly lose to Adelaide by two goals in a semi @-@ final . The 2003 season was disappointing for both Melbourne , and White personally . His average number of hit @-@ outs dropped by more than six per game , he averaged fewer than eight kicks per match , and did not receive any Brownlow Medal votes .

 The following season saw a vast improvement in White 's personal performance , as he enjoyed the finest season of his career , winning Melbourne 's best @-@ and @-@ fairest , receiving All @-@ Australian selection , and ranking second in the league for total number of hit @-@ outs . He reached the top ten in the 2004 Brownlow Medal with 15 votes , including four best @-@ on @-@ ground displays , with dominant performances against North Melbourne and Fremantle among them . His most productive period came between Rounds 9 and 16 , where he recorded three best @-@ on @-@ ground displays , averaged 25 hit @-@ outs and received 13 Brownlow Medal votes . His Round 6 performance against Carlton is also noted as one of his career @-@ best performances , with Melbourne winning by more than 100 points , as White recorded 26 disposals , took eight marks , kicked one goal , and received the three Brownlow votes for his influential display . Coinciding with White 's career @-@ best form , Melbourne sat atop the AFL ladder after Round 18 , but in the final month of the season , the team lost its last five matches , finishing fifth after Round 22 , and losing to Essendon in the Elimination Final . The 2005 season was less successful for both White and Melbourne , with the club struggling to cement a place in the top eight during the year , although they managed to finish seventh after a strong finish to the minor round , and qualify for the club 's second consecutive finals series — the first time it had competed in consecutive finals series since 1991 . Melbourne again lost in the Elimination Final , this time to Geelong . It was during this match that White sustained his career @-@ threatening facial injury . 
 Following the 2005 season , he signed a three @-@ year deal with Melbourne — his last contract with the club — worth A $ <unk> He was an integral part of Melbourne 's strong 2006 form , as the team won 11 out of 12 games after losing the first three matches of the season . He was named among the best Melbourne players in the side 's come @-@ from @-@ behind victory against St Kilda in the Elimination Final . Melbourne lost to Fremantle the following week , ending their third consecutive finals series . During 2006 , White effected fewer hit @-@ outs than in 2005 , although his total number of disposals , marks and goals were all significantly improved . He played all of Melbourne 's matches that season , as he did for four seasons from 2004 — a consistent run which saw him play more than 100 consecutive matches after he missed games in 2003 due to a serious shin injury and a knee injury , until Round 12 , 2008 . In both 2005 and 2006 , he ranked third in the league in number of hit @-@ outs .

 Melbourne 's poor form throughout the 2007 season , when they won just five matches , saw the side finish 14th . White brought up his milestone 250th AFL @-@ game in Round 19 with a win over the Western Bulldogs . His last season with Melbourne was 2008 , in which he was dropped for the first time in his Melbourne career , despite returning to some of his best form . His average number of disposals per match ( 18 @.@ 5 ) was the highest of any season in his career . His long @-@ time understudy Mark Jamar assumed White 's position as the premier ruckman at Melbourne , allowing Paul Johnson to play the second @-@ ruckman role . It was the first time in 20 years that anyone other than White or Jim Stynes had been the first @-@ choice ruckman at Melbourne for an extended run of matches . Coach Dean Bailey said that 2008 was the most difficult season that White and team @-@ mate Adem <unk> had experienced at the club — the side finished bottom and won just three games . Bailey praised both White and <unk> on their professionalism and attitude at the end of the season — the pair 's last at Melbourne . White played 15 games in 2008 — his lowest total in a season with Melbourne . He finished his career at Melbourne in Round 22 against Richmond , kicking two goals and having 17 possessions . He received 53 Brownlow votes throughout his career — 47 with Melbourne and six with Fremantle . He reached double @-@ figures in Brownlow votes on three occasions , with his highest being the 15 votes he received in 2004 . He received his final Brownlow vote in Round 7 , 2008 , in Melbourne 's win over Fremantle . He received Brownlow votes in nine of his 14 AFL seasons . 
 He was named as one of Melbourne 's 150 Legends during the club 's 150th anniversary celebrations , and finished his career with the seventh @-@ highest number of appearances for Melbourne with 236 . He was made a life member of the Melbourne Football Club during 2008 . White was delisted from Melbourne following the 2008 season , but has stated that he hopes to play on for one or two more seasons at another AFL club : " From a personal point of view , I still feel like I 've got some time left . " His preference would have been to continue at Melbourne , saying , " I love the club and would love to play on " but that he " totally understands " his delisting . Dean Bailey spoke highly of White 's leadership at Melbourne , saying that White will leave a lasting legacy at the club .

 Carlton coach Brett <unk> suggested that he would " have to go back and have a look " at the possibility of drafting White for the 2009 season . <unk> cited White 's experience and leadership in helping to guide the younger ruckmen at Carlton as a potential draw @-@ card . St Kilda was also suggested as a possible destination for White to continue his playing career , but the Sydney Swans later emerged as the most likely destination for White . Ultimately White signed to play in 2009 with the Redland Australian Football Club in the AFL Queensland State League . After one season with Redlands he retired from playing and joined Gold Coast Football Club as a coach

 During 1998 — his first year living back in Melbourne — he was selected to play for Victoria . He was selected in the squad of 25 for Victoria in 1999 but did not make the final 22 for the match against South Australia . This was the last State @-@ of @-@ Origin match , although a Victoria team was selected to play against a Dream Team in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match in 2008 — White was selected in the initial 40 @-@ man squad for Victoria , but once again did not make the final 22 . He was Melbourne 's only representative in the squad . Playing for Victoria in 1998 was his only representative appearance . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 White 's kicking accuracy was of particular note for a ruckman — his goal @-@ kicking accuracy finished at slightly less than 60 % . He was a consistent exponent of the spectacular mark , preferring to take chest marks high over packs . He was nominated on several occasions for the Mark of the Year , but he never won the award . His ball @-@ skills and work around the ground remained one of his greatest strengths throughout his career . He effected 5000 hit @-@ outs in his AFL career , the most by any one player since records began in 1987 , with a career @-@ high game total of 47 during a resounding round @-@ 22 win over West Coast Eagles in 2000 . Testament to his durability and consistency , he was ranked in the top five in the AFL in total number of hit @-@ outs for nine consecutive seasons from 1999 . At 195 cm , White is relatively short for a ruckman , and operated more as a ruck @-@ rover than as a traditional ruckman . He was noted for his athleticism and vertical @-@ leap , which helped him overcome his lack of height in comparison to other ruckmen . His approach to ruck @-@ work — with greater emphasis on possessing the ball and working around the ground — helped him adapt to the changed centre @-@ circle rules , and compensated for his lack of height and diminished ability at stoppages . Following the departure of Jim Stynes from Melbourne , White later worked on his game with former ruckman Sam Newman . Percy Johnson , Stynes and finally Newman guided and influenced White 's ruck @-@ work during his career . 
 = = Injuries = = 
 Throughout the latter stages of his career , he wore special <unk> and shin @-@ pads to protect himself from injury in the ruck — his specially @-@ designed shin @-@ pad was required to protect a problematic shin injury which had threatened his career . During a match in 2003 , he was kicked in the shin , causing his shin @-@ pad to crack and split the skin , leaving a laceration about the size of a <unk> . Once the wound had healed , White 's surgeon told him that if it split open again , he would have to stop playing . White has said that this " reality check " helped to strengthen his focus and helped him deal with injuries more effectively . He said that the specially @-@ designed shin @-@ guard and those who designed it " saved his career " . ( The shin @-@ guard can be seen on White 's right @-@ leg in the photos on this page . ) 
 In 2005 , he was involved in a horrific on @-@ field incident with Geelong 's Steven King . As King attempted to kick the ball out of mid @-@ air , he missed and collected White 's face at the height of his leg 's swing , causing facial injuries that required extensive surgery , inserting five metal plates and 14 screws into White 's jaw and face . It was viewed as an accident by the AFL tribunal and no action was taken against King . As the incident took place in Melbourne 's final match of the season — Geelong winning the match and knocking Melbourne out of the finals — White was able to recover during the off @-@ season and did not miss a match , despite the severity of the injury . White 's wedding to his fiancée Stacy was postponed until later in the year due to the injury .

 After his first round selection , the Twins assigned Revere to the Gulf Coast League Twins , with whom he posted a .325 batting average ( BA ) in his first season of professional ball , and was named a 2007 Gulf Coast League Postseason All @-@ Star . The following season with the Beloit Snappers of the Class A Midwest League , Revere 's batting average increased to .379 with 44 stolen bases and ten triples . He won several awards for his performance , including a Midwest League All @-@ Star selection , Mid @-@ season MVP , Postseason All @-@ Star , Player of the Year , Prospect of the Year , and the Sherry Robertson Award as Twins ' minor league player of the year . Baseball America placed him on their 2008 High Class A All @-@ Star team and called him the Twins ' second best prospect , behind Aaron Hicks . 
 Revere began the 2009 season with the Fort Myers Miracle of the Florida State League ( FSL ) . In the first half of the season , he batted .342 with 23 RBIs , 32 runs scored and 22 stolen bases . He was named the FSL Player of the Week for May 11 – 17 , and was an All @-@ star for the FSL 's Southern division .

Hardy in a game against the Oakland Athletics . He recorded his first major league hit a day later . 
 Revere began the 2011 season with the Twins ' Class AAA affiliate , the Rochester Red Wings of the International League . In May , Revere was called up to Minnesota to play left field for the injured Delmon Young . Soon after Young 's return , Span was placed on the seven @-@ day disabled list with a concussion . As a result , Revere was given another position to play . 
 In late 2012 , Revere amassed a 21 @-@ game hitting streak , his career best . He finished the 2012 season playing 124 major league games with a .294 batting average , no home runs , and 32 RBIs .

 On December 6 , 2012 , Revere was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Vance Worley and Trevor May . Revere was picked to lead off the Phillies ' Opening Day lineup for the 2013 season against the Atlanta Braves over Jimmy Rollins after a strong spring training performance . After acquiring Revere , Phillies General Manager ( GM ) Rubén Amaro commented , " He can go to the top of the order or bottom of the order . Either way , for us it was about the defense and the speed . We like athletic players and he 's certainly that . He has great energy , a fantastic defender . And those are priorities for us . " 
 On April 15 , 2013 , the day of the Boston Marathon bombings , Revere inscribed " Pray for Boston " onto a piece of masking tape and taped it to his glove , which he left sitting out while he stretched . A photographer from Getty Images photographed the glove , and Revere later commented that his phone was " ringing off the hook " with thanks for the gesture . Revere commented , 
 " A bunch of people who live in Boston said it was all over the news out there " , Revere said . " I just showed my appreciation . Even when I 'm playing , I 'm thinking of the people in Boston . It 's just terrible that it happened . For me , I 'm just playing the game for them a little bit . 
 In the subsequent game , Revere made an incredible leaping , diving catch with the glove , robbing Todd Frazier of an extra base hit . 
 Near the beginning of the season , Revere sustained an injury to his quadriceps that he worsened in the April 24 game against the Pittsburgh Pirates . He missed multiple consecutive games and was replaced in the lineup by Freddy Galvis . Revere finally returned on May 3 , his 25th birthday . He injured his elbow in a game against the Boston Red Sox on May 27 after jamming it into the metal fence at Fenway Park . He remained in the game , and x @-@ rays later turned up negative . Revere later said of the injury , " Luckily , I 've got strong enough bones . If it was somebody else it may have been bad , but luckily it wasn 't serious . " 
 By the end of May , Revere was back hitting mainly at the top of the order after manager Charlie Manuel decided to adjust the lineup in hopes of sparking some offense . He managed two hits in a game against the Miami Marlins on June 3 , stole two bases , and stopped an extra @-@ base hit from <unk> <unk> . " I just have to take it one game at a time and not put any pressure on myself . I 'm finding my stroke " , Revere later said of the game . On July 13 , Revere suffered a fractured foot after a foul ball hit him while at @-@ bat . He had surgery for the fracture on July 16 . Although the initial timetable for Revere 's return was six to eight weeks , the Phillies official website later published an article stating that there was no timetable for his return and they were unsure whether or not he will return for a remainder of the 2013 season . He ended up missing the rest of the 2013 season , and finished with a .305 batting average , 0 home runs , 17 runs batted in and 22 stolen bases . 
 Revere entered the 2014 season healthy , and , amidst chaos and position battles elsewhere , he was the preeminent starter in center field . Before the season , Pat Egan of Phillies Nation published an article declaring the Phillies as the clear winners of the trade that brought Revere to Philadelphia . Though initially writers thought the Twins received a terrific return and it was a terrible trade for the Phillies , Worley was ultimately outrighted of the Twins ' roster and traded , and May 's status as a top prospect languished , whereas Revere had emerged as a viable everyday center fielder who was under contract with the Phillies through 2018 . On April 1 , 2014 , Revere set a new MLB record for most plate appearances without a home run ( 1 @,@ 410 ) by a non @-@ pitcher . Despite his initial preeminence , because of sore ribs ( caused by a diving catch in the outfield ) , backup Tony Gwynn , Jr. started four consecutive games in centerfield ( beyond the time Revere needed to recover from his injury due to Gwynn 's success at the plate ) while Revere , who had recently struggled at the plate , was on the bench . However , a few days later , Revere came up to bat in the eighth inning in a scoreless game , and hit an RBI single , which re @-@ implanted him atop the Phillies ' starting lineup . As for Gwynn , Revere commented , 
 " We 're kind of the same player . He 's like my older brother . If I do something wrong , he 's right there telling me how to correct myself . I 'm the same way with him . If I see something , I tell him . He 's definitely a great motivator for me . I just learn from him , since he 's been in the game for a while . I 'm still learning . I kind of just watched him those few days to help me out and improve my game , and he watches me to improve his . We kind of feed off each other " 
 On May 27 , 2014 , Revere finally hit his first MLB home run in his <unk> career at @-@ bat , the longest streak without a home run to begin a career since Frank Taveras in 1977 . On September 5 , Revere hit another home run , the second of his career , against Washington Nationals right @-@ handed pitcher Rafael Soriano . In the waning weeks of the season , Revere was firmly embroiled in the battle for the National League batting title along with Justin Morneau and Josh Harrison , among others . In 151 games of 2014 , Revere hit .306 with an NL @-@ leading 184 hits , 49 stolen bases , two home runs , and 28 RBIs . Paul Boye wrote , " The fact of the matter boils down to this : Ben Revere is the best option in center field for this team , given both internal and external options at this point . " On October 1 , 2014 , Revere underwent right ankle surgery to remove two screws . 
 After having played center field exclusively during his first two years with the Phillies , Revere spent some time in left field during spring training in 2015 while <unk> Herrera played in center ; manager Ryne Sandberg noted that Revere 's arm may fit better in left field . In 96 games with the Phillies , Revere batted .298 with 24 stolen bases , 1 home run , and 26 RBI . 
 = = = Toronto Blue Jays = = = 
 On July 31 , 2015 , Revere was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Alberto Tirado and Jimmy Cordero . Revere struggled early in his tenure with the Blue Jays , going hitless in his first 13 at @-@ bats . He would return to form for the remainder of August , making several highlight @-@ reel catches in left field and extending a hit streak to 9 games on August 29 . During those 9 games , Revere batted .514 . He played in 56 games for the Blue Jays in the 2015 regular season , and batted .319 with 1 home run , 19 RBI , and 7 stolen bases . He played 152 total games in 2015 with a .306 batting average , 2 home runs , 31 stolen bases , and 45 RBI . 
 With the Blue Jays finishing the season 93 – 69 , the team clinched the AL @-@ East pennant for their first postseason berth in 22 years . During Game 6 of the 2015 ALCS against the Kansas City Royals , Revere was involved in controversy where Jeff Nelson called a strike on a pitch that was up and outside on a 2 @-@ 1 count . The very next pitch , Revere struck out swinging . He attacked a garbage can with his bat in frustration in the dugout , and the Blue Jays would end up losing the game 3 @-@ 4 , eliminating them from further postseason contention . In 11 postseason games , Revere batted .256 with 2 stolen bases .

 Revere 's former teammate Denard Span described him as having the " ability to change games with his speed both offensively and defensively " and saying that he is always " looking to steal second and third " to gain offense momentum . A slap hitter , he has struggled to hit for power during his career ; it took him 1 @,@ 466 at @-@ bats to hit his first home run , the most since 1977 . According to a hot zone chart generated by ESPN Stats and Information , Revere has the best batting average and slugging percentage on pitches on the lower @-@ outside part of the plate . Revere hits left @-@ handed pitchers as well as he does right @-@ handed pitchers . Lindy 's Sports noted that despite having a long swing with a " big timing hitch " , he makes " excellent line @-@ drive contact " and is a productive leadoff hitter with excellent speed .

 Defensively , Revere has excellent range in the outfield and , during the 2012 season , amassed a 16 @.@ 4 ultimate zone rating ( UZR ) , which is well above average . FanGraphs described him as being an " elite " defensive player due to his speed and range . Even when he has struggles offensively , his defense has warranted him being in the lineup both during the early stages of his career with the Twins as a Right fielder and during his 2013 slump with the Phillies . Though Revere uses his speed efficiently in covering ground in the outfield , he has struggled to produce with his below average arm . However , in 2014 , some writers asserted that his speed covered for poor range in the outfield , and that he truly was a below average outfielder .

 Described by writer Craig <unk> as embodying a " full @-@ throttle " style of play along with a " genuine , charismatic personality " , Revere is known for his energy on the field . Revere called his personality a product of the manner in which he was raised , and that he always tries to be " goofy " and to keep things loose . Former teammate Denard Span corroborated Revere being " goofy " , that he is a " real good teammate " , and that he comes to play the right way every day . Revere is a devout Christian ; he says that he prays nightly and reads his Bible weekly . In addition , Revere is a self @-@ proclaimed history buff and wants to explore Philadelphia museums and famous sites when he no longer has to focus so much on baseball . 
 = Abyssinia , Henry = 
 " Abyssinia , Henry " is the 72nd episode of the M * A * S * H television series , and the final episode of the series ' third season . First aired on March 18 , 1975 , and written by Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell , the highly rated episode was most notable for its shocking and unexpected ending . The plot of the episode centers on the honorable discharge and subsequent departure of the 4077th MASH 's commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake ( played by McLean Stevenson ) . 
 The title of the episode refers to the slang use of " Abyssinia " for " goodbye " . ( " Abyssinia " , pronounced " ab @-@ ee @-@ SIN @-@ ee @-@ ah " can be understood as " I 'll be seeing you " . In the 1920s and 1930s Abyssinia was the name for the country now called Ethiopia . ) It is mistakenly said that this slang was frequently used by the Henry Blake character throughout his years on the show . In fact , whenever Blake would bid farewell , it was usually by saying " <unk> @-@ bye " , though Blake did use this term at least once . 
 The highly controversial ending to the episode , which has since been referenced and parodied many times , prompted more than 1 @,@ 000 letters to series producers Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart , and drew fire from both CBS and 20th Century Fox . 
 After the production of this episode , both Stevenson and Wayne Rogers , who played the character of Trapper John McIntyre , left the series to pursue other interests . While Stevenson 's departure was announced prior to and written into " Abyssinia , Henry " , Rogers unexpectedly left the series during the break between Seasons Three and Four , and so his character 's departure takes place off @-@ screen in the following episode , " Welcome to Korea " , the first of the show 's fourth season . These combined departures and their subsequent replacements also signaled the beginning of a major shift in focus of the M * A * S * H series as a whole with story and script focus emphasizing the character of Hawkeye Pierce , played by Alan Alda .

Upon the completion of the surgical session , Henry begins planning his upcoming trip home and places a telephone call to Bloomington , Illinois , to inform his wife and family of the good news . 
 Meanwhile , Major Margaret Houlihan ( Loretta Swit ) and Major Frank Burns ( Larry Linville ) are eagerly awaiting the upcoming transfer of command of the 4077th MASH : upon Blake 's departure , Burns will become the unit commander . Henry and Radar begin to clean out the main office , sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him . As a token of appreciation and admiration , Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge ; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father . 
 On the night before Henry 's departure , Hawkeye Pierce ( Alan Alda ) , Trapper McIntyre ( Wayne Rogers ) , and Radar throw a going @-@ away party for him at Rosie 's Bar and Grill . All four inebriated , they share some pleasant memories and reminisce before Blake leaves to go to the bathroom . While Henry is gone , the others prepare a comedic ceremony to " drum [ Henry ] out of the Army " . As a part of the ceremony , the three present Henry with a brand new suit as a parting gift . 
 The next morning is the first with Frank Burns in charge , and he immediately starts using his " gung @-@ ho " , militarily strict , and whistle @-@ happy attitude to assemble the company . A lack of respect from his subordinates is already evident , as an out of uniform and unshaven Hawkeye and Trapper and an outrageously dressed ( even for him ) Corporal Klinger ( Jamie Farr ) show up for the assembly . As Blake leaves his tent for the last time , dressed in his new suit , he is greeted with a round of applause from the unit . Frank and Margaret give Blake a formal " ten @-@ hut " salute . Henry , in his typical laid @-@ back fashion , tells Frank to " take it easy " and to " stuff that whistle someplace " . 
 After saying his individual goodbyes to many of the members of the 4077th , Hawkeye whispers to Henry and convinces him to give a long kiss to Margaret , generating another rousing round of applause from the onlookers . Blake then leaves the camp , walking towards the chopper pad with Hawkeye , Trapper , Margaret , Frank , Klinger , Father Mulcahy ( William Christopher ) , and Radar , with the rest of the camp saying farewells and singing " For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow " . 
 When the helicopter arrives , it contains a wounded soldier , which occupies Hawkeye and Trapper ; they say their short goodbyes before going to care for the soldier . Beginning to board the helicopter , Henry spots an emotional Radar saluting him and pauses for a moment . He runs back to him to return the salute , hug him , and leave him with the words : " You behave yourself , or I 'm gonna come back and kick your butt . " Blake then boards the helicopter and leaves the 4077th . 
 The next scene takes place in the O.R. and became a defining moment in the series . As surgeons are working on wounded soldiers , Radar enters , visibly shaken and not wearing the required surgical mask . Trapper chides him for this , but Radar , too dazed to react ( or care ) , delivers a shocking announcement ( and quite possibly his most famous line ) : " I have a message . Lieutenant Colonel ... Henry Blake 's plane ... was shot down ... over the Sea of Japan . It spun in ... there were no survivors . " Radar leaves the O.R. as the camera pans the stunned and silent hospital staff , including Trapper and a teary @-@ eyed Hawkeye , who continue to operate on the wounded , and even Majors Burns and Houlihan , who are crying . 
 After a final commercial break , the episode closes with an " affectionate and reluctant farewell " to Blake by means of a light @-@ hearted montage of clips from past episodes . 
 = = Production = = 
 The final scene , in which Radar informs everyone of the death of Henry Blake was unprecedented : it was the first time in American television history that a main character departing a series was killed off in a tragic way . When Stevenson decided to leave the series part way through the third season , Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart , the show 's producers , decided to make a statement regarding the unexpectedness and horror of war , especially with the Vietnam War fresh in people 's minds . 
 To evoke genuine emotions of shock and sadness , the final O.R. scene was kept a secret from the cast , with the exception of Alan Alda , until immediately before filming ; only then did Gelbart hand out the last page of the script . As a result , Stevenson was still on the set to see the final scene being filmed . After shooting was completed , a season @-@ ending cast party was planned . Stevenson left the set almost immediately after the end of filming , and the party was canceled due to the poor mood of the cast . Stevenson later said in an interview that he was deeply hurt that his character 's death was revealed in that fashion and the party was " ruined . " Gelbart later said of the event , " I wish we could say to him , ' We didn 't mean it , Mac . ' " 
 = = Reaction and impact = = 
 Shortly after the episode originally aired , the reactions and feedback of viewers were intense , both in support and condemnation of the events of the episode . It is estimated that over 1 @,@ 000 letters were received by the producers regarding the episode ; " some ... were from people who understood . Many were from people that didn 't . " Many of those who objected also cited the fact that M * A * S * H was a situation comedy , and that Blake 's " cheap " killing did not belong in the show ; one caller to Reynolds stated after the episode aired that they " don 't know why [ they ] did it ; it 's not necessary , it 's just a little comedy show " and that " you 've upset everybody [ in the family ] , " before vowing never to watch the show again . Another , more lighthearted response to the episode came from an unhappy viewer in Lubbock , Texas , who sent a telegram stating that " Henry Blake has been found in a raft in Lake Lubbock . " Initially , Gelbart and Reynolds <unk> letters in response to the feedback , but eventually , due to the overwhelming number of letters , a form response was created explaining the rationale of their decisions . Negative reactions were not exclusive to the home viewers of the program : both CBS , the network that aired M * A * S * H , and 20th Century Fox , the company that produced M * A * S * H , expressed their unhappiness at the killing of Henry Blake . In fact , CBS ' distaste with the episode was so great that during a later rerun of the episode , the final O.R. scene was cut from the episode . The final scenes have always been shown in syndication , and were uncut on the DVD release of the series ' third season in 2003 . 
 Not all reaction to the airing was negative : On an episode of the variety series Cher that aired shortly afterward and featured Stevenson as a guest , the situation was parodied when the episode opened to a studio shot of Stevenson as Blake floating on a smoking raft and shouting , " I 'm OK ! I 'm OK ! " 
 In Bobbie Ann Mason 's 1985 novel In Country , the teenage protagonist recalls having watched the episode as a child and being " so shocked she went around stunned for days , " and confesses that Blake 's death on the show had seemed more real to her than the death of her own father in Vietnam . 
 The final scene was spoofed on the Family Guy episode " Fifteen Minutes of Shame " when a cutaway shows Brian Griffin saying to the rest of the family , " I have an announcement . Meg Griffin 's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan . It spun in . There were no survivors . " 
 In 1997 , TV Guide included this episode in their list of the " 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time , " ranking it # 20 . 
 In 2005 , TV Land included this episode as part of its " Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History " , ranking it # 15 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While " Abyssinia , Henry " is well known for the departure of McLean Stevenson from the series , it was also the final episode in which Wayne Rogers appeared . During the summer 1975 break between seasons three and four , he quit the series . 20th Century Fox sued him for breach of contract , but the lawsuit collapsed . The character of Trapper John McIntyre was subsequently written off the series in " Welcome to Korea , " the first episode of the next season , though Rogers had a small voice role in that episode as a PA announcer at Kimpo Air Base . 
 As a result , when the cast returned to begin filming the series ' fourth season in September 1975 , there were major changes in both the makeup and the direction of the show : The more earnest and faithful family man Captain B.J. Hunnicutt ( Mike Farrell ) had replaced Trapper John , and the regular Army Colonel Sherman Potter ( Harry Morgan ) had replaced Henry Blake as commander of the 4077th . Another change to the composition of the show occurred in the elevation of longtime recurring guest cast member Jamie Farr , who played Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger , to the regular cast , with his name being featured on the opening credits . Episodes following this represented a major change in focus for the show : The individual effects and psychological damages of war were explored more , often in parallel to the ending of the Vietnam War , and the Korean culture was portrayed in greater depth than had been done before , instead of focusing on a " boorish , military mindset " as before . 
 In general , the show began to take on a more serious tone as a seriocomic ( or dramedy ) series , in which the focus was on the character rather than the character type , and moved away from its status as a situation comedy . 
 = Lyo and Merly = 
 Lyo and Merly were the official mascots of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics held in Singapore . Lyo is a red male lion whose name stands for " Lion of the Youth Olympics " , while Merly is a blue female Merlion whose name combines " mer " ( meaning " sea " ) with " liveliness " and " youthfulness " . The duo represent several Olympic values ( such as excellence ) and traits of Singapore ( known as the Lion City ) . Cubix International designed the mascots , while another local company , Mascots and Puppets Specialists , developed their costumes . Before and during the Youth Olympics , Lyo and Merly appeared in school events , launches and roadshows . They also participated in pre @-@ National Day Parade activities , were displayed at competition venues and were featured in Youth Olympics memorabilia . 
 = = Background = = 
 The first official Olympics mascot was <unk> , introduced at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich , Germany . Games mascots have varied between being animals native to the area where the Games take place , humans , and imaginary creatures . They often reflect the culture and history of the hosting region , and have traits chosen to embody the ideals of Olympism and the Paralympic movement . The introduction of a mascot or mascots is often highlighted in the lead @-@ up to the Games , to help build event anticipation , with a focus placed on them in contemporary Olympics . The first ever Summer Youth Olympics , Singapore 's organizing committee extended the tradition of having mascots to this new event . 
 = = Development = = 
 In early 2009 , seven shortlisted mascot design proposals were submitted to the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee ( SYOGOC ) . Amongst the seven , the proposal of Cubix International , a company specialising in branding , animation and character development , was eventually selected . Cubix initially sought to develop robot mascots , intending to showcase Singapore as a " technologically advanced country " . However , research on Olympic mascots prompted them to move away from the robot theme and focus on animal mascots . The company stated it wanted to develop a pair of mascots " who had contrasting yet complementary personalities " . Mascots and Puppets Specialists , led by creative director Frankie Malachi Yeo , was hired to transform the mascots from designs to actual three dimensional forms . 
 Designing the mascots took about six months . There were issues over the materials used to build the mascot suits . Eventually , foam was selected as the main material . The mascot suits are heavy , with Lyo 's head weighing 8 kilograms ( 18 lb ) and Merly 's weighing 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) . The heads are strapped on to a harness donned by the mascot wearer . To minimize overheating , costumes included a built @-@ in fan , and optional cooling vests were made available . Parts of the mascot production process were captured in the documentary , Beyond Gold : The Journey to the first Youth Olympic Games , which was commissioned by the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee ( SYOGOC ) . 
 = = Mascots = = 
 The mascots ' designers created elaborate descriptions of Lyo and Merly , which are summarised below : 
 Lyo 's name is the initials ( <unk> ) of " Lion of the Youth Olympics " , while Merly 's name is a combination of mer , which means the sea , and the letters L and Y which stand for liveliness and youthfulness . The two characters allude to the " Lion City " label of Singapore , and the Merlion , a national symbol of Singapore , respectively . Lyo 's mane resembles the Flame of Passion of the Spirit of Youth , the emblem of the Games . It is also a reference to the Singapore 2010 bid tagline " Blazing the Trail " . The pad on his paw is shaped like the island of Singapore . Merly is vegetarian due to " a deep respect for all living creatures " , and her paw pad is shaped like a heart . 
 = = Outreach = = 
 The two mascots were officially introduced by Minister for Community Development , Youth and Sports Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan on 21 November 2009 at Suntec City . He commented that the duo are " an interesting play on fire and water " . He added that " there are aspects of [ the mascots ] we clearly can identify with as Singaporeans , but really what we hope is these mascots will be embraced by Singaporeans as well as the visitors who come " . Before and throughout the Youth Olympics , the mascots appeared in various activities and programmes , including events in schools , launches and roadshows . The Olympic theme featured in Singapore 's 2010 National Day Parade , also held in the month of August , and Lyo and Merly participated in pre @-@ parade activities . 
 Lyo and Merly were also widely featured in Games memorabilia sold at the official Youth Olympic Games Superstore in front of Ngee Ann City shopping centre on Orchard Road , Singapore 's main shopping street , and at competition venues . Male medal winners at the Games are presented with a Lyo plush toy during victory ceremonies , and female winners receive a Merly toy . Four postage stamps depicting the mascots in poses featuring the Games ' Culture and Education Programme ( CEP ) and Olympic sports were also launched by the SYOGOC and Singapore Post . In addition , a limited @-@ edition Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games Commemorative Pack , which depicted the journey taken by the country since it won the bid to host the Games , featured an exclusive <unk> Sheet of the mascots in all 26 sport poses . Lyo and Merly also appeared on three coins released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to commemorate the Games . A mural of the duo made by artist Charlene <unk> was showcased at a party held at the official hotel partner , Fairmont Singapore , to commemorate the 150 @-@ day countdown to the Games .

 The Naps started Peckinpaugh 's professional career by assigning him to the New Haven Prairie Hens of the Class @-@ B Connecticut League . He was promoted to the Naps to make his Major League Baseball ( MLB ) debut in September 1910 , playing in 15 games for the Naps at age 19 . The Naps assigned Peckinpaugh to the Portland Beavers of the Class @-@ A Pacific Coast League for the entire 1911 season . He appeared in 70 games for the Naps in 1912 , batting only .212 . On May 25 , 1913 , after giving the starting shortstop position to Ray Chapman , the Naps traded Peckinpaugh to the New York Yankees for Jack <unk> and Bill Stumpf . 
 The Naps soon regretted the trade . With the Yankees , Peckinpaugh emerged as a team leader . He was named captain in 1914 by manager Frank Chance . Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season , and Peckinpaugh served as player – manager for the remainder of the season ; at the age of 23 , he became the youngest manager in MLB history . He finished the 1914 season fifth in the AL with 38 stolen bases . 
 Bill Donovan was hired as the Yankees manager in the offseason . In the 1914 – 15 offseason , Peckinpaugh considered leaving the Yankees to join the Federal League , as he received offers from the Chicago Federals , Buffalo Blues , and Indianapolis Hoosiers . After considering the offer from Chicago , he chose to stay with the Yankees , and received a three @-@ year contract worth $ 6 @,@ 000 ( $ 140 @,@ 349 in current dollar terms ) per season from 1915 through 1917 .

Though team owner Clark Griffith had indicated that Peckinpaugh would serve as his player @-@ manager at the time of the trade , he named Clyde Milan player @-@ manager for the 1922 season instead . This distracted Peckinpaugh , and along with injuries , limited his performance . 
 Chance , now managing the Boston Red Sox , attempted to acquire Peckinpaugh from the Senators before the 1923 season . Remaining in Washington , Peckinpaugh rebounded during the 1923 season with timely hitting and solid fielding . 
 Griffith appointed Bucky Harris as manager before the 1924 season . Harris considered Peckinpaugh his " assistant manager " . Peckinpaugh was a key contributor in the 1924 World Series , in which the Senators defeated the Giants . He won the League Award as the AL 's Most Valuable Player in 1925 , edging Al Simmons by a small margin .

The route functions as an underpass under the Raritan Valley Line of New Jersey Transit , under which it crosses about halfway down the block , along the municipal border . Route 59 was originally a proposed alignment of Route 22 , which was supposed to head from an intersection with current day New Jersey Route 159 in Morris County at the Pine Brook Bridge before heading through several counties , terminating at an intersection with New Jersey Route 27 in Rahway .

 Neon Bible is the second studio album by the Canadian rock band Arcade Fire , released in March 2007 on Merge Records . Originally announced on December 16 , 2006 through the band 's website , the majority of the album was recorded at a church the band bought and renovated in Farnham , Quebec . The album is the first to feature drummer Jeremy Gara , and the first to include violinist Sarah Neufeld among the band 's core line @-@ up . 
 Neon Bible became Arcade Fire 's highest charting album at the time , debuting on the Billboard 200 at number two , selling 92 @,@ 000 copies in its first week and more than 400 @,@ 000 to date . Being released within a month of similarly successful releases by The Shins ( <unk> the Night Away ) and Modest Mouse ( We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank ) , Neon Bible was cited as an example of the popularization of indie rock . Critics offered the self @-@ produced Neon Bible mostly favorable reviews , although with division over the album 's sound . Publications like NME and IGN praised the album for its grandiose nature , while Rolling Stone and Uncut said that it resulted in a distant and overblown sound .

 Following the release of Funeral ( 2004 ) , which had been recorded in an attic studio known as <unk> , Arcade Fire decided a permanent recording location was necessary . Following their tour in support of Funeral , the band bought the Petite Église in Farnham , Quebec . Being used as a café at the time of purchase , the Petite Église had once been a church and a Masonic Temple . Once renovation of the church was complete , the band spent the latter half of 2006 recording a majority of the album there . Michael Pärt produced additionally recordings in Budapest , recording the Budapest Film Orchestra and a military men 's choir . Other sessions included one in New York , where the band recorded along the Hudson River to be near water . 
 Having produced most of the album themselves , the band decided to bring in someone else for the mixing . Tracks were sent to several well @-@ known mixers / producers to experiment with and after deciding they liked Nick Launay 's ideas best , the band invited him to their studio to work on the songs further . For a month Launay worked with the album 's engineer and co @-@ producer Marcus Strauss on the mixing of each song , with the band regularly driving up from Montreal to assess their progress . In an interview with HitQuarters , Launay described the mixing process as a " playful thing " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Beginning work on Neon Bible immediately following a North American tour in support of the band 's first album , Funeral , songwriter Win Butler , born in the United States but having lived in Canada for several years , said that he felt he was observing his homeland from an outsider 's point of view . The album is rooted in Americana themes , with Bob Dylan , Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley being cited as influences . 
 Arcade Fire began recording with what would become " Black Mirror " and a reworking of the Arcade Fire EP song " No Cars Go " as their starting point . Once the title of the album was decided upon , the band was further inspired after they , according to Will Butler , " watched a lot of TV preachers , get @-@ rich @-@ quick schemes on YouTube . " The band was also attracted to using the ocean and television as central images for the album , with Win Butler saying the ocean imagery symbolizes a lack of control ; of television , Butler stated that : 
 People don 't necessarily know that they 're taking on a worldview , or absorbing ideas [ while watching television ] . It doesn 't necessarily seem like [ it 's happening ] , but it definitely does . I find it very easy to get sucked in . It starts to affect the way you see the world . 
 These ideas are reflected in the arrangement and composition of the album , which lead to a sound of dread and dissonance . The band used a number of less common instruments to achieve this sound ; in addition to the orchestra and choir , Neon Bible features a hurdy @-@ gurdy , mandolin , accordion and pipe organ . Win Butler has said that in conceiving the album he hoped for a more stripped @-@ down sound but the songs demanded further instrumentation .

AOL Music cited the cover as an example of an artist " keeping artwork alive . " The artwork would go on to win Tracy Maurice and François Miron the Juno Award for best CD / DVD Artwork Design of the Year . Frontman Win Butler stated in an interview that the album title is derived from him being particularly attracted to the image , not from the John Kennedy Toole novel The Neon Bible .

 Largely due to band member Régine Chassagne 's Haitian ancestry , the band has tried to raise support and awareness for the socio @-@ economic problems in Haiti throughout their career .

On December 26 , 2006 , they supported Haitian charity organization Partners in Health by releasing the song " Intervention " on iTunes and donating the proceeds . However , they accidentally uploaded " Black Wave / Bad Vibrations " , the track after " Intervention " on Neon Bible . While the song was quickly removed once the problem was discovered , file sharers quickly circulated it on various P2P networks . On his blog , Win Butler quipped , " I guess it is sort of charming that we can send the wrong song to the whole world with a click of a mouse ... Oh well . " 
 On December 28 , 2006 , the band allowed listeners to listen to their first single , " Black Mirror " , by calling the number ( 866 ) <unk> @-@ <unk> , extension number <unk> . The song was also streamed on the band 's website beginning on January 6 , 2007 . The following day , the band revealed a variety of information about the album through a YouTube video .

 On February 2 , 2007 , all the lyrics to Neon Bible were released on the band 's website . Also included was the text and an audio clip of a child reading " The Wolf and the Fox " , a French fable allegedly written by 17th century French poet Jean La Fontaine , an allusion to " The Well and the Lighthouse " , which is loosely based around the fable . This was followed on February 5 , 2007 with the band releasing a promotional pamphlet as a JPEG image on their website that included album @-@ related imagery and much of the French and English text from " The Wolf and the Fox " . 
 In October 2007 , Arcade Fire created a website at <unk> with the date October 6 displayed on it . After speculation over what the website was about , including rumors of new material or a live streaming of a concert , it was eventually revealed to be a video for " Neon Bible " , featuring Win Butler 's face and hands , which the viewer can interact with during the song . " Neon Bible " was the first song on the album to have a music video .

 Arcade Fire began their tour in support of the album in January and February 2007 , playing a series of concerts at churches and other small venues in Ottawa , Montreal , London and New York . This was followed by a 23 date European tour in March and early April , though the last 9 dates of this were cancelled due to illness . The first North American leg of the tour began April 26 in San Diego and April 28 at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and contained 26 dates . This leg contained openings by The National , St. Vincent , and Electrelane . The band then began an 11 @-@ date European leg at Glastonbury Festival on June 22 before returning to North America for 10 more LCD Soundsystem @-@ supported dates beginning September 15 at Austin City Limits . The Neon Bible tour continued with 14 more dates in Europe between October 25 and November 19 , and six dates beginning January 18 , 2008 in Australia and New Zealand as part of the Big Day Out festival . The tour then ended after three more shows from February 7 in Japan .

 Compared to the band 's debut , Funeral , Neon Bible has experienced breakthrough commercial success . During its first week , it debuted at number one in both Canada and Ireland , and number two in the United States , the United Kingdom and Portugal . Neon Bible was out @-@ charted only by Notorious B.I.G. ' s greatest hits compilation in the U.S. and the Kaiser Chiefs 's Yours Truly , Angry Mob in the UK . It was certified gold by the CRIA in Canada in March 2007 . 
 Upon release , Neon Bible garnered universal acclaim , receiving an 87 — the seventh highest score of 2007 — from review aggregator Metacritic . NME reviewer Mark Beaumont commented the album " is a climactic monolith of a record in the grand tradition of melodic transatlantic clamour rock . " The A.V. Club reviewer Kyle Ryan interpreted the album as a commentary on the post @-@ 9 / 11 American world , saying that " the band is seemingly sending a beacon to other reasonable people forced underground by the world 's insanity . " Stylus contributor Derek Miller saw the album in similar terms , saying that while the album touches on " violence , paranoia , the falsity of simple labor , the war @-@ call of organized religion — a what 's what of indie turmoil after 2003 " the band go further to the point where its " thematic threads bind the songs . " Robert Christgau gave the album a " A + " grade , saying that Butler and co . " thud rather than thunder . But what a loud and joyous thud it is . " 
 IGN , in giving the album 8 @.@ 9 out of 10 , said " the playing overall seems tighter and more cohesive " and that the album is a " grandiose project , one teeming with jubilant enthusiasm and reverent abundance . " Other publications agreed , but felt such was a negative . Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote that he was surprised such a large band could " sound so distant here so often , " saying that " the result is a huge sound that only sparkles on the edges , leaving Butler alone in the middle . " However , Rolling Stone also named it the fourth best album of the year . Uncut 's three @-@ star review of the album said that " at its overblown worst Neon Bible is one of those records that takes itself too seriously to be taken seriously . " 
 Neon Bible was a finalist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize . Neon Bible was nominated for Best Alternative Album for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards . It was # 4 in NME albums of the year , fourth in Rolling Stone 's list of albums of the year and album of the year in Q in December 2007 . The album won the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year .

 = French ironclad Triomphante = 
 Triomphante ( Triumphant ) was the third and last ship of the La Galissonnière class of wooden @-@ hulled , armored corvettes built for the French Navy during the 1870s . Her construction was delayed for years and the navy took advantage of the extended construction time to upgrade her armament in comparison to the lead ship , La Galissonnière . She and her half @-@ sister La Galissonnière participated in a number of battles during the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 . The ship remained in Asia and never returned to France after the war . She was condemned in 1896 and sold in 1903 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The La Galissonnière @-@ class ironclads were designed as faster , more heavily armed versions of the Alma @-@ class ironclads by Henri Dupuy de Lôme . They used the same central battery layout as their predecessors , although the battery was lengthened 4 meters ( 13 ft 1 in ) to provide enough room to work the larger 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns . Triomphante and her sister ship Victorieuse were modified by Constructor Sabattier who reduced the number of screws from two to one to improve their sailing qualities by reducing the drag from the stationary propellers , added an 194 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) bow chaser under the forecastle and increased the caliber and number of the secondary armament . 
 Triomphante was 76 @.@ 85 meters ( 252 ft 2 in ) between perpendiculars and had a beam of 14 @.@ 88 meters ( 48 ft 10 in ) . She had a mean draft of 6 @.@ 3 meters ( 20 ft 8 in ) and displaced 4 @,@ 150 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 080 long tons ) . Her crew numbered between 352 and 382 officers and men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Triomphante had a single vertical compound steam engine driving a single propeller . Her engine was powered by four oval boilers . During sea trials her engine produced 2 @,@ 214 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 651 kW ) and the ship reached 12 @.@ 75 knots ( 23 @.@ 61 km / h ; 14 @.@ 67 mph ) . She only carried 330 metric tons ( 320 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 2 @,@ 740 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 070 km ; 3 @,@ 150 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Victorieuse was also ship @-@ rigged with three masts and had a sail area of 1 @,@ 730 square meters ( 18 @,@ 600 sq ft ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Triomphante mounted four of her six 240 @-@ millimeter Modèle 1870 breech @-@ loading guns in the central battery on the battery deck . The other two 240 @-@ millimeter guns were mounted in barbettes on the upper deck , sponsoned out over the sides of the ship , just forward of the funnel . A 194 @-@ millimeter breech @-@ loading chase gun was fitted under the forecastle . Triomphante 's secondary armament of six 138 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) breech @-@ loading guns was also mounted on the upper deck . 
 The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 19 @-@ caliber 240 mm gun weighed 317 @.@ 5 pounds ( 144 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 15 @.@ 41 long tons ( 15 @.@ 66 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 624 ft / s ( 495 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 4 inches ( 366 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 20 @-@ caliber 194 mm gun fired an armor @-@ piercing 165 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 75 @.@ 0 kg ) shell while the gun itself weighed 7 @.@ 83 long tons ( 7 @.@ 96 t ) . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 739 ft / s ( 530 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 12 @.@ 5 inches ( 320 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 138 mm gun was 21 calibers long and weighed 2 @.@ 63 long tons ( 2 @.@ 67 t ) . It fired a 61 @.@ 7 @-@ pound ( 28 @.@ 0 kg ) explosive shell with velocity of 1 @,@ 529 ft / s ( 466 m / s ) . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 For defense against torpedo boats the ship also mounted four 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns . They fired a shell weighing about 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of about 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a range of about 3 @,@ 200 meters ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute . Triomphante also received several towed Harvey torpedoes . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The La Galissonnière @-@ class ships had a complete 150 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) wrought iron waterline belt , approximately 2 @.@ 4 meters ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) high laid over 650 millimeters ( 26 in ) of wood . The sides of the battery itself were armored with 120 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) of wrought iron backed by 520 millimeters ( 20 in ) of wood and the ends of the battery were closed by bulkheads of the same thickness . The barbette armor was 120 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) thick . The unarmored portions of their sides were protected by thin iron plates .

 Triomphante was laid down at Rochefort on 5 August 1869 and launched on 28 March 1877 . While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known , the budget for the French Navy was cut after the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the industrial age . The ship was commissioned as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron on 17 October 1880 under the command of Rear Admiral Brossard du <unk> . On 15 February 1883 she became flagship of the Levant Squadron ( French : Division Navale du Levant ) under Rear Admiral Conte . On 28 May the admiral was ordered to shift his flag as Triomphante was ordered to Saigon . 
 Triomphante , and her half @-@ sister La Galissonnière , were assigned to the Far East Squadron in 1884 , under the command of Vice Admiral Amédée Courbet , and participated in several actions during the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 . Both ships fought in the Battle of Fuzhou , Triomphante sinking the wooden gunboat <unk> , and destroying coastal defenses defending the Min River . They supplied landing parties during the Battle of Tamsui in October 1884 , but they were forced to retreat by Chinese troops , albeit at only a few casualties ( 5 killed and 10 wounded ) . Triomphante helped to capture the <unk> Islands in March 1885 during the Pescadores Campaign , losing two killed and five wounded from her landing party . She became the flagship of the Far East Squadron on 1 April 1885 and remained as such until 5 February 1894 when she was reduced to reserve . Triomphante was condemned on 18 July 1896 and sold for scrap in 1903 .

 = HMS Repulse ( 1916 ) = 
 HMS Repulse was a Renown @-@ class battlecruiser of the Royal Navy built during the First World War . Originally laid down as an improved version of the Revenge @-@ class battleships , her construction was suspended on the outbreak of war because she would not be ready in a timely manner . Admiral Lord Fisher , upon becoming First Sea Lord , gained approval to restart her construction as a battlecruiser that could be built and enter service quickly . The Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) , Eustace Tennyson @-@ D 'Eyncourt , quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher 's requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months . They did not quite meet that ambitious goal , but the ship was delivered a few months after the Battle of Jutland in 1916 . Repulse , and her sister HMS Renown , were the world 's fastest capital ships upon completion . 
 Repulse participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917 ; the only combat she saw during the war . She was reconstructed twice between the wars ; the 1920s reconstruction increased her armour protection and made lesser improvements , while the 1930s reconstruction was much more thorough . Repulse accompanied the battlecruiser HMS Hood during the Special Service Squadron 's round @-@ the @-@ world cruise in 1923 – 24 and protected international shipping during the Spanish Civil War in 1936 – 39 . 
 The ship spent the first months of the Second World War hunting for German raiders and blockade runners . She participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April – June 1940 and searched for the German battleship Bismarck in 1941 . Repulse escorted a troop convoy around the Cape of Good Hope from August to October 1941 and was transferred to East Indies Command . She was assigned in November to Force Z which was supposed to deter Japanese aggression against British possessions in the Far East . Repulse and her consort Prince of Wales were eventually sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941 when they attempted to intercept landings in British Malaya . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Admiral Lord Fisher first presented his requirements for the new ships to the Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) on 18 December 1914 , before the ships had even been approved . He wanted a long , high , flared bow , like that on the pre @-@ dreadnought HMS Renown , but higher , four 15 @-@ inch guns in two twin turrets , an anti @-@ torpedo boat armament of twenty 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns mounted high up and protected by gun shields only , speed of 32 knots using oil fuel , and armour on the scale of the battlecruiser Indefatigable . Within a few days , however , Fisher increased the number of guns to six and added two torpedo tubes . Minor revisions in the initial estimate were made until 26 December and a preliminary design was completed on 30 December . 
 During the following week the DNC 's department examined the material delivered for the two battleships and decided what could be used in the new design . The usable material was transferred to the builders who had received enough information from the DNC 's department to lay the keels of both ships on 25 January 1915 , well before the altered contracts were completed on 10 March ! 
 Repulse had an overall length of 794 feet 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 242 @.@ 1 m ) , a beam of 89 feet 11 @.@ 5 inches ( 27 @.@ 4 m ) , and a maximum draught of 29 feet 9 inches ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) . She displaced 26 @,@ 854 long tons ( 27 @,@ 285 t ) at normal load and 31 @,@ 592 long tons ( 32 @,@ 099 t ) at deep load . The Brown @-@ Curtis direct @-@ drive steam turbines were designed to produce 112 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 84 @,@ 000 kW ) , which would propel the ship at 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . However , during trials in 1916 , Repulse 's turbines provided 118 @,@ 913 shp ( 88 @,@ 673 kW ) , allowing her to reach a speed of 31 @.@ 73 knots ( 58 @.@ 76 km / h ; 36 @.@ 51 mph ) . The ship normally carried 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 016 t ) of fuel oil , but had a maximum capacity of 4 @,@ 289 long tons ( 4 @,@ 358 t ) . At full capacity , she could steam at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) for 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 410 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) . 
 The ship mounted six 42 @-@ calibre BL 15 @-@ inch Mk I guns in three twin hydraulically powered gun turrets , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . Her secondary armament consisted of 17 BL 4 @-@ inch Mark IX guns , fitted in five triple and two single mounts . Repulse mounted a pair of QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns mounted on the shelter deck abreast the rear funnel . She mounted two submerged tubes for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes , one on each side forward of ' A ' barbette . 
 Repulse 's waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured 6 inches ( 152 mm ) thick amidships . Her gun turrets were 7 – 9 inches ( 178 – 229 mm ) thick with roofs were 4 @.@ 25 inches ( 108 mm ) thick . As designed the high @-@ tensile @-@ steel decks ranged from 0 @.@ 75 to 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 19 to 38 mm ) in thickness . After the Battle of Jutland in 1916 , while the ship was still completing , an extra inch of high @-@ tensile steel was added on the main deck over the magazines . Repulse was fitted with a shallow anti @-@ torpedo bulge integral to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship . 
 Despite these additions , the ship was still felt to be too vulnerable to plunging fire and Repulse was refitted in Rosyth between 10 November 1916 and 29 January 1917 with additional horizontal armour , weighing approximately 504 long tons ( 512 t ) , added to the decks over the magazines and over the steering gear . Repulse was the first capital ship fitted with a flying @-@ off platform when an experimental one was fitted on ' B ' turret in the autumn of 1917 . Squadron Leader Frederick Rutland took off in a Sopwith Pup on 1 October . Another platform was built on ' Y ' turret and Rutland successfully took off from it on 8 October . One fighter and a reconnaissance aircraft were normally carried .

 Repulse was laid down by John Brown , Clydebank , Scotland on 25 January 1915 . The ship was launched on 8 January 1916 and completed on 18 August 1916 , after the Battle of Jutland . Her construction cost £ 2 @,@ 829 @,@ 087 . She served with the Grand Fleet in the North Sea during the remaining two years of the First World War . Repulse relieved HMS Lion as flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron for the duration of the war .

 Over the course of 1917 the Admiralty became more concerned about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British @-@ laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines . A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers . Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons , the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st BCS ( less Renown ) and , more distantly , the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation . 
 The German ships , four light cruisers of II Scouting Force , eight destroyers , three divisions of minesweepers , eight Sperrbrechers ( cork @-@ filled trawlers , used to detonate mines without sinking ) and two trawlers to mark the swept route , were spotted at 7 : 30 a.m. , silhouetted by the rising sun . The light battlecruiser Courageous and the light cruiser Cardiff opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later . The Germans responded by laying an effective smoke screen . The British continued in pursuit , but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted . Repulse was detached not long after and raced forward at full speed to engage the enemy ships . She opened fire at about 9 : 00 , scoring a single hit on the light cruiser SMS Königsberg during the battle . When the German battleships SMS Kaiser and SMS Kaiserin were spotted about 9 : 50 the British broke off their pursuit and Repulse covered their retreat , aided by a heavy fog that came down around 10 : 40 . The ship fired a total of 54 15 @-@ inch shells during the battle and scored one hit on the light cruiser SMS Königsberg that temporarily reduced her speed . 
 On 12 December 1917 , Repulse was damaged in a collision with the battlecruiser HMAS Australia . The ship was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 . 
 = = Inter @-@ war period = = 
 Repulse began a major refit at Portsmouth on 17 December 1918 intended to drastically improve her armour protection . Her existing 6 @-@ inch armour belt was replaced by 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) armour plates made surplus by the conversion of the battleship Almirante Cochrane ( originally ordered by Chile and purchased after the war began ) to the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle . The old armour was fitted between the main and upper decks , above the new armour belt . Additional high @-@ tensile plating was added to the decks over the magazines . The ship 's anti @-@ torpedo bulge was deepened and reworked along the lines of that installed on the battleship HMS Ramillies . The bulge covered her hull from the submerged torpedo room to ' Y ' magazine and the inner compartments of which were filled with crushing tubes . The bulges added 12 feet 8 inches ( 3 @.@ 9 m ) to her beam and 1 foot 4 inches ( 0 @.@ 4 m ) to her draught . The refit added about 4 @,@ 500 long tons ( 4 @,@ 600 t ) to her displacement and raised her metacentric height to 6 @.@ 4 feet ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) at deep load . Three 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) rangefinders were also added as well as eight torpedo tubes in twin mounts on the upper deck . Both flying @-@ off platforms were removed . This refit cost £ 860 @,@ 684 . 
 Repulse was recommissioned on 1 January 1921 and joined the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet . In November 1923 , Hood , accompanied by Repulse and a number of Danae @-@ class cruisers of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron , set out on a world cruise from west to east via the Panama Canal . They returned home ten months later in September 1924 . Shortly after her return the ship 's pair of 3 @-@ inch AA guns and her two single four @-@ inch gun mounts were removed and replaced with four QF four @-@ inch Mark V AA guns . The Battlecruiser Squadron visited Lisbon in February 1925 to participate in the Vasco da Gama celebrations before continuing on the Mediterranean for exercises . A squash court was added on the starboard side between the funnels for the Prince of Wales ' tour of Africa and South America that lasted from March to October . Upon her return she was refitted from November 1925 to July 1926 and had a high @-@ angle control position ( HACP ) added to her fore @-@ top .

 After Repulse completed her 1926 refit she remained in commission , aside from a brief refit in July – September 1927 , with the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet until she was paid off in June 1932 prior to beginning her reconstruction in April 1933 . Most of the existing layers of high @-@ tensile steel that constituted the ship 's horizontal armour were replaced by non @-@ cemented armour plates 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 – 89 mm ) in thickness and the torpedo control tower was removed from the aft superstructure . A fixed catapult replaced the midships 4 @-@ inch triple mount and a hangar was built on each side of the rear funnel to house two of the ship 's Fairey III aircraft . One additional aircraft could be carried on the deck and another on the catapult itself . Electric cranes were mounted above each hangar to handle the aircraft . The four 4 @-@ inch AA guns were moved , one pair abreast the rear funnel at the level of the hangar roof and the other pair abreast the fore funnel on the forecastle deck . Four prototype QF 4 @-@ inch Mark XV dual @-@ purpose guns were added in twin @-@ gun Mark XVIII mounts abreast the mainmast . Two octuple Mark VI 2 @-@ pounder mounts were fitted on extensions of the conning @-@ tower platform abreast the fore funnel . Above these a pair of quadruple Mark II * mountings for the 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Vickers Mark III machine gun were added . These mounts could depress to − 10 ° and elevate to a maximum of 70 ° . The machine guns fired a 1 @.@ 326 @-@ ounce ( 37 @.@ 6 g ) bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 520 ft / s ( 770 m / s ) . This gave the gun a maximum range of about 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) , although its effective range was only 800 yd ( 730 m ) Repulse received two High @-@ Angle Control System anti @-@ aircraft directors , one Mark II on the fore @-@ top and a Mark I * mounted on a pedestal above the rear superstructure . The two submerged torpedo tubes were removed and the vacant spaces sub @-@ divided and turned into store @-@ rooms . 
 Repulse was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet when she recommissioned in April 1936 . She transported 500 refugees from Valencia and Palma , Majorca to Marseilles , France in late 1936 after the start of the Spanish Civil War . The ship was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for George VI . Repulse was sent to Haifa in July 1938 to maintain order during the Arab Revolt . She was selected to convey the King and Queen during their May 1939 Canadian Tour and she was refitted between October 1938 and March 1939 for this role . The twin 4 @-@ inch AA guns were replaced by two more Mark V guns and two additional quadruple .50 @-@ calibre mounts were added . The King and Queen ultimately travelled aboard the liner RMS Empress of Australia while Repulse escorting them on the first half of the journey . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 At the beginning of the Second World War Repulse was part of the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet . She patrolled off the Norwegian coast and in the North Sea in search of German ships and to enforce the blockade for the first couple months of the war . Early in the war the aft triple 4 @-@ inch gun mount was replaced with an 8 @-@ barrel 2 @-@ pounder mount . In late October she was transferred to Halifax with the aircraft carrier HMS Furious to protect convoys and search for German raiders . Repulse and Furious sortied from Halifax on 23 November in search of the German battleship Scharnhorst after it had sunk the armed merchant cruiser HMS Rawalpindi , but the Repulse was damaged by heavy seas in a storm and was forced to return to port . Repulse escorted the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain 10 – 23 December 1939 and was reassigned to the Home Fleet . In February 1940 she accompanied the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal on a fruitless search for six German blockade runners that had broken out of Vigo , Spain . 
 Repulse was assigned to support Allied operations during the Norwegian Campaign in April – June 1940 . On 7 April , Repulse , along with the bulk of the Home Fleet , was ordered to sea to intercept what was thought to be another attempt to break @-@ out into the North Atlantic . The ship was detached the following day to search for a German ship reported by the destroyer HMS Glowworm , but the destroyer had been sunk by the German cruiser Admiral Hipper before Repulse arrived and she was ordered to rendezvous with her sister Renown south of the Lofoten Islands , off the Norwegian coast . On 12 April Repulse was ordered to return to Scapa Flow to refuel and she escorted a troop convoy upon her return . In early June the ship was sent to the North Atlantic to search for German raiders and played no part in the evacuation of Norway . 
 Accompanied by Renown and the 1st Cruiser Squadron , Repulse attempted to intercept the German battleship Gneisenau as it sailed from Trondheim to Germany in July . Until May 1941 the ship escorted convoys and unsuccessfully searched for German ships . On 22 May Repulse was diverted from escorting Convoy <unk> to assist in the search for the German battleship Bismarck , but she had to break off the search early on 25 May as she was running low on fuel . The ship was refitted from June to August and received eight Oerlikon 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) autocannon as well as a Type 284 surface gunnery radar . Repulse escorted a troop convoy around the Cape of Good Hope from August to October and was transferred to East Indies Command . 
 = = = Force Z = = = 
 In late 1941 Winston Churchill decided to send a small group of fast capital ships , along with one modern aircraft carrier to Singapore , to deter expected Japanese aggression . In November , Repulse which was in the Indian Ocean was ordered to Colombo , Ceylon to rendezvous with the new battleship HMS Prince of Wales . The carrier HMS Indomitable , which was assigned to join them , was delayed when she ran aground in the Caribbean . Prince of Wales and Repulse and their escorting destroyers comprised Force Z , which arrived in Singapore on 2 December 1941 . On the evening of 8 December , Force Z departed for an attempt to destroy Japanese troop convoys and protect the army 's seaward flanks from Japanese landings in their rear . 
 Force Z was spotted during the afternoon of 9 December by the Japanese submarine I @-@ 65 and floatplanes from several Japanese cruisers spotted the British ships later that afternoon and shadowed them until dark . Admiral Sir Tom Phillips decided to cancel the operation as the Japanese were now alerted . Force Z turned back during the evening , after having tried to deceive the Japanese that they were heading to Singora . At 00 : 50 on 10 December Admiral Philips received a signal of enemy landings at Kuantan and correspondingly altered course so that he would arrive shortly after dawn . 
 The crew of I @-@ 58 spotted Force Z at 02 : 20 , reported their position , and fired five torpedoes , all of which missed . Based on this report the Japanese launched 11 reconnaissance aircraft before dawn to locate Force Z. Several hours later 86 bombers from the 22nd Air Flotilla based in Saigon were launched carrying bombs or torpedoes . The crew of a Mitsubishi G3M " Nell " reconnaissance bomber spotted the British at 10 : 15 and radioed in several reports . The pilot was ordered to maintain contact and to broadcast a directional signal that the other Japanese bombers could follow . 
 The first attack began at 11 : 13 when 250 kilograms ( 551 lb ) bombs were dropped from eight G3Ms from an altitude of 11 @,@ 500 feet ( 3 @,@ 505 m ) . The battlecruiser was straddled by two bombs , then hit by a third which penetrated through the hangar to explode on the armoured deck below . This inflicted a number of casualties and damaged the ship 's Supermarine Walrus seaplane , which was then pushed over the side to remove a fire hazard . 
 Anti @-@ aircraft fire damaged five of the Japanese bombers , two so badly that they immediately returned to Saigon . In the ensuing attacks , Repulse was skilfully handled by her captain , Bill Tennant who managed to avoid 19 torpedoes as well as the remaining bombs from the G3Ms . However , Repulse was then caught by a synchronised pincer attack by 17 Mitsubishi G4M torpedo bombers and hit by four or five torpedoes in rapid succession . The gunners on the Repulse shot down two planes and heavily damaged eight more , but the torpedo damage proved fatal . At 12 : 23 Repulse listed severely to port and quickly capsized with the loss of 508 officers and men . The destroyers HMS Electra and HMAS Vampire rescued the survivors . 
 The wreck site was designated as a ' Protected Place ' in 2002 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 , 60 years after her sinking . Survivors described five torpedo hits on Repulse , four on the port side and one on the starboard side . The four portside hits were : two amidship , one abreast of the rear turret and one near the propellers . The starboard side hit was amidships . A 2007 diving expedition confirmed two of the hits by examination of the wreck : the portside hit near the propellers and the starboard hit amidship . The portside midships section of the wreck was buried in the ocean floor thus the hits there could not be confirmed . The area abreast of the rear turret was accessible and no sign of a torpedo hit was found . 
 In October 2014 , the Daily Telegraph reported that both Prince of Wales and Repulse were being " extensively damaged " with explosives by scrap metal dealers . 
 = Syphon Filter = 
 Syphon Filter is a third @-@ person shooter stealth video game developed by Eidetic and published by 989 Studios for PlayStation . The game was followed by a sequel , Syphon Filter 2 , in 2000 , and spin @-@ offs later released for the PlayStation Portable . The first game in the Syphon Filter series , the plot centres on special agents Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing who are tasked by the United States government to apprehend an international terrorist from Germany . 
 Development on Syphon Filter began with the intention of creating a new " super @-@ spy " genre hybrid that contained elements of stealth @-@ action and puzzle solving . The game was almost cancelled several times during development as Eidetic faced many difficulties due to the lack of inspiration from others and their inexperience in creating video games . Despite the initial drawbacks faced , Syphon Filter was met with positive reviews from critics upon release , mostly directed at its innovation and immersive plot . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game is presented in a third @-@ person perspective , and the player can freely move in three @-@ dimensional space and rotate the camera in any direction . The top left corner of the screen interface shows the status of Logan 's armour , a ' danger @-@ meter ' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat , and a target lock . A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units , enemies , weapon pick ups or mission objectives . The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner , with the ammunition count . Depending on the weapon used , the camera will shift to first @-@ person mode to assist in aiming . 
 The core of the gameplay is focused on stealth @-@ based tactics , which require one to silently take out enemies using silenced weapons or other lethal attacks . However , most of the game is action @-@ orientated , which involves Logan navigating through levels whilst loudly shooting at enemies with no consequence to the mission . The game takes place in a wide variety of locations , including narrow interior streets of Washington D.C. to wide open plains of Kazakhstan . In some stealth based missions , the game will involve various puzzles . Some locations feature low light ambience , which force the player to use their torch despite its drawbacks imposed during stealth missions . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Gabriel Logan and his partner Lian Xing investigate a series of biological outbreaks triggered by international terrorist Erich Rhoemer . When fellow agent Ellis loses contact during a mission in Costa Rica , the top @-@ secret Agency dispatches Gabe and Lian to find him . They discover Ellis is dead , and Rhoemer 's suspected drug operation is a cover for the viral operation . Another outbreak in Nepal leads to more questions when an infected person who should have died remained alive . 
 Before the Agency can pursue Rhoemer , he attacks Washington , D.C. with viral bombs . Gabe battles several terrorists , including Mara Aramov , as he follows the trail of bombs across city streets , subways , Washington Park and finally Freedom Memorial where he must incinerate enemy munitions expert Anton <unk> to stop the final threat . 
 Gabe 's investigation takes him to a new lead from PharCom , a multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headed by Jonathan Phagan . The Costa Rican plantation was growing PharCom compounds , meaning Phagan and Rhoemer were working together . At the PharCom Exposition Center , Gabe shadows Phagan to a meeting with Aramov and Edward Benton , an apparent Agency mole who assisted Rhoemer during the Washington , D.C. attack . 
 After Gabe eliminates Benton , he saves Phagan from assassination only to have him escape . Mara Aramov , now in custody , had attempted to locate PharCom 's virus labs . Gabe must set aside the hunt for Phagan to destroy Rhoemer 's base in Kazakhstan . During his assignment , Rhoemer seemingly kills Lian , but Agency Director Thomas Markinson rescues Gabe . 
 Markinson gives Gabe a report on the virus called Syphon Filter , a bioweapon that one can program on a genetic level to target specific groups of people . Gabe and Markinson infiltrate Rhoemer 's stronghold in Ukraine to inject test subjects with a vaccine and locate Phagan , who is now Rhoemer 's prisoner . In the catacombs , Phagan tells Gabe that Lian is alive , and they reunite . Lian has become infected with Syphon Filter , and she says there is no universal cure . 
 Mara Aramov arrives to shoot Phagan , but she convinces Gabe and Lian that she came to help . The three travel to PharCom 's warehouses in hopes of preventing Rhoemer from launching a missile . Lian reveals that the serum Gabe injected into the test subjects was really a lethal chemical , and Markinson was having them killed . Using the fighting between Rhoemer 's terrorists and Phagan 's guards to cover his insertion , Gabe descends into a silo and searches for the missile 's detonation codes . 
 He finds Markinson and gets him to confess that the Agency has been involved in the plot all along . Rhoemer worked for Markinson , since the latter wanted the virus in the Agency 's possession . He never authorized the missile attack , but before he can stop it , Rhoemer kills Markinson with a headshot . Gabe must reach the missile 's control center in time and destroy it . Enraged , Rhoemer engages Gabe in a final fight , but is killed with a gas grenade . 
 Their mission completed , Gabe and Lian call in the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command ( <unk> ) to secure the area . They do not know how far Markinson was cooperating with Rhoemer and Phagan , but Gabe believes they may never know . In a post @-@ credits scene , Aramov approaches a mysterious man inside the Agency headquarters and whispers something in his ear . He congratulates her while the camera pulls back to show PharCom boxes in the office . 
 = = Development = = 
 According to creative director John Garvin , Syphon Filter was originally conceived as " just a name " from a producer at 989 Studios . Initially , there was no plot , character or gameplay from the original one page synopsis . Eidetic decided to set Syphon Filter as a new ' stealth @-@ action ' hybrid that focused heavily on weapons , gadgets and stealth . The team 's lead designer was influenced over Rare 's successful GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64 , and implemented the game 's mechanics to have a similar feel for a new " super spy " genre . 
 The team experienced immense difficulty in creating the game , as Garvin noted that there were " no , or few , games " from which Eidetic could draw inspiration . Most of the team that developed Syphon Filter had little experience with making third @-@ person action games , as Eidetic 's only video game released for a console was <unk> 3D , which was released three years prior for the PlayStation and was infamous for being critically panned as one of the worst games of all time . Despite the initial difficulties with staff and lack of experience , Eidetic produced a prototype which involved a shooting segment in an underground . Garvin admitted that the team " didn 't know anything about making realistic shooters set in a spy world " as the game came close to being cancelled several times throughout development because the team was missing deadlines , revamping mechanics and changing the story . During development , the team of thirteen re @-@ wrote several drafts as the game was being conceived . The original plot of Syphon Filter was intended as a science @-@ fiction orientated approach and involved a group of kidnapped scientists who were being forced to build a time machine by an unspecified antagonistic organisation . The storyline was <unk> changed when John Garvin was hired to be art director , later creative director . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Syphon Filter received " critical acclaim " reviews , according to video game review aggregator Metacritic . 
 The blend of a stealth @-@ action hybrid gameplay was praised by most critics . Doug Perry of IGN enjoyed the implemented skill @-@ based action that he considered was " hard to come by in a PlayStation game " . Perry praised the game 's detail and advanced graphics , but criticised the low resolution and noting that the game 's frame rate was " not perfect " . Despite this , he noted that what Syphon Filter " gives up in frame rate [ it ] provides in character and environment detail " . 
 Game Revolution similarly praised the attention to detail , calling every texture of the game " well planned and rendered " however compared the graphics were not as detailed as Metal Gear Solid . However , they noted that during some points the game " suffers from many typical PlayStation polygonal errors " , causing some textures to become " warped " when viewed from an angle , although they noted that glitches were uncommon and did not affect gameplay in any way . 
 The gameplay and artificial intelligence were the most praised aspects of the game . Game Revolution noted the gameplay was " well above average " and had an excellent replay value , in contrast to games such as Star Fox 64 once completed . Perry praised the game 's wide variety of weapons and gadgets , having counted at least thirty different weapons and equipment for the player to use , with the added bonus of secret weapons , adding to the gameplay value . Game Revolution added that the AI was " perhaps the best part of the game " , commending on how certain enemies react on when one of their comrades are killed nearby . IGN similarly praised its AI , pointing out on how every time a level is played the AI would change its behaviour , sometimes hiding behind trees or carrying different weapons . 
 = = = Sequels = = = 
 Due to its popularity , Sony commissioned 989 Studios to make various sequels and spin @-@ offs to the game . Syphon Filter 2 was released in 2000 to popular reviews from critics , and another direct sequel , Syphon Filter 3 was released in 2001 to mixed reviews upon release . Two spin @-@ offs were released for the PlayStation Portable in 2006 and 2007 ; Syphon Filter : Dark Mirror and Syphon Filter : Logan 's Shadow , respectively . A port to the PlayStation 2 for Logan 's Shadow was released exclusively in North America in 2007 . The two spin @-@ offs were met with mixed to positive reviews from critics , which led to the end of the Syphon Filter series in 2007 . 
 = Vladimir Bukovsky = 
 Vladimir Konstantinovich Bukovsky ( Russian : <unk> ́ <unk> Константи ́ нович <unk> ́ вский ; born 30 December 1942 in <unk> , Bashkir ASSR ) was prominent in the Soviet dissident movement of the 1960s and 1970s and spent a total of twelve years in psychiatric prison @-@ hospitals , labor camps and prisons within the Soviet Union . Since being expelled from the country in late 1976 he has remained in active and vocal opposition to the Soviet system and the shortcomings of its successor regimes in Russia . A writer , neurophysiologist , and activist , he is celebrated for his part in the campaign to expose and halt the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union . 
 Today he is a member of the international advisory council for the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation , a director of the Gratitude Fund set up in 1998 to commemorate and support former dissidents , a member of the International Council of the New York @-@ based Human Rights Foundation , and a Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute in Washington . In 2001 , Vladimir Bukovsky received the Truman @-@ Reagan Medal of Freedom which has been awarded annually since 1993 by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Vladimir Bukovsky was born in the town of <unk> in the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ( today the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Russian Federation ) , to which his family was evacuated during World War II . After the war he and his parents returned to Moscow where his father Konstantin ( 1908 – 1976 ) was a well @-@ known Soviet journalist . During his last year at school Vladimir was expelled for creating and editing an unauthorized magazine . In order to meet the requirements to apply for a university place he completed his secondary education at evening classes . 
 = = Activism and imprisonment = = 
 = = = Mayakovsky Square = = = 
 In September 1960 Bukovsky entered Moscow University to study biology . There he and some friends decided to revive the informal Mayakovsky Square poetry readings which began after a statue to the poet was unveiled in central Moscow in 1958 . They made contact with earlier participants of the readings such as Vladimir Osipov , the editor of Boomerang ( 1960 ) , and Yuri <unk> who issued the Phoenix ( 1961 ) , two examples of literary samizdat . 
 It was then that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Bukovsky wrote his critical notes on the Communist Youth League or Komsomol . Later this text was given the title " Theses on the Collapse of the Komsomol " by the KGB . Bukovsky portrayed the USSR as an " illegal society " facing an acute ideological crisis . The Komsomol was " moribund " , he asserted , having lost both moral and spiritual authority , and he called for its democratisation . This text and his other activities brought Bukovsky to the attention of the authorities . He was interrogated twice before being thrown out of the university in autumn 1961 . 
 Bukovsky was arrested on 1 June 1963 . He was later convicted , in absentia , by reason on his " insanity " , under Article 70 @.@ 1 ( " Anti @-@ Soviet agitation and propaganda " ) of the RSFSR Criminal Code . The official charge was the making and possession of photocopies of anti @-@ Soviet literature , namely two copies of the banned work The New Class by Milovan Djilas . Bukovsky was examined by Soviet psychiatrists , declared to be mentally ill , and sent for treatment at the Special Psychiatric Hospital in Leningrad where he remained for almost two years , until February 1965 . It was there he became acquainted with General Petro Grigorenko , a fellow inmate . 
 = = = The Glasnost rally , 5 December 1965 = = = 
 In December 1965 , Bukovsky helped prepare a demonstration on Pushkin Square in central Moscow to protest against the trial of the writers Andrei <unk> and Yuli Daniel . He circulated the " Civic Appeal " by mathematician and poet Alexander <unk> @-@ <unk> , which called on the authorities to obey the Soviet laws requiring glasnost in the judicial process , e.g. the admission of the public and the media to any trial . The demonstration on 5 December 1965 ( Constitution Day ) became known as the Glasnost Meeting or rally , and marked the beginning of the openly active Soviet civil rights movement . 
 Bukovsky himself was unable to attend . Three days earlier he was arrested , charged with distributing the appeal , and kept in various <unk> , among them Hospital No 13 at <unk> , <unk> and the Serbsky Institute , until July 1966 . 
 = = = The Right to <unk> , 1967 = = = 
 On 22 January 1967 Bukovsky , Vadim Delaunay , Yevgeny <unk> and Victor <unk> held another demonstration on Pushkin Square . They were protesting against the recent arrests of Alexander Ginzburg , Yuri <unk> , Alexei <unk> and Vera <unk> ( finally prosecuted in January 1968 in the Trial of the Four ) and asserting their own right to protest : on 16 September 1966 a new law , Article 190 @.@ 3 , had been introduced which classified any public gatherings or demonstrations as a crime . 
 On 1 September 1967 at his own trial Bukovsky used his final words to attack the regime 's failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures . He invoked Article 125 of the ( still current ) 1936 Soviet Constitution to defend the right to organize demonstrations and other public protests . He further suggested that the prosecution had repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure in its conduct of the case . Bukovsky 's final words in court circulated widely in a samizdat collection of such addresses and as part of a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov . 
 Fellow protestors Vadim Delaunay and Yevgeny <unk> admitted regret for their actions but not their guilt ; they received suspended sentences and were released . Bukovsky was defiant and , like fellow demonstrator Victor <unk> ( convicted in February 1967 ) , was given three years in an " ordinary regime " corrective @-@ labour camp . Bukovsky was sent to Bor in the Voronezh Region to serve his sentence . He was released in January 1970 . 
 = = = The Campaign against the Abuse of Psychiatry = = = 
 In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet authorities began the widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent @-@ minded . This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka , as such places were popularly known , which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison @-@ hospitals set up ( e.g. the Leningrad Special <unk> Hospital ) as part of an existing penal institution . Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients ; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs ; they might also be incarcerated in prison @-@ type institutions under overall control of the KGB . 
 In 1971 Bukovsky managed to smuggle to the West over 150 pages documenting the political abuse of psychiatric institutions in the Soviet Union . In a letter addressed to " Western psychiatrists " and written in a deliberately restrained tone , Bukovsky asked them to consider if the evidence justified the isolation of several dissidents , and urged them to discuss the matter at the next International Congress of Psychiatrists . 
 The documents were released to the press in March 1971 by a small French group called the International Committee for the Defence of Human Rights . Bukovsky 's letter appeared on 12 March in The Times ( London ) and later in the British Journal of Psychiatry Bukovsky was arrested on 29 March and held in custody for nine months before being put on trial in January 1972 . 
 The information Bukovsky had gathered and sent to the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union . It also struck a chord among psychiatrists . In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times ( London ) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned . At a meeting in November 1971 , the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened . These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events , which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky 's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence . As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row , Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation , without access to a lawyer , to be tried and sent to the camps or a special psychiatric hospital . 
 Responding to public pressure , the World Psychiatric Association finally condemned Soviet practices at its Sixth World Congress in 1977 and set up a review committee to monitor misuse . In 1983 the Soviet representatives withdrew from the World Psychiatric Association rather than face expulsion . Bukovsky later characterized this reaction as " the most important victory for the dissident form of glasnost " . 
 = = = Final arrest ( 1971 ) and imprisonment = = = 
 Following the release of the documents , Bukovsky was denounced in Pravda as a " malicious hooligan , engaged in anti @-@ Soviet activities " and arrested on 29 March 1971 . At first held in <unk> Prison , in August Bukovsky spent approximately three months in the Serbsky Institute , which this time pronounced him mentally sound and able to stand trial . 
 During the trial in January 1972 Bukovsky was accused of slandering Soviet psychiatry , contacts with foreign journalists , and the possession and distribution of samizdat . On this occasion he again used his final words to the court to reach a much wider audience when the text circulated in samizdat . He was sentenced to two years in prison , five in a labour camp , and five more in internal exile . 
 While in prison Bukovsky and fellow inmate psychiatrist Semyon Gluzman jointly wrote A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents published in Russian , English , French , Italian , German , Danish . It instructed potential victims of political psychiatry how to behave during interrogation in order to avoid being diagnosed as mentally ill . 
 = = Deportation from the USSR ( 1976 ) = = 
 The fate of Bukovsky and other political prisoners in the Soviet Union had been repeatedly brought to world attention by Western diplomats and human rights groups such as the relatively new Amnesty International . 
 Had he served the full sentence handed down in 1972 Vladimir Bukovsky would have been released from the camps ( or prison ) in March 1978 and been able to live in Moscow again in 1983 . In December 1976 , however , he was forcibly deported from the USSR and exchanged at Zürich airport by the Soviet government for the imprisoned general secretary of the Communist Party of Chile , Luis <unk> . In his 1978 autobiography Bukovsky describes how he was brought to Switzerland in handcuffs . The widely publicised exchange increased public awareness in the West about Soviet dissidents . 
 In March 1977 , U.S. President Jimmy Carter met with Bukovsky at the White House . In the USSR the meeting was seen by dissidents and rights activists as a sign of the newly elected president 's willingness to stress human rights in his foreign policy ; the event provoked harsh criticism by Soviet leaders . 
 Bukovsky moved to Great Britain where he settled in Cambridge and resumed his studies in biology , disrupted fifteen years earlier ( see above ) by his expulsion from Moscow University . 
 = = Life in the West = = 
 Bukovsky gained a Masters Degree in Biology at Cambridge University . He also wrote and published To Build a Castle : My Life as a Dissenter ( 1978 ) . ( The title in Russian , And the Wind Returns ... , is a Biblical allusion . ) The book was translated into English , French and German . It was published in Russian the following year by <unk> publishers in New York . Today the Russian original is available online via a number of websites . 
 Since he has lived in the West Bukovsky has written many essays and polemical articles . These not only criticised the Soviet regime and , later , that of Vladimir Putin , but also exposed " Western gullibility " in the face of Soviet abuses and , in some cases , what he believed to be Western complicity in such crimes ( see American Betrayal sub @-@ section below ) . In the late 1970s and early 1980s , following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , Bukovsky campaigned successfully for an official UK and US boycott of the summer 1980 Olympics in Moscow . During the same years he voiced concern about the activities and policies of the Western peace movements . 
 In 1983 , together with Cuban dissident Armando Valladares , Bukovsky co @-@ founded and was later elected president of Resistance International . The anti @-@ Communist organisation was run from a small office in Paris by Soviet dissidents and emigres , notably Vladimir <unk> and Eduard Kuznetsov . In 1985 it expanded into the American Foundation for Resistance International . Among the prominent members of the board were Albert Jolis and Jeane Kirkpatrick while Midge Decter , Yuri Yarim @-@ <unk> , Richard Perle , Saul Bellow , Robert Conquest and Martin Colman were on the body 's advisory committee . The Foundation aimed to be a coordinating centre for dissident and democratic movements seeking to overturn communism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere . It organised protests in the communist countries and in the West , and opposed western financial assistance to communist governments . The Foundation also created the National Council to Support Democratic Movements ( National Council for Democracy ) with the goal of aiding the emergence of democratic rule @-@ of @-@ law governments , and providing assistance with the writing of constitutions and the formation of civil institutions . 
 In March 1987 Bukovsky and nine other émigré authors ( Ernst <unk> , Yury Lyubimov , Vasily <unk> and Leonid Plyushch among them ) caused a furore in the West and then in the Soviet Union itself when they raised doubts about the substance and sincerity of Mikhail Gorbachev 's reforms . 
 = = Judgment in Moscow ( 1995 ) = = 
 In April 1991 Vladimir Bukovsky visited Moscow for the first time since his deportation fifteen years before . In the run @-@ up to the 1991 presidential election the team around Boris Yeltsin considered Bukovsky as one of a number of potential vice @-@ presidential running @-@ mates . In the end , army officer Alexander <unk> , a veteran of the 1979 – 1989 war in Afghanistan and Hero of the Soviet Union was selected . On 5 December 1991 both of Bukovsky 's Soviet @-@ era convictions were annulled by a decree of the RSFSR Supreme Court . The following year President Yeltsin formally restored Bukovsky 's Russian citizenship : he had never been deprived of his Soviet citizenship , despite deportation from the country . 
 In 1992 , after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , President Yeltsin 's government invited Bukovsky to serve as an expert witness at the trial before the Constitutional Court where Russia 's communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their Party and taking its property . The respondent 's case was that the CPSU itself had been an unconstitutional organisation . To prepare his testimony , Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from the CPSU Central Committee archives ( then reorganised into the Central Depository for Contemporary Documentation or <unk> ) . With the help of a small hand @-@ held scanner and a laptop computer , he managed secretly to scan many documents ( some with high security clearance ) , including KGB reports to the Central Committee . The copies were then smuggled to the West . 
 Bukovsky hoped that an international tribunal in Moscow might play a similar role to the first Nuremberg Trial ( 1945 – 1946 ) in post @-@ Nazi Germany and help the country begin to overcome the legacy of Communism . This did not happen . The " Trial of the CPSU " fell far short of that goal . The Soviet Communist Party was found to be an unconstitutional organisation , but former communists were allowed to play a leading part in the government of post @-@ Soviet Russia and , as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation , to act as the country 's main political opposition . Former CPSU , even Politburo , members such as Alexander Yakovlev ( Russian politician ) had a prominent place in the presidential commission for the post @-@ October 1917 victims of political repression . Bukovsky expressed his deep disappointment with this failure in his writings and interviews . 
 Having failed to finish off conclusively the communist system , we are now in danger of integrating the resulting monster into our world . It may not be called communism anymore , but it has retained many of its dangerous characteristics ... Until a Nuremberg @-@ style tribunal passes its judgment on all the crimes committed by communism , it is not dead and the war is not over . 
 It took several years and a team of assistants to piece together the scanned fragments ( many only half a page in width ) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then , in 1999 , to make them available online . Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky 's Judgment in Moscow ( 1995 ) , where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West . 
 The book was translated into several languages . It was not published at the time in English : Random House bought the rights to the manuscript , but the publisher , in Bukovsky 's words , tried to make the author " rewrite the whole book from the liberal left political perspective . " Bukovsky resisted , explaining to the Random House editor that he was " allergic to political censorship " because of " certain peculiarities of my biography " . ( The contract was subsequently cancelled . ) . The French edition appeared in 1995 as <unk> à Moscou . The book was also published in Russian ( 1996 ) and certain other Slavic languages , most notably the Polish edition which for a time became a bestseller . Only in 2016 did a full @-@ length translation of the book , updated with material from the <unk> archive , appear in English .

 British and European psychiatrists assessing the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterized him in 1971 : " The information we have about [ Vladimir Bukovsky ] suggests that he is the sort of person who might be embarrassing to authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort , and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him . But such people often have much to contribute , and deserve considerable respect . " 
 Soon Vladimir Bukovsky was again out of favour with the Russian authorities . He supported Yeltsin against the Supreme Soviet in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis in October that year but criticised the new Constitution of Russia approved two months later , as being designed to ensure a continuation of Yeltsin 's power . According to Bukovsky , Yeltsin became a hostage of the security agencies from 1994 onwards , and a restoration of KGB rule was inevitable . 
 After the publication of Judgment in Moscow in French ( 1995 ) and then in Russian ( 1996 ) , he was denied entry to Russia from October 1996 until 2007 , in the run @-@ up to the 2008 Presidential elections . 
 = = = Moscow Mayor — or President of Russia ? = = = 
 In 1992 a group of liberal deputies of the Moscow City Council proposed Bukovsky 's candidacy for elections of the new Mayor of Moscow , following the resignation of the previous Mayor , Gavriil Popov . Bukovsky refused the offer , stating that to fulfil the mayor ’ s duties he would need a large team of intellectuals committed to radical reform , and there was a lack of such people in the country . Deputy mayor Yury Luzhkov took over , and ran the city from 1992 to 2010 . 
 In early 1996 a group of Moscow academics , journalists and intellectuals suggested that Vladimir Bukovsky should run for President of Russia as an alternative candidate to both incumbent President Boris Yeltsin and his main challenger Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation . However , no formal nomination process was initiated .

 In 2001 , Bukovsky was elected President of the <unk> pro <unk> – <unk> per le <unk> – Freedom Committees in Florence , an Italian libertarian organisation which promoted an annual Memento Gulag , or Memorial Day devoted to the Victims of Communism , on 7 November ( the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution ) . The Memento Gulag has since been held in Rome , Bucharest , Berlin , La Roche sur Yon and Paris . 
 = = = Contacts with Boris Nemtsov and the Russian Opposition = = = 
 In 2002 Boris Nemtsov , former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia who was then an elected member of the State Duma and leader of the Union of Rightist Forces , paid a visit to Bukovsky in Cambridge . He wanted to discuss the strategy of the Russian opposition . It was imperative , Bukovsky told Nemtsov , that Russian liberals adopt an uncompromising stand toward what he saw as the authoritarian government of President Vladimir Putin . 
 On one of journalist Anna Politkovskaya 's frequent visits to Britain she interviewed Vladimir Bukovsky and Boris Berezovsky to provide a " comparative analysis of different waves of political emigration " . With Bukovsky , " The Patriarch " as he was called in the published version of her article , she discussed the position of those who had gained political asylum in Britain ( Ahmed Zakayev , Alexander Litvinenko ) , and the attitudes of the UK government of Tony Blair and of the European Parliament to the situation in Chechnya . During their talk Bukovsky expressed disapproval of the way in which Slobodan Milosevic was brought before the Hague tribunal . 
 In January 2004 , with Garry Kasparov , Boris Nemtsov , Vladimir V. Kara @-@ Murza and others , Bukovsky was a co @-@ founder of Committee 2008 . This umbrella organisation of the Russian democratic opposition was formed to ensure free and fair elections in 2008 when a successor to Vladimir Putin was elected . 
 In 2005 Bukovsky was among the prominent dissidents of the 1960s and 1970s ( Gorbanevskaya , Sergei <unk> , Eduard Kuznetsov , Alexander Podrabinek , Yelena Bonner ) who took part in a documentary series by Vladimir Kara @-@ Murza Jr . They Chose Freedom . In 2013 Bukovsky was featured in a documentary series by Natella Boltyanskaya Parallels , Events , People . 
 In 2009 Bukovsky joined the council of the new Solidarnost coalition which brought together a wide range of extra @-@ parliamentary opposition forces . 
 = = = Criticism of torture in Abu Ghraib prison ( Iraq ) = = = 
 As revelations mounted about the sanctioned torture of captives in the Guantánamo Bay detention camp , Abu Ghraib and the CIA secret prisons , Bukovsky entered the discussion with an uncompromising attack on the official if covert rationalisation of torture . In an 18 December 2005 op @-@ ed in The Washington Post , Bukovsky recounted his experience under torture in <unk> prison in 1971 . Once commenced , he warned , the inertia of torture was difficult to control , corrupting those who carried it out . " Torture " , he wrote , " has historically been an instrument of oppression — not an instrument of investigation or of intelligence gathering . " Bukovsky explained : 
 Investigation is a subtle process , requiring patience and fine analytical ability , as well as a skill in cultivating one 's sources . When torture is condoned , these rare talented people leave the service , having been outstripped by less gifted colleagues with their quick @-@ fix methods , and the service itself degenerates into a playground for sadists . 
 US President Barack Obama repudiated the Torture <unk> on 20 January 2009 , two days after taking office . 
 = = = Fatal defects of the European Union = = = 
 In a February 2006 interview with The Brussels Journal , Bukovsky said he had read confidential documents from secret Soviet files in 1992 which confirmed the existence of a " conspiracy " to turn the European Union into a socialist organisation . The European Union was a " monster " , he argued , and it must be destroyed , the sooner the better , " before it develops into a full @-@ fledged totalitarian state " , 
 Meanwhile they are introducing more and more ideology . The Soviet Union used to be a state run by ideology . Today 's ideology of the European Union is social @-@ democratic , statist , and a big part of it is also political correctness . I watch very carefully how political correctness spreads and becomes an oppressive ideology , not to mention the fact that they forbid smoking almost everywhere now . 
 There were certain parallels , Bukovsky warned in his interview , between the formation of the Soviet Union and the European Union . In 2006 he described the perils of the USSR , with its model whereby nationalities and ethnic groups were dissolved to create a new " Soviet nation " . While Soviet ideology postulated that the State would eventually wither away , Bukovsky pointed out that the reality was quite different : the State had become paramount . As an expression of his Eurosceptic position Bukovsky is vice @-@ president of The Freedom Association ( <unk> ) in the United Kingdom and has been a patron of the United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) . 
 In 2007 , following a similar line of argument , Bukovsky suggested that Russia was too big and should be broken up into several smaller countries . It was an opinion quickly reported to audiences around the world by the new State @-@ funded English @-@ language broadcaster Russia Today . 
 = = = Diana West 's American Betrayal ( 2013 ) = = = 
 In September 2013 , Bukovsky entered the controversy over Diana West 's American Betrayal : The Secret Assault on Our Nation 's Character , a book dismissed by historian Professor Ronald Radosh as " McCarthy on Steroids " . Responding at <unk> , Bukovsky rejected Radosh 's criticisms , condemned the attempt to portray West as a deluded and historically inept conspiracy @-@ <unk> , and supported her conclusions as to the infiltration of the Roosevelt government by Stalinist agents and fellow @-@ travellers : 
 That treacherous Establishment is still there . We are still governed by a nomenklatura of <unk> , <unk> and Quislings of the Cold War . Mrs. West has reached that conclusion merely by examining the first chapters of this sad story . Sure enough , there are mountains of other and more recent evidence to support her conclusions . But of course , whatever the evidence , the " consensus " will never plead guilty . Rather , they will try and usurp the judicial seat . 
 In turn Bukovsky himself was taken to task by David Horowitz , whose <unk> Magazine had carried the Radosh review : 
 It grieves me to see a hero of the anti @-@ Communist struggle , Vladimir Bukovsky , join the character assassins that Diana West has mobilized to attack Radosh and me because <unk> posted a bad review of her book . ... It grieves me even more because he goes out of his way to defend her preposterous claims , e.g. , that the division of Europe at Yalta was a Soviet plot when everyone knows the division was drawn by Winston Churchill , hardly a Soviet stooge . There are dozens , if not hundreds , of howlers like this in West 's 400 @-@ page , 900 @-@ footnote book , which is why we gave it a bad review . 
 Ten years earlier , Bukovsky sketched some of the numerous and insidious ways such Western complicity was secured . Beyond those who were recruited as Soviet agents and consciously worked for the USSR , as he explained in Judgment in Moscow ( 1995 ) , there were men and women whom the KGB and GRU classified as " agents of influence " and " confidential contacts " : 
 The majority of these " agents of influence " , moreover , were not in a literal sense KGB agents . Some distributed Soviet disinformation for idealistic reasons ; others were paying off an old " debt " to the KGB or , on the contrary , expected some new reward or service ; others simply did not know what they were doing . ... The examples are endlessly varied . 
 This applied equally , Bukovsky cautioned , to post @-@ Stalin generations of specialists on the USSR and Eastern Europe . They had been subjected to similar pressures and inducements in the 1970s and 1980s : 
 The majority of Sovietologists and <unk> , experts on Russia and the Soviet Union , were dependent on the regime for permission to visit the USSR from time to time . A specialist could not secure his place and reputation in the current academic world without that contact : anyone might accuse him of having lost touch and no longer retaining his expertise . The chance to travel to the USSR , however , was closely monitored in those years by the KGB . 
 = = Candidate for Russian Presidency ( 2008 ) = = 
 In May 2007 , Bukovsky announced his plans to run as candidate for president in the May 2008 Russian presidential election . On 16 December 2007 , Bukovsky was officially nominated to run against Dmitry Medvedev and other candidates . 
 The group that nominated Bukovsky as a candidate included Yuri <unk> , Vladimir V. Kara @-@ Murza , Alexander Podrabinek , Andrei <unk> , Vladimir <unk> and others . Activists , authors and commentators such as Viktor <unk> , Valeriya <unk> and Lev Rubinstein also favoured Bukovsky . 
 Responding to pro @-@ Kremlin politicians and commentators who expressed doubt about <unk> 's electoral prospects , his nominators rejected a number of frequently repeated allegations . In Moscow more than 800 citizens of the Russian Federation nominated Bukovsky for president on 16 December 2007 . Bukovsky secured the required number of signatures to register and submitted his application to the Central Election Commission on time , 18 December 2007 . 
 The Action Group in support of Bukovsky 's candidacy denied claims by pro @-@ government media that Bukovsky had failed in his campaign to become RF President and in appeals before the RF Constitutional Court . 
 On 22 December 2007 the Central Electoral Commission turned down Bukovsky 's application , on the grounds that ( 1 ) he had failed to give information about his activities as a writer when submitting his documents , ( 2 ) he was holding a British residence permit , and ( 3 ) he had not been living in Russia during the past ten years . Bukovsky appealed against the decision at the RF Supreme Court on 28 December 2007 and , subsequently , before its cassation board on 15 January 2008 . 
 On 30 March 2011 , Bukovsky requested the arrest of Mikhail Gorbachev by the British authorities after submitting to Westminster Magistrates ' Court materials on crimes against humanity that the former Soviet leader had allegedly committed in the late 1980s and early 1990s . 
 = = Crimea , Ukraine , Litvinenko Inquiry ( 2012 – 2015 ) = = 
 Bukovsky was among the first 34 signatories of " Putin must go " , an online anti @-@ Putin manifesto published on 10 March 2010 . In May 2012 Vladimir Putin began his third term as president of the Russian Federation after serving four years as the country 's prime minister . The following year Bukovsky published a collection of interviews in Russia which described Putin and his team as The heirs of Lavrentiy Beria , Stalin 's last and most notorious secret police chief . 
 Following the winter 2014 Sochi Olympics the Russian Federation annexed Crimea . The West responded with sanctions targeted at Putin 's immediate entourage , and Bukovsky expressed the hope that this would prove the end of his regime . 
 In October 2014 the Russian authorities declined to issue Bukovsky with a new foreign @-@ travel passport . The Foreign Ministry stated that it could not confirm Bukovsky 's citizenship . The response was met with surprise from Kremlin 's Human Rights Council and the Human Rights ombudsman of the Russian Federation . 
 On 17 March 2015 at the long @-@ delayed inquiry into Alexander Litvinenko 's fatal poisoning Bukovsky gave his views as to why the former FSB man had been murdered . Interviewed on BBC TV eight years before , Bukovsky expressed no doubt that the Russian authorities were responsible for the London death of Litvinenko on 23 November 2006 .

 In early May 2015 it was reported that Bukovsky had undergone a 9 @-@ hour heart operation in a private German clinic , during which he was given two artificial valves . Subsequently Bukovsky was kept in a medically @-@ induced coma for three days to improve his chances of recovery . 
 In 2015 UK Crown Prosecution Service announced prosecution of Bukovsky for " prohibited images " found on his computer . Bukovsky described the accusations as absurd and pointed out that the tip about the images – most likely planted on his computer by a backdoor program – was passed through Europol from Russian security services . Bukovsky also noted that while the original announcement by CPS accused him of " possession and making " , the prosecution materials passed to the court only mentioned " possession " . 
 After partial recovery from his lengthy heart surgery , Vladimir Bukovsky responded to charges brought against him by the UK Crown Prosecution Service earlier in the year . Issuing a High Court writ for libel , Vladimir Bukovsky said that the CPS had defamed him , and claimed damages of £ 100 @,@ 000 .

 Mingulay ( Scottish Gaelic : Miughalaigh , pronounced [ <unk> ̪ aj ] ) is the second largest of the Bishop 's Isles in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland . Located 12 miles ( 19 km ) south of Barra , it is known for its important seabird populations , including puffins , black @-@ legged kittiwakes , and razorbills , which nest in the sea @-@ cliffs , amongst the highest in the British Isles . 
 There are iron age remains , and the culture of the island was influenced by early Christianity and the Vikings . Between the 15th and 19th centuries Mingulay was part of the lands of Clan MacNeil of Barra , but subsequently suffered at the hands of absentee landlords . 
 After two thousand years or more of continuous habitation , the island was abandoned by its Gaelic @-@ speaking residents in 1912 and has remained uninhabited since . It is no longer used for grazing sheep . The island is also associated with the " Mingulay Boat Song " , although that was composed in 1938 , following Mingulay 's abandonment . The National Trust for Scotland has owned Mingulay since 2000 . 
 = = Geology and soils = = 
 In the Pleistocene era Mingulay was covered by the ice sheets which spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides . After the last retreat of the ice around 20 @,@ 000 years ago , sea levels were lower than at present and circa 14 @,@ 000 BP it was joined to a single large island comprising most of what is now the Outer Hebrides . Steadily rising sea levels since that time then isolated the island , which is made up of Hebridean gneiss interspersed with some granite . The ice deposited both erratic blocks of rock and boulder clay on the eastern side of the island around Mingulay Bay . The rest of the island is covered in peat , thin acidic soils , or bare rock . 
 = = Geography and pre @-@ history = = 
 Mingulay is now part of the small archipelago known as the Bishop or Barra Isles which are " composed of a cluster of islands surrounded by a boisterous sea , making the passage of one island to another a matter of very considerable hazard " and which form the southern end of the larger Outer Hebrides group . 
 There is one large beach on the eastern side of the isle where the only settlement of note ( ‘ The Village ’ ) was located and a tiny cove at <unk> ( Old Norse : ship valley ) . Bagh na h @-@ <unk> ( Scots Gaelic : bay of the steep promontory ) on the western side is a deep cleft in the sea @-@ cliffs once thought to be the highest in the UK which rise to 213 m ( 699 ft ) above sea level at <unk> . 
 Mingulay boasts three large sea stacks : <unk> ( Old Norse : Erne mound ) , <unk> ( Old Norse : Flax mound ) and <unk> , which has a natural arch in 150 m ( 490 ft ) cliffs through which boats can sail on rare days when the restless sea is calm . There are several outlying islets including the twin rocks of Sròn a <unk> to the south @-@ west , Geirum Mòr and Geirum Beag to the south between Mingulay and the nearby island of Berneray , and Solon Mòr ( ' Big Gannet ' ) , Solon Beag ( ' Little Gannet ' ) , <unk> nan <unk> , Barnacle Rock and a smaller stack called The Red Boy , all to the north between Mingulay and Pabbay . 
 The highest hills are <unk> ( 273 m or 896 ft ) , Hecla ( Old Norse : Hooded shroud ) ( 219 m or 719 ft ) and Macphee 's Hill ( 224 m or 735 ft ) . The last was named when a relief ship sent by MacNeil of Barra was sent to discover why communications from the island had ceased . A crewman called Macphee was sent ashore and returned to report that the residents had all died of disease . Fearing the plague , his shipmates refused to allow him back on board . He survived for a year , and climbed the hill every day to look out for a rescue . When the island was re @-@ settled The MacNeil granted him land there . 
 The south @-@ western promontory of Dun Mingulay features the remains of an Iron Age fort and there is a pre @-@ historic site at Crois an t @-@ <unk> near the western landing place at Aneir at the southern end of Mingulay Bay , which may have been a stone circle . In 1971 a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old Iron Age midden was found resting on sand near the ‘ Village ’ overlooking the Bay . A stone ' pebble hammer ' was discovered nearby in 1975 , but it has not been possible to date the find . <unk> may also contain Iron Age remains . 
 = = Name = = 
 In historic times the Hebrides have been heavily influenced by Celtic , Norse and Scots culture and this is evident in the variety of names the isle possesses . " Mingulay " is derived from <unk> @-@ ay , the Old Norse for " Big Island " although this is misleading as it is only the second largest of the Barra Isles behind Vatersay , which is lower lying and appears smaller from the sea . Miughalaigh and <unk> are two variants of the Gaelic name . Lowland Scots speakers in their turn have variously described the island as " <unk> " or " <unk> " ( which are both approximations of the Gaelic pronunciation ) , " <unk> " and " <unk> " before finally settling on the current variant . 
 Murray ( 1973 ) states that the name “ appropriately means Bird Island ” . 
 = = History and culture = = 
 = = = Christianity , Norsemen and Clan MacNeil = = = 
 There is little doubt that early Christianity influenced Mingulay ( for example the nearby islands of Pabbay and Berneray both have cross @-@ inscribed slabs ) but no direct evidence has yet been found . From circa 871 onwards Viking raids on the Outer Hebrides gathered pace but similarly the Viking graves found on Berneray and Vatersay are not replicated on Mingulay and whilst there are no definite indications of Norse settlement , their presence on the island is confirmed by the many features they named . 
 From the 12th century onwards Norse power in the Western Isles weakened , and by 1266 they reverted to Scots ' control under the tutelage of the Lords of the Isles . By 1427 Clan MacNeil of Barra had emerged as the dominant local power ; they adopted the cliffs of <unk> as part of their traditional crest and used the name as a war @-@ cry . 
 The islanders ' livelihood was based on fishing ( for white fish , herring and lobster ) , crofting ( with up to 55 ha ( 0 @.@ 21 sq mi ) of arable and pasture land fertilised by <unk> on which sheep , cattle , ponies , pigs and poultry were kept ) and very dependent on the bounty provided by seabirds . For example , rent was payable to The MacNeil in <unk> or ‘ <unk> ’ - shearwater chicks . 
 The Reformation never reached the south of the Outer Hebrides and Roman Catholicism held sway from the 12th century to the early 20th . The lack of a resident priest meant that services were often organised by the lay community , but the local culture and traditions of songs and story @-@ telling were rich and varied . As Samuel Johnson observed when lamenting his failure to reach thus far on his 18th @-@ century Hebridean journey : 
 Popery is favourable to ceremony ; and among the ignorant nations ceremony is the only preservative of tradition . Since Protestantism was extended to the savage parts of Scotland , it has perhaps been one of the chief labours of the Ministers to abolish stated observances , because they continued the remembrance of the former religion . 
 Some of the local beliefs were perhaps less welcome to the practitioners of organised religion . An each @-@ uisge was thought to live in a bottomless well near the summit of Macphee ’ s Hill , and faery <unk> and their associated music were taken for granted , if generally avoided . The curative powers of the seventh son of a seventh son were assumed to be sufficient for the treatment of diseases as serious as tuberculosis . Yet the old ways themselves were dying . 
 = = = Absentee landlords = = = 
 The Barra estates of MacNeil ( including all the Barra Isles ) were sold to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack of consideration for his tenants during the potato famines was matched by his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms . However , the Highland Clearances seemed to have the effect of increasing Mingulay ’ s population as families evicted from Barra sometimes chose to re @-@ settle there rather than take the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia . In this regard Mingulay 's remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were actually reduced from 1840 – 45 . In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty @-@ four year period of tenure . 
 In 1764 the population of the island was 52 . Later census records show that there were 113 residents in 1841 , 150 in 1881 , 142 in 1891 ( occupying 28 houses , compared to the 1841 total of 19 ) , and 135 in 1901 . Families were often large , and ten or more children was not uncommon , three generations sometimes sharing a single small house . Life was co @-@ operative with fishing , <unk> , peat cutting and landing the boats all being communal activities . The island is remote but was by no means cut off . In the 19th century fishermen sold fish in Glasgow and Ireland , both men and women worked on the east coast herring fishing industry , and food was brought in from mainland Scotland on a regular basis . 
 At the height of Village life there was a mill , a chapel house consisting of a church and a priest 's residence , and a school . However , despite there being a continuous population on Mingulay for at least two thousand years , evacuations began in 1907 and the island was completely abandoned by its residents in 1912 . 
 = = = Evacuation = = = 
 There were numerous reasons for the evacuation . In 1897 a boat from the neighbouring island of Pabbay was lost off Barra Head with its crew of five : more than half of Pabbay 's male population , and this did not encourage confidence amongst the fishermen of Mingulay . The lack of a sheltered landing meant that the island could be unreachable for weeks at a time , and loading and unloading goods was at best strenuous and at worst hazardous . This may have meant less at a time when possessions were fewer , but no doubt the population was also increasingly aware of their relative isolation . Writing about the collapse of similar populations in the Hebrides , Neat ( 2000 ) suggests : 
 one common thread would appear to be the unwillingness of even the most stoical and historically @-@ aware communities to continue an existence based upon endless physical hardship when the opportunity of an easier livelihood elsewhere is there to be taken . 
 Buxton ( 1995 ) tells the story of two men who left Mingulay together . One was visiting Barra , the other intended to emigrate to New York . They said their farewells in Castlebay but it did not work out for the latter and he returned from the United States three months later . To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again , who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because of adverse sea conditions . Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders . 
 The ferocity of the weather should not be underestimated . In 1868 a huge wave washed over the top of Geirum Mor , taking the sheep with it . The summit of the islet is 51 metres ( 170 ft ) above sea level . Fraser Darling and Boyd ( 1969 ) also speculate about the " quiet failure " of the populations of small islands like Mingulay to husband their available natural resources . Certainly the population began to exceed the carrying capacity of the land . The Congested Districts Board installed a derrick to assist with the landings at Aneir at the south end of the Bay in 1901 , but the design was flawed and its failure was a further disappointment . 
 In July 1906 grazing land on Vatersay was raided by landless cottars from Barra and its isles , including three families from Mingulay . They were followed in 1907 by eight more raiders from Mingulay led by Micheal Neill <unk> . Lady Gordon Cathcart took legal action but the visiting judge took the view that she had neglected her duties as a landowner and that " long indifference to the necessities of the cottars had gone far to drive them to exasperation " . Vatersay has sheltered anchorages and was only 300 metres ( 330 yd ) from Barra ( until the construction of a causeway in 1990 ) and Neil MacPhee wrote " it is better a thousand times to die here than to go through the same hardships which were our lot " on Mingulay . 
 In November 1907 six more families consisting of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on <unk> , which has a sheltered beach . Meanwhile , the plight of the Vatersay raiders had been raised at Westminster . Despite considerable public sympathy they were eventually sentenced to two months in prison . Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay with the aim of providing new crofts . By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay families living there . Only six families remained on Mingulay itself , and all of them planned to leave . 
 By 1910 there were only a dozen fishermen in six families living there , and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned . Some may have wished to stay , but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school , which had closed in April 1910 , would have been a factor . There is also no doubt that the parish priest , Donald Martin , encouraged the desertion . It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there , nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits . 
 Mingulay bears similarities to the island of Hirta , which was also evacuated in 1930 , Mingulay is sometimes referred to as the " near St Kilda " . Mingulay is less than a third of the distance from " The Long Island " that Hirta is , yet a 19th @-@ century visitor commented that the former was " much more primitive than St Kilda , especially as regards the cottars ' and crofters ' houses " , suggesting that the lack of a permanent landing was of greater import than sheer distance . 
 = = = 1912 to the present day = = = 
 After the island was evacuated it was first tenanted and then purchased in 1919 by Jonathan MacLean from Barra . In 1930 it was sold to John Russell who had experience as a sheep farmer in both Australia and Montana . Russell was clearly a man who liked his own company , choosing to live on the island alone all autumn and winter with his pet ferrets and cats , and joined by two shepherds for the spring and summer only . After seven years he sold up to Peggy Greer , a farmer from Essex who visited only rarely and let the <unk> out to local farmers . In 1951 she attempted to sell the island herself , but without success until 1955 when a local crofters ' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles <unk> Company completed the purchase . The advent of motor boats made stocking the islands considerably easier and the company ’ s ownership continued for the next forty years . 
 In 2000 Mingulay was acquired by the National Trust for Scotland through a bequest by J. M. <unk> “ to provide an area of natural beauty in memory of her parents and the courage of her late brother , Bernard . ” 
 Only two buildings survive on the island : the schoolhouse and the chapel house , although the latter has recently lost its roof and front wall . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 Mingulay has a large seabird population , and is an important breeding ground for razorbills ( 9 @,@ 514 pairs , 6 @.@ 3 % of the European population ) , guillemots ( 11 @,@ 063 pairs ) and black @-@ legged kittiwakes ( 2 @,@ 939 pairs ) . shags ( 694 individuals ) , fulmar ( 11 @,@ 626 pairs ) , puffins ( 2 @,@ 072 pairs ) , storm petrel , common terns , Arctic terns , bonxies and various species of gull also nest in the sea @-@ cliffs . Manx shearwaters nested on <unk> stack until the late 18th century , when they were driven away by puffins , and tysties have also been recorded there . 
 Sheep graze the island ’ s rough pastures and there is a population of rabbits , introduced by shepherds after the 1912 evacuation . Grey seals are abundant , numbers having grown substantially since the departure of human residents . Although they do not breed , up to 1 @,@ 000 make use of the beach in winter . 
 The flora of the island is typical of the Outer Hebrides with heather , sphagnum moss , sedges , grass and bracken predominating . There is but a single tree – a 2 @-@ metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay . Sea holly , otherwise rare in the Western Isles , has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century , and sea <unk> , normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure . In spring and summer there are <unk> of wild flowers around the deserted Village . 
 Mingulay and nearby Berneray became a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1983 .

 The island attracts regular visits from naturalists and in recent years has also become popular with rock climbers . The National Trust for Scotland operates two licensed boatmen from Barra and further information may be available at the tourist office in Castlebay . 
 There is an ‘ occasional ’ anchorage in Mingulay Bay sheltered from westerly winds . Landing on the beach may be difficult as there is a regular heavy swell and approaching the old landing place at Aneir may be easier . There is also a landing place at <unk> .

 The haunting " Mingulay Boat Song " was composed by Hugh S. Roberton , the founder of the Glasgow Orpheus Choir , in 1938 , and first recorded by the Francis <unk> family of Ulster . Written in the style of Hebridean work songs to the tune Creag <unk> from Lochaber , it invites the listener to imagine the <unk> of the island singing in time to the pulling of their oars . 
 Chorus 
 Heel ya 'ho boys , let her go , boys 
 Bring her head round now all together 
 Heel ya 'ho boys , let her go boys 
 Sailing homeward to Mingulay ! 
 What care we tho ' white the Minch is 
 What care we for wind and weather ? 
 Let her go boys , every inch is 
 Wearing homeward to Mingulay ! 
 Chorus 
 Wives are waiting on the bank , boys , 
 Looking seaward from the heather . 
 Pull her ' round boys , and we 'll anchor 
 <unk> the sun sets at Mingulay ! 
 Chorus . 
 It has been recorded by numerous artists including Robin Hall and Jimmy MacGregor in 1971 , The <unk> and Richard Thompson in 2006 . The lyrics have also been variously interpreted . For example , Hall and MacGregor 's 1961 version has a female vocalist ( Shirley Bland ) rendering the third stanza as : 
 We are waiting by the harbour , 
 Weeping , waiting since break of day @-@ o . 
 We are waiting by the harbour , 
 As the sun sets on Mingulay . 
 Although the fame of the song means that it is one of the few things popularly associated with the island and it is evocative of island life , it was never sung by its residents , having been composed long after the evacuation . 
 Other songs composed by or about residents of the island survive . These include " Oran do dh <unk> <unk> " ( Song to the Isle of Mingulay ) written by Neil MacPhee the <unk> raider ( see above ) , after the abandonment of the island , and " <unk> Neill a <unk> " ( Neil 's Trip to Mingulay ) written by Father Allan MacLean ( known locally as the " Curate of Spain " having attended the Scots College in Valladolid ) , possibly during the period 1837 – 40 when he lived on Barra . Songs and oral tradition relating to Mingulay are discussed in Liza Storey 's Miughalaigh ( 2008 ) .

 = Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering = 
 Established in 1908 , the Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University in State College , Pennsylvania , is the oldest industrial engineering department in the world . According to the most recent U.S. News & World Report university rankings , the undergraduate program is ranked eighth in the United States and the graduate program 12th . The department is headed by Janis P. <unk> , the Peter and Angela Dal <unk> Chair , and is housed in the Leonhard Building in the West Campus area of University Park . Named for alumnus Harold Marcus and his wife Inge , the department employs 31 faculty members who serve approximately 200 graduate and 400 undergraduate students . 
 = = History = = 
 At the turn of the 20th century , Penn State had developed a national reputation for its engineering curriculum , but industrial engineering was only beginning to emerge as an academic discipline . Noted efficiency expert Frederick Taylor recommended that university president James A. Beaver hire Hugo Diemer , a professor from the University of Kansas , in the hope that Diemer would create an industrial engineering curriculum at Penn State . A two @-@ year option was ready by 1908 , and a four @-@ year bachelor 's degree program emerged the following year , the first of its kind in the world . At the time , courses consisted of modern industrial engineering fundamentals such as time and motion study , plant layout optimization , and engineering economics , in addition to courses on advertising and sales . The new department also took over the instruction of manual shop skills , including carpentry and metalworking . 
 At the time , the department did not have its own building , and for many years shared building space with other departments in the university 's College of Engineering . In the 1980s , members of the Penn State Board of Trustees began to consider expanding the campus toward the west , and by 1987 , initial plans to construct a new engineering building were in place . The board funded the project in 1995 amid concerns of damaging the aesthetics of the previously undeveloped western edge of campus . Some trustees disapproved of the building design , but the board ultimately released $ 5 million from its fund dedicated to expanding west campus . In 1998 , the project received additional funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . The building opened in 2000 and was named after William E. Leonhard , a 1936 Penn State College of Engineering alumnus who , with his wife , has donated in excess of $ 1 million toward engineering at Penn State . In 1999 , the department itself was named after alumnus Harold Marcus and his wife Inge , who donated $ 5 million to the department . 
 In 2005 , the department restructured the undergraduate industrial engineering curriculum for the first time in 21 years . Shifting its focus somewhat from its traditional manufacturing emphasis , the new curriculum introduced several courses related to the service industry . Four key research areas emerged : Human Factors ; Manufacturing ; Operations Research ; and Production , Supply Chain , and Service Engineering . 
 = = Academics = = 
 The department is recognized as one of the country 's premier industrial engineering departments . The 2014 U.S. News & World Report undergraduate program rankings placed the department eighth in the country , and the graduate program was ranked as tenth . Twenty @-@ nine full @-@ time faculty currently serve nearly 200 graduate and 400 undergraduate students . 
 At the undergraduate level , students can pursue a Bachelor of Science ( B.S. ) degree in industrial engineering . The first two years of the program consist primarily of general engineering courses , including math and science . Once these introductory courses are complete , students begin taking industrial engineering courses on topics such as engineering economy , manufacturing technology , statistics , work design , and operations research . Undergraduates are also permitted to pursue an approved minor and count three of the credits earned toward their industrial engineering degree . 
 Graduate students have a greater variety of options . The Master of Science ( M.S. ) degree is available through both a traditional thesis track , or a one @-@ year non @-@ thesis track . Options in manufacturing engineering , human factors / ergonomics engineering , and quality engineering are available for M.S. candidates . Furthermore , dual M.S. degrees in industrial engineering and operations research are offered . 
 At the Ph.D. level , students may pursue an industrial engineering degree , a dual @-@ degree in industrial engineering and operations research , or a degree in industrial engineering with a minor in operations research . Emphasis areas available to students pursuing the doctoral degree are Human Factors / <unk> , Manufacturing , Operations Research , and Production , Logistics , and Service Systems . 
 In addition to the study abroad opportunities available to all engineering students at Penn State , the industrial engineering department offers study abroad programs specifically for industrial engineering students .

Another former faculty member , Benjamin W. <unk> , authored an introductory industrial engineering textbook , served as department head , and in 1976 won the IIE Frank and Lillian Gilbreth Award . 
 = Battle of Great Bridge = 
 The Battle of Great Bridge was fought December 9 , 1775 , in the area of Great Bridge , Virginia , early in the American Revolutionary War . The victory by Continental Army and militia forces led to the departure of Governor Lord Dunmore and any remaining vestiges of British power from the Colony of Virginia during the early days of the conflict . 
 Following increasing political and military tensions in early 1775 , both Dunmore and rebellious Whig leaders recruited troops and engaged in a struggle for available military supplies . The struggle eventually focused on Norfolk , where Dunmore had taken refuge aboard a Royal Navy vessel . Dunmore 's forces had fortified one side of a critical river crossing south of Norfolk at Great Bridge , while Whig forces had occupied the other side . In an attempt to break up the Whig gathering , Dunmore ordered an attack across the bridge , which was decisively repulsed . William Woodford , the Whig commander at the battle , described it as " a second Bunker 's Hill affair " . 
 Shortly thereafter , Norfolk , at the time a Tory center , was abandoned by Dunmore and the Tories , who fled to navy ships in the harbor . Whig @-@ occupied Norfolk was destroyed on January 1 , 1776 in an action begun by Dunmore and completed by Whig forces . 
 = = Background = = 
 Tensions in the British Colony of Virginia were raised in April 1775 at roughly the same time that the hostilities of the American Revolutionary War broke out in the Province of Massachusetts Bay with the Battles of Lexington and Concord . Rebellious Whigs in control of the provincial assembly had begun recruiting troops in March 1775 , leading to a struggle for control of the colony 's military supplies . Under orders from John Murray , 4th Earl of Dunmore , the royal governor of Virginia , British troops removed gunpowder from the colonial storehouse in Williamsburg , alarming the Whigs that dominated the colonial legislature . Although the incident was resolved without violence , Dunmore , fearing for his personal safety , left Williamsburg in June 1775 and placed his family on board a Royal Navy ship . A small British fleet then took shape at Norfolk , a port town whose merchants had significant Loyalist ( Tory ) tendencies . The threat posed by the British fleet may also have played a role in minimizing Whig activity in the town . 
 Incidents continued between Whigs on one side and Tories on the other until October , when Dunmore had acquired enough military support to begin operations against the rebellious Whigs . General Thomas Gage , the British commander @-@ in @-@ chief for North America , had ordered small detachments of the 14th Regiment of Foot to Virginia in response to pleas by Dunmore for military help . These troops began raiding surrounding counties for rebel military supplies on October 12 . This activity continued through the end of October , when a small British ship ran aground and was captured by Whigs during a skirmish near Hampton . Navy boats sent to punish the townspeople were repulsed by Continental Army troops and militia in a brief gunfight that resulted in the killing and capture of several sailors . Dunmore reacted to this event by issuing a proclamation on November 7 in which he declared martial law , and offered to emancipate Whig @-@ held slaves in Virginia willing to serve in the British Army . The proclamation alarmed Tory and Whig slaveholders alike , concerned by the idea of armed former slaves and the potential loss of their property . Nevertheless , Dunmore was able to recruit enough slaves to form the Ethiopian Regiment , as well as raising a company of Tories he called the Queen 's Own Loyal Virginia Regiment . These local forces supplemented the two companies of the 14th Foot that were the sole British military presence in the colony . This successful recruiting drive prompted Dunmore to write on November 30 , 1775 that he would soon be able to " reduce this colony to a proper sense of their duty . " 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Lord Dunmore had , on arrival in Norfolk , ordered the fortification of the bridge across the Elizabeth River , about 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of Norfolk in the village of Great Bridge . The bridge formed a natural defense point since it was on the only road leading south from Norfolk toward North Carolina , it was bordered on both sides by the Great Dismal Swamp , and the access to the bridge on both sides was via narrow causeways . Dunmore sent 25 men of the 14th Foot to the bridge , where they erected a small stockade fort they called Fort Murray on the Norfolk side of the bridge . They also removed the bridge planking to make crossing it more difficult . The fort was armed with two cannons and several smaller swivel guns . The men of the 14th were augmented by small companies from the Ethiopian and Queen 's Own regiments , bringing the garrison size to between 40 and 80 men . 
 In response to Dunmore 's proclamation , Virginia 's assembly ordered its troops to march on Norfolk . William Woodford , the colonel leading the Continental Army 's 2nd Virginia Regiment , advanced toward the bridge with his regiment of 400 and about 100 riflemen from the Culpeper Minutemen . On December 2 they arrived at the bridge and set up a camp across the bridge from the British fort . Upon their arrival the British set about destroying buildings near the fort to ensure a clear field of fire . Woodford was at first unwilling to assault the British position , due to a lack of cannons and an overly generous estimate of the garrison 's strength . He therefore began entrenching the position on his side of the bridge , while more and more militia companies arrived from the surrounding counties and North Carolina . Some cannons eventually arrived with a contingent of North Carolina men , but they were useless because they lacked mountings and carriages . Woodford also became concerned when he heard rumors that a large number of Scottish Highlanders had joined Dunmore 's forces . The rumors were partly true : the Highlanders were in fact 120 families , but few of the men were skilled at arms . By December 8 , the force in the Whig camp had grown to nearly 900 , with more than 700 fit for duty . 
 Dunmore learned that the Whigs had acquired cannons , but was unaware they were inoperable . Concerned for the safety of the garrison , he decided an attack on the Whig position was necessary . His plan called for a diversionary attack by the Ethiopian companies of the garrison at a spot downriver from the bridge to draw the Whigs ' attention , while the garrison , reinforced by additional troops from Norfolk , would attack across the bridge in the early morning light . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Dunmore 's best intelligence had informed him that Whig forces numbered about 400 . On the night and morning of December 8 and 9 Captain Samuel Leslie led the reinforcements down to Fort Murray , arriving around 3 : 00 am . Upon his arrival he learned that the Ethiopian detachment intended for the diversion was not in the fort . They had been dispatched on a routine deployment to another nearby crossing , and Dunmore had failed to send orders ensuring their availability for the operation . Leslie decided to proceed with the attack anyway . After resting his troops until a little before dawn , he sent men out to replace the bridge planking . Once this was finished , Captain Charles Fordyce led a company of 60 grenadiers across the bridge . They briefly skirmished with Whig sentries , raising the alarm in the camp beyond the entrenchments . Fordyce 's men were then joined by a company of navy gunners who had been brought along to operate the field artillery for the attack , while the Tory companies arrayed themselves on the Norfolk side of the bridge . 
 The Whig leadership in the camp at first thought the early skirmishing was a typical morning salute , and paid it little heed . Shortly after reveille , the severity of the alarm became apparent . While the camp mobilized , a Whig company numbering about sixty prepared for the British advance behind the earthworks . They carefully withheld fire until the grenadiers , advancing with bayonets fixed , were within 50 yards ( 46 m ) , and then unleashed a torrent of fire on the British column . Fordyce , leading the column , went down in a hail of musket fire just steps from the earthworks along with many of the men in the front ranks . The British advance dissolved as the Whig musket fire continued ; about half of Fordyce 's force was killed , and many were injured . The navy gunners provided covering fire as they retreated back across the bridge , but their small cannons made no impression on the earthworks . 
 Colonel Woodford had by this time organized the forces in the Whig camp , and they marched out to face the British . After an inconsequential exchange of musket fire at long range , Woodford sent the riflemen of the Culpeper Minutemen off to the left . From this position the riflemen , whose weapons had a much longer range than muskets , began to fire on the British position on the far side of the bridge . The navy gunners , with the only weapons the British had available to contest the riflemen at that range , were now out of position , and were also being threatened by the large Whig force approaching the earthworks . They spiked their guns and retreated across the bridge , and Captain Leslie ordered his men to retreat into Fort Murray . In some 25 minutes , Dunmore 's attempt to stop the Patriot buildup near Norfolk had been emphatically turned back . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following a truce to permit the British to remove their dead and wounded , the Tory forces sneaked out in the night to return to Norfolk . Captain Fordyce was buried with full military honors by the Whigs near the site of the battle . Casualty estimates ranged from Dunmore 's official report of 62 killed or wounded to an escaped patriot 's report that the British losses totaled 102 , excluding militia casualties . The only claimed Whig casualty was one man with a slight wound to the thumb . 
 The Whigs were then reinforced by the arrival of troops from North Carolina under Colonel Robert Howe . Dunmore blamed Leslie for his decision to attack without the accompanying diversion , although the outcome of the battle may not have been different even with the diversion , given the disparity in force sizes . In the following days , Dunmore and his Tory supporters took refuge on ships of the Royal Navy , and Norfolk was occupied by the victorious Whig forces . The danger Dunmore posed to the rebel cause , however , had not been eliminated . General George Washington , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Continental Army and a Virginian who knew Dunmore well , wrote a letter to Charles Lee in late December , warning of continued danger despite Dunmore 's flight to the navy . He told Lee that " if that Man is not crushed before Spring , he will become the most formidable Enemy America has " , and that " nothing less than depriving him of life or liberty will secure peace to Virginia . " 
 After a series of escalations over the Whig refusal to allow provisions to be delivered to the overcrowded vessels , Dunmore and Commodore Henry Pellow decided to bombard the town . On January 1 , 1776 , Norfolk was destroyed in action begun by Royal Navy ships and their landing parties , but completed by Whig troops that continued to loot and burn the former Tory stronghold . 
 Lord Dunmore occupied Portsmouth in February 1776 , and used it as a base for raiding operations until late March , when General Charles Lee successfully forced him back to the fleet . After further raiding operations in the Chesapeake , Dunmore and the British fleet left for New York City in August 1776 . Dunmore never returned to Virginia . 
 A highway marker was placed by the state of Virginia in 1934 near the battle site . In response to construction threats to the battlefield , local citizens organized in 1999 to preserve the area . 
 = Scotiabank Saddledome = 
 The Scotiabank Saddledome is the primary indoor arena of Calgary , Alberta , Canada . 
 Located on the Stampede Grounds , on the southeast end of downtown Calgary , the Saddledome was built in 1983 to replace the Stampede Corral as the home of the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League , and to host ice hockey and figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics . Today the arena is also home to the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League and the Calgary Roughnecks of the National Lacrosse League . 
 The facility also hosts concerts , conferences and other sporting championships , and events for the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede . It underwent a major renovation in 1994 – 95 and sold its naming rights , during which its original name of Olympic Saddledome was changed to Canadian Airlines Saddledome . The facility was given the name Pengrowth Saddledome in 2000 , after Pengrowth Management Ltd. signed a ten @-@ year agreement . It adopted its current name in October 2010 as Scotiabank signed on as title sponsor . 
 The Saddledome is owned by the City of Calgary who leased it to the Saddledome Foundation , a non @-@ profit organization , to oversee its operation . It is currently managed by the Calgary Flames . 
 The Saddledome was damaged during the 2013 Alberta floods but was repaired and reopened in time for the 2013 – 14 NHL season . 
 = = Calgary Stampede = = 
 Calgary had been served for 30 years by the Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980 . With a total capacity of 8 @,@ 700 , the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950 , but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s . The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League ( NHL ) in 1977 , leading the World Hockey Association 's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope to be a team selected to merge with the NHL . 
 Calgary 's bid to host the 1988 Winter Olympics , coupled with the arrival of the Flames , drove the need to build a new arena . City Council debated the merits of several locations for the city 's new Olympic Coliseum , and narrowed their choices down to two areas in the Victoria Park neighbourhood on the east end of downtown . Two other sites , one on the west end of downtown , and a late bid by several businessmen pushing to build the arena in the northern suburb of Airdrie were also considered . 
 The Victoria Park Community Association fought the bid to build the arena in their neighborhood , threatening to oppose the city 's Olympic bid if necessary . City Council voted on March 3 , 1981 to build the proposed 20 @,@ 000 seat arena on the Stampede grounds , immediately east of the Corral and south of Victoria Park . The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land to allow for the new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction . In a bid to end the battle , Mayor Ralph Klein asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval . The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations , allowing construction to begin . The following day , on July 29 , 1981 , builders began construction of the arena . The International Olympic Committee was impressed that the project was underway , as noted in the XV Olympic Winter Games official report which stated " The fact that this facility was already being built added credibility to ( Calgary 's ) bid and proved to be a positive factor in demonstrating Calgary 's commitment to hosting the Games " . 
 The facility was designed by Graham McCourt Architects . While they set out to design a unique building , the idea of a western theme never occurred to Barry Graham or his team . The roof of the building was designed to be a reverse hyperbolic paraboloid , allowing for a pillar free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by up to one @-@ third when compared to traditional arenas , resulting in reduced heating , lighting and maintenance costs , plus the floating roof can flex to compensate for the city 's frequent temperature fluctuations . When the design was unveiled , the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle @-@ shaped . Of 1 @,@ 270 entries submitted in a contest to name the arena , 735 involved the word Saddle . The winning name in the contest , Olympic Saddledome , was drawn from a hat filled with several similar saddle @-@ themed names . At the time the name received a tepid reception from some , including the chairman of Calgary 's Olympic Organizing Committee ( OCO ) , Frank King , who was quoted as saying " It is neither Olympic nor western , and it 's not even dome " . 
 The designers won several architectural and engineering awards for their work on the Saddledome , and were honoured by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada at its millennium celebration of architecture in 2000 . As of 2008 , the Saddledome was still reported as the world record holder for the longest spanning hyperbolic paraboloid concrete shell . The Saddledome was featured on the cover of Time Magazine on September 27 , 1987 , for an article discussing the city of Calgary and the upcoming 1988 Olympics . 
 The location of the Saddledome within Stampede Park allows for easy access to Calgary 's C @-@ Train light rail transit system via the Victoria Park / Stampede station that stands parallel to Macleod Trail . The C @-@ Train station , BMO Centre , Stampede Corral and Saddledome are all connected via a Plus 15 pedestrian skyway . Direct vehicle access is gained from the north via 5th Street East or Olympic Way . 
 = = History = = 
 The arena was initially projected to cost $ 60 million to build , and later revised to over $ 80 million . Attempts to fast track construction resulted in a $ 16 million cost overrun , resulting in a final cost of $ 97 @.@ 7 million and an eight @-@ month delay in its completion . Builders faced delays while building the roof as numerous adjustments were required to fit the giant concrete slabs between the array of cables that held them in place . Upset with the excess cost , opposition politicians in Alberta demanded a public hearing into the issue . A hearing conducted by the city placed much of the blame on the project manager , while the city and province were required to pay the additional costs . 
 When it opened on October 15 , 1983 , the Olympic Saddledome served to boost the morale of a city that was experiencing a significant downturn as a result of the international oil market collapse , high interest rates , and the federal government 's National Energy Policy . During the first event , an NHL game between the Flames and the Edmonton Oilers , the standard of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was the first thing booed by a population upset with the government 's policies . The Oilers defeated the Flames 4 – 3 in front of a sold out crowd of nearly 17 @,@ 000 fans . 
 The initial seating capacity was 16 @,@ 605 for hockey as the upper loges were not immediately completed . As the Olympics neared , the Calgary organizing committee spent $ 1 million to add over 2 @,@ 600 seats to the upper loges in a bid to alleviate a scandal that resulted from the organizing committee giving its partners and sponsors preferential treatment in ticket sales . With a capacity of 20 @,@ 016 , the International Ice Hockey Federation noted that it was the largest arena ever used at the Winter Games , and called the facility " the finest international rink in the world " The International Olympic Committee praised the city 's commitment to hosting the Olympics , noting in its official report that constructing the arena prior to being awarded the Games lent credibility to Calgary 's bid and positively influenced voters . The Saddledome was the first arena in North America designed to accommodate the larger international ice surface ( international rinks are 13 feet wider than NHL rinks ) . The Saddledome reached its highest capacity in the early ' 90s at 20 @,@ 230 . 
 The Flames petitioned the City of Calgary and the Saddledome Foundation to upgrade the facility in 1994 , requesting renovations to add additional luxury boxes and a new club section . The Flames insisted the upgrades were necessary for the team to remain viable in the arena . They argued it was important that their landlord bring the arena up to the higher standards they felt was required . The team lobbied City Council in the hope it would agree to fund the majority of the $ 18 million renovation using federal infrastructure funds . At the same time , they rejected a counter proposal for applying a ticket surcharge to pay the cost . Media reports claimed the team was considering relocating out of Calgary if council did not agree . Flames ' owners denied the reports , but said they had threatened to build a new rink elsewhere in the city . City Council supported the Flames ' proposal in a 9 – 6 vote following several months of negotiations . 
 Renovations occurred between 1994 and 1995 and saw the addition of 41 new luxury suites at the top of the lower bowl , an 1 @,@ 172 seat club section , a new restaurant , expanded offices for the Flames , Saddledome management and Hockey Canada , as well as a significant restructuring of the public concourse and a new <unk> structure . The arena remained operational until the spring of 1995 despite ongoing construction , but was closed entirely between April and October 1995 . The Saddledome officially re @-@ opened on October 25 , 1995 for the Flames ' first home game of the 1995 – 96 NHL season . 
 Prior to its re @-@ opening , the Flames signed a deal with Canadian Airlines to rename the facility . Under a twenty @-@ year agreement worth approximately $ 1 million per year , the arena became the Canadian Airlines Saddledome . Removing the " Olympic " moniker was controversial with both the public and City Council , though the city voted in favour of the deal which included the donation of a portion of the naming rights to fund amateur sports within the city . The arena was renamed again in 2000 when Canadian Airlines was acquired by Air Canada and ceased operations . Pengrowth Management Ltd. signed a ten @-@ year agreement that gave the facility the name of Pengrowth Saddledome . 
 The arena has received cosmetic upgrades in recent years . In 2004 , the Flames spent $ 1 million on a LED " power ring " display that lines the facing of the second level . The JumboTron that was installed in 1995 was replaced in 2006 with a new high definition scoreboard . Manufactured by Daktronics , the display has twelve screens and two LED ribbons , and is called the <unk> Energy Board .

 The Saddledome was one of many buildings impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods . The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city , including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located . The event level of the arena was filled with water , while the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were swamped . At a press conference held on June 22 , 2013 , team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a " total loss " . He added that the team 's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed , but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the 2013 – 14 Calgary Flames season . Repairs to the facility forced the cancellation of all concerts and agricultural events scheduled for the 2013 Calgary Stampede . 
 Crews worked around the clock to repair the facility ; Saddledome director of building operations Robert Blanchard estimated that 650 @,@ 000 man hours of work was performed on the facility and noted that they had compressed a six @-@ month project into two . The facility was granted its occupancy permit in late August , and the first event following the Saddledome 's re @-@ opening was an Eagles concert on September 11 . The first hockey game was September 14 , a Flames pre @-@ season contest . 
 = = Events = = 
 As the home of the Flames , the Saddledome hosted the 1985 NHL All @-@ Star Game , and the 2000 NHL Entry Draft . The Flames have played three Stanley Cup Finals series in the Saddledome : 1986 , 1989 and 2004 . The arena is also the home of the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) . The Hitmen won the President 's Trophy in 1999 before a WHL playoff record crowd of 17 @,@ 139 . Playing in the largest arena in the WHL , the Hitmen also hold league records for overall attendance ( 362 @,@ 227 in 2004 – 05 ) , as well as single game ( 19 @,@ 305 in 2007 – 08 ) . The Saddledome is also the home of the Calgary Roughnecks of the National Lacrosse League ( NLL ) and hosted the 2005 NLL All @-@ Star Game . It has twice hosted the NLL Champion 's Cup game : 2004 and 2009 , both Calgary victories . The stadium was one of the venues for the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships . 
 The opening of the Saddledome allowed Calgary to play host to major musical acts that were bypassing the city in the early 1980s , because the city 's existing facilities were not large enough to accommodate the industry 's top performers . 
 The Moody Blues were the first musical act to appear with Stevie Ray Vaughan opening , in November 1983 , while Rod Stewart has made the most appearances in the Dome , 11 . Many other top acts have made stops in the Saddledome , however the inability of the roof to support the massive light , speaker and special effect rigs that some performers currently use has led the city to again be bypassed for some major tours . 
 In addition to hockey and figure skating at the 1988 Olympics , the Saddledome has been the site of numerous major national and international events . The facility has hosted Brier , the Canadian men 's curling championship , on four occasions ( 1997 , 2002 , 2009 and 2015 ) . It also hosted the women 's championship , the Tournament of Hearts in 1995 . The 2006 World Figure Skating Championships was also held in the arena . The WWF pay @-@ per @-@ view event In Your House 16 : Canadian Stampede was also held at the Saddledome in July 1997 . Among non @-@ sporting events , the Saddledome most recently hosted a public address by the Dalai Lama in 2009 that was attended by 15 @,@ 000 people . In 2005 , Queen Elizabeth II attended a celebration of Alberta 's centennial at the Saddledome . 
 It has also hosted PBR Bud Light Cup events ; in 1998 and 1999 the event was known as " Cody Snyder 's <unk> ' " , and in 2000 and 2001 the event was called the Professional Bull Riders Canadian Open . The Saddledome has also been a host for PBR Canada events . 
 = = Amenities = = 
 The Saddledome seats 19 @,@ 289 for hockey and lacrosse , with different capacities for other events depending on the arena 's configuration . It has 72 luxury suites , 41 of which were constructed at the top of the lower bowl in 1995 and 31 were constructed at the top of the second level when the facility was built . There are also six party suites on the corners of the upper loges that are rented on an event by event basis . Sections 115 through 122 of the lower bowl form the Chrysler Club and offers in @-@ seat concession service at Flames games . 
 The Chrysler Club features a private dining room available during Flames games , large concerts and private events . Dutton 's Canadian Lounge is a sports bar located at the west entrance to the building . There are three additional restaurants within the facility : The HSBC <unk> Restaurant , the Alumni Lounge and the King Club . The Iconic Platinum Club is a 188 @-@ seat executive club accessible with a purchased membership . It features a private bar and restaurant as well as a fully functional business centre . 
 = = Saddledome Foundation = = 
 The City of Calgary established the Saddledome Foundation in 1983 and leased the arena for 50 @-@ years to the non @-@ profit organization . Its mandate was to " oversee the operation in a manner that protects taxpayers and benefits amateur sports at the local , provincial and national level " . The foundation is made up of a board of nine directors : three appointed by the city , three appointed by the province , and one each appointed by the Calgary Olympic Development Association ( now <unk> Canada ) , Hockey Canada and the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede . The foundation contracted the Stampede to manage the arena , and through its lease agreements with the Stampede and the Flames , earned 15 % of gross concession sales , 50 % of net income from luxury suites and executive seating and investment income on the arena 's revenues . The Flames signed a 20 @-@ year lease in 1983 that earned them 70 % of advertising revenues and 90 % of ticket revenues . The Stampede earned 85 % of concession revenues and all revenue from parking . 
 As part of the 1994 deal with the city , the Flames bought out the Stampede 's contract for $ 20 million and took over management of the facility . While the city and Saddledome Foundation paid for the 1994 – 95 renovations , the new agreement required the Flames to pay for future arena maintenance and repairs , as well as any further renovations . The Flames agreed to manage the arena for 20 years and to contribute $ 14 @.@ 5 million toward amateur sport in the city over that time . The Saddledome Foundation retains the responsibility of distributing funds to amateur sport . From its inception through 2007 , it had allocated over $ 20 million toward this cause . 
 = = Future = = 
 The Saddledome is one of the oldest arenas in the NHL , fueling speculation that it is due to be replaced . Flames president and chief executive officer Ken King said in 2008 that plans for a new arena were " five to eight years away " creating the expectation that the team hoped to have a new arena built for when their lease was due to expire in 2014 , but such plans never came to fruition . Team chairman Murray Edwards argues that the ability of the facility to host major events and concerts are growing increasingly limited as the facility ages . Along with Edwards , sports financial analysts also note that newer arenas generate far more revenue for their teams than the Saddledome does for the Flames . 
 It is expected that any new arena would also be located either on the Stampede Grounds or elsewhere in downtown Calgary . While NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has lobbied on behalf of both the Flames and the Oilers for government support , Calgary mayor <unk> <unk> and alderman John Mar have stated their opposition using taxpayer money to help fund a new arena . King stated that the Flames have concepts and designs for a new building , but are not ready to release them . Some of the plans being considered for Stampede Park would include lowering the city 's C @-@ train light rail transit line below ground and run straight into a new facility . 
 A new arena is being proposed as part of <unk> — a sports complex which would be located in the western downtown area , and would include replacements for both the Saddledome and McMahon Stadium . 
 = California State Route 67 = 
 State Route 67 ( SR 67 ) is a state highway in San Diego County , California . It begins at Interstate 8 ( I @-@ 8 ) in El Cajon and continues to Lakeside as the San Vicente Freeway before becoming an undivided highway through the eastern part of Poway . In the town of Ramona , the route turns into Main Street before ending at SR 78 . SR 67 provides direct access from the city of San Diego to the East County region of San Diego County , including Ramona and Julian . 
 The route has existed as a railroad corridor since the turn of the 20th century . A highway known as the Julian road was built by 1913 , and was designated as Legislative Route 198 in the state highway system by 1935 . Route 198 was renumbered SR 67 in the 1964 state highway renumbering . A freeway south of Lakeside was built in the late 1960s , and opened to traffic in 1970 . Since then , the portion of the highway north of Lakeside has become known for a high number of traffic accidents and related fatalities . The California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) has made several attempts to remedy the problem and make the road safer . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 67 begins at I @-@ 8 in El Cajon ; known as the San Vicente Freeway , it turns north near the Westfield Parkway shopping center . There are two interchanges in the city of El Cajon : one with Broadway and Fletcher Parkway , and another with Bradley Avenue . Following this , the freeway leaves the El Cajon city limits , entering the city of Santee near Gillespie Field , before coming to an interchange with the eastern end of SR 52 in Santee . Near the Woodside Avenue exit , SR 67 turns northeast , paralleling the San Diego River and entering the unincorporated area of Eucalyptus Hills as it leaves the San Diego urban area . <unk> Road and Winter Gardens Boulevard have interchanges with SR 67 . 
 The freeway ends , and SR 67 turns north and becomes an undivided highway at Mapleview Street , crossing the San Diego River and entering the locale of Moreno . SR 67 then enters the rural area east of Sycamore Canyon County Open Space Preserve near the locale of Foster , passing to the west of San Vicente Reservoir . The road intersects the eastern end of Scripps Poway Parkway and County Route S4 ( CR S4 ) , the latter within the Poway city limits . In eastern Poway , SR 67 veers east , eventually leaving the city and entering unincorporated Rock Haven . The road continues near Rosemont before turning northeast and becoming Julian Road and then Main Street in downtown Ramona . SR 67 ends at the intersection with SR 78 ; SR 78 intersects to the northwest as Pine Street and continues northeast along Main Street towards Julian . 
 SR 67 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , but is not part of the National Highway System , a network of highways that are essential to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The route is named the CHP Officer Christopher D. Lydon Memorial Freeway from I @-@ 8 to Mapleview Street in Lakeside . In 2013 , SR 67 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 94 @,@ 000 between Broadway and Bradley Avenue ( the highest AADT for the highway ) , and 18 @,@ 100 between Rio Maria Road and Poway Road ( the lowest AADT for the highway ) .

 = = = Early days = = = 
 The " Julian road " had been constructed by 1872 , and was used for stagecoaches . In 1883 , The San Diego Union and Daily Bee described it as a " disgrace to the county . It could hardly be in a worse condition ... and should be repaired immediately . " On October 21 , 1885 , the county Board of Supervisors agreed to a realignment of the Julian road , in what was known as the Bernardo District , onto private property . The road was described in 1890 by The San Diego Union and Daily Bee as passing through farms , and the grade was " cut on the west side of the canyon and buttressed with granite the greater part of the way . " The route continued towards Ramona through vineyards , passing by more boulders . 
 Between 1885 and 1891 , the San Diego , Cuyamaca , and Eastern Railroad was extended from San Diego through El Cajon to the town of Foster , northeast of Lakeside . In 1896 , the stagecoach line connected the terminus of the railroad line in Foster to Julian , and transported the San Diego newspapers to Ramona by 2 : 30 pm each day . The county began to survey a new routing of the Julian road in 1913 cutting through the El Monte Ranch , reducing the distance from San Diego to Julian by five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) and removing some steep grades . 
 Bidding was conducted on the Julian road , then known as Road No. 3A , on June 30 , 1920 ; however , progress on the grading of the road fell behind the county engineer 's expectations by October , with only 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) of the road complete . The road was paved from Santee to El Cajon by the end of 1920 . Between Foster and Julian , the paved road was opened in July 1922 , at a cost of $ 550 @,@ 000 ( about $ 45 @,@ 530 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) . The " Ramona Road " remained unpaved between the Mussey Grade and the road to Ballena , a distance of 20 miles ( 32 km ) , and the estimated cost of paving it was $ 400 @,@ 000 ( about $ 29 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) . In 1925 , there were 12 miles ( 19 km ) left of unpaved road between Ramona and Julian , and state and county taxes were to be used to fund this project . The Mussey Grade was completed in April 1925 , marking the completion of the paved road between San Diego and Ramona . 
 San Diego County declared the Julian road a county boulevard in 1926 , meaning that vehicles were required to stop before entering the highway . The road that would become SR 67 was added to the state highway system in 1933 , from El Cajon to near Santa Ysabel , and was designated as Route 198 in 1935 . It consisted of Maine and Woodside avenues in Lakeside and Magnolia Avenue in the city of El Cajon all the way to U.S. Route 80 ( US 80 ) at Main Street . Because of the construction of the San Vicente Reservoir north of Lakeside , a two @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) section of the road had to be submerged , and it was decided to relocate the road 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) further west by the foot of Mount Woodson . The road was allocated $ 830 @,@ 784 in funding ( about $ 37 @,@ 641 @,@ 062 in 2015 dollars ) to be realigned , widened , and repaved between Lakeside and Mount Woodson in 1942 . Grading and paving of the 11 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 18 @.@ 8 km ) part was scheduled for completion on December 15 , 1943 . 
 Funding was allocated for traffic signals on the portion between Main Street and Broadway in El Cajon in 1954 . Route 198 also extended onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR 94 . This portion was signed as Sign Route 67 by 1962 , from Campo Road to US 80 . In the 1964 state highway renumbering , Route 198 was renumbered as State Route 67 ; the portion south of I @-@ 8 was renumbered as SR 125 . 
 = = = Freeway construction = = = 
 The State Highway Commission decided to reroute SR 67 through Lakeside in 1954 , moving it closer to the San Diego River and away from the city center , using the land formerly occupied by the old railroad . In 1961 , the construction of the San Vicente Freeway was listed as a high @-@ priority project by the California Chamber of Commerce . During 1964 , the county of San Diego received $ 1 million ( about $ 16 million in 2015 dollars ) to construct SR 67 as a freeway from Pepper Drive to Broadway in the city of El Cajon . Another $ 1 million ( about $ 15 million in 2015 dollars ) was allocated in 1965 , and the project was extended to I @-@ 8 . The freeway from I @-@ 8 to Pepper Drive was complete by 1967 , when Caltrans announced that " yellow , non @-@ <unk> markers interspersed with raised yellow dots " would be installed on the freeway portion to delineate the shoulder ; this was the first section to use them in the county . By December 1968 , the freeway was complete from I @-@ 8 north to Woodside Avenue ; the grade at the northern end was smoothed out during the widening of the road in early 1970 . In March , the freeway was under construction from Woodside Avenue to the San Diego River , at a cost of $ 3 @.@ 2 million ( about $ 34 million in 2015 dollars ) . The freeway portion opened on October 12 , 1970 ; it was constructed four lanes wide . 
 It was planned that SR 67 would be the eastern terminus of SR 56 . On December 30 , 1980 , the City of Poway included SR 56 in the city plan extending east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125 . In 1983 , both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR 56 to SR 67 , although the City of Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in the city . There are no plans to construct the portion of SR 56 east of I @-@ 15 . Several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SR 56 freeway with SR 67 , including Ted Williams Parkway , Twin Peaks Road , <unk> Road ( CR S5 ) , and Poway Road ( CR S4 ) . 
 = = = Safety concerns = = = 
 The highway portion of SR 67 was popularly known as " Slaughterhouse Alley " because of the high number of fatal accidents . The road was widened in 1979 to add a shoulder and passing lane between the north end of the freeway and Poway Road . During the construction , there were concerns about speeding cars putting the construction workers in danger . The total cost was $ 927 @,@ 000 ( about $ 4 @,@ 422 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) , and Asphalt Inc. performed the work . 
 The reputation of the highway continued into the early years of the 21st century . In 2000 , a $ 1 million project ( about $ 1 @.@ 5 million in 2015 dollars ) was authorized to widen the shoulders of the road , after there were 413 accidents and 15 fatalities on SR 67 from 1996 to 1999 . At this time , County Supervisor Dianne Jacob proposed expanding the highway portion to four lanes along the entire route . Following a safety initiative , including the involvement of law enforcement and trucking companies , accidents and fatalities both decreased by the end of 2001 . Accidents continued , however , and by November 2008 , electronic signs were installed to inform motorists of their speed , and another publicity campaign had been launched . The reduction from two lanes to one lane heading southbound just after a curve has been blamed for at least some of the accidents , with collisions resulting from cars " jockeying " to be ahead . Head @-@ on collisions are another source of crashes . Despite this , in 2009 Caltrans did not view the road as unsafe according to official metrics . 
 In May 2009 , the San Diego Association of Governments ( SANDAG ) announced that fixing SR 67 was number 17 on its priority list , resulting in an estimated 2030 completion of a four @-@ lane highway that would not be limited @-@ access . A month later , Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues . Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits ; from January 2007 to early December 2010 , twenty @-@ four people died from accidents on SR 67 . Following a March 2009 fatal crash , some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway , but the suit was decided in favor of the department . In a 2010 report , Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I @-@ 8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow .

 In 1983 , the <unk> Corporation was awarded a contract to renovate the interchange with I @-@ 8 for $ 9 @.@ 1 million ( about $ 32 @.@ 7 million in 2015 dollars ) . SR 67 from Poway Road to the Poway city limits was proposed to be widened in 1985 . There was a movement in 1987 to construct a northbound offramp at Woodside Avenue , due to traffic congestion at the Prospect Avenue offramp ; however , it was never built . Call boxes were installed on SR 67 in 1994 . 
 There was also a proposal in 2000 to renovate the interchange at Bradley Avenue . The next year , SANDAG approved the construction of a southern bypass of Ramona and widening from Vigilante Road to Dye Road for a cost of $ 200 million as part of a 2030 transportation plan . The chairman of the Ramona Planning Group suggested calming traffic by using a roundabout instead of widening the highway . 
 The road 's guardrails and signs sustained damage in the 2003 Cedar Fire . That year , there were plans to widen Route 67 from Mapleview Street to Dye Road ; however , when threatened with a lawsuit from Save Our Forests and <unk> , SANDAG agreed to " reconsider " the project . Traffic jams were prevalent on October 21 and 22 in 2007 , during the ongoing local wildfires and the evacuation of Ramona on the narrow road . 
 " Heavy construction " of SR 52 from SR 125 eastward to SR 67 began in February 2008 , after it had been delayed by funding issues that were finally resolved in 2006 with voter @-@ approved statewide transportation bonds . The interchange with SR 52 began to be constructed in mid @-@ June 2008 . Completion was scheduled for 2010 , but was delayed to early 2011 due to weather @-@ related delays .

 = Varanus salvadorii = 
 Varanus salvadorii is a monitor lizard found in New Guinea . It is also known by the common names crocodile monitor , Papua ( n ) monitor , Salvadori 's monitor and <unk> . The largest monitor lizard in New Guinea , it is believed to be one of the longest lizards in the world , verified at up to 244 cm ( 8 ft ) , and in rare cases it may rival or exceed the length of the world 's largest lizard , the Komodo dragon . It is the sole member of the subgenus <unk> . V. salvadorii is an arboreal lizard with a dark green body and yellowish bands , a blunt snout and a very long tail . It lives in mangrove swamps and coastal rainforests in the southeastern part of the island , where it feeds on birds , small mammals , eggs , and carrion in the wild , using teeth better adapted than those of most monitors for seizing fast @-@ moving prey . Like all monitors , it has anatomical features that enable it to breathe more easily when running than other lizards can , and V. salvadorii may have greater stamina than most monitors . Little is known of its reproduction and development , as the species is very difficult to breed in captivity . 
 V. salvadorii is threatened by deforestation and poaching , and is protected by the CITES agreement . The lizard is hunted and skinned alive by tribesmen to make drums , who describe the monitor as an evil spirit that " climbs trees , walks upright , breathes fire , and kills men " ; yet the tribesmen maintain that the monitor gives warnings if there are crocodiles nearby . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 V. salvadorii was first described as Monitor salvadorii by Wilhelm Peters and Giacomo Doria in 1878 from a female specimen with a snout @-@ to @-@ vent length of 48 cm ( 19 in ) long and a tail measuring 114 cm ( 45 in ) in length . 
 The generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " lizard " . The term " monitor " is thought to have come about from confusion between <unk> and the German <unk> , meaning " warning " . The term " goanna " came about as a corruption of the name " iguana " . The specific name is derived from a Latinization of Tommaso Salvadori , an Italian ornithologist who worked in New Guinea . Later , in 1885 , it was renamed Varanus salvadorii by George Albert Boulenger . The Papua monitor is occasionally confused for the Asian water monitor ( V. <unk> ) because of their similar scientific names . 
 = = = Evolutionary development = = = 
 The evolutionary development of V. salvadorii started with the genus Varanus , which originated in Asia about 40 million years ago and migrated to Australia . Around 15 million years ago , a collision between Australia and Southeast Asia allowed the varanids to move into what is now the Indonesian archipelago . 
 V. salvadorii has been placed <unk> as part of a species cluster with the lace monitor ( V. varius ) and the Komodo dragon ( V. komodoensis ) . This study was based upon mitochondrial DNA and <unk> fixation analysis . A theory has been put forth that the species diverged from a common ancestor , as the Torres Strait separating New Guinea from Australia is less than 90 km ( 56 mi ) long , a distance that could have been covered fairly easily with island hopping . However , the similarities between V. salvadorii and V. varius may simply be an example of convergent evolution . Another clade postulated by Eric Pianka places V. salvadorii in a larger " Australian " clade of large monitors , along with other species as the Komodo dragon , the lace monitor , the <unk> ( V. giganteus ) , the Argus monitor ( V. panoptes ) , and the sand goanna ( V. gouldii ) . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The largest of the seven species of monitors found on the island of New Guinea , V. salvadorii occurs in both the state Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian region of West Papua . It inhabits the high and low canopies of the lowland rainforests and coastal mangrove swamps , sometimes venturing out of these areas during floods in the rainy seasons . No detailed field investigation data are available for V. salvadorii , so the full extent of its range is unknown . Its remote and generally inaccessible habitat is the main factor in preventing detailed study of this animal in its natural habitat . 
 = = Biology and morphology = = 
 The most characteristic feature of this monitor is its blunt , bulbous snout , which makes this species look different from every other monitor on New Guinea , and lends to its common name of tree crocodile . The body of the lizard is dark green with rings of yellow spots . The tail is banded yellow and black and is extremely long , being more than twice as long as the snout @-@ to @-@ vent length . It has long , straight teeth and prominent , curved claws . There is no external sexual dimorphism . 
 Unique among living varanid species , the animal 's tail is two @-@ thirds longer than the snout @-@ to @-@ vent length in both juveniles and adults . <unk> Robert <unk> gives the proportion as the tail being 210 % of the animal 's body length . At hatching , V. salvadorii is about 45 cm ( 18 in ) long , while a sexually mature female may grow to 150 cm ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) . This is possibly the longest living species of lizards , although it is considerably less massive and heavy than the Komodo dragon . Specimens are known to reach at least 244 cm ( 8 @.@ 01 ft ) in <unk> but it may grow longer . A specimen reportedly measuring 323 cm ( 10 @.@ 60 ft ) was caught in <unk> by Dr. F. Barker . Several reported specimens have been claimed to exceed 350 cm ( 11 @.@ 5 ft ) , some even to 610 cm ( 20 @.@ 0 ft ) , but most of these were second @-@ hand reports and no museum specimens in this size range are known . Weight in the species has been reported to be up to 90 kg ( 200 lb ) , but this is an unverified and possibly dubious report , this species is much more slender even in large specimens than comparable length Komodo dragons . The average size of this species is under 200 cm ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) and average body mass is reportedly about 20 kg ( 44 lb ) . However 10 adult specimens were found to weigh only 5 to 6 @.@ 38 kg ( 11 @.@ 0 to 14 @.@ 1 lb ) at a length of 1 @.@ 16 to 2 @.@ 25 m ( 3 @.@ 8 to 7 @.@ 4 ft ) so even the <unk> weigh is fairly optimistic for this species . The average size of V. salvadorii caught in one study were 99 @.@ 2 cm ( 39 @.@ 1 in ) with a weight of 2 @.@ 02 kg ( 4 @.@ 5 lb ) but presumably consisted of largely or entirely young specimens . 
 Varanus salvadorii has mammal @-@ like aerobic abilities ; this is accomplished by means of a positive pressure gular pump in the animal ’ s throat to assist lung ventilation . The majority of lizards cannot run and breathe at the same time due to Carrier 's constraint , but monitor lizards are exceptions to this rule . The development of this ventilatory pump is analogous to the evolution of the diaphragm in mammals , which <unk> the lung independently of locomotion ; scientists place V. salvadorii as the species with the highest endurance in this regard . This would suggest the lizard is at an evolutionary midpoint , relying on both forms of breathing . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 As an arboreal lizard , it can hang onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip . The primary use of the tail , however , is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another . The tail may also be used for defense , as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails . This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade , but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable . Although they are known to rest and bask in trees , they sleep on the ground or submerged in water . 
 These monitors will rise up on their hind legs to check their surroundings , a behavior that has also been documented in Gould 's monitors ( V. gouldii ) . They are known to exhibit a warning posture , in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them . According to native belief , they will give a warning call if they see crocodiles . In general V. salvadorii avoids human contact , but its bite is capable of causing infection , like the Komodo dragon 's . One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection .

 The teeth of V. salvadorii do not resemble those of other monitor species , which are typically blunt , <unk> , and face slightly rearward . Their upper teeth are long and fang @-@ like , standing vertical from the jawbone , designed to hook into fast @-@ moving or feathered prey such as birds , bats , and rodents . Their lower teeth are housed in a fleshy sheath . In the wild , V. salvadorii is the top predator in New Guinea , feeding on birds , eggs , small mammals , and carrion . Natives have reported it may take down pigs , deer , and hunting dogs , and hauls its prey into the canopy to consume it . Its only competition is the New Guinea singing dog , a type of dingo . Captive specimens have been known to eat fish , frogs , rodents , chickens , and dog food . 
 This species has been observed hunting prey in a unique fashion for monitor lizards . Rather than following its prey to ambush it from behind , V. salvadorii will stalk its prey and anticipate where it will run , meeting it headlong . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Reproduction has only been observed in captivity , so nothing is known about its reproduction in the wild . The egg clutches , comprising four to 12 eggs , are deposited around October to January , with the eggs showing a remarkable difference in dimensions , a phenomenon for which no explanation is known . Dimensions may vary from 7 @.@ 5 cm × 3 @.@ 4 cm to 10 cm × 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 in × 1 @.@ 3 in to 3 @.@ 9 in × 1 @.@ 8 in ) , while weight may vary from 43 @.@ 3 to 60 @.@ 8 g ( 1 @.@ 53 to 2 @.@ 14 oz ) . Most clutches laid in captivity have been infertile , and only four successful breedings have been documented thus far . Hatchlings are about 18 inches ( 46 cm ) long and weigh around 56 g ( 2 @.@ 0 oz ) . Like those of many other monitors , the hatchlings of V. salvadorii are more colorful than adults , and feed primarily on insects and small reptiles . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 Varanus salvadorii is currently protected under the CITES Appendix II , which requires an exportation permit for international trade . It is not listed on the IUCN Red List or the Endangered Species Act . It faces threats from deforestation and poaching , as it is hunted and skinned alive by native peoples to make drums , who consider the monitor an evil spirit that " climbs trees , walks upright , breathes fire , and kills men " . In 2008 , a total of 52 individuals were maintained at 17 zoological parks in the United States , with an unknown number in private collections . 
 = Assassination of William McKinley = 
 The 25th President of the United States , William McKinley , was shot and fatally wounded on September 6 , 1901 , inside the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan @-@ American Exposition in Buffalo , New York . McKinley was shaking hands with the public when he was shot by Leon Czolgosz , an anarchist . The President died on September 14 from gangrene caused by the bullet wounds . McKinley became the third American president to be assassinated , following Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881 . 
 McKinley had been elected for a second term in 1900 . He enjoyed meeting the public , and was reluctant to accept the security available to his office . The Secretary to the President , George B. Cortelyou , feared an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music , and twice took it off the schedule . McKinley restored it each time . 
 Czolgosz had lost his job during the economic Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism , a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders . Regarding McKinley as a symbol of oppression , Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him . Unable to get near McKinley during the earlier part of the presidential visit , Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple . One bullet grazed McKinley ; the other entered his abdomen and was never found . 
 McKinley initially appeared to be recovering , but took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous , and died early the next morning ; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him . After McKinley 's murder , for which Czolgosz was put to death in the electric chair , the United States Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility for protecting the president . 
 = = Background = = 
 In September 1901 , William McKinley was at the height of his power as president . Elected in 1896 , during the serious economic depression resulting from the Panic of 1893 , he had defeated his Democratic rival , William Jennings Bryan . McKinley led the nation both to a return to prosperity and to victory in the Spanish – American War in 1898 , taking possession of such Spanish colonies as Puerto Rico and the Philippines . Re @-@ elected handily in a rematch against Bryan in 1900 , according to historical writer Eric <unk> , " it looked as if the McKinley Administration would continue peaceably unbroken for another four years , a government devoted to prosperity " . 
 McKinley 's original vice president , Garret Hobart , had died in 1899 , and McKinley left the choice of a running mate to the 1900 Republican National Convention . In advance of the convention , New York 's Republican political boss , Senator Thomas C. Platt , saw an opportunity to politically sideline his state 's governor , former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt , by pushing for his nomination as vice president . Roosevelt accepted the nomination and was elected on McKinley 's ticket . 
 Leon Czolgosz was born in Detroit , Michigan , in 1873 , the son of Polish immigrants . The Czolgosz family moved a number of times as Paul Czolgosz , Leon 's father , sought work throughout the Midwest . As an adult , Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until he lost his job in a labor dispute in 1893 . Thereafter , he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings , trying to understand the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893 . In so doing , he became interested in anarchism . By 1901 , this movement was feared in the United States — New York 's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist in front of an audience was a breach of the peace . Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half @-@ dozen officials and members of royal houses , and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago . 
 Two American presidents had been assassinated in the 19th century — Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881 . John Wilkes Booth , Lincoln 's assassin , had been embittered by the Confederate defeat in the American Civil War ; Charles Guiteau , the assassin of Garfield , was an eccentric ( possibly insane ) man motivated by personal political and religious views who had unsuccessfully sought office in Garfield 's administration . Although two presidents had been struck down by assassins , McKinley did not like security personnel to come between him and the people . When in his hometown , Canton , Ohio , he often walked to church or the business district without protection , and in Washington went on drives with his wife without any guard in the carriage .

 = = = Plans and arrivals = = = 
 McKinley gave a short speech at his second inauguration on March 4 , 1901 . Having long been an advocate of protective tariffs , and believing the Dingley Tariff , passed during his first year in office , had helped the nation reach prosperity , McKinley planned to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements with other countries . This would open foreign markets to US manufacturers that had dominated the domestic market thanks to the tariff , and who sought to expand . During a long trip planned for the months after his inauguration , he intended to make major speeches promoting this plan , culminating in a visit and address at the Pan @-@ American Exposition in Buffalo on June 13 . 
 McKinley , his wife Ida , and their official party left Washington on April 29 for a tour of the nation by train , scheduled to conclude in Buffalo for a speech on what had been designated as " President 's Day " . He met with rapturous receptions in the Far West , which had never seen a president . In California , the First Lady became seriously ill , and for a time was thought to be dying . She recovered in San Francisco , but her husband canceled the remainder of the tour and the McKinleys returned to Washington . The speech at the Exposition was postponed until September 5 , after McKinley spent some weeks in Washington and two months in Canton . He used his time in his Ohio home working on the Buffalo speech and in supervising improvements to his house . He intended to remain based in Canton until October . 
 Czolgosz had lived on his parents ' farm near Cleveland beginning in 1898 , working little — he may have suffered a nervous breakdown . He is known to have attended a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in May 1901 in Cleveland : he approached her before the speech and asked her to recommend books on anarchism ; she obliged . The talk , in which Goldman did not advocate violence but expressed understanding for those driven to it , was a great influence on Czolgosz ; he later stated that her words burned in his head . He came to see her at her Chicago home in July as she was about to depart on a trip with her daughter to Buffalo to see the fair , and the two anarchists rode together to the train station . Goldman expressed concern to another radical that Czolgosz ( who was using the alias Fred Nieman ) was following her around ; soon after , he apparently departed Chicago . William Arntz , a worker at a park in Canton , stated that he had seen a man resembling Czolgosz in mid @-@ 1901 , when the President was staying at home and sometimes visiting the park . The man was wearing two guns , and when Arntz reminded him that firearms were not permitted outside the park 's shooting range , responded dismissively . Arntz sought the police , but the man was never found . 
 Later in the summer , Czolgosz moved to Buffalo , though his reasons for doing so are not known . Author and journalist Scott Miller speculated that he may have chosen Buffalo because of its large Polish population . He boarded in the suburb of West Seneca and spent much of his time reading . Czolgosz then left for Cleveland , though what he did there is uncertain ; he may have picked up anarchist literature or procured more money . After Cleveland , Czolgosz went to Chicago , where he saw a newspaper mention of President McKinley 's impending visit to Buffalo . He returned to Buffalo , as yet uncertain of what he would do ; he at first only sought to be near the man who to him embodied injustice . On Tuesday , September 3 , he made up his mind . Czolgosz later stated to the police : 
 It was in my heart , there was no escape for me . I could not have conquered it had my life been at stake . There were thousands of people in town on Tuesday . I heard it was President 's Day . All those people seemed bowing to the great ruler . I made up my mind to kill that ruler . 
 On September 3 , Czolgosz went to Walbridge 's Hardware Store on Buffalo 's Main Street and purchased a .32 @-@ caliber Iver Johnson revolver . He had as yet no clear plan for the assassination of the President . The following day , William and Ida McKinley arrived in Buffalo by train . The cannon that fired a salute to the President on his arrival in the city had been set too close to the track , and the explosions blew out several windows in the train , unnerving the First Lady . About a dozen people on the platform , believing the damage was caused by a bomb , shouted " Anarchists ! " As William McKinley stepped down from the train to the official welcome , Czolgosz shoved his way forward in the crowd , but found the President too well guarded to make an attempt on his life . 
 = = = A day at the fair ; excursion to Niagara Falls = = = 
 McKinley 's trip to Buffalo was part of a planned ten @-@ day absence from Canton , beginning on September 4 , 1901 , which was to include a visit in Cleveland to an encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic ; he was a member as a Union veteran . The McKinleys stayed in Buffalo at the Milburn House , the large home of the Exposition 's president , John G. Milburn . On Saturday , September 7 , they were to travel to Cleveland and stay first at the home of businessman and future Ohio governor Myron Herrick , a friend of the President , and then with McKinley 's close friend and adviser , Ohio Senator Mark Hanna . Upon arrival in Buffalo , the presidential party was driven through the fairgrounds on the way to the Milburn House , pausing for a moment at the Triumphal Bridge at the Exposition so the visitors could look upon the fair 's attractions . 
 While in Buffalo , McKinley had two days of events : On Thursday , September 5 , he was to deliver his address and then tour the fair . The following day , he was to visit Niagara Falls , and , on his return to Buffalo , meet the public at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds . Part of the reason for bringing McKinley repeatedly to the fair was to swell the gate receipts ; the popular President 's visit was heavily advertised . The public reception at the Temple of Music was disliked by his personal secretary , George B. Cortelyou , who , concerned for the President 's security , twice tried to remove it from the program . McKinley each time restored it ; he wished to support the fair ( he agreed with its theme of hemispheric cooperation ) , enjoyed meeting people , and was not afraid of potential assassins . When Cortelyou asked McKinley a final time to remove the event from the schedule , the President responded , " Why should I ? No one would wish to hurt me . " Cortelyou warned McKinley that many would be disappointed since the President would not have time to shake hands with all who would line up to meet him . McKinley responded , " Well , they 'll know I tried , anyhow . " Unable to persuade the President to alter his schedule , Cortelyou telegraphed to authorities in Buffalo , asking them to arrange extra security . 
 On the morning of Thursday , September 5 , the fair gates were opened at 6 : 00 a.m. to allow the crowds to enter early and seek good spots to witness the President 's speech . The Esplanade , the large space near the Triumphal Bridge where the President was to speak , was filled with fairgoers ; the crowd overflowed into the nearby Court of the Fountains . Of the 116 @,@ 000 fairgoers that day , about 50 @,@ 000 are believed to have attended McKinley 's speech . The route between the Milburn House and the site of the speech was packed with spectators ; McKinley 's progress by carriage to the fair with his wife was accompanied by loud cheering . He ascended to a stand overlooking the Esplanade , and after a brief introduction by Milburn , began to speak . 
 In his final speech , McKinley urged an end to American isolationism . He proposed trade arrangements which would allow US manufacturers new markets . " The period of exclusiveness is past . The expansion of our trade and commerce is the pressing problem . Commercial wars are unprofitable . " The crowd greeted his speech with loud applause ; at its conclusion , the President escorted Ida McKinley back to her carriage as she was to return to the Milburn House while he saw the sights at the fair . 
 McKinley toured the pavilions of other Western Hemisphere nations , attracting crowds and applause wherever he went . He presided over a luncheon at the New York State Building , and attended a by @-@ invitation @-@ only reception at the Government Building . He was heavily guarded by soldiers and police , but still tried to interact with the public , encouraging those who tried to run to him by noticing them , and bowing to a group of loud young popcorn sellers . He made an unscheduled stop for coffee at the Porto Rican Building ( a common variant spelling of Puerto Rico prior to 1932 ) before returning to the Milburn House in the late afternoon . 
 Despite a Cortelyou warning to the organizers that she might not attend due to her delicate health , Ida McKinley had been present at a luncheon in her honor by the Exposition 's Board of Lady Managers , and after dinner , the President and First Lady returned to the fairgrounds , pausing at the Triumphal Bridge to watch the fair illuminated by electricity as the sun set . They went by boat to the Life Saving Station to view the fireworks from there before returning to the Milburn House . 
 Czolgosz , gun in pocket , had arrived early at the fair , and was quite close to the podium before McKinley arrived . He considered shooting the President during his speech , but felt he could not be certain of hitting his target ; he was also being jostled by the crowd . Czolgosz had not made up his mind when McKinley concluded his speech and disappeared behind security guards . Nevertheless , he attempted to follow McKinley as the President began his tour of the fair , but was thrust back by officers . Czolgosz saw no further chance at getting close to the President that day , and he returned to his $ 2 / week rented room above a saloon . 
 On the morning of Friday , September 6 , 1901 , McKinley dressed formally as usual , then departed the Milburn House for a stroll through the neighborhood . The President nearly slipped away unguarded ; when the police and soldiers noticed him leaving , they hurried after him . Czolgosz also rose early with the intent of lining up for the public reception at the Temple of Music ; he reached the Exposition gates at 8 : 30 a.m. , in time to see the President pass in his carriage en route to the train station for the visit to Niagara Falls . The McKinleys traveled by train to Lewiston , where they switched to trolleys to view the Niagara Gorge . When the party reached the municipality of Niagara Falls , they transferred to carriages to see the sights . The party rode halfway across the Honeymoon Bridge overlooking the Falls , though McKinley was careful not to enter Canada for reasons of protocol . It was a hot day , and Ida McKinley felt ill due to the heat ; she was driven to the International Hotel to await her husband , who toured Goat Island before joining his wife for lunch . After smoking a cigar on the veranda , the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby , and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls . The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music . Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium , but as she was not fully recovered , she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest . As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes , the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long . As it was only 3 : 30 p.m. , McKinley stopped for refreshments at the Mission Building before proceeding to the Temple of Music . 
 = = Shooting and death of McKinley = = 
 = = = At the Temple of Music = = = 
 When given the opportunity to host a public reception for President McKinley , fair organizers chose to site it in the Temple of Music — Louis L. Babcock , grand marshal of the Exposition , regarded the building as ideal for the purpose . The large auditorium was located close to the Esplanade , in the heart of the fair , and had doorways on each of its four sides . In addition to rows of chairs on the floor of the hall , it had spacious galleries . Babcock spent the morning of September 6 making the physical arrangements for the reception . Floor seating was removed to create a broad aisle , running from the east doors through which the public would be admitted , to where McKinley would stand . Once members of the public shook hands with McKinley , they would continue on to exit the building . An American flag was draped behind McKinley , both to screen him from behind , and for decoration — several potted plants were arrayed around the President 's place to create an attractive scene . Besides its utility for other purposes , the ornate building was one of the architectural features of the fair . 
 Considerable arrangements had been made for the President 's security . Exposition police were stationed at the doors ; detectives from the Buffalo police guarded the aisle . In addition to McKinley 's usual Secret Service agent , George Foster , two other agents had been assigned to the Buffalo trip because of Cortelyou 's security concerns . Babcock was made nervous by a joke at lunch in an Exposition restaurant that the President might be shot during the reception . He had arranged for a dozen artillerymen to attend the reception in full @-@ dress uniform , intending to use them as decoration . Instead , he had them stand in the aisle with instructions to close on any suspicious @-@ looking person who might approach the President . These men were not trained in police work , and served to crowd the area in front of the President and obstruct the views of the detectives and Secret Service . At such events , Foster usually stood just to the left and behind McKinley . However , Milburn wished to stand to McKinley 's left to be able to introduce anyone he knew in the line to the President , and Foster and another agent instead stood across the aisle from McKinley . 
 Through the afternoon , crowds had filled the floor outside the blocked @-@ off aisle , and the galleries as well , wanting to see the President , even if they could not greet him . McKinley arrived on schedule , glanced at the arrangements , and walked to his place , where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right . The pipe organ began to play " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him . The police let them in , and McKinley prepared to perform his favorite part of the job . An experienced politician , McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute , gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed . Cortelyou anxiously watched the time ; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted , he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand . Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch , Babcock moved towards the doors . As the reception continued , the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach . The procession of citizens shaking hands with their Chief Executive was interrupted when 12 @-@ year @-@ old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook , New York , who was accompanied by her mother , asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel . The President gave it to her , then resumed work without his trademark good @-@ luck piece . The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall , swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President , but breathed a sigh of relief when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit . The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced , perhaps due to the heat of the day , as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows ; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one , as if injured . Seeing this , McKinley reached for his left hand instead . As the two men 's hands touched at 4 : 07 pm , Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a .32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief . 
 As onlookers gazed in horror , and as McKinley lurched forward a step , Czolgosz prepared to take a third shot . He was prevented from doing so when James Parker , an American of part @-@ African part @-@ Spanish descent from Georgia who had been behind Czolgosz in line , slammed into the assassin , reaching for the gun . A split second after Parker struck Czolgosz , so did Buffalo detective John Geary and one of the artillerymen , Francis O 'Brien . Czolgosz disappeared beneath a pile of men , some of whom were punching or hitting him with rifle butts . He was heard to say , " I done my duty . " McKinley staggered backwards and to the right , but was prevented from falling by Cortelyou , Milburn , and Detective Geary ; they guided him across some fallen bunting to a chair . The President tried to convince Cortelyou he was not seriously injured , but blood was visible as he tried to expose his injury . Seeing the pummeling being taken by Czolgosz , McKinley ordered it stopped . Czolgosz was dragged away , but not before being searched by Agent Foster . When Czolgosz kept turning his head to watch the President while being searched , Foster struck him to the ground with one punch . 
 After stopping the beating of Czolgosz , McKinley 's next concern was for his wife , urging Cortelyou to take care how she was told of the shooting . The initial crowd reaction had been panic , and an attempt to flee the hall , which was frustrated by others surging inwards to see what had occurred . As McKinley was carried out on a stretcher to an electric @-@ powered ambulance , there was a moan from the crowd at the sight of the President 's ashen face . Foster rode with him on the way to the fair 's hospital . On the way there , McKinley felt in his clothing and came out with a metal object . " I believe that is a bullet . " McKinley had been shot twice ; one bullet had deflected off a button and only grazed him ; the other had penetrated his abdomen . 
 = = = Operation = = = 
 The ambulance carrying McKinley reached the Exposition hospital at 4 : 25 p.m. Although it usually dealt only with the minor medical issues of fairgoers , the hospital did have an operating theatre . At the time of the shooting , no fully qualified doctor was at the hospital , only nurses and interns . The best surgeon in the city ( and the Exposition 's medical director ) , Dr. Roswell Park was in Niagara Falls , performing a delicate neck operation . When interrupted during the procedure on September 6 to be told he was needed in Buffalo , he responded that he could not leave , even for the President of the United States . He was then told who had been shot . Park , two weeks later , would save the life of a woman who suffered injuries almost identical to McKinley 's . The first physician to arrive at the hospital was Dr. Herman Mynter , whom the President had met briefly the previous day ; the wounded McKinley ( who had a good memory for faces ) joked that when he had met Mynter , he had not expected to need his professional services . As McKinley lay on the operating table , he stated of Czolgosz , " He didn 't know , poor fellow , what he was doing . He couldn 't have known . " With Park unavailable and with the fading afternoon light the major source of illumination in the operating room , when another surgeon , Dr. Matthew D. Mann arrived , the decision was made to operate at once to try to remove the remaining bullet . Mynter had given McKinley an injection of morphine and strychnine to ease his pain ; Mann ( a noted gynecologist without experience in abdominal wounds ) administered ether to sedate McKinley as the wounded man murmured the Lord 's Prayer . 
 For hundreds of years , abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection , with doctors able to do little more than ease pain . Only seventeen years previously , Dr. Emil Kocher , a Swiss surgeon , had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound . To increase the lighting , sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician ; towards the end of the surgery , a better light was rigged . The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as <unk> . With McKinley in a weakened condition , Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet ; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese . The surgeon made an incision in the President 's skin , and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh . He probed with his finger and hand , finding damage to the digestive system — the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound . Mann sewed up both holes in the organ , but could not find the bullet itself ; he concluded it had lodged in the President 's back muscles . He later wrote , " A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm . " A primitive X @-@ ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley ; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good . He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound , without drainage , and covered the area with a bandage . As the operation concluded , Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls ; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5 : 20 , McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken . He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance . The First Lady had not been told of the President 's shooting ; once the surgery was complete , the presidential physician , Presley M. Rixey , gently told her what had occurred . Ida McKinley took the news calmly ; she wrote in her diary , " Went to <unk> [ sic ] Falls this morning . My Dearest was receiving in a public hall on our return , when he was shot by a ... " Leech , in her biography of President McKinley , suggests that the First Lady could not write the word , " anarchist " . 
 = = = Apparent recovery ; eventual death = = = 
 Within minutes of the shots , the news was conveyed around the world by telegraph wire , in time for the late newspaper editions in the US . In the era before radio , thousands stood in cities across the country outside newspaper offices , awaiting the latest bulletin from Buffalo . Fears that McKinley would not survive the day of his shooting were allayed by reassuring bulletins issued by Cortelyou based on information from the doctors . Large , threatening crowds assembled outside Buffalo police headquarters where Czolgosz was brought . Word that he had admitted to being an anarchist led to attacks on others of that belief : one was nearly lynched in Pittsburgh . 
 At the Milburn House , McKinley seemed to be recovering . On Saturday , September 7 , McKinley was relaxed and conversational . His wife was allowed to see him , as was Cortelyou ; the President asked his secretary , " How did they like my speech ? " and was pleased on hearing of positive reactions . Meanwhile , Vice President Roosevelt ( who had been on a Vermont vacation ) , much of the Cabinet , and Senator Hanna hurried to Buffalo . Cortelyou continued to issue encouraging bulletins . The President was permitted few visitors , and complained of loneliness . As the crisis seemed to have passed , dignitaries started to leave on September 9 , confident of the President 's recovery . Roosevelt left for a vacation in the Adirondack Mountains after expressing outrage that Czolgosz might serve only a few years under New York State law for attempted murder , the maximum penalty for attempted murder in New York at that time being ten years . Attorney General Philander Knox went to Washington , searching for a means to bring Czolgosz under federal law . Secretary of State John Hay had been closely associated with the two presidents to be assassinated : he had been Lincoln 's secretary , and a close friend of James Garfield . He arrived on September 10 ; met at the station by Babcock with an account of the President 's recovery , Hay responded that the President would die . 
 McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan wrote of the week following the shooting : 
 His hearty constitution , everyone said , would see him through . The doctors seemed hopeful , even confident ... It is difficult to understand the cheer with which they viewed their patient . He was nearly sixty years old , overweight , and the wound itself had not been thoroughly cleaned or traced . Precautions against infections , admittedly difficult in 1901 , were negligently handled . 
 According to McKinley biographer Margaret Leech , McKinley 's apparent recovery " was merely the resistance of his strong body to the gangrene that was creeping along the bullet 's track through the stomach , the pancreas , and one kidney " . Another X @-@ ray machine was sent from New Jersey by its inventor , Thomas Edison . It was not used on the President ; sources vary on why this was — Leech stated that the machine , which she says was procured by Cortelyou and accompanied by a trained operator , was not used on orders of the doctors in charge of McKinley 's case . Miller recounts that doctors attempted to test it on a man of about McKinley 's size , but it proved to be missing a crucial part , much to Edison 's embarrassment . 
 McKinley had been given nutritive enemas ; on September 11 , he took some broth by mouth . When it seemed to do him good , the following morning they allowed him toast , coffee , and chicken broth . His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion ; he was given <unk> and most doctors left after their evening consultation . In the early morning of September 13 , McKinley suffered a collapse . Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt , 12 miles ( 19 km ) from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness ; a park ranger was sent to find him . Specialists were summoned ; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart , by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless . As yet unknown to the doctors , gangrene was growing on the walls of his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood . McKinley drifted in and out of consciousness all day ; when awake he was the model patient . By evening , McKinley too knew he was dying , " It is useless , gentlemen . I think we ought to have prayer . " His friends and family were admitted , and the First Lady sobbed over him , " I want to go , too . I want to go , too . " Her husband replied , " We are all going , we are all going . God 's will be done , not ours " and with final strength put an arm around her . He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn , " Nearer , My God , to Thee " , although other accounts have her singing it softly to him . Ida McKinley was led away , her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna . Morgan recounts their final encounter , " Sometime that terrible evening , Mark Hanna had approached the bedside , tears standing in his eyes , his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus . " When a tentative , formal greeting gained no coherent response , Hanna " cried out over the years of friendship , ' William , William , don 't you know me ? ' " 
 At 2 : 15 a.m. on Saturday , September 14 , 1901 , President McKinley died . At the time of McKinley 's death , Roosevelt was on his return journey to Buffalo , racing over the mountain roads by carriage to the nearest railroad station , where a special train was waiting . When he reached that station at dawn , he learned of McKinley 's death . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 An autopsy was performed later on the morning of McKinley 's death ; Mann led a team of 14 physicians . They found the bullet had passed through the stomach , then through the transverse colon , and vanished through the peritoneum after penetrating a corner of the left kidney . There was also damage to the adrenal glands and pancreas . Mynter , who participated in the autopsy , later stated his belief that the bullet lodged somewhere in the back muscles , though this is uncertain as it was never found . After four hours , Ida McKinley demanded that the autopsy end . A death mask was taken , and private services took place in the Milburn House before the body was moved to Buffalo City and County Hall for the start of five days of national mourning . McKinley 's body was ceremoniously taken from Buffalo to Washington , and then to Canton . On the day of the funeral , September 19 , as McKinley was taken from his home on North Market Street for the last time , all activity ceased in the nation for five minutes . Trains came to a halt , telephone and telegraph service was stopped . Leech stated , " the people bowed in homage to the President who was gone " . 
 In addition to the damage done by the bullet , the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy ( fatty degeneration of the heart muscle ) . This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury , and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise . Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis , a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time . 
 Czolgosz went on trial for the murder of McKinley in state court in Buffalo on September 23 , 1901 , nine days after the president died . Prosecution testimony took two days and consisted principally of the doctors who treated McKinley and various eyewitnesses to the shooting . Defense attorney Loran L. Lewis and his co @-@ counsel called no witnesses , which Lewis in his closing argument attributed to Czolgosz 's refusal to cooperate with them . In his 27 @-@ minute address to the jury , Lewis took pains to praise President McKinley ; Miller notes that the closing argument was more calculated to defend the attorney 's " place in the community , rather than an effort to spare his client the electric chair " . After a bare half @-@ hour of deliberations , the jury convicted Czolgosz ; he was subsequently sentenced to death and died in the electric chair on October 29 , 1901 . Acid was placed in the casket to dissolve his body , before burial in the prison graveyard . 
 After McKinley 's murder , newspaper editorials across the country heavily criticized the lack of protection afforded to American presidents . Though it still lacked any legislative mandate , by 1902 , the Secret Service was protecting President Theodore Roosevelt full @-@ time . This did not , however , settle the debate . Some in Congress recommended the United States Army be charged with protecting the President . Not until 1906 did Congress pass legislation officially designating the Secret Service as the agency in charge of presidential security . 
 The aftermath of the assassination saw a backlash against anarchists ; the Buffalo police announced soon after the shooting that they believed Czolgosz had not acted alone , and a number of anarchists were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack . Czolgosz mentioned his contacts with Emma Goldman during the interrogation ; authorities arrested her family to give her incentive to turn herself in , which she did on September 10 . She spent nearly three weeks in jail ; she , like all other arrestees thought to have conspired with Czolgosz , was released without charge . Anarchist colonies and newspapers were attacked by vigilantes ; although no one was killed , there was considerable property damage . Fear of anarchists led to surveillance programs which were eventually consolidated in 1908 as the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Anti @-@ anarchist laws passed in the wake of the assassination lay dormant for some years before being used during and after World War I , alongside newly passed statutes , against non @-@ citizens whose views were deemed a threat . Among those deported in December 1919 was Goldman , who did not have US citizenship . 
 Leech believed the nation experienced a transition at McKinley 's death : 
 The new President was in office . The republic still lived . Yet , for a space , Americans turned from the challenge and the strangeness of the future . <unk> and regretful , they remembered McKinley 's firm , unquestioning faith , his kindly , frock @-@ coated dignity ; his accessibility and dedication to the people : the federal simplicity that would not be seen again in Washington ... [ After McKinley 's death , ] old men came to the [ White House ] on errands of state and politics , but their primacy was disputed by the young men crowding forward . The nation felt another leadership , nervous , aggressive , and strong . Under command of a bold young captain , America set sail on the stormy voyage of the twentieth century .
