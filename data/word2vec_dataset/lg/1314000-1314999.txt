 Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants , known for their role in pollination and , in the case of the best @-@ known bee species , the European honey bee , for producing honey and beeswax . Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea , presently considered as a clade <unk> . There are nearly 20 @,@ 000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families , though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher . They are found on every continent except Antarctica , in every habitat on the planet that contains insect @-@ pollinated flowering plants . 
 Some species including honey bees , bumblebees , and stingless bees live socially in colonies . Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen , the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients . Most pollen is used as food for larvae . Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially ; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees . 
 Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than 2 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 08 in ) long , to <unk> pluto , the largest species of leafcutter bee , whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 54 in ) . The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae , or sweat bees , but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies . Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as bee @-@ eaters ; insect predators include <unk> and dragonflies . 
 Human beekeeping or apiculture has been practised for millennia , since at least the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece . Apart from honey and pollination , honey bees produce beeswax , royal jelly and propolis . Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore , again since ancient times , and they feature in works of literature as varied as Virgil 's Georgics , Beatrix Potter 's The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse , and W. B. Yeats 's poem The Lake Isle of Innisfree . Bee larvae are included in the Javanese dish <unk> <unk> , where they are eaten steamed with shredded coconut . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 The ancestors of bees were wasps in the family Crabronidae , which were predators of other insects . The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae . This same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps , where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors . Until recently , the oldest non @-@ compression bee fossil had been found in New Jersey amber , <unk> prisca of Cretaceous age , a corbiculate bee . A bee fossil from the early Cretaceous ( ~ 100 mya ) , <unk> <unk> , is considered " an extinct lineage of pollen @-@ collecting Apoidea sister to the modern bees " . Derived features of its morphology ( apomorphies ) place it clearly within the bees , but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits ( <unk> ) of the legs ( two mid @-@ tibial spurs , and a slender hind <unk> ) , showing its transitional status . By the Eocene ( ~ 45 mya ) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages . 
 The highly eusocial corbiculate Apidae appeared roughly 87 Mya , and the <unk> ( within the Apidae ) around 53 Mya . The <unk> appear as fossils only from the late Oligocene ( ~ 25 Mya ) to early Miocene . The <unk> are known from <unk> <unk> in the Early Eocene . The <unk> are known from trace fossils ( characteristic leaf cuttings ) from the Middle Eocene . The <unk> are known from the Eocene @-@ Oligocene boundary , around 34 Mya , of the Florissant shale . The Halictidae first appear in the Early Eocene with species found in amber . The <unk> are known from fossil brood cells of Pleistocene age . 
 = = = Coevolution = = = 
 The earliest animal @-@ pollinated flowers were shallow , cup @-@ shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles , so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees . The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents , with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination , and are the most efficient pollinating insects . In a process of coevolution , flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes , and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar . Bees also developed structures known as <unk> hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen . The location and type differ among and between groups of bees . Most bees have <unk> hairs located on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens , some bees in the family Apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops . This drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms , and , in turn , the bees themselves . Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites . Some bees provide tufts of hairs called <unk> that appear to provide lodgings for mites ; in return , it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen , so the relationship in this case may be <unk> .

 = = Description = = 
 It is usually easy to recognise that a particular insect is a bee . They differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume @-@ like setae ( bristles ) , combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae , small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings , and in females , by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half @-@ plates . 
 <unk> , one of the most obvious characteristics of bees is that they collect pollen to provide provisions for their young , and have the necessary adaptations to do this . However , certain wasp species such as pollen wasps have similar behaviours , and a few species of bee scavenge from carcases to feed their offspring . The world 's largest species of bee is thought to be the Indonesian resin bee <unk> pluto , whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 54 in ) . The smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees in the tribe Meliponini whose workers are less than 2 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 08 in ) in length . 
 A bee has a pair of large compound eyes which cover much of the surface of the head . Between and above these are three small simple eyes ( ocelli ) which provide information for the bee on light intensity . The antennae usually have thirteen segments in males and twelve in females and are geniculate , having an elbow joint part way along . They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch ( mechanoreceptors ) , smell and taste , and small , hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to " hear " sounds . The mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar . 
 The thorax has three segments , each with a pair of robust legs , and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments . The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae , and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets , flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen . The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing . The abdomen has nine segments , the <unk> three being modified into the sting . 
 = = Sociality = = 
 = = = <unk> breeding system = = = 
 According to inclusive fitness theory , organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output , but also that of close relatives . In evolutionary terms , individuals should help relatives when Cost < <unk> * Benefit . The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure . In haplodiploid species , females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs . Because a male is haploid ( has only one copy of each gene ) , his daughters ( which are diploid , with two copies of each gene ) share 100 % of his genes and 50 % of their mother 's . Therefore , they share 75 % of their genes with each other . This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton termed " <unk> " , more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring . Workers often do not reproduce , but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters ( as queens ) than they would by having their own offspring ( each of which would only have 50 % of their genes ) . This unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality ( arising at least nine separate times ) within the Hymenoptera . However , some eusocial species such as termites are not haplodiploid . Conversely , many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial , and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males , creating half @-@ sisters that share only 25 % of their genes . <unk> is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality . But , monogamy ( queens mating singly ) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated , so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees . 
 = = = Eusociality = = = 
 Bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities . The most advanced of these are eusocial colonies found among the honey bees , bumblebees , and stingless bees ; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non @-@ reproductive adults . Sociality , of several different types , is believed to have evolved separately many times within the bees . In some species , groups of cohabiting females may be sisters , and if there is a division of labour within the group , they are considered <unk> . The group is called eusocial if , in addition , the group consists of a mother ( the queen ) and her daughters ( workers ) , with male drones at certain stages . When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives , the system is considered primitively eusocial as in many paper wasps ; when the castes are morphologically discrete , the system is considered highly eusocial . 
 There are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees , but they have rarely been studied . Most are in the family Halictidae , or " sweat bees " . Colonies are typically small , with a dozen or fewer workers , on average . Queens and workers differ only in size , if at all . Most species have a single season colony cycle , even in the tropics , and only mated females hibernate . A few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds . The orchid bees include some primitively eusocial species with similar biology . Some <unk> bees are primitively eusocial colonies , with progressive provisioning : a larva 's food is supplied gradually as it develops , as is the case in honey bees and some bumblebees . 
 Bumblebees are eusocial , like the eusocial Vespidae such as hornets . The queen initiates a nest on her own . Bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population , which occurs in mid to late summer . Nest architecture is simple , limited by the size of the pre @-@ existing nest cavity , and colonies rarely last more than a year . In 2011 , the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up the Bumblebee Specialist Group to review the threat status of all bumblebee species world @-@ wide using the IUCN Red List criteria . 
 <unk> bees are highly eusocial . They practise mass provisioning , with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies . 
 The true honey bees ( genus Apis ) are highly eusocial , and are among the best known of all insects . There are 29 subspecies of Apis mellifera , native to Europe , the Middle East , and Africa . Africanized bees are a hybrid strain of A. mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies ; they are unusually defensive . 
 = = = Solitary and communal bees = = = 
 Most other bees , including familiar insects such as carpenter bees , leafcutter bees and mason bees are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile , and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself . There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species . Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax . 
 Solitary bees are important pollinators ; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood . Often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste @-@ like consistency . Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen @-@ carrying structures on their bodies . A very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination . Most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences , namely : carpenter bees , sweat bees , mason bees , polyester bees , squash bees , dwarf carpenter bees , leafcutter bees , alkali bees and digger bees . 
 Most solitary bees nest in the ground in a variety of soil textures and conditions while others create nests in hollow reeds or twigs , holes in wood . The female typically creates a compartment ( a " cell " ) with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva , then seals it off . A nest may consist of numerous cells . When the nest is in wood , usually the last ( those closer to the entrance ) contain eggs that will become males . The adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid , and usually dies after making one or more nests . The males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge . Solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting ( only in self @-@ defense , if ever ) . 
 While solitary females each make individual nests , some species. such as the European mason bee <unk> <unk> , and the Dawson 's Burrowing bee , <unk> dawsoni , are gregarious , preferring to make nests near others of the same species , and giving the appearance of being social . Large groups of solitary bee nests are called aggregations , to distinguish them from colonies . In some species , multiple females share a common nest , but each makes and provisions her own cells independently . This type of group is called " communal " and is not uncommon . The primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 The life cycle of a bee , be it a solitary or social species , involves the laying of an egg , the development through several moults of a legless larva , a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis , followed by the emergence of a winged adult . Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom . The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate . The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised ; after mating , a female stores the sperm , and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid , fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs , males . Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage . 
 The egg is generally oblong , slightly curved and tapering at one end . In the case of solitary bees , each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it . This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning . In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows . The nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood , in solitary bees , to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees . 
 The larvae are generally whitish grubs , roughly oval and bluntly @-@ pointed at both ends . They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing . They have no legs but are able to move within the confines of the cell , helped by tubercles on their sides . They have short horns on the head , jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle . There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons . The pupa can be seen through the semi @-@ transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days , the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee . When ready to emerge , it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell . 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 In Antoine Magnan 's 1934 book Le vol des insectes , he wrote that he and André Sainte @-@ Laguë had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed @-@ wing calculations , but that " One shouldn 't be surprised that the results of the calculations don 't square with reality " . This has led to a common misconception that bees " violate aerodynamic theory " , but in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed @-@ wing flight , and that their flight is explained by other mechanics , such as those used by helicopters . In 1996 it was shown that vortices created by many insects ' wings helped to provide lift . High @-@ speed cinematography and robotic mock @-@ up of a bee wing showed that lift was generated by " the unconventional combination of short , choppy wing strokes , a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction , and a very fast wing @-@ beat frequency " . Wing @-@ beat frequency normally increases as size decreases , but as the bee 's wing beat covers such a small arc , it flaps approximately 230 times per second , faster than a fruitfly ( 200 times per second ) which is 80 times smaller . 
 = = = Navigation , communication , and finding food = = = 
 The ethologist Karl von Frisch studied navigation in the honey bee . He showed that honey bees communicate by the waggle dance , in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other workers in the hive . He demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways : by the sun , by the polarization pattern of the blue sky , and by the earth ’ s magnetic field . He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass ; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive . Bees navigate using spatial memory with a " rich , map @-@ like organization " . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Floral relationships = = = 
 Most bees are <unk> ( generalist ) meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plants , however , some are <unk> ( specialists ) , in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants . Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen , and male orchid bees , which gather aromatic compounds from orchids ( one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators ) . Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers , floral odors , and even electromagnetic fields . Once landed , a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers . 
 In rare cases , a plant species may only be effectively pollinated by a single bee species , and some plants are endangered at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened . There is , however , a pronounced tendency for <unk> bees to be associated with common , widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators . There are some forty <unk> associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the United States southwest , for example . 
 = = = As mimics and models = = = 
 Many bees are aposematically coloured , typically orange and black , warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting . As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non @-@ stinging insects such as bee @-@ flies , robber flies and hoverflies , all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees . 
 Bees are themselves Müllerian mimics of other aposematic insects with the same colour scheme , including wasps , <unk> and other beetles , and many butterflies and moths ( Lepidoptera ) which are themselves distasteful , often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food . All the Müllerian mimics , including bees , benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration . 
 Bees are also mimicked by plants such as the bee orchid which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee ; male bees attempt to mate ( <unk> ) with the furry lip of the flower , thus pollinating it . 
 = = = As brood parasites = = = 
 Brood parasites occur in several bee families including the apid subfamily <unk> . Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures ( the <unk> ) and do not construct their own nests . They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species , and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee . When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva 's pollen ball , and often the host egg also . The Arctic bee species , Bombus hyperboreus , in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus . However , unlike many other bee brood parasites , they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen . 
 In the south of Africa , hives of African honeybees ( A. mellifera scutellata ) are being destroyed by parasitic workers of the Cape honeybee , A. m. capensis . These lay diploid eggs ( " <unk> " ) , escaping normal worker policing , leading to the colony 's destruction ; the parasites can then move to other hives . 
 The cuckoo bees in the Bombus subgenus Psithyrus are closely related to , and resemble , their hosts in looks and size . This common pattern gave rise to the ecological principle " Emery 's rule " . Others parasitize bees in different families , like <unk> , a <unk> apid , two species of which are <unk> of the <unk> genus <unk> , while the other species in the same genus attacks halictid bees . 
 = = = Nocturnal bees = = = 
 Four bee families ( <unk> , <unk> , Halictidae , and Apidae ) contain some species that are crepuscular . Most are tropical or subtropical , but there are some which live in arid regions at higher latitudes . These bees have greatly enlarged ocelli , which are extremely sensitive to light and dark , though incapable of forming images . Some have refracting superposition compound eyes : these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor . Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators , and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night . 
 = = = Predators , parasites and pathogens = = = 
 Vertebrate predators of bees include bee @-@ eaters , shrikes and flycatchers , which make short sallies to catch insects in flight . Swifts and swallows fly almost continually , catching insects as they go . The honey buzzard attacks bees ' nests and eats the larvae . The greater <unk> interacts with humans by guiding them to the nests of wild bees . The humans break open the nests and take the honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax . Among mammals , predators such as the badger dig up bumblebee nests and eat both the larvae and any stored food . 
 Specialist ambush predators of visitors to flowers include crab spiders , which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects ; predatory bugs , and praying mantises , some of which ( the flower mantises of the tropics ) wait motionless , aggressive mimics camouflaged as flowers . <unk> are large wasps that habitually attack bees ; the ethologist Niko Tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the <unk> <unk> <unk> might kill several thousand honeybees in a day : all the prey he observed were honeybees . Other predatory insects that sometimes catch bees include robber flies and dragonflies . 
 Honey bees are affected by parasites including <unk> and Varroa mites . However , some bees are believed to have a mutualistic relationship with mites .

 Three bee maidens with the power of divination and thus speaking truth are described in Homer 's Hymn to Hermes , and the food of the gods is " identified as honey " ; the bee maidens were originally associated with Apollo , and are probably not correctly identified with the <unk> . Honey , according to a Greek myth , was discovered by a nymph called Melissa ( " Bee " ) ; and honey was offered to the Greek gods from <unk> times . Bees were associated , too , with the Delphic oracle and the prophetess was sometimes called a bee . 
 The image of a community of honey bees has been used from ancient to modern times , in Aristotle and Plato ; in Virgil and Seneca ; in Erasmus and Shakespeare ; Tolstoy , and by political and social theorists such as Bernard Mandeville and Karl Marx as a model for human society . In English folklore , bees would be told of important events in the household , in a custom known as " Telling the bees " .

 Kit Williams ' treasure hunt book The Bee on the Comb ( 1984 ) uses bees and beekeeping as part of its story and puzzle . 
 Sue Monk Kidd 's The Secret Life of Bees ( 2004 ) , and the 2009 film starring Dakota Fanning , tells the story of a girl who escapes her abusive home and finds her way to live with a family of beekeepers , the <unk> . 
 Dave Goulson 's A Sting in the Tale ( 2014 ) describes his efforts to save bumblebees in Britain , as well as much about their biology .

 The humorous 2007 animated film Bee Movie used Jerry Seinfeld 's first script and was his first work for children ; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson , alongside Renée Zellweger . Critics found its premise awkward and its delivery tame . 
 = = = Beekeeping = = = 
 Humans have kept honey bee colonies , commonly in hives , for millennia . Beekeepers collect honey , beeswax , propolis , pollen , and royal jelly from hives ; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers . 
 Depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15 @,@ 000 years ago ; efforts to domesticate them are shown in Egyptian art around 4 @,@ 500 years ago . Simple hives and smoke were used ; jars of honey were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun . From the 18th century , European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony . Among Classical Era authors , beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in the History of Animals Book 9 ( a book not written by Aristotle himself ) . The account mentions that bees die after stinging ; that workers remove corpses from the hive , and guard it ; castes including workers and non @-@ working drones , but " kings " rather than queens ; predators including toads and bee @-@ eaters ; and the waggle dance , with the " irresistible suggestion " of <unk> ( <unk> , it <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> , they watch ) . 
 Beekeeping is described in detail by Virgil in his Eclogues ; it is also mentioned in his Aeneid , and in Pliny 's Natural History . 
 = = = As commercial pollinators = = = 
 Bees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants , and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants . It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects , birds and bats , most of which is accomplished by bees , especially the domesticated European honey bee . 
 Contract pollination has overtaken the role of honey production for beekeepers in many countries . From 1972 to 2006 , feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US , and they are now almost absent . The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly , through urbanization , systematic pesticide use , tracheal and Varroa mites , and the closure of beekeeping businesses . In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased , and was described as colony collapse disorder . In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony , and deadly in combination . Winter losses increased to about 1 / 3 . Varroa mites were thought to be responsible for about half the losses . 
 Apart from colony collapse disorder , losses outside the US have been attributed to causes including pesticide seed dressings , such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further . In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming . 
 However farmers have focused on alternative solutions in order to mitigate these problems . By raising native plants , they provide food for native bee pollinators like L. <unk> and L. leucozonium , leading to less reliance on honey bee populations .

 Honey is a natural product produced by bees and stored for their own use , but its sweetness has always appealed to humans . Before domestication of bees was even attempted , humans were raiding their nests for their honey . Smoke was often used to subdue the bees and such activities are depicted in rock paintings in Spain which have been dated to 15 @,@ 000 BC . Indigenous people in many countries eat insects , including consuming the larvae and pupae of bees , mostly stingless bees . They also gather " bee brood " ( the larvae , pupae and surrounding cells ) for consumption . In the Indonesian dish <unk> <unk> from Central and East Java , bee larvae are eaten as a companion to rice , after being mixed with shredded coconut , wrapped in banana leaves , and steamed . 
 Honey bees are used commercially to produce honey . They also produce some substances used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits , pollen , propolis , and royal jelly , though all of these can also cause allergic reactions .

 The painful stings of bees are mostly associated with the poison gland and the Dufour 's gland which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals .

However , the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction . 
 = U.S. Route 199 = 
 U.S. Route 199 ( US 199 ) is a U.S. highway in the U.S. states of California and Oregon . The highway was established in 1926 as a spur of U.S. Route 99 , which has since been replaced by Interstate 5 . US 199 stretches 80 miles ( 130 km ) from U.S. Route 101 near Crescent City , California northeast to Interstate 5 in Grants Pass , Oregon . The highway is the northern portion of the Redwood Highway . In Oregon , US 199 is officially known as Redwood Highway No. 25 . The majority of the road in California is the Smith River Scenic Byway , a National Forest Scenic Byway . This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System . The first roadway , a plank road , from Crescent City was established in May 1858 , and before the US 199 designation was applied to the highway , the roadway was designated Highway 25 and Route 1 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 199 begins at a partial interchange with US 101 northeast of Crescent City ; Elk Valley Cross Road ( County Route D2 ) connects the two routes just to the north for full access . The highway quickly enters the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park , climbs over a ridge , crosses the Smith River , and meets State Route 197 ( which heads northwest to US 101 via the Smith River ) . US 199 follows the banks of the river and its Middle Fork as it takes a steady but curvy climb through the Smith River National Recreation Area in the Six Rivers National Forest , passing the settlements of <unk> , Gasquet and Patrick Creek . As it approaches the summit , the Middle Fork Smith River turns east , but US 199 continues northeast , following Griffin Creek to near its source ( where there is a rest area ) , and passing under Hazel View Summit , the border between the Smith River NRA and the Rogue River @-@ Siskiyou National Forest , in the 1963 Collier Tunnel ( elevation about 2100 feet / 650 m ) . ( The old curving route over the summit still exists as Oregon Mountain Road . ) Upon leaving the tunnel , US 199 descends alongside the small Broken Kettle Creek into the Elk Valley and crosses into Oregon . 
 US 199 leaves the national forest as it enters Oregon and descends into the Illinois Valley , passing O 'Brien and the west end of OR 46 in Cave Junction . North of Cave Junction , US 199 leaves the Illinois River , which curves west towards the ocean , and follows several small creeks past Selma to Hayes Hill Summit ( elevation about 1700 feet / 500 m ) . The highway descends from the summit alongside Slate Creek past Wonder and Wilderville and ends up in the Rogue River Valley , where it enters Grants Pass . 
 South of downtown Grants Pass , US 199 meets OR 99 and OR 238 and splits at a partial interchange . The main Redwood Highway turns north with OR 99 , passing through downtown and ending at exit 58 of I @-@ 5 , while the Redwood Spur , locally known as Grants Pass Parkway , continues straight , bypassing downtown to end at I @-@ 5 exit 55 . Both of these are signed in both directions as US 199 , while signage on US 199 itself at the split only shows " OR 99 north " for the mainline through downtown and " to I @-@ 5 " for the bypass . On I @-@ 5 , exit 55 is marked as " US 199 " , but exit 58 is " OR 99 to US 199 " . The Oregon Transportation Commission 's defined routing of US 199 takes it along the main Redwood Highway through downtown , and the OTC calls the spur to exit 55 " US 199 Spur " , but , consistent with signs on I @-@ 5 ( but not on the surface ) , the Oregon Department of Transportation calls the spur US 199 and the downtown route OR 99 only . 
 The older route through downtown is a one @-@ way pair on Sixth ( southbound ) and Seventh ( northbound ) Streets , entirely overlapping OR 99 to I @-@ 5 exit 58 , where OR 99 continues with I @-@ 5 to the north . The Caveman Bridge , a concrete through arch bridge built in 1927 , carries Sixth Street over the Rogue River , while the parallel Seventh Street Bridge is a utilitarian bridge from 1960 . The Grants Pass Parkway ( Redwood Spur ) also crosses the river on a four @-@ lane bridge built in 1990 ; before that bypass was completed , the spur began downtown on E ( southbound ) and F ( northbound ) Streets . Soon after the old and new routes join , the spur ends at a trumpet interchange with I @-@ 5 ( exit 55 ) . 
 = = History = = 
 By 1854 , when it was incorporated , Crescent City had a population of 800 but no road leading inland . The Crescent City and Yreka Plank and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10 , and a survey was completed in October , but work stopped with the Panic of 1855 . The corporation was revived in December 1856 as the Crescent City Plank Road and Turnpike Company , began construction of a plank road in 1857 , and opened the road in May 1858 . This road , shown on USGS topographic maps as <unk> Road , led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River , where there was a toll booth , and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line , where it turned east , crossing back and forth between the states , to Oregon Mountain . There it turned northeast , following the Illinois River and branches past O 'Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby . The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville , along the present US 199 , Fish Hatchery Road , and OR 238 . 
 A second road in California was built by Horace Gasquet , who acquired a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet , California — where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge — in 1857 . In 1881 , he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain , shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps . Tolls were charged starting in 1882 , and in 1887 the road was completed . Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River to the mouth of the South Fork , including a suspension bridge across that waterway , and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City . 
 As part of Oregon 's initial state highway system , the road from Grants Pass southwest to Wilderville and then along the Crescent City Plank Road to the state line was named the Grants Pass @-@ Crescent City Highway No. 25 in November 1917 . At the time , the Grants Pass @-@ Crescent City route , via the Gasquet Toll Road , was a narrow , winding unpaved mountain road with long grades and some remaining plank road in California . California added its portion to the state highway system in 1919 , for the state 's third highway bond issue , as an extension of Legislative Route 1 . By 1924 , the road was part of the Redwood Highway , which continued south to Sausalito , but was still completely unimproved between Crescent City and Waldo , Oregon . ( Oregon changed the Grants Pass @-@ Crescent City Highway name to Redwood Highway in May 1924 . ) A new highway between Gasquet and Kerby was completed by the two states in September 1926 , and in June 1929 the new <unk> Bridge over the Smith River was dedicated , bypassing the remainder of the old road over Howland Hill . In 1948 , US 199 became part of the Winnemucca to the Sea Highway , organized to promote the route that has largely become Nevada State Route 140 and Oregon Route 140 from I @-@ 80 at Winnemucca , Nevada to Crescent City . One major improvement to the highway 's alignment was made after 1929 : the Collier Tunnel replaced the winding route over Hazel View Summit in California on July 20 , 1963 . 
 Neither of the early designations — Highway 25 and Route 1 - was marked ( signs posted by the California State Automobile Association used the Redwood Highway name ) , but in 1926 it became U.S. Route 199 , a branch of US 99 from Grants Pass to US 101 in Crescent City . Oregon moved the Pacific Highway No. 1 from present OR 99 to I @-@ 5 , which bypassed Grants Pass , in 1959 , and the Redwood Highway No. 25 was extended north through downtown Grants Pass to I @-@ 5 . A proposed branch on M Street to I @-@ 5 east of downtown was also included in Highway 25 , but this was moved to the E and F Streets one @-@ way pair in 1961 . ( I @-@ 5 here was built in the early 1960s , but US 99 remained on the old alignment . ) On the California side of the state line , US 199 was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 and the State Scenic Highway System in 1963 ; in the 1964 renumbering the Route 1 designation was dropped , making Route 199 the legislative number . Although US 299 and US 399 became state routes in 1964 , the shorter US 199 , which crossed a state line , remained . US 99 has since become Oregon Route 99 through Grants Pass , and US 199 now ends at I @-@ 5 . The spur east from downtown Grants Pass to I @-@ 5 was built at the same time as I @-@ 5 , and in 1991 it was moved from E and F Streets to bypass downtown on the new Grants Pass Parkway .

 Somewhere is a 2010 American drama film written and directed by Sofia Coppola . The film follows Johnny Marco ( played by Stephen Dorff ) , a newly famous actor , as he recuperates from a minor injury at the Chateau Marmont , a well @-@ known Hollywood retreat . Despite money , fame and professional success , Marco is trapped in an existential crisis and feels little emotion during his daily life . When his ex @-@ wife suffers an unexplained breakdown and goes away , she leaves Cleo ( Elle Fanning ) , their 11 @-@ year @-@ old daughter , in his care . They spend time together and her presence helps Marco mature and accept adult responsibility . The film explores ennui among Hollywood stars , the father – daughter relationship and offers an oblique comedy of show business , particularly Hollywood film @-@ making and the life of a " star " . 
 Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival where it received the Golden Lion award for best picture . Critical opinion was mildly positive . Reviewers praised the patience of the film 's visual style and its empathy for a handful of characters , but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola 's previous work , or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success . It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10 , 2010 , and in the United States on December 22 , 2010 . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 As the film opens a black Ferrari circles on a race track in the desert , its engine roaring in and out of the shot . When it eventually stops , Johnny Marco ( Stephen Dorff ) steps out . Marco is a Hollywood actor who , despite his recent rise to fame , does not feel much meaning in his daily life . He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film : he is photographed with his co @-@ star ( Michelle Monaghan ) , gives interviews to the press , and attends an award ceremony in Italy . Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy ( Chris Pontius ) , a fellow actor and childhood friend , Marco spends much time alone , driving his Ferrari motorcar , drinking beer , taking pills , and having casual sex with various women . Twice he has pole @-@ dancing twins ( Kristina and <unk> Shannon ) set up their equipment and perform in his room , the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic . 
 He receives an unexpected visit from his 11 @-@ year @-@ old daughter , Cleo ( Elle Fanning ) . Her stay changes his lifestyle little at first , including his indulging an overnight visitor , a blonde woman . Johnny and his daughter spend time together in his hotel suite and he brings her with him on his daily routine and on a publicity trip to Milan ( where he is awarded with a " <unk> " , in a show with local celebrities playing themselves ) , and through preparations for her departure to summer camp . As their time together grows , Johnny 's fatherly emotions emerge and force him to re @-@ assess his otherwise " successful " life . After Cleo leaves for camp Johnny calls his ex @-@ wife and tearfully breaks down admitting his unhappiness at his empty life . His ex @-@ wife is indifferent to his pain and declines his request to come see him . At the end , Johnny checks out of the hotel promising not to return , and drives his Ferrari into the countryside . He randomly stops and gets out , leaving the keys in the ignition , and walks down the highway smiling .

 Coppola 's first three films examine feminine self @-@ definition and maturation , usually in privileged circumstance . Lost in Translation ( 2003 ) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel ; Marie Antoinette ( 2006 ) , a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen , examined her loneliness . Somewhere examines similar themes of success and isolation , but from a male perspective . The film explores Marco 's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame . He appears to suffer from anhedonia , the inability to feel pleasure , but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes . " He believes he 's nothing " , summarized film critic Roger Ebert , " and it appears he 's correct " . The film 's opening shot , a Ferrari circling a race @-@ track in and out of a stationary camera position , its whine and roar rising and falling , establishes the theme of ennui . The sequence 's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax , observe and withhold expectations . Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set @-@ up , " so you 're alone with this guy and not aware that it 's a movie . But I hope it 's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there . Something that gives you a chance to take a breath " . 
 The Chateau Marmont , a well @-@ known retreat for Hollywood celebrities , is the film 's setting and can be " either a paradise of easy wish @-@ fulfillment or a purgatory of celebrity anomie " ( A.O. Scott ) , but Coppola subtly conveys the emptiness of Marco 's situation without denying its appeal . Coppola has stayed at the hotel , and said " I 've seen a few Johnny Marcos " ; in contrast , writing the part of the daughter , she drew on childhood experiences with her director father , Francis Ford Coppola , such as attending film festivals , though she denied the film was autobiographical . Coppola said that cultural depictions of fame are unbalanced , and at a time when so many strive for it she is trying to show a different side of it . 
 = = = Parenthood = = = 
 Coppola mentioned that the parental angle was inspired by the birth of her second child . As the film progresses the " tender and temporary " father – daughter relationship comes to the fore . Marco has partial custody of his daughter from a failed marriage . Ebert speculates that she probably understands the reasons for the split better than he , and wonders why the child must suffer his hedonism and " detached attempts at fatherhood " . In some ways Cleo — having grown up inside the Hollywood bubble — mothers her father , cooking for him and being more worldly aware , but she also watches him with the wide @-@ eyed adoration of a child . 
 = = = Comedy of show @-@ business = = = 
 Coppola comes from a family of film @-@ makers and actors , and she has said how childhood memories of living in hotels partially inspired her choice of setting . Somewhere presents a detailed portrait of life in that industry and charts its existential and emotional boundaries . While celebrity gossip websites inform us of the shallowness of much of " star life " , Coppola 's feature differs in its emotional depth . She wanted to depict Marco working , but not on a film set . Instead he is shown giving interviews , being photographed , attending an awards ceremony in Italy , and having special effects make @-@ up applied . When Marco attends the special @-@ effects department his face is covered in latex , the camera then very slowly , hypnotically zooms in . Marco is obliged to use his " star " recognition to help promote his new film , when his publicist calls he becomes passive and mechanically takes the arranged chauffeured car and speaks to the press . In part , the humor derives from Marco 's subdued response to these attentions , and Coppola 's off @-@ beat observation of people around him . At the Venice film festival , critics highlighted the repetition of characters in a cloistered existence in Coppola 's films , to which she responded " I feel like everyone should tell what they know in the world that they know " . 
 = = Production = = 
 Scenes from the film are said to be inspired by the director 's childhood experiences as the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola . She recalls sampling all the gelato flavors on a Milanese hotel 's room service menu , a trip to Italy , a helicopter ride , and though she said there was a " personal connection " to the film , she denied it was an autobiography . Rather , she based the character of Cleo on a friend 's daughter whose parents work in Hollywood and used her own experiences to relate to the character and add a realistic touch . Federico Fellini 's Toby Dammit ( 1968 ) has also been noted as an influence . Meanwhile , the parental focus of the film developed because Coppola had recently had her second child . Coppola said that she thought of Dorff to play Marco early while writing the film , because he had an aura of " the bad @-@ boy actor , " but also " this really sweet , sincere side . " 
 Coppola wanted a minimalist look for the film , especially after the mixed reactions to her richly costumed Marie Antoinette . The overall effect was to be " sweet and genuine but without being sappy . " For the visual style she discussed Bruce Weber 's Hollywood portraits and Helmut Newton 's photographs of models at the Chateau Marmont , and Jeanne <unk> , 23 quai du Commerce , 1080 Bruxelles ( 1975 ) , a film by Chantal Akerman about the routine of a Belgian housewife , with Harris Savides , the cinematographer . He said , " The main thing was to tell the story really simply and let it play out in long beats and have the audience discover the moment . " Coppola used the lenses that her father had used to film Rumble Fish ( 1983 ) in an effort to give the film a more period look , although it is set in the present . 
 Before filming began Dorff , Fanning , and Lala Sloatman ( who plays Marco 's ex @-@ wife ) improvised meals and fights to understand the family 's dynamic . Dorff also collected Fanning from school and they spent an afternoon together to bond . Dorff stayed in the Chateau Marmont during principal photography , making it easier to get to the set and understand the character . Coppola also showed Dorff Paper Moon ( 1973 ) during production . 
 Filming took place in Los Angeles and Italy in June and July 2009 . Benicio del Toro , Erin Wasson and members of the band Rooney have cameos in the film . In a feature for The New York Times website , Coppola discussed making the scene when Marco visits a special effects studio . She said she initially was unsure of how to approach it , but Savides did a long , slow zoom which captures his breathing and creates a sense of claustrophobia . Despite many takes , Dorff was a " good sport " , she said . The sound of the phone ringing was added by Sarah Flack , the editor , to indicate that Marco has been forgotten .

 Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 3 , 2010 , and it was released in Italy on the same day . At the festival 's close ( September 11 ) , the jury unanimously awarded Somewhere the Golden Lion , the festival 's prize for the best overall film . Quentin Tarantino , president of the jury , said the film " grew and grew in our hearts , in our minds , in our affections " after the first screening . Focus Features distributed Somewhere in North America and most other territories . Pathé released the film in France on January 5 , 2011 , while <unk> distributed it in Japan .

 Somewhere received positive reviews and has a " certified fresh " score of 72 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 179 reviews with an average score of 6 @.@ 6 out of 10 . The critical consensus states : " It covers familiar territory for Sofia Coppola , but Somewhere remains a hypnotic , seductively pensive meditation on the nature of celebrity , anchored by charming performances from Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning " . The film also has a score of 67 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 40 reviews . 
 Sight and Sound magazine , published by the British Film Institute , described Somewhere as " going round in circles " and noted that many viewers would " write off Coppola 's film as the whining of the privileged " , but also acknowledged " a delicate portrait of a still @-@ maturing pre @-@ teen daughter " . During the 2010 National Board of Review Awards , Sofia Coppola was given the Special Filmmaking Achievement Award for writing , directing and producing Somewhere . 
 Roger Ebert , writing in the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , awarded the film four out of four stars and praised the detail in the portrait of Johnny Marco , saying " Coppola is a fascinating director . She sees , and we see exactly what she sees . " A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film " exquisite , melancholy and formally audacious " and said " This is not a matter of imitation , but rather of mastery , of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment . If you pay close attention , " Somewhere " will show you everything . " Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian , awarding the film two stars from five . He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely , lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing " the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered " ; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and " really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time . " 
 <unk> , a French cinema website , calculated a score of 2 @.@ 9 stars out of 5 from twenty @-@ six press reviews . French newspaper Le Monde gave the film a positive review , saying Somewhere was Coppola 's most minimalist and daring film . Coppola 's films , it said , deal with " the delicate irony of the delinquency of a universe of the happy few " , which is both to her credit and a ghost which haunts her , a loyalty ensnaring her . France 24 said the " virtuosity of Coppola is also in her keeping empathy for the characters without pouring out mushy sentiment . " Richard Roeper said that Somewhere is one of the best films of 2010 , ranking it number 10 .

 = USS Rhode Island ( BB @-@ 17 ) = 
 USS Rhode Island ( BB @-@ 17 ) was the last of five Virginia @-@ class battleships built for the United States Navy , and was the second ship to carry her name . She was laid down in May 1902 , launched in May 1904 , and commissioned into the Atlantic Fleet in February 1906 . The ship was armed with an offensive battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) guns and eight 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) guns , and she was capable of a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . 
 The ship 's career primarily consisted of training with the other battleships of the Atlantic Fleet . Rhode Island took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907 – 09 , and thereafter largely remained in the Atlantic . In late 1913 , she cruised the Caribbean coast of Mexico to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Rhode Island was assigned to anti @-@ submarine patrols off the east coast of the US . Starting in December 1918 , after the end of the war , the ship was used to repatriate American soldiers . She carried over 5 @,@ 000 men in the course of five trips . She was briefly transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 1919 before being decommissioned in 1920 and sold for scrap in 1923 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 = = Design = = 
 Rhode Island was 441 feet 3 inches ( 134 @.@ 49 m ) long overall and had a beam of 76 ft 3 in ( 23 @.@ 24 m ) and a draft of 23 ft 9 in ( 7 @.@ 24 m ) . She displaced 14 @,@ 948 long tons ( 15 @,@ 188 t ) as designed and up to 16 @,@ 094 long tons ( 16 @,@ 352 t ) at full load . The ship was powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion steam engines rated at 19 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 000 kW ) and twelve coal @-@ fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers , generating a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . As built , she was fitted with heavy military masts , but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909 . She had a crew of 812 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch / 40 Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . The secondary battery consisted of eight 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) / 45 guns and twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) / 45 guns . The 8 @-@ inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets ; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets , with the other two turrets abreast the forward funnel . The 6 @-@ inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull . For close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats , she carried twelve 3 @-@ inch / 50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3 @-@ pounder guns . She also carried two 1 @-@ pounder guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , Rhode Island carried four 21 in ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . 
 Rhode Island 's main armored belt was 11 in ( 279 mm ) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and 6 in ( 152 mm ) elsewhere . The main battery gun turrets ( and the secondary turrets on top of them ) had 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) thick faces , and the supporting barbettes had 10 in ( 250 mm ) of armor plating . The conning tower had 9 in ( 230 mm ) thick sides .

 Rhode Island was laid down at the Fore River Shipyard in Massachusetts on 1 May 1902 and was launched on 17 May 1904 . The ship was completed less than a year later , on 19 February 1906 . The ship conducted an extensive shakedown cruise and sea trials before steaming to Hampton Roads , where she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron , Atlantic Fleet on 1 January 1907 . She left Hampton Roads on 9 March 1907 , bound for Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . There , she and the rest of the 1st Squadron conducted maneuvers and gunnery training . After the conclusion of these exercises , she returned to the east coast of the United States for a cruise to Cape Cod Bay . On 8 December , Rhode Island returned to Hampton Roads , where she and fifteen other battleships held a naval review at the start of the cruise of the Great White Fleet . The battleships were joined by transports and a squadron of torpedo boats . On 16 December , President Theodore Roosevelt reviewed the fleet before it departed on the first leg of the trip . 
 The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America , making stops in Port of Spain , Rio de Janeiro , Punta Arenas , and Valparaíso , among other cities . After arriving in Mexico in March 1908 , the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice . The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas , stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia , stopping in Hawaii on the way . Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne , Sydney , and Auckland . The fleet then turned north for the Philippines , stopping in Manila , before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama . Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November . The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean ; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said , Egypt . The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar , where an international fleet of British , Russian , French , and Dutch warships greeted the Americans . The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 , having traveled 46 @,@ 729 nautical miles ( 86 @,@ 542 km ; 53 @,@ 775 mi ) . There , they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt . 
 After the conclusion of the review , Rhode Island steamed to New York for an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard . During the overhaul , on 8 March , the ship was assigned to the 3rd Division , 1st Squadron . After emerging from the dry dock , she resumed her normal peacetime routine of maneuvers with the rest of the squadron , gunnery practice , and training cruises . In February 1910 she was sent on a cruise in the Caribbean . The ship was reassigned to the 4th Division , 1st Squadron on 20 October , and two weeks later she and the rest of the squadron held a naval review in Boston for President William Howard Taft on 2 November . The ships then crossed the Atlantic to visit European ports ; Rhode Island went to Gravesend . During the cruise , the fleet conducted large scale battle and reconnaissance training . Rhode Island and the rest of the ships recrossed the Atlantic and stopped in Guantanamo Bay on 13 January 1911 . 
 The ship then resumed her peacetime routine , which lasted for the next three years , punctuated only by a cruise to Key West , Florida and Havana and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba in June – July 1912 . Upon her return , she was reassigned temporarily as the flagship of the 3rd Division on 17 July . This duty was short @-@ lived , and on 1 August the divisional commander transferred his flag to her sister ship New Jersey . On 28 June 1913 , Rhode Island again became the divisional flagship , and this stint lasted until 18 January 1914 . In late 1913 , the US Navy began to become increasingly involved in the Mexican Revolution ; in late 1913 , Rhode Island cruised off Veracruz , Tampico , and Tuxpan to protect American nationals in the country . In February 1914 , the ship left the area and stopped in Guantanamo Bay for two weeks before continuing on to the United States to return to her normal routine . 
 The ship went on two cruises to show the flag in the Caribbean , the first from October 1914 to March 1915 , and the second from January to February 1916 . During this period , she served as the flagship for the 4th Division , 1st Squadron , from 19 December 1914 to 20 January 1915 . On 15 May 1916 , she was reduced to the fleet reserve at the Boston Navy Yard , and formally removed from the Atlantic Fleet the following day . From 24 June to 28 September , she served as the flagship of the Commander in Chief , Reserve Force , Atlantic Fleet . Rhode Island was placed back in commission on 27 March 1917 , as tensions with Germany rose dramatically as the result of the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign that had been launched earlier in the year . The United States declared war on 6 April , and on 3 May , the ship became the flagship of Battleship Division 3 , Atlantic Fleet . The ship 's crew underwent extensive training to bring the ship up to combat readiness before she was assigned to anti @-@ submarine patrols off Tangier Island , Maryland . She was based out of Hampton Roads into 1918 . 
 In April , Rhode Island was transferred to Battleship Division 2 , and in June , she conducted torpedo proving trials . At the end of the war in November , the ship was assigned to the operation to transport American soldiers back from France . The first trip started on 18 December ; Rhode Island and Virginia steamed to Brest , France , where they arrived on 30 December . The two ships took on 2 @,@ 043 men between them during a three @-@ day stay in the port . Over the course of four further trips , the last of which ended on 4 July 1919 , she carried more than 5 @,@ 000 men to Boston . On 17 July , she was assigned as the flagship of Battleship Squadron 1 , Pacific Fleet . She left Boston five days later and cruised down to Balboa , at the entrance to the Panama Canal . After transiting the canal , Rhode Island steamed north , to Mare Island Navy Yard , where she remained through 1920 . On 30 June , she was decommissioned and placed in reserve . According to the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty , Rhode Island was sold for scrap on 1 November 1923 and broken up . The ship 's bell is preserved on display at the Rhode Island State House .

 The number of staff in the kitchen has increased from four when it first opened to 42 , resulting in a ratio of one kitchen staff member per customer .

 The restaurant is known for its fourteen @-@ course tasting menu featuring dishes such as nitro scrambled egg and bacon ice cream , an Alice in Wonderland inspired mock turtle soup involving a bullion packet made up to look like a fob watch dissolved in tea , and a dish called Sound of the Sea which includes an audio element . The restaurant has an associated laboratory where Blumenthal and his team develop new dish concepts . 
 In 2009 the restaurant suffered from the largest norovirus outbreak ever documented at a restaurant with over 400 diners falling unwell . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Fat Duck is located in Bray in the High Street . Chef proprietor Heston Blumenthal has owned the premises since it opened at the location in 1995 . It is not the only Michelin three @-@ star restaurant in Bray , the other being Michel Roux 's restaurant The Waterside Inn . In 2007 there were only four restaurants in the entire United Kingdom with three Michelin stars . 
 The restaurant has fourteen tables , and can seat 42 diners . It has a very high proportion of chefs working at the restaurant , 42 , equating to one chef per diner . Much of the menu is developed by experimentation : for example , the egg and bacon ice cream came about following Blumenthal investigating the principles of " flavour encapsulation " . A research laboratory where Blumenthal and his team develop dishes is two doors away opposite the Hinds Head pub , which is also owned by the chef . It was where the majority of the laboratory scenes for the television series Heston Blumenthal : In Search of Perfection were filmed . The lab equipment includes a centrifuge which is used to make chocolate wine , and a vacuum oven . The restaurant takes reservations up to 2 months in advance , and in 2011 it was receiving some 30 @,@ 000 calls for reservations per day , although that figure also included people who couldn 't get through and were <unk> .

 Blumenthal was inspired as a teenager by trips to the Michelin @-@ starred restaurants in France and the work of Harold McGee . McGee 's work in particular led him to question traditional cooking techniques and approaches which resulted in combinations which may at first appear unusual . Blumenthal incorporates psychology and the perception of diners into his dishes , explaining , " For example , eat sardine on toast sorbet for the first time , confusion will reign as the brain will be trying to tell the palate to expect a dessert and you will therefore be tasting more sweetness than actually exists . " The restaurant serves a fourteen @-@ course tasting menu . 
 Dishes served include palate cleansers made of vodka and green tea , frozen in liquid nitrogen , a snail porridge that was described by one food critic as " infamous " , and ice creams of both crab , and egg and bacon , each of which resulted in increased media attention for the restaurant . The mock turtle soup has an Alice in Wonderland theme , where a fob watch formed of freeze @-@ dried beef stock covered with gold leaf is dropped into a tea cup and has a beef stock " tea " poured over it that dissolves the gold and the watch . A plate of ox tongue and vegetables is served alongside it to place into the soup . Toast sandwiches are served as a side dish . It had been developed for an appearance on Heston 's Feasts , and was afterwards added to the menu at the restaurant . Dishes are served with additional sensory inputs , such as " Sounds of the Sea " , a plate of seafood served with a seafood foam on top of a " beach " of tapioca , breadcrumbs and eel . Alongside the dish , diners are given an iPod to listen to crashing waves whilst they eat . Other additional sensory components include " The smell of the Black Forest " that accompanies a <unk> ice cream . 
 = = History = = 
 The Fat Duck is located in a 16th @-@ century cottage that was further modified in the 19th and 20th centuries . Prior to the restaurant opening in the location , it was a public house called The Ringers . The building was Grade II listed by English Heritage on 2 May 1989 . When the restaurant opened in 1995 , the kitchen was staffed by owner Heston Blumenthal and one other employee . At the time the restaurant was serving meals in the style of a French bistro , such as lemon tarts , and steak and chips . Blumenthal later said that science had already begun to influence the cooking at this early stage , as already on the menu were his Triple Cooked Chips , which were developed to stop the potato from going soft . 
 The restaurant came close to going bankrupt , Blumenthal sold his house , his car and many of his possessions in order to keep the restaurant afloat . After four years , the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin star in the 1999 list . Blumenthal worked with Professor Peter Barham of the University of Bristol , and developed a menu of dishes through experimentation such as slow @-@ cooked lamb which avoids shocking the fibres in the meat and causing them to seize . By 2000 , techniques were being used such as cooking vegetables in mineral water after discovering that the levels of calcium in tap water causes their discolouration , and freezing cuttlefish to break down the molecules in them in order to increase their tenderness . In 2001 it was awarded a second Michelin star , and was also named Restaurant of the Year by The Automobile Association . 
 In 2004 , the restaurant was awarded three Michelin stars , becoming one of three restaurants in the United Kingdom to hold that level of recognition alongside the Waterside Inn , also in Bray , and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London . It was the fastest that a restaurant had gone from one to three stars in the UK . During the same year , the restaurant was ranked second in the world behind The French Laundry by The World 's 50 Best Restaurants . The restaurant also received the title of Square Meal BMW Best UK Restaurant 2004 . The following year the listing ranked The Fat Duck as the best restaurant in the world , At the first Front of House Awards in 2007 , the restaurant won the awards for Overall Service and Front Desk of the Year . 
 In 2008 , Blumenthal published The Big Fat Duck Cookbook , following his BBC series ' Heston Blumenthal : In Search of <unk> 
 On 19 November 2012 , British citizen Ivan <unk> Herrera Jorge and Swede Carl Magnus Lindgren , two senior members of The Fat Duck restaurant , were killed on Chai Wan Road , Hong Kong in a traffic accident when their taxi was hit by two buses . They died along with the taxi driver , Wong Kim @-@ chung . A further 56 people were injured in the accident . Blumenthal had been in Hong Kong and was travelling in a separate cab at the time of the crash . 
 On 31 March 2014 , Heston Blumenthal announced he would be closing the restaurant for renovations for 6 months and temporarily relocating it with its entire team to Crown Towers , Melbourne , Australia . The restaurant will be called The Fat Duck for 6 months before being renamed Dinner by Heston Blumenthal . This will be the second restaurant with that name and will be Blumenthal 's first restaurant outside of Britain , and his sixth in total . 
 = = Food scare , closure , and reopening = = 
 On 27 February 2009 , Blumenthal closed his restaurant temporarily after a number of customers reported feeling unwell at different times . By 3 March the source of the outbreak was still unclear but sabotage had been ruled out . A spokesman for the restaurant said " All this leads us to believe that it [ the health scare ] has not come from the restaurant and we expect to be given the all clear . " On 6 March it was reported that 400 people had stated they had felt unwell after eating at the restaurant . Boxing promoter Frank Warren said he was " very disappointed " with his treatment after becoming sick following his visit . He said " Everything was fabulous about the evening – the food , the setting , the service , it was unbelievably good but unfortunately , afterwards , all of us were ill " . 
 The restaurant reopened on 12 March 2009 . The cause of the illness was later given by the Health Protection Agency as norovirus , which was thought to originate from oysters which had been harvested from beds contaminated with sewage . The virus was spread further after being contracted by staff members . The restaurant was criticised for its cleaning methods and its slow response to the incident . Complaints of illness from customers totalled 529 . 
 The Fat Duck had received negative publicity regarding health standards before , when a food and safety test in 2004 found that " three out of the four samples were found to be unsatisfactory " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Fodor 's describes the restaurant as " extraordinary " and " one of the best restaurants in the country " . Frommer 's gives the restaurant three stars , grading it as " exceptional " . 
 In September 1996 , Ben Rogers ate at the restaurant for The Independent before it had gained any Michelin stars or the awards it has today and while it was still using something close to its original menu . Even so , he discovered that Blumenthal was cooking foie gras in sherry in order to give it a nutty flavour , although Rogers wasn 't sure if the nutty flavour was warranted in the dish itself . He did think that a <unk> of duck was worth praising , describing it as " delicious " , but also thought that another dish of monkfish was rubbery in texture . He described the menu itself as " awkwardly written , badly punctuated , and at points quite impenetrable " . Following the first Michelin star , David Fingleton visited the restaurant for The Spectator , and said that the experience was " beyond reproach ; unsullied pleasure from start to finish " . 
 In 2001 , Terry Durack reviewed the restaurant for The Independent . He was initially hesitant as he expected tricks straight away and was surprised to find a bowl of normal green olives on the table as he arrived . He didn 't think much of a mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup , but described the restaurant as " great " and gave it a score of seventeen out of twenty . Following the third Michelin star , Jan Moir of The Daily Telegraph visited the restaurant but disliked it , saying that " while many of the flavours are politely interesting , the relentless <unk> textures of <unk> and foams and creams and poached meats really begins to grate " . She also thought the restaurant was overpriced , calling it " The Fat Profit " . 
 Matthew Fort reviewed the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005 , he said that " there is no doubt that the Fat Duck is a great restaurant and Heston Blumenthal the most original and remarkable chef this country has ever produced " . A. A. Gill for The Times recommended that people should " eat here at least once to find out what is really going on in your mouth " . Also in 2005 , German food critic Wolfram <unk> visited the restaurant complained of the delays in service and of several of the dishes , described the mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup as a " fart of nothingness " , while chef Nico Ladenis said of the restaurant , " Someone who makes egg and bacon ice cream is hailed a genius . If you vomit and make ice cream out of it , are you a star ? " Tony Naylor of The Guardian enjoyed his trip to the restaurant in 2008 , and afterwards criticised those who thought that spending £ 323 @.@ 13 on a meal for two at lunchtime was too much . 
 In 2005 the restaurant was ranked 1st on the list of The World 's 50 Best Restaurants . After spending 11 years on the list , it has dropped down to 73rd in the top 100 . It has been ranked second best on numerous occasions , first behind The French Laundry and then behind El Bulli . In 2012 , it was ranked in thirteenth place . In 2010 , it was named the Best UK Restaurant in the <unk> Awards , a scheme run by the <unk> Group . 
 In 2009 , it was the only restaurant to be given a top score of ten out of ten in the Good Food Guide . The editor of the guide , Elizabeth Carter , explained the reason for the score , " It 's extremely rare that a restaurant cooks perfectly on a consistent basis , but we 've had so many superlative reports that we 're delighted to recognise The Fat Duck as the best restaurant in Britain . " It retained that top score through to the 2013 edition of the guide .

 = 2015 Giro d 'Italia = 
 The 2015 Giro d 'Italia ( English : Tour of Italy ) was a three @-@ week Grand Tour cycling stage race that took place in May 2015 . It was the 98th running of the Giro d 'Italia and took place principally in Italy , although some stages visited France and Switzerland . The 3 @,@ 481 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @,@ 163 @.@ 5 mi ) race included 21 stages , beginning in San Lorenzo al Mare on 9 May and concluding in Milan on 31 May . It was the fifteenth race of the 2015 UCI World Tour . The Giro was won by Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , with Fabio Aru ( Astana ) second and Aru 's teammate Mikel Landa third . 
 Contador first took the lead after stage 5 , the race 's first uphill finish . His defence of the maglia rosa ( the pink jersey awarded to the winner of the race ) was put in doubt when he injured his left shoulder in a crash in the sixth stage . He held his lead through several stages stage but was caught up in another crash in stage 13 , which caused him to lose the lead . He took the lead back the following day in the 59 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 36 @.@ 9 mi ) Individual time trial , where he gained a lead of several minutes over all his rivals . Despite aggressive riding from Aru and Landa in the final week , Contador was able to defend his lead to the finish of the race . This was his second Giro d 'Italia title , after the 2008 race . 
 As well as finishing second overall , Aru won the white jersey as the best young rider in the week . Giacomo Nizzolo ( Trek Factory Racing ) won the points competition and Giovanni Visconti ( Movistar ) won the mountains classification . Astana finished first in both the team ranking by time and the team ranking by points . Contador , Visconti and Nizzolo all won their classifications without winning any stage victories . 
 = = Teams = = 
 As the Giro d 'Italia was a UCI World Tour event , all seventeen UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to send a squad . Five UCI Professional Continental teams were given wildcard places in the race by RCS Sport , the race organisers . Four of these were Italian @-@ based teams : Androni Giocattoli , Bardiani – CSF , Nippo – Vini Fantini and Southeast Pro Cycling . Southeast 's entry in the race was earned by their victory in the 2014 Coppa Italia , when they competed as Neri Sottoli ; they were invited despite three recent doping cases in the team . The final wildcard place was awarded to CCC – Sprandi – Polkowice , a Polish @-@ based team . CCC @-@ Sprandi @-@ Polkowice 's invitation immediately received attention because the team 's roster included two prominent riders who has previously served bans for doping : Stefan Schumacher and Davide Rebellin . The day after the announcement , Cycling Weekly reported that the team might omit the riders from its squad for the race . 
 Several prominent teams applied for wildcard places but were unsuccessful . These were UnitedHealthcare , Colombia , Wanty – Groupe Gobert and Caja Rural – Seguros RGA . 
 The team presentation took place in San Remo on the evening before the first stage . As each team sent nine riders to the race , the <unk> contained 198 riders . George Bennett ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) was withdrawn from the <unk> on the night before the race , however , as a blood test had revealed low cortisol levels . As his team was part of the Movement for Credible Cycling ( MPCC ) , he was not allowed to start the Giro . LottoNL – Jumbo therefore began the race with eight riders and there were 197 riders in the peloton at the beginning of the race . This included riders from 36 different countries , with the largest numbers coming from Italy ( 59 ) , France ( 15 ) , Belgium ( 12 ) and the Netherlands ( 12 ) . The average age of riders in the Giro was 28 @.@ 95 ; they ranged from the 21 @-@ year @-@ old Rick Zabel ( BMC Racing Team ) to the 41 @-@ year @-@ old Alessandro Petacchi ( Southeast ) . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 The winner of the 2014 Giro d 'Italia , Nairo Quintana ( Movistar Team ) , chose not to defend his title in order to focus on the Tour de France . The principal favourite for the race was Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , especially as Chris Froome ( Team Sky ) and Vincenzo Nibali ( Astana ) , two of the most successful active Grand Tour riders , also chose to focus on the Tour and to skip the Giro . Contador , who had won the 2014 Vuelta a España , was attempting to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same season . No rider had achieved this double since Marco Pantani in 1998 ; Contador described his ambition to do " something that people will remember forever " . Contador 's last attempt to win both the Giro and the Tour – in the 2011 season – ended in failure . Although he finished first in the Giro , he only managed fifth place in the Tour ; both results were subsequently removed because of a ban due to a doping case from 2010 . 
 The rider considered most likely to challenge Contador for the general classification was Richie Porte ( Sky ) . Porte had already achieved nine race victories in 2015 , including the overall victories in Paris – Nice , the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro del Trentino . Porte was expected to be particularly strong in the individual time trial , as well as in the mountains . Porte had not shown consistent form in a Grand Tour in recent years , however , and there were doubts about his ability to maintain his form over a three @-@ week race . 
 Rigoberto Urán ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) – who had finished second in 2013 and 2014 – was also among the favourites , with the long individual time trial expected to suit him . Fabio Aru ( Astana ) – who had finished third in 2014 – was also expected to perform well ; VeloNews described him as " perhaps the best pure climber in the race " . Other riders expected to challenge for the higher places included Ilnur Zakarin ( Team Katusha ) , who had just won the Tour de Romandie , Domenico Pozzovivo ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Jurgen Van den Broeck ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Damiano Caruso ( BMC ) and Ryder Hesjedal ( Cannondale – Garmin ) , the winner of the 2012 Giro d 'Italia . Four former winners of the Giro started the 2015 edition : Contador , Hesjedal , Ivan Basso ( Tinkoff @-@ Saxo ) and Damiano Cunego ( Nippo – Vini Fantini ) . 
 Other prominent riders to start the race included a large number of prominent sprinters , including André Greipel ( Lotto @-@ Soudal ) and Michael Matthews ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) . Greipel was expected to perform well in the few flat stages . Matthews had the ability to win hillier stages ; his team 's strength in the team time trial was expected to put him into the maglia rosa during the first week ; he had also worn the jersey in the first week of the 2014 Giro . Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , a former world champion , participated in the Giro for the first time in his career . 
 = = Route and stages = = 
 The first announcement of the route for the 2015 Giro came in July 2014 , when RCS Sport announced that it would begin with a team time trial from San Lorenzo al Mare along the coast to San Remo . The route would use the Riviera dei <unk> cycle path and would start at the foot of the Cipressa climb made famous by its inclusion in the Milan – San Remo classic . The route used neither the climb of the Cipressa nor that of the Poggio di San Remo ; it kept to the coastline and was entirely flat . The stage would end on the <unk> Italo Calvino in San Remo . The following two stages were announced at the same time . The second stage – the first mass @-@ start stage of the race – would suit the sprinters , while the third stage would take the riders to La Spezia , where the small climb of the <unk> would come towards the end of the stage . A further route announcement was made in mid @-@ September . Mauro <unk> , the race director , announced that the Giro would return to the climb of the Madonna di Campiglio for the first time since 1999 . In the 1999 Giro , Marco Pantani won the stage that finished on the climb and was in the race lead ; he tested positive for EPO , however , and was expelled from the race . The full route announcement was made in Milan on 6 October at an event attended by many riders expected to participate in the Giro . 
 An additional stage in Liguria was included in the route . This was the new third stage , with the stage to La Spezia now stage 4 . The additional stage was hilly but had a long flat section towards the finish . The first summit finish of the race came on the second @-@ category climb of the <unk> at the end of stage 5 . There was then one flat stage , which was followed by the hilly stage 7 , which was the longest stage in any Giro d 'Italia since 2000 at 263 kilometres ( 163 mi ) . These took the riders south along the Tyrrhenian coast and into Campania and then inland towards the southern Apennines . The race then entered the mountains for stages 8 and 9 . Stage 8 had a summit finish on the Campitello Matese ; stage 9 included mountains and hills throughout . This was followed by the race 's first rest day . 
 The rest day included a transfer to <unk> Marche on the Adriatic coast . The subsequent stages took the riders along the coast and then into the Dolomites . Immediately after the rest day , there were four relatively flat stages , although two of them included hills towards the end . These were followed by the race 's only individual time trial . This was 59 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 36 @.@ 8 mi ) in length and was one of the longest time trials in the Giro in recent years . It began with 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) of flat roads , which were followed by rolling roads towards the finish line in Valdobbiadene . After the time trial came the stage to Madonna di Campiglio , which included several other difficult climbs . This was followed by the second rest day . 
 The final week of the race began with a stage that crossed the very difficult Passo di Mortirolo on the way to a finish on a third @-@ category climb in Aprica . Cycling Weekly described this as " this year 's blockbuster stage " . This was followed by one of the flattest stages of the race , which took the Giro out of Italy for the first time in 2015 as it crossed into Switzerland for a finish in Lugano . There were then three consecutive days with high mountains . The eighteenth stage of the race started in <unk> , Switzerland in Switzerland and took the riders across the difficult Monte <unk> before a difficult descent to the finish . There were then two consecutive summit finishes on the <unk> and on Sestriere . The final stage was a largely ceremonial flat stage towards a finish in Milan . 
 The highest climb of the 2015 Giro – known as the Cima Coppi – was the Colle delle Finestre on the penultimate stage . This was 2 @,@ 178 metres ( 7 @,@ 146 ft ) above sea level . In general , the climbs were lower than in previous years , following controversy in the 2014 Giro over the crossing of the Passo dello Stelvio . The race organisers also tried to make the transfers between stages shorter . 
 = = Race overview = = 
 Stage 1 , the team time trial , was won by Orica – GreenEDGE . Simon Gerrans was the first rider to cross the line , so he became the first leader of the race . Tinkoff @-@ Saxo were second , seven seconds slower , which made Contador the best @-@ placed rider among the general classification favourites . He gained six seconds on Aru and twenty seconds on Porte . Elia Viviani won the sprint on stage 2 ; he therefore took the lead in the points classification . Michael Matthews finished seventh on the stage and moved into the maglia rosa . Matthews extended his lead by winning stage 3 in a sprint from a reduced group . There was particular concern during the stage after Domenico Pozzovivo ( AG2R La Mondiale ) crashed on a descent ; he abandoned the race and was taken to hospital . The fourth stage was won by Davide <unk> ( Cannondale – Garmin ) from an early breakaway . Astana raced aggressively in the second part of the stage and put significant pressure on the other general classification riders ; Rigoberto Urán lost more than 40 seconds , while Tinkoff @-@ Saxo appeared weak in support of Contador . Matthews lost around 20 minutes ; Simon Clarke took over the lead of the race . Clarke was the third Australian rider for the Orica – GreenEDGE team to lead the 2015 Giro . 
 Stage 5 , with its summit finish at <unk> , was also won by a rider from a breakaway , this time Jan Polanc ( Lampre – Merida ) , who attacked on the final climb and won by more than a minute . The general classification favourites attacked on the final climb ; Contador was the first to attack and was followed by Aru and Porte . They were then joined by Mikel Landa , Aru 's teammate , and gained time over all the other riders . Clarke lost over two minutes to Contador , Aru and Porte ; he therefore lost the maglia rosa and Contador became the new leader of the race , two seconds ahead of Aru and twenty ahead of Porte . Contador 's lead came under threat the following day . The stage was won by Greipel in a sprint finish , but there was a large crash in the final metres . This was caused by a spectator who was leaning over the crash barriers with a camera ; Daniele Colli ( Nippo – Vini Fantini ) collided with him and caused a large number of riders to crash behind him . Contador was among the riders to crash ; although he finished the stage on the same time as Greipel , he was treated for a shoulder injury by his team doctor and was unable to put on the leader 's jersey on the podium . Despite suffering from the injury , Contador started and finished the following day 's stage . This was won in a sprint finish by Diego Ulissi ( Lampre @-@ Merida ) , while Contador retained the race lead . 
 Contador continued to be troubled by his injury during stage 8 , which finished on the climb of the Campitello Matese . The stage was won by <unk> Intxausti ( Movistar ) , who was in the day 's early breakaway and attacked on the final climb . Astana again rode hard to put pressure on the other riders ; eventually a group formed of Contador , Aru , Porte and Landa . Landa then attacked and finished second on the stage , 15 seconds ahead of the other three riders . He therefore moved up into fifth place overall , while Contador increased his lead over Aru by winning bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint . Stage 9 was also won by a rider from a breakaway : Paolo Tiralongo ( Astana ) took a solo victory . Aru , Contador , Porte and Landa were again alone in a group towards the end of the stage ; although they came to the finish together , Aru took a second out of the others in the sprint . This moved him to three seconds behind Contador . The following day was the first rest day of the race . 
 After the rest day , stage 10 was once again won by a rider from a breakaway : Nicola Boem ( Bardiani – CSF ) sprinted to the victory from a small group . A large group – including Contador , Aru and Landa – finished together . Porte , however , suffered a mechanical problem in the final 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) and he was unable to regain contact with the main group , despite assistance from his teammates and from Michael Matthews , Porte 's fellow Australian . Porte lost over 40 seconds to the other general classification favourites . After the stage , it was revealed that Porte had been given assistance by another Australian Orica – GreenEDGE rider , Simon Clarke . Clarke had seen Porte waiting for assistance and had given him one of his own wheels . This was illegal under UCI rules that prohibit " non @-@ regulation assistance to a rider from another team " ; Porte was therefore given a two @-@ minute time penalty and dropped to twelfth place , over three minutes behind Contador , with Landa moving up to third place . 
 Stage 11 was won by Ilnur Zakarin , who attacked from an all @-@ day breakaway 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) from the finish line and rode solo to the finish . The general classification favourites all finished together . Stage 12 finished with a short , steep climb . It was won by Philippe Gilbert ( BMC ) . Contador finished second to win six bonus seconds ; his lead was further extended as Aru and Landa both lost several seconds on the climb . Contador lost the lead the following day , however . The stage was won in a bunch sprint by Sacha Modolo ( Lampre – Merida ) ; just over 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) before the finish line , however , there was a large crash that delayed a large number of riders . Contador was one of the riders delayed in the crash ; he lost 36 seconds to Aru , who therefore took over the race lead . Porte was also caught up in the crash and lost another two minutes . 
 Stage 14 was the individual time trial , which was won by Vasil Kiryienka ( Sky ) . Contador finished third on the stage , nearly three minutes ahead of Aru . Contador therefore moved back into the race lead . Contador passed Landa on the road , despite starting three minutes after him ; Landa lost over four minutes and fell to seventh place overall . Movistar 's Andrey Amador moved up into third . Stage 15 was the final stage of the second week and was the climb to Madonna di Campiglio . Landa won the stage after Astana rode hard on the final climb ; he finished five seconds ahead of Contador and moved back up to fourth place . Contador finished a second ahead of Aru and extended his lead further due to bonus seconds for his third @-@ place finish . Porte , who had lost over 30 minutes during the weekend following the crash in stage 13 , withdrew from the race after the stage . 
 After the rest day , Landa won a second consecutive stage . Contador had suffered a puncture at the foot of the penultimate climb – the Mortirolo – and at one point was nearly a minute behind Landa and Aru . Contador caught Landa and Aru , however , then attacked them . Although Landa was able to follow Contador 's attack , Aru was not . On the final climb to Aprica , Landa attacked and won the stage , 38 seconds ahead of Contador . Aru , meanwhile , lost nearly three minutes to Landa . Landa moved up into second place , although he was still over four minutes behind Contador , with Aru now third . Sacha Modolo won his second stage the following day , in a sprint finish , with Giacomo Nizzolo ( Trek Factory Racing ) moving into the lead of the points classification . Philippe Gilbert also won a second stage of the 2015 Giro on stage 18 , escaping in a breakaway early in the day and attacking 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from the finish to take a solo victory . Contador again increased his lead , however : after Aru and Landa were caught behind a crash , Contador ordered his team to attack . Cyclingnews.com suggested this was revenge for Astana 's attack on stage 16 . <unk> then attacked alone and , after cooperation with Ryder Hesjedal , gained more than a minute on his rivals . Landa was second , over five minutes behind , with Aru a further 50 seconds back . 
 Stage 19 was the first of two consecutive summit finishes . The stage was won by Aru , who attacked early in the final climb . Contador was content to let the other riders dictate the pace in the chasing group , which finished over a minute behind Aru . Landa finished in the same group ; Aru therefore moved back ahead of him into second place overall . Aru won again on stage 20 , the final difficult stage of the Giro . Contador was isolated from his teammates early in the first of the day 's two climbs . The roads towards the top of the climb – the Colle delle Finestre – were gravel . Landa attacked around this point and Contador was unable to follow . With Contador struggling , the other riders in the group attacked . Contador was a minute behind them at the summit , with Landa further ahead . At the foot of the final climb , Landa was ordered by his team to wait for Aru with the hope that , by working together , the two riders could put enough time into Contador to win the Giro . Aru attacked in the final kilometres of the final climb to Sestriere and won the stage . Landa was 24 seconds behind . Despite losing over two minutes , Contador retained his race lead . 
 The final stage of the Giro was a flat stage ending with several laps of a circuit in Milan . It was not expected to affect the general classification , with a bunch sprint the likely conclusion . There was an attack on the finishing circuit , however , by Iljo Keisse ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Luke Durbridge ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) . Although they never had more than a minute 's lead , they were able to stay away from the peloton to the finish . Keisse won the sprint between the pair for the stage victory . Contador finished in the leading group to secure the overall victory , just under two minutes ahead of Aru . Contador thus won the overall 2015 Giro d 'Italia without winning any stage victories . 
 = = Classification leadership = = 
 In the 2015 Giro d 'Italia , four different jerseys were awarded . The first and most important is the general classification , calculated by adding each rider 's finishing times on each stage . Riders received time bonuses for finishing in the first three places on each stage ( excluding the team time trial and individual time trial ) . The rider with the lowest cumulative time was awarded the pink jersey ( the maglia rosa ) and was considered the winner of the Giro d 'Italia . 
 Additionally , there was a points classification . Riders won points for finishing in the top 15 on each stage . Flat stages award more points that mountainous stages , meaning that this classification tends to favour sprinters . In addition , points can be won in intermediate sprints . The winner of the points classification won the red jersey . 
 There was also a mountains classification . Points were awarded for reaching the top of a climb towards the front of the race . Each climb will be categorized as either first , second , third , or fourth @-@ category , with more points available for the higher @-@ categorized climbs . The Cima Coppi , the race 's highest point of elevation , awards more points than the other first @-@ category climbs . At 2 @,@ 178 metres ( 7 @,@ 146 ft ) , the Cima Coppi for the 2015 Giro d 'Italia was the unpaved Colle delle Finestre . 
 The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification . This was decided the same way as the general classification , but only riders born after 1 January 1990 were eligible . The winner of the classification was awarded a white jersey . 
 There were also two classifications for teams . In the Trofeo Fast Team classification , the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added up ; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time . The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification , with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points ( 20 for first place , 19 for second place and so on , down to a single point for 20th ) for their team . 
 Notes 
 In stage 3 , Esteban Chaves , who was second in the young riders classification , wore the white jersey , because Michael Matthews ( in first place ) wore the pink jersey as leader of the general classification during that stage . 
 In stage 14 , Davide <unk> , who was second in the young riders classification , wore the white jersey , because Fabio Aru ( in first place ) wore the pink jersey as leader of the general classification during that stage .

 = HMS Vindictive ( 1918 ) = 
 HMS Vindictive was a warship built during the First World War for the Royal Navy ( RN ) . Originally designed as a Hawkins @-@ class heavy cruiser and laid down under the name Cavendish , she was converted into an aircraft carrier while still building . Renamed in 1918 , she was completed a few weeks before the end of the war and saw no active service with the Grand Fleet . The following year she participated in the British campaign in the Baltic against the Bolsheviks during which her aircraft made numerous attacks against the naval base at Kronstadt . Vindictive returned home at the end of the year and was placed in reserve for several years before her flight decks were removed and she was reconverted back into a cruiser . The ship retained her aircraft hangar and conducted trials with a aircraft catapult before she was sent to the China Station in 1926 . A year after her return in 1928 , she was again placed in reserve . 
 Vindictive was demilitarized and converted into a training ship in 1936 – 1937 . At the beginning of the Second World War she was converted into a repair ship . Her first role after the conversion was completed in early 1940 , however , was to transport troops during the Norwegian Campaign . She was then sent to the South Atlantic to support British ships serving there and , in late 1942 , to the Mediterranean to support the ships there . Vindictive returned home in 1944 and was damaged by a German torpedo off the coast of Normandy after the Allies invaded France . She was reduced to reserve after the war and sold for scrap in 1946 . 
 = = Background and description = = 
 The Hawkins @-@ class cruiser was designed to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas . This required a large ship to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders . The design was also given high freeboard to allow it to maintain its speed in heavy weather . Sir Eustace Tennyson d 'Eyncourt , the Director of Naval Construction , included both coal and oil @-@ fired boilers to provide the ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions . Four ships were ordered , named after famous Elizabethan seafarers , in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916 , named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and <unk> Thomas Cavendish . By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended , so construction proceeded slowly . 
 The cruisers had an overall length of 605 feet ( 184 @.@ 4 m ) , a beam of 65 feet ( 19 @.@ 8 m ) , and a mean draught of 19 feet 3 inches ( 5 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . They were designed to displace 9 @,@ 750 long tons ( 9 @,@ 906 t ) and had a complement of 37 officers and 672 enlisted men . 
 The ships had four Parsons geared steam turbines , each of which drove one propeller shaft . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 60 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 45 @,@ 000 kW ) for a speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by 12 Yarrow boilers ; 8 of these were oil @-@ fired while the remaining 4 used coal . They had a stowage capacity of 800 long tons ( 810 t ) of coal and 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 600 t ) of fuel oil , giving her a range of 5 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 000 km ; 6 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . 
 The main armament of the Hawkins @-@ class cruisers consisted of seven 45 @-@ calibre 7 @.@ 5 in ( 190 mm ) Mk VI guns in pivot mounts . They were arranged in two superfiring pairs , one each fore and aft of the superstructure , one on each broadside abreast the rear funnel , and the last was on the quarterdeck at the same level as the lower of the rear superfiring pair ; they were designated 1 through 7 from front to rear . At maximum elevation these guns fired a 200 @-@ pound ( 91 kg ) shell to a range of 21 @,@ 114 yards ( 19 @,@ 307 m ) . 
 Their secondary armament comprised a dozen quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt guns . Eight of these were on low @-@ angle mounts intended for use against torpedo boats and the remaining four were on high @-@ angle mounts for anti @-@ aircraft defence . They also mounted two submerged tubes , one on each broadside , and four above @-@ water tubes , two on each broadside , for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes . 
 The Hawkins @-@ class cruisers were protected with an armour that had a maximum thickness of 4 inches abreast the ships ' magazines and a minimum thickness of 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) . It consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel of varying thicknesses that covered most of the ships ' sides . The decks had a maximum thickness of 1 – 1 @.@ 5 in ( 25 – 38 mm ) over the engine rooms , boilers , and the steering gear . The conning tower and its communication tube were protected by the only Krupp cemented armour in the ships and had thicknesses of 3 inches and 2 inches ( 51 mm ) respectively . 
 = = = Conversion into an aircraft carrier = = = 
 In January 1917 , the Board of Admiralty reviewed the navy 's aircraft carrier requirements and decided to order two ships fitted with a flying @-@ off deck as well as a landing deck aft . The initial order had to be cancelled in April 1917 for lack of building facilities , so the Admiralty decided to convert Cavendish , already under construction , in June 1917 . 
 No. 2 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch gun , two 3 @-@ inch guns and the conning tower were removed and the forward superstructure was remodelled into a 78 by 49 feet ( 23 @.@ 8 by 14 @.@ 9 m ) hangar with a capacity for six reconnaissance aircraft . The hangar roof , with a small extension , formed the 106 @-@ foot ( 32 m ) flying @-@ off deck . The aircraft were hoisted up through a hatch at the aft end of the flying @-@ off deck by two derricks . The 193 by 57 feet ( 58 @.@ 8 by 17 @.@ 4 m ) landing deck required the removal of Nos. 5 and 6 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns and moving the four 3 @-@ inch AA guns to an elevated platform between the funnels , in lieu of the 3 @-@ inch guns intended for that position . A port side gangway 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) wide connected the landing and flying @-@ off decks to allow aircraft with their wings folded to be wheeled from one to the other . A crash barrier was hung from " the gallows " at the forward end of the landing on deck . To increase her stability after the addition of so much topweight , the upper portion of her anti @-@ torpedo bulge was enlarged . 
 Although still overweight compared to her designed displacement , the modifications made the ship lighter than her sister ships , at 9 @,@ 344 long tons ( 9 @,@ 494 t ) light displacement and a metacentric height of 3 @.@ 59 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) . She completed her sea trials on 21 September 1918 and reached a speed of 29 @.@ 12 knots ( 53 @.@ 93 km / h ; 33 @.@ 51 mph ) from 63 @,@ 600 shaft horsepower ( 47 @,@ 400 kW ) . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Cavendish was laid down at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast on 26 June 1916 and launched on 17 January 1918 . In June she was renamed Vindictive , the fifth ship of that name in the RN , to perpetuate the name of the old protected cruiser Vindictive , which had distinguished herself in the Zeebrugge Raid of April 1918 and had then been sunk as a blockship at Ostend in May . She commissioned on 1 October and , after briefly working up , joined the Grand Fleet 's Flying Squadron on 18 October only a few weeks before the Armistice on 11 November . For the rest of the year she conducted flying trials and exercises , including those of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin reconnaissance aircraft , of which two were lost in accidents . The only landing aboard the ship was made by William Wakefield on 1 November in the fleet 's last operational Sopwith Pup . Experiments conducted earlier aboard the larger Furious , with a similarly intact superstructure and funnels , had demonstrated that the turbulence from these was enough to make successful landings almost impossible at high speed . Wakefield minimised the problem by approaching the landing deck at an angle with the ship slowly moving . 
 Vindictive was dispatched to the Baltic with a dozen aircraft , a mix of Griffins , Sopwith <unk> fighters , Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter and Short Type 184 bombers , on 2 July 1919 to participate in the British campaign in the Baltic in support of the White Russians and the newly independent Baltic states . On 6 July she ran aground on a shoal near Reval at speed . Stuck hard in the <unk> Baltic , all of her fuel was dumped overboard , and most of her ammunition as well . Some 2 @,@ 200 long tons ( 2 @,@ 200 t ) of stores were also off @-@ loaded , but the ship could not be towed free by the combined efforts of the light cruisers Danae and Cleopatra and three tugboats . Eight days after grounding a fortuitous westerly wind began that raised the water level by 8 inches ( 203 mm ) , just enough to pull the ship free . Unbeknownst to the British the entire operation had taken place in a minefield . 
 The carrier unloaded her air group , commanded by Major Grahame Donald , at <unk> , Finland on 14 July . Their airfield was still under construction , but they were able to fly a reconnaissance mission over the major Bolshevik naval base at Kronstadt on 26 July while Vindictive sailed to Copenhagen , Denmark , to load aircraft and spares left for her by the carrier Argus . Four days later , Rear Admiral Walter Cowan ordered Donald and his aircraft to attack Kronstadt at night . As their airfield was not yet finished , the ship 's flying @-@ off deck was extended to 118 feet ( 36 @.@ 0 m ) to better allow the bombers to take off with their 112 @-@ pound ( 51 kg ) bombs . Accurate anti @-@ aircraft fire kept the aircraft too high for an effective attack , but Donald 's men claimed two hits on the submarine tender Pamiat <unk> . In reality one bomb struck the oil tanker Tatiana , setting it on fire and killing one man . That same day eight RN Coastal Motor Boat ( CMB ) s arrived ; Vindictive served as their depot ship . 
 Vindictive 's aircraft continued to support British operations against the Bolsheviks until they left the Baltic in December , although no further missions were flown from the carrier . They shot down a helium @-@ filled observation balloon and spotted for ships conducted shore bombardments . Most importantly , nine of them attacked Kronstadt during the night of 17 / 18 August 1919 to provide a diversion for an attack by the <unk> on ships in Kronstadt harbour . As a result , the torpedo boats damaged the battleship Andrei Pervozvanny and sank Pamiat <unk> . In subsequent attacks on Kronstadt , they nearly hit Andrei Pervozvanny while she was in drydock , nearly hit a minesweeper , killing one crewman from the explosion , and hit two auxiliary ships . By December it was clear that the Whites ' offensive against Petrograd had failed and the British began withdrawing ; Vindictive left three Camels in Latvia , embarked the rest of her aircraft and sailed for home on 22 December . 
 She was paid off into reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard on 24 December and received permanent repairs of her damage from the grounding , at a cost of £ 200 @,@ 000 . Furious and Vindictive had proven that the idea of " cruiser @-@ carriers " was unworkable due to the turbulence from their superstructures and that a complete flight deck was necessary to successfully operate aircraft at sea . The Admiralty had considered converting her to that configuration , with an island , in July 1918 while still building , but had decided to wait on the results of tests conducted with Argus evaluating different designs for the island . Vindictive was thought to be too small to be an effective carrier and the financial restrictions in place after the war vitiated against such a major reconstruction . 
 = = = As cruiser = = = 
 For the next several years the ship was either in reserve or used as a troop transport , until she began reconversion into a cruiser at Chatham Dockyard on 1 March 1923 . The flight decks were removed and she was mostly restored to her designed configuration , although her 3 @-@ inch AA guns were replaced by three QF 4 inch Mk V AA guns . Two of these were mounted on a platform between the aft funnel and the mainmast and the third gun was positioned on the quarterdeck between the two 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns . The major exception was that No. 2 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch gun was not installed and she retained her hangar in the forward superstructure . The two derricks that serviced the hangar were replaced by a single crane on the starboard side of the hangar roof . No. 2 's position was occupied by a prototype compressed @-@ air Carey aircraft catapult , the first British cruiser to mount a catapult . Vindictive used it for the first time on 3 October when she launched a Fairey IIID floatplane . She also conducted catapult trials on float @-@ equipped Fairey Flycatcher fighters . 
 She sailed for the China Station on 1 January 1926 with six Fairey IIIDs aboard for anti @-@ piracy patrols and departed for home on 14 March 1928 . She arrived in May and her catapult was removed in October , ending her career as an aviation ship . Vindictive was again reduced to reserve in 1929 , making occasional trooping voyages . 
 = = = As training ship = = = 
 In 1936 – 1937 , Vindictive was demilitarised in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty and converted to a training ship for cadets . Her two inboard propellers were removed as were the inboard turbines ; half of her boilers were removed and their compartments were converted into accommodations . The aft funnel was removed , the aft superstructure remodelled and enlarged and her hangar converted into more accommodation space . Her armament , including the above @-@ water torpedo tubes , was replaced by a pair of 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) guns forward and a quadruple QF 2 @-@ pounder ( " pom @-@ pom " ) AA mount aft . In this form she displaced 9 @,@ 100 long tons ( 9 @,@ 200 t ) and was capable of a maximum speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . She was recommissioned on 7 September 1937 . 
 = = = As fleet repair ship = = = 
 After the Second World War began in August 1939 , Vindictive was transferred to Devonport for a modernisation like that of her sister Effingham , with nine 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns , four twin @-@ gun 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) mounts and a catapult . She had a low priority so little work had been done by early October , when a less complex modernisation was considered . This proposal had six 6 @-@ inch guns and three 4 @-@ inch AA guns , and her former aft boiler room was to be converted from a laundry into an oil tank to extend her range , but this was rejected in favour of a conversion into a fleet repair ship . Her armament was removed and her forward superstructure was extended over the former hangar 's roof . Her aft superstructure was extended to be flush with her sides and slightly lengthened , and a large deckhouse was built on the quarterdeck . Her armament now consisted of six single 4 @-@ inch QF Mk V AA guns , all on the centreline , two quadruple " pom @-@ pom " mounts , one on each side , and six depth charges . In this role , she had a standard displacement of 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) ( 12 @,@ 000 long tons ( 12 @,@ 000 t ) at full load ) and her draught increased to 20 feet 3 inches ( 6 @.@ 2 m ) . 
 The conversion was completed on 30 March 1940 , just in time for the ship to be used with the Home Fleet as a troop transport during the Norwegian Campaign . She ferried British troops to Narvik in late April and escorted an evacuation convoy from Harstad on 4 June . Vindictive was transferred to the South Atlantic later in the year and remained there until late 1942 , when she was ordered north . On the night of 12 November , she was attacked west of Gibraltar by the German submarine U @-@ 515 , but managed to evade the torpedoes . U @-@ 515 sank the accompanying destroyer tender Hecla and blew the stern off one of the escorting destroyers , Marne . She remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1944 , when she was recalled to support the ships participating in Operation Overlord . 
 During this time she received her first radars . By August 1943 she mounted a Type 286 target indication set as well as a Type 285 anti @-@ aircraft gunnery radar . By January 1944 she had received a Type 291 air warning radar . Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon , three on each side of the roof of the large workshop abaft the funnel . In 1944 Vindictive was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of six more Oerlikons . Later that year , the 4 @-@ inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added . In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons . 
 In early August 1944 , the ship was damaged by a long @-@ range , circling , " Dackel " torpedo dropped by the Luftwaffe off the coast of Normandy . She was paid off into reserve on 8 September 1945 and was sold for scrap on 24 January 1946 . Vindictive was subsequently broken up at Blyth . 
 = Colorado Avalanche = 
 The Colorado Avalanche are a professional ice hockey team based in Denver , Colorado . They are members of the Central Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The Avalanche are the only team in their division not based in the Central Time Zone ; the team is situated in the Mountain Time Zone . Their home arena is Pepsi Center . Their current head coach is Patrick Roy , and their general manager is Joe Sakic . 
 The Avalanche were founded in 1972 as the Quebec Nordiques and were one of the charter franchises of the World Hockey Association . The franchise joined the NHL in 1979 as a result of the NHL – WHA merger . Following the 1994 – 95 season , they were sold to the COMSAT Entertainment Group and relocated to Denver . In the club 's first season in Denver , the Avalanche won the Pacific Division and went on to sweep the Florida Panthers in the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals , becoming the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup in the season following a relocation . Among teams in the major North American professional sports leagues , only the National Football League ( NFL ) ' s Washington Redskins have also accomplished the feat . This was the first major professional sports championship a Denver @-@ based team would bring to the city . In the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals , the Avalanche defeated the New Jersey Devils 4 – 3 to win their second and most recent championship . As a result , they are the only active NHL team that has won all of its Stanley Cup Final appearances . Coincidentally , the Devils had preceded the Avalanche in Denver ; they were called the Colorado Rockies . 
 The Avalanche have won nine division titles ( including their first eight in a row in Denver , the longest such streak in NHL history ) and qualified for the playoffs in each of their first ten seasons in Denver ; this streak ended in 2007 .

 = = = Quebec Nordiques ( 1972 – 95 ) = = = 
 The Quebec Nordiques were one of the World Hockey Association 's original teams when the league began play in 1972 . Though first awarded to a group in San Francisco , the team quickly moved to Quebec City when the California deal soured because of financial and arena problems . During their seven WHA seasons , the Nordiques won the Avco World Trophy once , in 1977 and lost the finals once , in 1975 . In 1979 , the franchise entered the NHL , along with the WHA 's Edmonton Oilers , Hartford Whalers , and Winnipeg Jets . 
 After making the postseason for seven consecutive years , from 1981 to 1987 , the Nordiques became one of the worst teams in the league . From 1987 – 88 to 1991 – 92 , the team finished last in their division every season , and three of those times they finished dead last in the league . This included a dreadful 12 @-@ win season in 1989 @-@ 90 that is still the worst in franchise history . As a result , the team earned three consecutive first overall draft picks , used to select Mats Sundin ( 1989 ) , Owen Nolan ( 1990 ) and Eric Lindros ( 1991 ) . Lindros made it clear he did not wish to play for the Nordiques , to the extent that he did not wear the team 's jersey for the press photographs , only holding it when it was presented to him . On advice from his mother , he refused to sign a contract and began a holdout that lasted over a year . On June 30 , 1992 , he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for five players , the rights to Swedish prospect Peter Forsberg , two first round draft picks and US $ 15 million . The Eric Lindros trade turned the moribund Nordiques into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight , and in hindsight is seen as one of the most one @-@ sided deals in sports history . In the first season after the trade , 1992 – 93 , the Nordiques reached the playoffs for the first time in six years . Two years later , they won the Northeast Division and had the second best regular @-@ season record during the strike @-@ shortened season . 
 While the team experienced on @-@ ice success , it spent most of its first 23 years struggling financially . Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the league , and the second @-@ smallest to host a team in the four major sports . The changing financial environment in the NHL made things even more difficult . In 1995 , team owner Marcel Aubut asked for a bailout from Quebec 's provincial government as well as a new publicly funded arena . The bailout fell through , and Aubut subsequently began talks with COMSAT Entertainment Group in Denver , which already owned the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) ' s Denver Nuggets . In May 1995 , COMSAT announced an agreement in principle to purchase the team . The deal became official on July 1 , 1995 , and 12 @,@ 000 season tickets were sold in the 37 days after the announcement of the move to Denver . 
 COMSAT considered several names for the team , including Extreme , Blizzards and Black Bears . It also debated whether to brand the team as a Denver team or as a regional franchise representing either Colorado or the entire Rocky Mountain region . After initially filing copyright protection for " Black Bears , " COMSAT opted to name the team the Colorado Avalanche . The new name was revealed August 10 , 1995 .

 After buying the team , COMSAT organized its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary , Ascent Entertainment Group Inc . , which went public in 1995 , with 80 % of its stock bought by COMSAT and the other 20 % available on NASDAQ . The Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver ( where the Denver Nuggets once played ) on October 6 , 1995 , winning 3 – 2 against the Detroit Red Wings . Led by captain Joe Sakic , forward Peter Forsberg and defenseman Adam Foote on the ice and Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach , the Avalanche became stronger when All @-@ Star Montreal Canadiens goalie Patrick Roy joined the team . Feeling humiliated for being left in the net after having let in nine goals in 26 shots during a Canadiens game against the Red Wings , Roy joined the Avalanche on December 6 , 1995 , together with ex @-@ Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault , Martin <unk> and Andrei Kovalenko . Roy would prove a pivotal addition for Colorado in the years to come . 
 The Avalanche finished the regular season with a 47 – 25 – 10 record for 104 points , won the Pacific Division and finished second in the Western Conference . Colorado progressed to the playoffs , defeating the Vancouver Canucks and the Chicago Blackhawks in the first two rounds , both in six games and the Presidents ' Trophy @-@ winning Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals in six games as well . In the Stanley Cup Finals , the Avalanche met the Florida Panthers , who were also in their first Finals . The Avalanche swept the series 4 – 0 . In Game 4 , during the third overtime and after more than 100 minutes of play with no goals , defenseman Uwe Krupp scored to claim the franchise 's first Stanley Cup . Joe Sakic was the playoff 's scoring leader with 34 points ( 18 goals and 16 assists ) and won the Conn Smythe Trophy , awarded to the most valuable player to his team during the playoffs . The 1995 – 96 Cup was the first major professional championship won by a Denver team and the Avalanche are the only team ( expansion or brand new ) in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup their first season after a relocation , and only the second team to win a championship their first season after a relocation in any of the four major North American sports leagues , following the Washington Redskins of the NFL . They also became the second team from the WHA to win the Cup . With the Cup win , Russians Alexei Gusarov and Valeri Kamensky and Swede Peter Forsberg became members of the Triple Gold Club , the exclusive group of ice hockey players who have won Olympic gold , World Championship gold , and the Stanley Cup . 
 = = = = Early success , 1996 – 2000 = = = = 
 In 1996 – 97 , Colorado won the Pacific Division , as well as the Presidents ' Trophy for finishing the regular season with the best record in the league : 49 – 24 – 9 for 107 points . The team was also the league 's best scoring with an average of 3 @.@ 38 goals scored per game . The Avalanche met the two lowest seeds of the Western Conference in the first two rounds of the playoffs : the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers , and defeated them in six games and five games , respectively . During a rematch of the previous year Western Conference Finals , the Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games . Detroit went on to sweep the Stanley Cup Finals just as the Avalanche had done the year before . <unk> <unk> was elected for the league 's first All @-@ Star team at the end of the season . 
 As a free agent during the summer of 1997 , Joe Sakic signed a three @-@ year , $ 21 million offer sheet with the New York Rangers . Under the collective bargaining agreement at the time , the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers ' offer or let go of Sakic . Colorado would match the offer , which instigated a salary raise for NHL players . 
 In the following season , Colorado won the Pacific Division with a 39 – 26 – 17 record for 95 points . The Avalanche sent the largest delegation of the NHL to the 1998 Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament in Nagano , Japan : 10 players representing seven countries and coach Marc Crawford for Canada . Milan Hejduk won the gold medal for Czech Republic , Alexei Gusarov and Valeri Kamensky got the silver medal for Russia and Jari Kurri won the bronze medal for Finland . Colorado lost in the Western Conference Quarter @-@ finals against the Edmonton Oilers in seven games , after having led the series 3 – 1 . Peter Forsberg was the league 's second highest scorer in the regular season with 91 points ( 25 goals and 66 assists ) and was elected for the league 's first all star team . After the end of the season , head coach Marc Crawford rejected the team 's offer of a two @-@ year deal . Bob Hartley was hired to the head coach position in June 1998 . 
 In 1998 – 99 , with the addition of the Nashville Predators to the league , the NHL realigned their divisions and the Colorado Avalanche were put in the new Northwest Division . Despite a slow 2 – 6 – 1 start , Colorado finished with a 44 – 28 – 10 record for 98 points , won the Northwest Division and finished second in the Western Conference . Between January 10 and February 7 , the Avalanche had their longest winning streak ever with 12 games . Following the Columbine High School massacre , Colorado postponed their first two playoff games to a later date ; they would wear patches in honor of the Columbine victims on their jerseys during the playoffs . After defeating both the San Jose Sharks and the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first two rounds , Colorado met the Presidents ' Trophy @-@ winning Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Finals , where they lost in seven games . Peter Forsberg , the playoffs leading scorer with 24 points ( 8 goals and 16 assists ) , was again elected to the league 's first All @-@ Star team and Chris Drury won the Calder Memorial Trophy for the best rookie of the season . Together with Milan Hejduk , both were elected for the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team at the end of the season . 
 It was in the 1999 – 2000 season that the Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the new Pepsi Center that cost US $ 160 million . Milan Hejduk scored the first goal of a 2 – 1 victory against the Boston Bruins on October 13 , 1999 . The Avalanche finished the season with a 42 – 28 – 11 – 1 record for 96 points and won the Northwest Division . Before the playoffs , the Avalanche strengthened their defense for a run towards the Stanley Cup . On March 6 , 2000 , the Boston Bruins traded future Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque and forward Dave <unk> to Colorado for Brian Rolston , Martin Grenier , Samuel Pahlsson and a first round draft pick . Bourque , who had been a Bruin since 1979 , requested a trade to a contender for a chance to win the Stanley Cup . However , and just as the year before , Colorado lost in the Conference Finals against the Dallas Stars in a seven games after beating the Phoenix Coyotes and Detroit Red Wings in five games . 
 The Avalanche 's success came amid considerable turmoil in the front office . COMSAT 's diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company . In particular , cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms . Finally , in 1997 , COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media . However , Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time ( though it has since bought Major League Baseball 's Atlanta Braves ) , and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets . 
 After almost two years , Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to Wal @-@ Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for $ 400 million . However , a group of Ascent shareholders sued , claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low . Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $ 461 million . 
 However , a new wrinkle appeared when the City of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years . Sturm had made his bid in his own name , and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out . While Sturm was willing to make a long @-@ term commitment to the city , he wasn 't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams . After negotiations fell apart , Liberty bought all of Ascent , but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market . Finally , in July 2000 , the Avalanche , Nuggets and Pepsi Center were finally bought by real estate entrepreneur Stan Kroenke in a $ 450 million deal . Kroenke is the brother @-@ in @-@ law of the <unk> ; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie 's sister . Liberty retained only a 6 @.@ 5 % stake of the sports franchises . As part of the deal , Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that would ensure the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025 . After the deal , Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises .

 The 2000 – 01 season was the best season the team has ever had due to phenomenal play by all @-@ time leading scorer in Avalanche history , Joe Sakic . The Avalanche won the Northwest Division and captured their second Presidents ' Trophy after having finished the regular season with 52 – 16 – 10 – 4 for 118 points . Sakic finished the regular season with 118 points ( 54 goals and 64 assists ) , only three behind Jaromir Jagr 's 121 points . On February 4 , 2001 , the Avalanche hosted the 51st NHL All @-@ Star Game . Patrick Roy , Ray Bourque and Joe Sakic played for the North America team , who won 14 – 12 against the World team , that featured Milan Hejduk and Peter Forsberg . All but Hejduk were part of the starting lineups . Before the playoffs , the Avalanche acquired star defenseman Rob Blake and center Steven Reinprecht from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Adam Deadmarsh , Aaron Miller and their first round 2001 Draft pick . In the playoffs , Colorado swept their Western Conference Quarter @-@ finals against the Vancouver Canucks . In the Western Conference Semi @-@ finals , the Avalanche defeated the Los Angeles Kings in seven games , after having wasted a 3 – 1 lead . After the last game of the series , Peter Forsberg underwent surgery to remove a ruptured spleen and it was announced that he would not play until the following season . The injury was a huge upset for the team ; former NHL goaltender Darren Pang considered it " devastating ... to the Colorado Avalanche . " The team would overcome Forsberg 's injury ; in the Western Conference Finals , Colorado beat the St. Louis Blues 4 – 1 and progressed to the Stanley Cup Finals , where they faced the defending champion New Jersey Devils . The Avalanche came back from a 3 – 2 series deficit and won the series 4 – 3 , marking the second year in a row that defending champions lost in the Finals , as the Devils themselves defeated the Dallas Stars in 2000 . After being handed the Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman , captain Joe Sakic immediately turned , and gave it to Ray Bourque , capping off Bourque 's 22 @-@ year career with his only championship . Sakic was the playoffs ' leading scorer with 26 points ( 13 goals and 13 assists ) . He won the Hart Memorial Trophy , given to the league 's most valuable player during the regular season ; the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy , awarded to the player that has shown the best sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with performance in play ; the Lester B. Pearson Award ; and shared the NHL Plus / Minus Award with Patrik Elias of the Devils . Patrick Roy won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs . <unk> <unk> was awarded the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for significant humanitarian contributions to his community , namely his work on charitable organizations and his own children foundation . Ray Bourque and Joe Sakic were elected to the league 's first All @-@ Star team . Rob Blake was elected to the second All @-@ Star team .

 In the 2001 – 02 season , the team finished the regular season with 99 points from a 45 – 28 – 8 – 1 record and won the Northwest Division . Colorado had the league 's lowest goals conceded : 169 , an average of 2 @.@ 06 per game . The NHL season was interrupted once again for the 2002 Winter Olympics , in Salt Lake City , Utah . The Avalanche had nine players representing six countries . Canada won the ice hockey tournament and Rob Blake , Adam Foote and Joe Sakic won gold medals . American Chris Drury got a silver medal . With the win , Blake and Sakic became members of the Triple Gold Club . The Avalanche advanced through the first two rounds of the playoffs winning 4 – 3 against the Los Angeles Kings and 4 – 3 against the San Jose Sharks . Patrick Roy had a shutout on the decisive game of each series . The Avalanche made the Western Conference Finals for the fourth consecutive season ( and sixth overall in the last seven seasons ) , meeting the Detroit Red Wings in the playoffs for the fifth time in seven years . Colorado had a 3 – 2 lead after five games , but lost Game 6 at home 2 – 0 and then the Red Wings won the deciding game at Detroit , 7 – 0 . As in 1997 , Detroit went on to win the Stanley Cup . Peter Forsberg was the playoffs scoring leader with 27 points ( 9 goals , 18 assists ) . Patrick Roy won the William M. Jennings Trophy , given to the goaltenders of the team with fewest goals scored against . Roy was elected for the league 's first All @-@ Star team , together with Joe Sakic . Rob Blake was elected for the second All @-@ Star team . 
 The following season , 2002 – 03 , saw the Avalanche claim the NHL record for most consecutive division titles , nine , breaking the Montreal Canadiens streak of eight , won between 1974 – 82 . The division title came after a bad start by the team , that led to the exit of head coach Bob Hartley , in December . General Manager Pierre Lacroix promoted assistant coach Tony Granato , who had only three months of coaching experience as an assistant , to the head coach position . The team 's playoff spot seemed in doubt at one point , but the Avalanche managed to finish with 105 points , ahead of the Vancouver Canucks by one . The race to the title was exciting , namely the second @-@ to @-@ last game of the season , as the Avalanche needed to win the game to stay in the race , and Milan Hejduk scored with 10 seconds left in overtime to beat Anaheim . The title was guaranteed in the final day of the regular season , when the Avalanche beat the St. Louis Blues 5 – 2 and the Vancouver Canucks lost against the Los Angeles Kings 2 – 0 . In the Western Conference Quarter @-@ finals , the Avalanche blew a 3 – 1 series lead over the Minnesota Wild , and lost in overtime in Game 7 . Peter Forsberg won the Art Ross Trophy for the leading scorer of the regular season , which he finished with 106 points ( 29 goals , 77 assists ) . Forsberg also won the Hart Memorial Trophy for the regular season 's most valuable player and shared the NHL Plus / Minus Award with teammate Milan Hejduk . Hejduk scored 50 goals to win the Maurice ' Rocket ' Richard Trophy , awarded annually to the leading goal scorer in the NHL . Forsberg was elected to the league 's first All @-@ Star team . Hejduk was elected to the second All @-@ Star team . 
 After that season , Patrick Roy retired and the Avalanche signed star wingers Paul Kariya from the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Teemu Selanne from the San Jose Sharks . Both failed to live up to the expectations ; Kariya spent most of the 2003 – 04 season injured and Selanne scored only 32 points ( 16 goals and 16 assists ) in 78 games . There were doubts if goalie David Aebischer could perform at the top level the team was used to while having Roy . Having " nine elite players , " " the most talented top six forwards on one team since the days of the Edmonton Oilers " was not good enough as the franchise failed to win the Northwest Division title , ending the NHL record streak . The 40 – 22 – 13 – 7 record was good enough for 100 points , one less than the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks . This ended a streak of nine consecutive division titles dating to the team 's last year in Quebec , the most in NHL history . 
 During a game against the Canucks on March 8 , 2004 , Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado 's Steve Moore from behind , leaving Moore unconscious . It was said to be retaliation for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before . Because of the punch and the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him , and numerous other players from both teams piling on top , Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae , among other injuries , that ended his career . Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions . In Denver , ever since the Moore hit , it has become tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck , whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center . 
 In the playoffs , Colorado won the Western Conference Quarter @-@ finals against the Dallas Stars in five games , but lost in the Western Conference Semi @-@ finals against the San Jose Sharks in a six games . Joe Sakic became the only Avalanche player ever to be chosen as the All @-@ Star Game Most Valuable Player during the 2004 NHL All @-@ Star Game , when he scored a hat @-@ trick . Sakic was elected for the league 's first All @-@ Star team at the end of the season and won the NHL / Sheraton Road Performer Award . After the end of the season , on July 2004 , Joel Quenneville was hired for the position of head coach , replacing Tony Granato , who became his assistant . 
 The 2004 – 05 NHL season was canceled because of an unresolved lockout . During the lockout , many Avalanche players played in European leagues . David Aebischer returned home with Alex Tanguay to play for Swiss club HC Lugano ; Milan Hejduk and Peter Forsberg returned to their former teams in their native countries , HC Pardubice and Modo Hockey . Nine other players from the Avalanche 2003 – 04 roster played in Europe during the lockout . 
 = = = = New beginnings , 2005 – 09 = = = = 
 After the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout and the implementation of a salary cap , the Avalanche were forced to release some of their top players . Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote were lost to free agency to save room in the cap for Joe Sakic and Rob Blake . Although the salary cap was a blow to one of the highest spenders of the league , the Colorado Avalanche finished the 2005 – 06 regular season with a 43 – 30 – 9 record for 95 points , good enough to finish second in the Northwest Division , seven behind the Calgary Flames and tied with the Edmonton Oilers . The season paused in February for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin , Italy . The Avalanche sent an NHL leading 11 players from eight countries . Finnish Antti Laaksonen earned the silver medal , while Ossi <unk> ended up not playing because of an injury ; Czech Milan Hejduk won a bronze medal . In the Western Conference Quarter @-@ finals , Colorado beat the team with the second @-@ best record in the Western Conference , the Dallas Stars , in five games . In the Conference Semi @-@ finals , the Avalanche were swept for the first time ever , coming at the hands of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim . The day after the loss , Pierre Lacroix , who had been the general manager of the franchise since 1994 when they were in Quebec , resigned , where Francois Giguere was then hired as his replacement . Lacroix remained president of the franchise until Spring of 2013 , when the team owner 's son , Josh Kroenke , took over as team president and governor . Pierre Lacroix remains an advisor to the team . 
 By the beginning of the 2006 – 07 season , Joe Sakic and Milan Hejduk were the only two remaining members from the 2000 – 01 Stanley Cup @-@ winning squad . Sakic was the only player left from the team 's days in Quebec , though Hejduk was drafted by the <unk> Stastny , son of Nordiques legend Peter Stastny , also provided a link to the franchise 's past . Before the previous season 's playoffs , in a move reminiscent of Patrick Roy 's trade , the Avalanche traded goalie David Aebischer to the Montreal Canadiens for the Vezina Trophy @-@ winning Jose Theodore . The move , however , would not turn out to be as successful . Theodore posted a 13 – 15 – 1 record in 2006 – 07 , with an .891 save percentage and 3 @.@ 26 goals against average ( GAA ) , with his US $ 6 million salary becoming a heavy burden for the Avalanche in the salary cap era . The Avalanche missed the playoffs for the first time since 1993 – 94 , when they were still in Quebec . The team had a 15 – 2 – 2 run in the last 19 games of the season to keep their playoffs hopes alive until the penultimate day of the season . A 4 – 2 loss against the Nashville Predators on April 7 , with former Av Peter Forsberg assisting the game @-@ winning goal scored by another former Av , Paul Kariya , knocked Colorado out of the playoff race . As consolation , the team won the last game of the season against the Calgary Flames the following day and finished fourth in the Northwest Division and ninth in the Western Conference with a 44 – 31 – 7 record for 95 points , one less than eighth @-@ seeded Calgary . Nonetheless , the result was greater than expected by hockey pundits ; Sports Illustrated previewed before the start of the season that the Avalanche would finish 13th in the Western Conference . During that last game of the season , Joe Sakic scored a goal and two assists and became the second @-@ oldest player in NHL history to reach 100 points , behind only Gordie Howe , who had 103 points at age 40 in the 1968 – 69 season . During the season , Paul Stastny set an NHL record for longest point streak by a rookie , with 20 games , three more than the previous record , held by Teemu Selanne and Karlis <unk> set a new NHL record for the longest game streak by a defenseman , with 495 games . Until the Avalanche 's 2006 – 07 season , no team in the history of the NHL had ever made it to 95 points without earning a spot in the playoffs . In the Eastern Conference , three teams progressed to the playoffs with fewer than 95 points : the New York Rangers ( 94 ) , the Tampa Bay Lightning ( 93 ) and the New York Islanders ( 92 ) . 
 For the 2007 – 08 season , the Avalanche signed two free agents : defenseman Scott Hannan and left winger Ryan Smyth . These acquisitions filled the team 's needs and were expected to help make an impact in the playoffs . With a 9 – 5 victory over the St. Louis Blues on December 9 , 2007 , the Avalanche earned their 1,000th franchise victory . On February 25 , 2008 , unrestricted free agent Peter Forsberg signed with the Avalanche for the remainder of the 2007 – 08 season . A day later , at the trade deadline , they re @-@ acquired popular defenseman Adam Foote from the Columbus Blue Jackets as well as Ruslan Salei from the Florida Panthers . In the Western Conference Quarter @-@ finals , Colorado beat the Minnesota Wild in six games . In the Western Conference Semi @-@ finals , however , the Avalanche were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings . 
 On May 9 , 2008 , the Colorado Avalanche Organization announced that Joel Quenneville would not return to coach the team next season . Two weeks later , Tony Granato was named head coach of the Avalanche for the second time . 
 The 2008 – 09 season was the worst season the Avalanche had since moving to Denver . Posting a record of 32 – 45 – 5 , finishing 15th in the Western Conference ( 28th overall ) , and recording the fewest amount of points since their days in Quebec during the 1979 – 80 season . The Avalanche missed the post @-@ season for the second time in three seasons . It would be the first time in Avalanche history the team 's top scorer would score less than 70 points on the season , as Milan Hejduk and Ryan Smyth would register only 59 points each . Captain Joe Sakic played a career low 15 games , notching just two goals and ten assists . The team 's 199 goals was a league low . On April 13 , 2009 , just one day after the end of the season , the Avalanche relieved Francois Giguere of his general manager duties . Colorado would go on to receive the highest draft pick in Avalanche history , third overall . That pick turned out to be Brampton Battalion star Matt Duchene . 
 = = = = Rebuilding , 2009 – 13 = = = = 
 In the 2009 off @-@ season , the Avalanche named Greg Sherman the new general manager and Joe Sacco the new head coach . The following month , top scorer Ryan Smyth was traded to the Los Angeles Kings and Joe Sakic , the only team captain the Avs had ever known , retired after 21 seasons in the NHL . The Avs named Adam Foote team captain to replace him . Sakic 's jersey retirement ceremony took place on October 1 , 2009 , before the season opener at home against the San Jose Sharks in front of a sold out crowd where the Avalanche won 5 – 2 . The Avalanche started the season off strong until the Olympic break . Three Avs played in Vancouver : Paul Stastny for the United States , Ruslan Salei for Belarus and Peter Budaj for Slovakia . Following the Winter Olympics , the Avs struggled but eventually clinched a playoff spot with 95 points on the season , a 26 @-@ point improvement from the previous year 's effort , and good enough for eighth place in the Western Conference . The Avalanche fell in the Western Conference Quarter @-@ finals to the top @-@ seeded San Jose Sharks in six games . 
 The 2010 off @-@ season proved limited activity on the Avs ' part . Stan Kroenke bought full ownership in the St. Louis Rams of the NFL in 2010 . Since the NFL does not allow its owners to hold majority control of major @-@ league teams in other NFL cities , Kroenke turned over day @-@ to @-@ day control of the Denver Nuggets and Avalanche to his son Josh toward the end of 2010 , and must sell his controlling interest in both teams by 2014 . After an impressive underdog triumph in making the playoffs in 2010 , and Joe Sacco finishing third in Jack Adams Trophy voting , the Avs failed to qualify for the playoffs in 2011 . Earning only 68 points in the standings , setting a franchise record for losing and winless streaks after the All @-@ Star break , the Avalanche have seen their worst season yet since moving to Denver . One point less than their previous worst season in 2008 – 09 . They finished 29th in the 30 @-@ team NHL , besting only their division mates , the Edmonton Oilers . Matt Duchene set a franchise record as the youngest scoring leader in Quebec / Colorado history with 67 points , sharing the club goals @-@ leader title with David Jones , each with 27 tallies . Former Avs great Peter Forsberg attempted a comeback in the NHL with Colorado mid @-@ season . After two games , zero points and compiling a plus @-@ minus rating of – 4 , however , Forsberg announced his retirement from professional hockey . Captain Adam Foote also retired after the final game of the season . 
 In the off @-@ season , Colorado had two first @-@ round picks . Present at the draft , former Avalanche great Joe Sakic served his first duties as new alternate governor and adviser of hockey operations of the club . With their first pick , second overall , they selected Gabriel Landeskog , the young captain of the Kitchener Rangers . Second , they selected defenseman Duncan Siemens 11th overall , a pick acquired from the St. Louis Blues in the controversial trade that sent power @-@ forward Chris Stewart , long time top prospect Kevin <unk> and a second round pick to the Blues in exchange for their first round pick , veteran Jay McClement and 2006 former first overall pick , Erik Johnson . A complete overhaul at the goal tending position sent Peter Budaj to the Montreal Canadiens and Brian Elliott to St. Louis , Elliott having been acquired from the Ottawa Senators for Craig Anderson during the team 's downward spiral the season previous . Goalie Semyon Varlamov was dealt to Colorado from the Washington Capitals for a first and second pick , while veteran netminder and former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Jean @-@ Sebastien Giguere was signed as a free agent in hopes to mentor the young Varlamov . Duncan Siemens was sent back to his major junior team , the Saskatoon Blades in camp , while Gabriel Landeskog made the opening night roster against the Detroit Red Wings on October 8 , 2011 , at Pepsi Center . Adam Deadmarsh was promoted from video / developmental coach to offensive assistant coach after Steve <unk> accepted a job as head coach in the minor league . 
 Peter Forsberg 's number 21 became the fourth jersey number retired by the Avs on opening night , a contest Colorado would lose to Detroit 3 – 0 . Colorado redeemed themselves in game two of the season on October 10 , 2011 , against the 2011 Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins . Varlamov negated all 30 shots registered by Boston and posted the fifth shutout of his career and first win as an Avalanche in the regular season . Milan Hejduk scored the game @-@ winning goal and first goal of the season for the club in a 1 – 0 victory over the defending champions . In April 2012 , The Avs were eliminated from playoff contention and finished 11th place in the Western Conference . Despite a 20 @-@ point improvement from last season 's efforts , the team failed to reach the playoffs for the second straight year , the first time the Colorado club would do so in their 17 years playing in Denver . Head coach Joe Sacco signed a two @-@ year contract extension shortly after the end of the season . Stand out rookie Gabriel Landeskog overtook Matt Duchene as the youngest in franchise history to lead the team in goals , scoring 22 in 82 games . 
 Having resigned most of their free agents , the club wouldn 't see much change in the 2012 off @-@ season , with the exception of losing unrestricted free agents Peter Mueller , Jay McClement and Kevin Porter . Colorado would add Greg <unk> , John Mitchell and high scoring winger P. A. <unk> to its roster . Gabriel Landeskog , the Avs ' lone representative at the 2012 NHL Awards , walked away with the Calder Memorial Trophy , joining Chris Drury , Peter Forsberg and Peter Stastny for earning top rookie honors for the Avalanche . 
 On September 4 , 2012 , Gabriel Landeskog was named the fourth captain of the Avalanche . Former captain Milan Hejduk relinquished his captaincy a week earlier . At 19 years and 286 days old , Landeskog is the youngest captain in NHL history , being 11 days younger than when Sidney Crosby was named captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins at 19 years and 297 days . 
 = = = = Return of Patrick Roy , 2013 – present = = = = 
 After a disappointing 2012 – 13 season which saw the Colorado Avalanche finish 15th in the Western Conference and 29th overall in the League , it was announced on April 28 , 2013 , that Head Coach Joe Sacco had been relieved of his duties . On May 10 , it was announced that former long @-@ time Avalanche captain and Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic is set to take on an expanded role in Avalanche management , being named executive vice president of hockey operations , overseeing all matters involving hockey personnel . It was also announced that Josh Kroenke , son of owner Stan Kroenke , is now president of the Avalanche , succeeding Pierre Lacroix . On May 23 , Patrick Roy returned to the Avalanche as head coach and vice president of hockey operations . Although Sherman retained his role as general manager , he was largely reduced to an advisory role . Roy and Sakic now share most of the duties held by a general manager on most other NHL teams , though Sakic has the final say on hockey matters . 
 Under Roy in 2013 – 14 , the Avs returned to the playoffs , finishing first in the Central Division and second in the Western Conference , but would lose a seven @-@ game series to the Minnesota Wild in the Western Conference Quarterfinals . Nonetheless , for his outstanding job as a first @-@ year coach , Roy won the Jack Adams Award for the League 's top coaching honors . 
 Just prior to the start of the 2014 – 15 season , Sakic was given the title of general manager while Sherman was demoted to assistant general manager , thus formalizing the de facto arrangement that had been in place since 2013 . Despite the front office changes , the Avalanche failed to qualify for the 2015 playoffs after finishing with a record of 39 – 31 – 12 , resulting in a seventh @-@ place finish in the Central Division . 
 = = Attendance sell @-@ out streak = = 
 The Colorado Avalanche have the all @-@ time NHL record for the longest consecutive attendance sell outs at home games with 487 . The streak began on November 9 , 1995 , on the Avalanche 's eighth regular season home game during the 1995 – 96 season , with an attendance of 16 @,@ 061 at the McNichols Sports Arena versus the Dallas Stars . Almost 11 years later , it ended on October 16 , 2006 , after a reported attendance of 17 @,@ 681 , which is 326 under the capacity at Pepsi Center , before a game against the Chicago Blackhawks . The Avalanche recorded their 500th home sellout in their 515th game in Denver on January 20 , 2007 , against the Detroit Red Wings . 
 = = Rivalry with the Detroit Red Wings = = 
 In 1996 , the Colorado Avalanche met the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals and upset the Red Wings 4 – 2 . During Game 6 , Red Wings player Kris Draper was checked into the boards face @-@ first by Avalanche player Claude Lemieux . As a result , Draper had to undergo facial reconstructive surgery and had to have his jaw wired shut for five weeks . The incident marked the beginning of a rivalry often considered one of the most intense in NHL history by the press and fans . 
 In the following season , in the last regular season meeting between the Avalanche and the Red Wings on March 26 , 1997 , a brawl known as the Brawl in Hockeytown broke out . The game ended with nine fights , 11 goals , 39 penalties , 148 penalty minutes , one hat @-@ trick ( by Valeri Kamensky ) and a goalie fight between Stanley Cup champion goalies Patrick Roy and Mike Vernon . Claude Lemieux was one of the players singled out by the Red Wings players . The Red Wings ended up winning the game in overtime 6 – 5 . The teams met again in the Western Conference Finals that season , with the Red Wings emerging victorious and going on to win the Stanley Cup . 
 The rivalry between the Avalanche and the Red Wings was most intense from 1996 to 2002 . During those seven seasons the two teams played five postseason series against each other in the Stanley Cup playoffs , with the Avalanche winning three of the series ( 1995 – 96 , 4 – 2 ; 1998 – 99 , 4 – 2 ; 1999 – 2000 , 4 – 1 ) and the Red Wings winning two of them ( 1996 – 97 , 4 – 2 ; 2001 – 02 , 4 – 3 ) . During this time frame , these two teams combined for a total of five Stanley Cup championships in seven years , the Avalanche winning twice ( 1995 – 96 and 2000 – 01 ) and the Red Wings winning three times ( 1996 – 97 , 1997 – 98 and 2001 – 02 ) . After 2002 , the rivalry between the two teams began to cool down , and the two teams would not meet again in the playoffs until 2008 , when the Red Wings swept the Avalanche in the Western Conference Semi @-@ finals and went on to win the Stanley Cup . The Red Wings moved to the Eastern Conference in 2013 – 14 season as part of the realignment which makes the two rivals only see each other twice a year .

 The Colorado Avalanche logo is composed by a burgundy letter A with snow wrapped around , similar to an avalanche , in the shape of the letter C. There is a hockey puck in the lower – right end of the snow and a blue oval on the background . 
 The team 's original alternate logo was the foot of a Sasquatch / Bigfoot and was seen on the shoulders of the Avalanche 's home and away jerseys . The logo was used on their jerseys since 1995 ; however , prior to the start of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft , the club unveiled a new alternate logo . The new logo features the insignia taken from the Colorado state flag and re @-@ colored to match the team 's color scheme . The logo will be featured on a patch located on the shoulders of the team 's uniforms , along with a 20th anniversary logo , for the 2015 – 16 season . 
 = = = Jerseys = = = 
 The team colors are burgundy , steel blue , black , silver and white . For the 2007 – 08 season , the NHL introduced the new @-@ look Rbk EDGE jerseys . The Avalanche debuted their new version of the Rbk EDGE jerseys on September 12 , 2007 at an Avalanche press conference . The design is similar to the previous jerseys , with some added piping . 
 The road jersey from 1995 – 2003 , which became the team 's home jersey in 2003 when the NHL decided to switch home and road jerseys , is predominantly burgundy and dark blue in color . Along the jersey , there are two black and white zigzag lines , one in the shoulders , the other near the belly . Between them , the jersey is burgundy , outside those lines it is dark blue . Similar lines exist around the neck . The Avalanche logo is in the center of the jersey . On top of the shoulders , there is the alternate logo , one on each side . The away jersey is similar but with different colors . The burgundy part on the home jersey is white on the away jersey , the light blue part is burgundy and the black and white lines became gray and blue . 
 The Avalanche introduced a third jersey during the 2001 – 02 season . It is predominantly burgundy . " Colorado " is spelled in a diagonal across the jersey where the logo is on the other jerseys . From the belly down , three large horizontal stripes , the first and the last being black and the middle one being white . In the middle of the arms , there are five stripes , black , white and burgundy from the outside inside in both sides . On the shoulders is the primary " A " logo . The third jersey was not worn by the Avalanche for the 2007 – 08 or the 2008 – 09 seasons after the NHL switched to the Reebok Edge jerseys . In the 2009 @-@ 10 season , the Avalanche introduced a new third jersey that was worn for the first time during the November 14 , 2009 home game against the Vancouver Canucks . It is similar to the club 's previous third jersey , but is primarily blue instead of burgundy and features burgundy patches on the shoulders with the " A " logo inside . It also does not have horizontal striping on the bottom . On the arms , there are five stripes , burgundy , white and black from the outside inside in both sides . They are closer to the elbows than the stripes on the previous third jerseys .

 = Robert Benchley = 
 Robert Charles Benchley ( September 15 , 1889 – November 21 , 1945 ) was an American humorist best known for his work as a newspaper columnist and film actor . From his beginnings at the Harvard Lampoon while attending Harvard University , through his many years writing essays and articles for Vanity Fair and The New Yorker and his acclaimed short films , Benchley 's style of humor brought him respect and success during his life , from New York City and his peers at the Algonquin Round Table to contemporaries in the burgeoning film industry . 
 Benchley is best remembered for his contributions to The New Yorker , where his essays , whether topical or absurdist , influenced many modern humorists . He also made a name for himself in Hollywood , when his short film How to Sleep was a popular success and won Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards , and through his many memorable appearances in films such as Alfred Hitchcock 's Foreign Correspondent ( 1940 ) and ( in a dramatic turn ) Nice Girl ? ( 1941 ) . His legacy includes written work and numerous short film appearances . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Although Benchley was known for misleading and fictional autobiographical statements about himself ( at one point asserting that he wrote A Tale of Two Cities before being buried at Westminster Abbey ) , he actually was the great @-@ grandchild of the founder of Benchley , Texas , Henry Wetherby Benchley , who was jailed for his help with the Underground Railroad . Robert Benchley was born on September 15 , 1889 in Worcester , Massachusetts , the son of Maria Jane ( Moran ) and Charles Henry Benchley . 
 Robert 's older brother , Edmund , was rushed to the Spanish – American War days after graduation from West Point ( 1898 ) , and was a casualty almost immediately . The Benchley family were attending a public Fourth of July picnic when a bicycle messenger brought the notification telegram . In unthinking , stunned reaction , Maria Benchley cried out " Why couldn 't it have been Robert ? ! " , while the latter , who was nine years old , was standing by her side . Mrs. Benchley apologized profusely and tried hard to atone for the remark . Edmund 's death had considerable effects on and unintended consequences for Robert 's life , particularly in the form of Edmund 's fiancee Lillian Duryea , a wealthy heiress . It is believed that Edmund 's death in battle seeded pacifist leanings in Robert Benchley 's writings . The period , however , was full of strong literary reactions to the Great War , and Benchley was aware of , for instance , the anti @-@ war writings of A.A. Milne . 
 Robert Benchley met Gertrude Darling in high school in Worcester . They became engaged during his senior year at Harvard , and they married in June 1914 . Their first child , Nathaniel Benchley , was born a year later . A second son , Robert Benchley , Jr . , was born in 1919 . Nathaniel became a writer himself , and penned a biography of his father in 1955 . He was a well @-@ respected fiction and children 's book author . Nathaniel had talented sons as well : Peter Benchley was best known for the book Jaws ( which inspired the film of the same name ) , and Nat Benchley wrote and performed in an acclaimed one @-@ man production based on Robert 's life . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Robert grew up and attended school in Worcester and was involved in academic and traveling theatrical productions during high school . Thanks to financial aid from his late brother 's fiancee , Lillian Duryea , he could attend Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter , New Hampshire for his final year of high school . Benchley reveled in the atmosphere at the Academy , and he remained active in creative extracurricular activities , thereby damaging his academic credentials toward the end of his term . 
 Benchley enrolled at Harvard University in 1908 , again with Duryea 's financial help . He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity in his first year , and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school . He did especially well in his English and government classes . His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time : Benchley was often called upon to entertain his fraternity brothers , and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular . His performances gave him some local fame , and most entertainment programs on campus and many off @-@ campus meetings recruited Benchley 's talents . 
 During his first two years at Harvard , Benchley worked with the Harvard Advocate and the Harvard Lampoon . He was elected to the Lampoon 's board of directors in his third year . The election of Benchley was unusual , as he was the publication 's art editor and the board positions typically fell to the foremost writers on the staff . The Lampoon position opened a number of other doors for Benchley , and he was quickly nominated to the Signet Society meeting club as well as becoming the only undergraduate member of the Boston Papyrus Club at the time . 
 Along with his duties at the Lampoon , Benchley acted in a number of theatrical productions , including Hasty Pudding productions of The Crystal <unk> and Below Zero . He also held the position of <unk> for the Pudding in 1912 . Benchley kept these achievements in mind as he began to contemplate a career for himself after college . Charles Townsend Copeland , an English professor , recommended that Benchley go into writing , and Benchley and future Benchley illustrator <unk> Williams from the Lampoon considered going into freelance work writing and illustrating theatrical reviews . Another English professor recommended that Benchley speak with the Curtis Publishing Company ; but Benchley was initially against the idea , and ultimately took a position at a civil service office in Philadelphia . Owing to an academic failure in his senior year due to an illness , Benchley would not receive his Bachelor of Arts from Harvard until the completion of his credits in 1913 . His shortcoming was the submission of a " scholarly paper " – which Benchley eventually rectified by a treatise on the U.S. – Canadian Fisheries Dispute , written from the point of view of a cod . He took a position with Curtis shortly after he received his diploma . 
 = = = Early professional career = = = 
 Benchley did copy work for the Curtis Company during the summer following graduation , while doing other odd service jobs , such as translating French catalogs for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts . In September , he was hired by Curtis as a full @-@ time staff member , preparing copy for its new house publication , <unk> Dicta . The first issue was roundly criticized by management , who felt it was " too technical , too scattering , and wholly lacking in punch " Things did not improve for Benchley and <unk> Dicta , and a failed practical joke at a company banquet further strained the relationship between Benchley and his superiors . He continued his attempts to develop his own voice within the publication , but Benchley and Curtis were not a good match , and he eventually left , as Curtis was considering eliminating Benchley 's role and he had been offered a position in Boston with a better salary 
 Benchley held a number of similar jobs in the following years . His re @-@ entry into public speaking followed the annual Harvard – Yale football game in 1914 , where he presented a practical joke involving " Professor Soong " giving a question @-@ and @-@ answer session on football in Chinese . In what the local press dubbed " the Chinese professor caper , " Soong was played by a Chinese @-@ American who had lived in the United States for over thirty years , and pretended to answer questions in Chinese while Benchley " translated . " While his public profile rose , Benchley continued with freelance work , which included his first paid piece for Vanity Fair in 1914 , titled " Hints on Writing a Book , " a parody of the non @-@ fiction pieces then popular . While Benchley 's pieces were bought by Vanity Fair from time to time , his consistent work dried up , and he took a position with the New York Tribune . 
 Benchley started at the Tribune as a reporter . He was a very poor one , unable to get statements from people quoted in other papers , and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city . He was promised a position at the Tribune 's Sunday magazine when it launched , and he was moved to the magazine 's staff soon after he was hired , eventually becoming chief writer . He wrote two articles a week : the first a review of non @-@ literary books , the other a feature @-@ style article about whatever he wanted . The liberty gave his work new life , and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper . 
 Benchley filled in for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the beginning of 1916 , reviewing theatre in New York . This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles ( such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse ) , but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribune 's position on World War I , and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine . In 1917 , the Tribune shut down the magazine , and Benchley was out of work again . When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through , Benchley decided he would continue freelancing , having made a name for himself at the magazine . 
 This freelancing attempt did not start out well , with Benchley selling just one piece to Vanity Fair and accumulating countless rejections in two months . When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A. Brady was offered , Benchley accepted it , against the advice of many of his peers . This experience was a poor one , as Brady was extremely difficult to work for . Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government 's Aircraft Board at the beginning of 1918 . His experience there was not much better , and when an opportunity was offered to return to the Tribune under new editorial management , Benchley took it . 
 At the Tribune , Benchley , along with new editor Ernest Gruening , was in charge of a twelve @-@ page pictorial supplement titled the Tribune Graphic . The two were given a good deal of freedom , but Benchley 's coverage of the war and focus on African @-@ American regiments as well as provocative pictorials about lynching in the southern United States earned him and Gruening scrutiny from management . Amid accusations that both were pro @-@ German ( the United States was fighting Germany at the time ) , Benchley tendered his resignation in a terse letter , citing the lack of " rational proof that Dr. Gruening was guilty of ... charges made against him ... " and management 's attempts to " <unk> the character and the newspaper career of the first man in three years who has been able to make the Tribune look like a newspaper . " 
 Benchley was forced to take a publicity position with the Liberty Loan program , and he continued to freelance until Collier 's contacted him with an associate editor position . Benchley took this offer to Vanity Fair to see if they would match it , as he felt Vanity Fair was the better magazine , and Vanity Fair offered him the position of managing editor . He accepted and began work there in 1919 . 
 An often overlooked influence upon Benchley 's early professional career was the admiration and friendship of the Canadian economist , academic , and humorist Dr. Stephen Leacock . From Toronto Leacock closely followed the increasing body of Benchley 's published humor and wit , and opened correspondence between them . He admitted to occasional borrowing of a Benchley topic for his own reflection and writings . Eventually , he began lobbying gently for Benchley to compile his columns into book form , and in 1922 was delighted with the result of his nagging . For his part – in a tribute to Leacock – Benchley later said he wrote everything Leacock ever wrote . They had a marvelous friendship . 
 = = = Vanity Fair and its aftermath = = = 
 Benchley began at Vanity Fair with fellow Harvard Lampoon and Hasty Pudding Theatricals alumnus Robert Emmet Sherwood and future friend and collaborator Dorothy Parker , who had taken over theatre criticism from P. G. Wodehouse years earlier . The format of Vanity Fair fit Benchley 's style very well , allowing his columns to have a humorous tone , often as straight parodies . Benchley 's work was typically published twice a month . Some of Benchley 's columns , featuring a character he created , were attributed to his pseudonym Brighton Perry , but he took credit for most of them himself . Sherwood , Parker , and Benchley became close , often having long lunches at the Algonquin Hotel . When the editorial managers went on a European trip , the three took advantage of the situation , writing articles mocking the local theatre establishment and offering parodic commentary on a variety of topics , such as the effect of Canadian hockey on United States fashion . This worried Sherwood , as he felt it could jeopardize his forthcoming raise . 
 The situation at Vanity Fair deteriorated upon management 's return . They sent out a memo forbidding the discussion of salaries in an attempt to rein in the staff . Benchley , Parker , and Sherwood responded with a memo of their own , followed by placards around their necks detailing their exact salaries for all to see . Management attempted to issue " tardy slips " for staff who were late . On one of these , Benchley wrote out , in very small handwriting , an elaborate excuse involving a herd of elephants on 44th Street . These issues contributed to a general deterioration of morale in the offices , culminating in Parker 's termination , allegedly due to complaints by the producers of the plays she skewered in her theatrical reviews . Upon learning of her termination , Benchley tendered his own resignation . Word of it was published in Time by Alexander Woollcott , who was at a lunch with Benchley , Parker , and others . Given that Benchley had two children at the time of his resignation , Parker referred to it as " the greatest act of friendship I 'd ever seen . " 
 Following word of Benchley 's resignation , freelance offers began piling up . He worked constantly while claiming he was intensely lazy . ( According to legend , he submitted a magazine piece titled " I Like to Loaf " two weeks after deadline . His explanatory note : “ I was loafing . ” ) He was offered $ 200 per basic subject article for The Home Sector , and a weekly freelance salary from New York World to write a book review column three times per week for the same salary he received at Vanity Fair . The column , titled " Books and Other Things , " ran for one year and roved beyond literature to mundane topics such as <unk> in Modern Practice . Unfortunately for Benchley , however , his writing a syndicated column for David Lawrence drew the ire of his World bosses , and " Books and Other Things " was dropped . 
 Benchley continued to freelance , submitting humor columns to a variety of publications , including Life ( where fellow humorist James Thurber stated that Benchley 's columns were the only reason the magazine was read ) . He continued meeting with his friends at the Algonquin , and the group became popularly known as the Algonquin Round Table . In April 1920 , Benchley landed a position with Life writing theatre reviews , which he would continue doing regularly through 1929 , eventually taking complete control of the drama section . His reviews were known for their flair , and he often used them as a soapbox for issues of concern to him , whether petty ( people who cough during plays ) or more important ( such as racial intolerance ) . 
 Things changed again for Benchley a number of years into the arrangement . A theatrical production by the members of the Round Table was put together in response to a challenge from actor J. M. Kerrigan , who was tired of the Table 's complaints about the ongoing theatre season . The result , which played for one night April 30 , 1922 at the 49th Street Theatre , was No Sirree ! ( the name being a pun of the European revue La <unk> @-@ Souris ) , " An Anonymous Entertainment by the Vicious Circle of the Hotel Algonquin . " Benchley 's contribution to the program , " The Treasurer 's Report , " featured Benchley as a nervous , disorganized man attempting to summarize an organization 's yearly expenses . The revue was applauded by both spectators and fellow actors , with Benchley 's performance receiving the biggest laughs . A reprise of " The Treasurer 's Report " was often requested for future events , and Irving Berlin hired Benchley for $ 500 a week to perform it nightly during Berlin 's Music Box Revue which opened in September 1921 and ran until September 1922 . 
 = = = Hollywood and The New Yorker call = = = 
 Benchley had continued to receive positive responses from his performing , and in 1925 he accepted a standing invitation from film producer Jesse L. Lasky for a six @-@ week term writing screenplays at $ 500 . While the session did not yield significant results , Benchley did get writing credit for producing the title cards on the Raymond Griffith silent film You 'd Be Surprised ( released September 1926 ) , and was invited to do some titling for two other films . 
 Benchley was also hired to help with the book for a Broadway musical , Smarty , starring Fred Astaire . This experience was not as positive , and most of Benchley 's contributions were excised and the final product , Funny Face , did not have Benchley 's name attached . Worn down , Benchley moved to his next commitment , an attempt at a talkie version of " The Treasurer 's Report " . The filming went by quickly , and though he was convinced he was not good , The Treasurer 's Report was a financial and critical success upon its release in 1928 . Benchley participated in two more films that year : a second talking film he wrote , The Sex Life of the <unk> , and a third starring but not written by him , The <unk> , all made in the Fox Movietone sound @-@ on @-@ film system and released by Fox Films . The films enjoyed similar success and were critically acclaimed , and Benchley was signed to a deal to produce more films before heading back to New York to continue writing . As Life would say following his eventual resignation in 1929 , " Mr. Benchley has left Dramatic Criticism for the Talking Movies " . 
 During the time that Benchley was filming various short films , he also began working at The New Yorker , which had started in February 1925 under the control of Benchley 's friend Harold Ross . While Benchley , along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances , was wary of getting involved with another publication for various reasons , he completed some freelance work for The New Yorker over the first few years , and was later invited to be newspaper critic . Benchley initially wrote the column under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes ( the lead conspirator in the English Gunpowder Plot ) , and the column was well received . Benchley tackled issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism , and the publication flourished . He was invited to be theatre critic for The New Yorker in 1929 , leaving Life , and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features in the magazine . The New Yorker published an average of forty @-@ eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s . 
 With the emergence of The New Yorker , Benchley was able to stay away from Hollywood work for a number of years . In 1931 , he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a film that would eventually be titled Sky Devils , and he acted in his first feature film , The Sport Parade ( 1932 ) with Joel McCrea . The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings , which embarrassed him ( even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley 's role ) , but the lure of filmmaking did not disappear , since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year for more money than he was making writing for The New Yorker . 
 = = = Benchley on film and " How to Sleep " = = = 
 Benchley re @-@ entered Hollywood at the height of the Great Depression and the large @-@ scale introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before . His arrival put him on the scene of a number of productions almost instantly . While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting , one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in Rafter Romance , and his work attracted the interest of MGM , who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films . Benchley , who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst , was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column . Before heading back to New York , Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady ( 1933 ) , which also featured Joan Crawford , Clark Gable , Fred Astaire , Nelson Eddy , and the Three Stooges . 
 In 1933 , Benchley returned to Hollywood , completing the short films Your Technocracy and Mine for Universal Pictures , How to Break 90 at Croquet for RKO , and the lavish feature @-@ length production China Seas for Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , starring Clark Gable , Jean Harlow , Wallace Beery , and Rosalind Russell ; Benchley 's character was slurring drunk throughout the movie . Upon completion , MGM invited Benchley to write and perform in a short production inspired by a Mellon Institute study on sleep commissioned by the Simmons Mattress Company . The resulting film , How to Sleep , was filmed in two days , and featured Benchley as both the narrator and sleeper , the latter a role Benchley claimed was " not much of a strain , as [ he ] was in bed most of the time . " The film was well received in preview screenings , and promotions took over , with a still from the film being used in Simmons advertisements . The only group not pleased was the Mellon Institute , who did not approve of the studio mocking their study . 
 This was followed in 1936 by How to be a Detective . The early success of How to Sleep prompted MGM to rush two more short films featuring Benchley , How to Train a Dog , a spoof of dog @-@ training techniques , and How to Behave , which lampooned etiquette norms . How to Sleep was named Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards , while the latter two shorts were not as well received . 
 Benchley returned to the cinema in 1937 , cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938 , and in his largest role to that point , the critically panned Live , Love and Learn . A short that Benchley completed for MGM , A Night at the Movies , was Benchley 's greatest success since How to Sleep , and won him a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York . These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts ( while How to Sleep needed two days , the later short How to Vote needed less than twelve hours ) , and took their toll on Benchley . He still completed two shoots in one day ( one of which was The Courtship of the Newt ) , but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule . 
 Benchley 's return yielded two more short films , and his high profile prompted negotiations for sponsorship of a Benchley radio program and numerous appearances on television shows , including the first television entertainment program ever broadcast , an untitled test program using an experimental antenna on the Empire State Building . The radio program , Melody and Madness , was more a showcase for Benchley 's acting , as he did not participate in writing it . It was not well received , and was removed from the schedule . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 1939 was a bad year for Benchley 's career . Besides the cancellation of his radio show , Benchley learned that MGM did not plan to renew his contract , and The New Yorker , frustrated with Benchley 's film career taking precedence over his theatre column , appointed Wolcott Gibbs to take over in his stead . Following his final New Yorker column in 1940 , Benchley signed with Paramount Pictures for another series of one @-@ reel shorts , all filmed at Paramount 's Long Island studio in Astoria , New York . Most of them were adapted from his old essays ( " Take the Witness ! , " with Benchley fantasizing about conquering a tough cross @-@ examination , was filmed as The Witness ; " The Real Public Enemies , " showing the criminal tendencies of sinister household objects , was filmed as Crime Control , etc . ) . In 1940 Benchley appeared in Alfred Hitchcock 's Foreign Correspondent for which he is also credited as one of the dialogue writers . In 1941 Benchley received two more feature @-@ length roles : Walt Disney 's The Reluctant Dragon , in which Benchley tours the various departments of the Disney studio , and Nice Girl ? with Deanna Durbin , noteworthy for a rare dramatic performance by Benchley . 
 Benchley 's roles primarily came as a freelance actor , as his Paramount shorts contract didn 't pay as well as feature films . Benchley was cast in minor roles for various romantic comedies , some shoots going better than others . He appeared in prominent roles with Fred Astaire in You 'll Never Get Rich ( 1941 ) and The Sky 's the Limit ( 1943 ) . Paramount did not renew his contract in 1943 , and Benchley signed back with MGM with an exclusive contract . The situation was not positive for Benchley , as the studio " mishandled " him and kept Benchley too busy to complete his own work . His contract concluded with only four short films completed and no chance of signing another contract . Following the printing of two books of his old New Yorker columns , Benchley gave up writing for good in 1943 , signing one more contract with Paramount in December of that year . 
 While Benchley 's books and Paramount contract were giving him financial security , he was still unhappy with the turn his career had taken . By 1944 he was taking thankless roles in the studio 's least distinguished films , like the rustic musical National Barn Dance . By this time Robert Benchley 's screen image was established as a comic lecturer who tried but failed to clarify any given topic . In this capacity Paramount cast him in the 1945 Bob Hope @-@ Bing Crosby comedy Road to Utopia ; Benchley interrupts the action periodically to " explain " the nonsensical storyline . On April 22 , 1945 , he guest starred on the Blue Network 's ( soon to be ABC ) top @-@ rated radio series The Andrews Sisters Show , sponsored by Nash motor cars & Kelvinator home appliances . 
 Benchley 's drinking , already a problem , worsened and he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver . ( Ironically , when younger , he had been an adamant teetotaler . ) While he completed his year 's work , his condition continued to deteriorate , and Benchley died in a New York hospital on November 21 , 1945 . His family opted for a private funeral service , and his body was cremated and interred in a family plot on the island of Nantucket . 
 = = Algonquin Round Table = = 
 The Algonquin Round Table was a group of New York City writers and actors who met regularly between 1919 and 1929 at the Algonquin Hotel . Initially consisting of Benchley , Dorothy Parker , and Alexander Woollcott during their time at Vanity Fair , the group eventually expanded to over a dozen regular members of the New York media and entertainment , such as playwrights George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly and journalist / critic Heywood Broun , who gained prominence due to his positions during the Sacco and Vanzetti trial . The table gained prominence due to the media attention the members drew as well as their collective contributions to their respective areas . 
 = = Humor style = = 
 Benchley 's humor was molded during his time at Harvard . While his skills as an orator were already known by classmates and friends , it was not until his work at the Lampoon that his style formed . The prominent styles of humor were then " <unk> " , which relied on devices such as dialects and a disdain for formal education in the style of humorists such as Artemis Ward and Petroleum Vesuvius <unk> , and a more " genteel " style of humor , very literary and upper @-@ class in nature , a style popularized by Oliver Wendell Holmes . While the two styles were , at first glance , diametrically opposed , they coexisted in magazines such as Vanity Fair and Life . The Lampoon primarily used the latter style , which suited Benchley . While some of his pieces would not have been out of place in a <unk> @-@ style presentation , Benchley 's reliance on puns and wordplay resonated more with the literary humorists , as shown by his success with The New Yorker , known for the highbrow tastes of its readers . 
 Benchley 's definition of humor was simplicity itself : “ Anything that makes people laugh . ” His favorite nursery rhyme was " One , two , three / Buckle my shoe . " 
 Benchley 's characters were typically exaggerated representations of the common man . They were designed to create a contrast between himself and the masses , who had less common sense . The character is often befuddled by many of the actions of society and is often neurotic in a " different " way — the character in How to Watch Football , for instance , finds it sensible for a normal fan to forgo the live experience and read the recap in the local papers . This character , labeled the " Little Man " and in some ways similar to many of Mark Twain 's protagonists , was based on Benchley himself ; the character did not persist in Benchley 's writing past the early 1930s , but survived in his speaking and acting roles . This character was apparent in Benchley 's Ivy Oration during his Harvard graduation ceremonies , and would appear throughout his career , such as during " The Treasurer 's Report " in the 1920s and his work in feature films in the 1930s . 
 Topical , current @-@ event style pieces written for Vanity Fair during the war did not lose their levity , either . He was not afraid to poke fun at the establishment ( one piece he wrote was titled " Have You a Little German Agent in Your Home ? " ) , and his common man observations often veered into angry rants , such as his piece " The Average Voter , " where the namesake of the piece " [ F ] <unk> what the paper said ... so votes straight <unk> ticket . " His lighter fare did not hesitate to touch upon topical issues , drawing analogies between a football game and patriotism , or chewing gum and diplomacy and economic relations with Mexico . 
 In his films , the common man exaggerations continued . Much of his time in the films was spent spoofing himself , whether it was the affected nervousness of the treasurer in The Treasurer 's Report or the discomfort in explaining The Sex Life of the <unk> to a women 's club . The longer , plot @-@ driven shorts , such as Lesson Number One , Furnace Trouble , and <unk> , Fried and Boiled , likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks . Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities , such as the incapable sportscaster Benchley played in The Sport Parade . 
 Benchley 's humor inspired a number of later humorists and filmmakers . Dave Barry , author , onetime humor writer for the Miami Herald , and judge of the 2006 and 2007 Robert Benchley Society Award for Humor , has called Benchley his " idol " and he " always wanted to write like [ Benchley ] . " Horace Digby claimed that , " [ M ] ore than anyone else , Robert Benchley influenced [ his ] early writing style . " Outsider filmmaker Sidney N. <unk> lists Benchley as an influence as well , and James Thurber used Benchley as a reference point , citing Benchley 's penchant for presenting " the commonplace as remarkable " in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty . 
 = = Works = = 
 Benchley produced over 600 essays , which were initially compiled in twelve volumes , during his writing career . He also appeared in a number of films , including 48 short treatments that he mostly wrote or co @-@ wrote and numerous feature films . 
 Posthumously , Benchley 's works continue to be released in books such as the 1983 Random House compilation The Best of Robert Benchley , and the 2005 collection of short films Robert Benchley and the Knights of the Algonquin , which compiled many of Benchley 's popular short films from his years at Paramount with other works from fellow humorists and writers Alexander Woollcott and Donald Ogden Stewart .

 = Mereka Bilang , Saya Monyet ! = 
 Mereka Bilang , Saya Monyet ! ( released internationally as They Say I 'm a Monkey ! ) is a 2008 Indonesian film directed by Djenar Maesa Ayu . Starring Titi Rajo Bintang , Henidar Amroe , and Ray <unk> , it tells the life story of Adjeng , who was sexually abused as a child by her mother 's boyfriend . Filmed over 18 days after several years of development , the film adapted two of Ayu 's short stories from her debut anthology of the same name . Owing to its low budget of Rp 620 million , its cast and crew were mostly amateurs and students , although several established actors appeared at reduced rates . 
 Mereka Bilang , Saya Monyet ! has been described as " anti @-@ Sjuman " because of the disparity between Ayu 's more personal directing style and the social realism of her father , Sjumandjaja . Although commercially unsuccessful , the film was well received by critics . It won five national @-@ level awards and was screened at several international film festivals . Two Indonesian publications , Tempo and The Jakarta Post , selected it as among the best films of 2008 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Adjeng ( Titi Rajo Bintang ) lives alone in an apartment paid for by her boyfriend , a rich businessman ( Joko Anwar ) . A writer of children 's stories , she wishes to write short stories for adults ; in this , she is mentored by Asmoro ( Ray Sahetapy ) – with whom she is also having sex . Meanwhile , Adjeng 's mother ( Henidar Amroe ) handles various aspects of her life , constantly calling her and making surprise visits . This has led Adjeng 's friends , Venny ( Ayu Dewi ) and Andien ( Fairuz Faisal ) , to tease her about her overbearing mother . 
 When Adjeng goes clubbing with her friends , she drinks too much and vomits , later passing out in a toilet . As she lies with her head on the seat she recalls that , as a child ( Nadya <unk> ) , she had been forced to eat vegetables she had previously vomited . Later , when Andien uses her apartment for a one @-@ night stand , Adjeng peeks and recalls how she had observed her mother having sex with her lover ( <unk> Depp ) , a man who had previously molested Adjeng – an act which is not shown explicitly . This background , as well as her recollections of life as a teenager ( played by Banyu Bening ) at the home of her womanising father ( August Melasz ) are worked into Adjeng 's short story " Lintah " ( " Leech " ) . 
 When Asmoro reads the story , he says that it is unrealistic and that readers need a climax . However , Adjeng insists that reality is unrealistic and that not all victims of rape are willing to call the police . Several days later , while they are lying in bed , Asmoro shows Adjeng that " Lintah " had been published in Kompas . Adjeng 's mother , aware of the story 's autobiographical nature , is furious and , after going to Adjeng 's apartment , blames everything on Adjeng 's father abandoning them . 
 Upset , Adjeng goes out with Venny and Andien , but when the two begin arguing about motherhood Adjeng leaves them both in the street . She then goes to a café to drink with Asmoro , who comforts her . When she returns home she checks her messages , most of which are about the short story . Venny and Andien , meanwhile , return to their families and think of the importance of children . 
 The following day , Asmoro sees the businessman , Adjeng 's boyfriend , leaving her apartment , which puts him in a foul mood . He and Adjeng fight , and Asmoro almost smothers Adjeng with a pillow before saying that they are through . As Adjeng lies on the bed , she recalls how her mother 's lover raped her and how her mother murdered him . As the phone rings , Adjeng watches the people from her past going about life in a residential complex , smiles , and returns to writing .

 The film was originally meant to be based on the short story " Mereka Bilang , Saya Monyet ! " from Djenar Maesa Ayu 's 2002 debut , a critically and commercially successful short story anthology of the same name . However , Djenar later chose to base the film on " Lintah " ( " Leech " ) and " <unk> <unk> " ( " Painting the Window " ) , two other stories from the anthology . Ayu had originally not intended to film her stories , but agreed after she was approached by a consortium who offered to fund her . She asked Indra Herlambang , a writer @-@ cum @-@ television personality , to help her write the screenplay as she " never could write stories with a plot " , and she needed him to keep her motivated . The two wrote the screenplay over a period of two years , having difficulty finding new investors after the original ones dropped out . 
 In 2004 Ayu began taking filmmaking classes to prepare herself to direct the film . She also watched several films directed by her father , the director Sjumandjaja , in preparation for production . Production began in October 2006 , with some of the film crew – including art director <unk> B. Yasin – drawn in after Ayu met them at a cafe in South Jakarta and discovered that they were active in the local indie film scene . The group helped collect the Rp 620 million ( US $ 75 @,@ 000 ) needed for production ; as a cost @-@ saving measure , numerous crew members were film students . 
 Many of the roles were written with specific actors in mind , with casting for other roles promoted by word of mouth . Titi Rajo Bintang , a lecturer at the Daya Kemang Institute of Art , was cast in the starring role of Adjeng after Ayu and her then @-@ husband , Sri Aksana Sjuman ( Ayu 's brother ) , convinced her . At first she was uncomfortable with some of her scenes and her lack of training , as this was her first film role . However , she received support from her husband , who told her that she should act professionally and that " in a kissing scene ... [ her ] body should not reject it " . The couple also provided the soundtrack for Mereka Bilang , Saya Monyet ! , including three original songs – " When You Smile " , " Someday " , and " Love , Sadness & Happiness " – performed by Rajo Bintang . 
 Model turned actress Henidar Amroe was chosen to play Adjeng 's mother ; Ayu later said that the role had been written with her in mind . Although worried about the sexual content of the film , Amroe accepted the role , calling it a " crazy " plot that " read like a foreign movie " . The young Adjeng was played by Ayu 's daughter , Banyu Bening . Several of the established actors cast , including Jajang C. Noer , Ray Sahetapy , and August Melasz , agreed to appear in the film for less than their usual fee . Shooting took place over 18 days , although 14 had originally been allocated . 
 = = Style and themes = = 
 Mereka Bilang , Saya Monyet ! deals with the after effects of child molestation in a way that the Indonesian magazine Tempo describes as an " interesting time control experiment " , replete with flashbacks which clearly establish the time frame in which scenes happen . According to <unk> Adi , in his review for Kompas , Adjeng 's writing is her therapy , as it entails constant reconstruction and deconstruction of her troubled past ; he posits that this ultimately allows Adjeng to fight back against the authority figures who had troubled her since she was young . In a making @-@ of documentary on the film , Ayu said that she had no moral message or social criticism in mind when creating the film , considering it instead a form of self @-@ exploration . Admitting that the film could be read as a critique of violence against women and children , she said that she could empathise as a woman . 
 Adi also sees a love – hate relationship between Adjeng and her mother , which results in Adjeng 's promiscuity – a common act in the Sastra <unk> literary movement of which Ayu is considered a part . The relationship between mother and daughter is reflective of themes in the earlier works Pasir Berbisik ( Whispering Sands ; 2001 ) , by Nan Achnas , and Eliana , Eliana ( 2003 ) , by Riri Riza . However , unlike the aforementioned films , Mereka Bilang , Saya Monyet ! did not end with the daughter and mother on divergent paths . The reviewer <unk> Indrarto , also writing for Kompas , wrote that Adjeng was the title " monkey " character of the film , being looked down upon by everyone around her ; however , those who judge her do not actually know her , thus , in Indrarto 's opinion , making them the " monkeys " . 
 A review in Tempo described the film as " anti @-@ Sjuman " owing to the differences in styles between father and daughter . Sjumandjaja 's films tended to fall under social realism , while Ayu 's debut had more of a personal , symbolic aspect with a touch of surrealism . The film does not show Adjeng 's molestation , instead symbolizing it by showing a leech feeding ; in one case , when Adjeng is raped in a bathtub , losing her virginity , the scene is represented by blood @-@ red water and numerous leeches feeding .

" Iskandar Liem , writing for The Jakarta Post , also listed the film as among the top ten of the year , alongside international works such as Christopher Nolan 's The Dark Knight and another Indonesian film , Riri Riza 's Laskar Pelangi ( The Rainbow Warriors ) . He described the film as " unflinching in its brutal honesty and fluid in its visual allegory " , welcoming Ayu as " a rebellious new voice " in Indonesia 's film industry . 
 <unk> <unk> , an organiser of the women @-@ themed film festival V , described Djenar as " an example of director who can portray a strong woman in her films " , with the film " breaking new ground " in portraying women 's sexuality .

 In his review for Kompas , Adi wrote that Ayu had made a well developed and acted film , a " good debut for [ Indonesia 's ] future director " , although he considered the cinematography incapable of fully expressing the character 's psychological torment .

 = Waldorf – Astoria ( New York , 1893 ) = 
 The Waldorf – Astoria originated as two hotels , built side @-@ by @-@ side by feuding relatives on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan . Built in 1893 and expanded in 1897 , the Waldorf – Astoria was razed in 1929 to make way for construction of the Empire State Building . Its successor , the current Waldorf Astoria New York , was built on Park Avenue in 1931 . 
 The original Waldorf Hotel opened on March 13 , 1893 at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street , on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had previously built his mansion . Constructed in the German Renaissance style by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh , it stood 225 feet ( 69 m ) high , with 15 public rooms and 450 guest rooms , and a further 100 rooms allocated to servants , with laundry facilities on the upper floors . It was heavily furnished with European antiques brought back by founding proprietor George Boldt and his wife from a 1892 visit to Europe . The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf , and soon after opening , it became one of the best restaurants in New York City , rivaling Delmonico 's and Sherry 's . 
 The Astoria Hotel opened in 1897 on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street , next door to the Waldorf . It was also designed in the German Renaissance style by Hardenbergh , at a height of about 270 feet ( 82 m ) , with 16 stories , 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms . The ballroom , in the Louis XIV style , has been described as the " pièce de résistance " of the hotel , with a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1 @,@ 200 at concerts . The Astor Dining Room was faithfully reproduced from the original dining room of the mansion which once stood on the site . 
 Connected by the 300 metres ( 980 ft ) long " Peacock Alley " after the merger in 1897 , the hotel had 1 @,@ 300 bedrooms , making it the largest hotel in the world at the time . It was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent " wealthy upper crust " of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city . It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms . The Waldorf gained world renown for its fundraising dinners and balls , as did its celebrity maître d 'hôtel , Oscar Tschirky , known as " Oscar of the Waldorf " . Tschirky authored The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf ( 1896 ) , a 900 @-@ page book featuring all of the recipes of the day , including his own , such as Waldorf salad , Eggs Benedict and Thousand Island dressing , which remain popular worldwide today .

 William Astor , motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor , built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house , on the site of his father 's mansion at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street . His father had been the millionaire developer , William Waldorf Astor . The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt , who owned and operated the Bellevue @-@ Stratford Hotel , an elite boutique hotel in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , with his wife Louise <unk> Boldt . The original plans for the Waldorf were for a hotel with 11 stories . Boldt 's wife , Louise , believed that 13 was a lucky number . She persuaded her husband to add two floors to the construction . William Astor 's construction of a hotel next to his aunt 's house worsened his feud with her , but , with Boldt 's assistance , John Astor persuaded his mother to move uptown . The Waldorf Hotel , named after the little town of Walldorf , in Baden @-@ Württemberg , Germany , the Astors ’ ancestral home , was opened for business March 13 , 1893 . 
 Early on , the Waldorf was a laughing stock with its large number of bathrooms and was known briefly as " Boldt 's Folly " after Boldt , or " Astor 's Folly " , with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in New York City . It appeared destined for failure . Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood . Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs . In the face of all of this , Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary 's Hospital for Children the day after the Waldorf opened . The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register . Despite the rain , the ballroom filled with many of New York 's First Families , who had paid $ 5 @.@ 00 for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf . Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt donated the services of the New York Symphony Orchestra led by Walter Damrosch to provide the music for the event . Even with proper escort , women of the times generally did not venture into hotels , but those attending also toured the facilities . While Boldt made news by insisting the Waldorf 's waiters be clean @-@ shaven even though he wore a beard , his decision to hire young Oscar Tschirky was one of the key factors in the hotel 's success . Oscar was personable , humble and very willing to tend to patrons ' needs on an individual basis . More than thirty years later , Tschirky was able to recall the Waldorf 's opening day and the names of many of the Social Register guests who made the hotel successful when it hosted the charity concert and dinner . Business soon picked up and it earned $ 4 @.@ 5 million in its first year , exorbitant for that period . By 1895 , the Waldorf added a five story addition . This brought the hotel 's ballroom down to the main floor ; the move brought many parties and dinners which were formerly held in private homes , into the Waldorf . Adjacent to the new ballroom was the Oak Room , where one could sit by large fireplaces where there were always logs on the hearth . In winter , waiters would offer patrons complimentary baked potatoes with butter .

 When a decision was made to build a second hotel next to the Waldorf , truce provisions were developed between the Astors which reserved some proprietary rights . The plan design used corridors to join the two buildings and there was even a bond provision for bricking up the corridors should the need arise . On November 1 , 1897 , Waldorf 's cousin , John Jacob Astor IV , opened the 16 story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site . The Astoria , named after Astoria , Oregon which was founded by John Jacob Astor in 1811 , stood on the site of William B. Astor ’ s house , and was leased to Boldt . 
 The two hotels , under one management , were renamed the Waldorf – Astoria . Situated on Fifth Avenue in what is now Midtown Manhattan , it was surrounded by streets on all sides . The Waldorf – Astoria had a frontage of 200 feet ( 61 m ) on Fifth Avenue , 350 feet ( 110 m ) on 33rd Street , 350 feet ( 110 m ) on 34th Street , and 200 feet ( 61 m ) on Astor Court , with 13 entrances opening directly from these thoroughfares . Below , extending to a depth 42 feet ( 13 m ) beneath the sidewalk , and occupying an additional area of 75 by 242 feet ( 23 m × 74 m ) running toward Broadway , were the basements , which contained the engine room , laundries , kitchens , and even the Waldorf @-@ Astoria Cigar Company . From the sidewalk to the observatory roof was a height of 250 feet ( 76 m ) . It was the largest hotel in the world at the time . The cost of the two buildings , exclusive of the furnishings but including the land , was about $ 15 million . The assessed value in 1897 was $ 12 @,@ 125 @,@ 000 , making it the next most valuable parcel on Fifth Avenue , after the B. Altman and Company site . The hotel became , according to author Sean Dennis Cashman , " a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family " . 
 The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century , with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor ( 1904 ) , The St. Regis ( 1904 ) , The Knickerbocker ( 1906 ) , and the Savoy @-@ Plaza Hotel ( 1927 ) . By the 1920s , the hotel was becoming dated , and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street . The Astor family sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3 , 1929 ; it was demolished soon afterwards . The Waldorf – Astoria Hotel records of 1893 – 1929 are held by the New York Public Library 's Archives & Manuscripts division .

 From its inception , the Waldorf was always a " must stay " hotel for foreign dignitaries . The viceroy of China , Li Hung @-@ Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred @-@ year @-@ old eggs which he brought with him . Mr. Li also brought his own stoves , chefs and servants with him to prepare and serve his meals . Upon his departure from the Waldorf , he ordered a basket of roses to be sent to every female guest at the hotel , and was very generous in the gifts and gratuities he provided for the hotel 's staff . In 1902 , a lavish dinner was organized for Prince Henry of Prussia ; in addition , the hotel built a private door on its 33rd Street side and installed a private elevator . The staff was also called upon to form a " bucket brigade " for the prince 's bath when there was a problem with the plumbing in the royal suite . One early wealthy resident was Chicago businessman J. W. Gates who would gamble on stocks on Wall Street and play poker at the hotel . He paid up to $ 50 @,@ 000 a year to hire suites at the hotel , where he had his own private entrance and elevator . Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna of Russia was invited by Waldorf president Lucius Bloomer to stay at the hotel in the 1920s . 
 The Waldorf – Astoria gained significant renown for its fundraising dinners and balls , regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie who became a fixture . Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty . On February 11 , 1899 , Oscar of the Waldorf hosted a lavish dinner reception which the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city 's costliest dinner at the time . Some $ 250 was spent per guest , with <unk> oysters , green turtle soup , lobster , ruddy duck and blue raspberries . Two months later , 120 sailors of the cruiser Raleigh were given a banquet , during which the gallery was decorated with silk banners and flags . One article that year claimed that at any one time the hotel had $ 7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe , testament to the wealth of its guests . In 1909 , banquets , attended by hundreds , were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary , a founder of US Steel , the following month . 
 The hotel was also influential in advancing the status of women , who were admitted singly without escorts . Boldt 's wife , Louise , was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center , particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events , or just to be seen in the Peacock Alley . The combined hotel was the first to do away with a ladies @-@ only parlor and provided women with a place to play billiards and ping @-@ pong . It was the first New York hotel to allocate an entire room for afternoon tea . The teas began in the Waldorf Garden with attendance eventually being so large , both the Empire Room and at times , the Rose Room , had to be opened during the hours of four and six pm to accommodate the number of guests . Men were admitted to the teas only if they were in the company of a woman . 
 The United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19 , 1912 and continued there for some time in the Myrtle Room , before moving on to Washington , D.C. John Jacob Astor IV was one of the people who perished on its ill @-@ fated journey . 
 The Waldorf – Astoria Orchestra was under the direction of Joseph Knecht , who was formerly assistant concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera House . Consisting of fifty musicians , it was maintained by Boldt at an annual expense of $ 100 @,@ 000 . The orchestra performed regular Sunday night concerts in the grand ballroom . The Waldorf – Astoria Bar was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel 's inception in 1893 , such as Diamond Jim Brady , Buffalo Bill Cody and Bat Masterson . A number of cocktails were invented at the bar , including the Rob Roy ( 1894 ) and the Bobbie Burns .

 On the exterior , the two and three lower stories in the respective buildings were of red sandstone , while the balance of the work to the roof @-@ line was red brick and red terracotta . The building rested on solid rock and contained a fireproof steel frame . The first and second floors contained public spaces . The Waldorf @-@ Astoria Segar Company was housed in the basement . 
 The combined hotel , after merging in 1897 , had 1 @,@ 300 bedrooms and 178 bathrooms , making it the largest hotel in the world at the time . With a telephone in every room and first @-@ class room service , the hotel was designed specifically to cater to the needs of the socially prominent , " wealthy , upper crust " of New York , as well as distinguished foreign visitors to the city . It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms , and featured numerous Turkish and Russian baths for the gentlemen of the day to relax in . Many of the floors were arranged as separate hotels to further the comfort of the guests . Each of these floors had its own team of assistants — clerks , maids , page boys , waiters — as well as telephone and dumbwaiter service , and refrigerators . The bedrooms and corridors were heated by direct radiation . The family included a stained glass picture of Walldorf in the design of the hotel ; it was located on the 33rd Street side over the main entrance to the South Palm Garden .

 The Waldorf Hotel , built at a reported cost of about $ 5 million , opened on March 13 , 1893 at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street , on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had previously built his mansion . The hotel stood 225 feet ( 69 m ) high , about 50 feet ( 15 m ) lower than the Astoria , with a frontage of about 100 feet ( 30 m ) on Fifth Avenue , and a total area of 69 @,@ 475 square feet ( 6 @,@ 454 @.@ 4 m2 ) . It was a German Renaissance structure , designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh , with 15 public rooms and 450 guest rooms , and a further 100 rooms allocated to servants , with laundry facilities on the upper floors . The New York Times proclaimed the hotel a palace after it opened in 1893 . 
 The exterior featured loggias , balconies , gables , groups of chimneys , and tiled roofs . One of the chief features was the interior garden court , with fountains and flowers , walls of white terracotta , frescoes and stained glass . The main entrance to the hotel was " sheltered by an elaborate frosted @-@ glass @-@ and @-@ wrought @-@ iron marquee " , and the entrance hall was built in Sienna marble , with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling . The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897 . 
 Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room , with an alcove off it containing the elevators and grand staircase . Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor , which was used as a reception room for women . It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe , including a bust of Marie Antoinette , and an antique clock which was once owned by her . The ceiling featured frescoes by Will <unk> Low , the central of which was called The Birth of Venus . The Gentleman 's Cafe was furnished with " robust black oak paneling , hunting murals , and stag @-@ horn <unk> " . 
 The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf , and soon after opening , it became one of the best restaurants in New York City , rivaling Delmonico 's and Sherry 's . It was modelled after the grand salon in King Ludwig 's palace at Munich , with satin hangings , upholstery and marble pillars , all of pale green , and Crowninshield 's frescoes . Empire in style , the Waldorf 's restaurant feathered columns of dark @-@ green marble , and the pilasters that came opposite them were of mahogany , with ormolu work in the panels . The caps and bases of both columns and pilasters were gilded . This treatment occupied most of the wall space . The ceiling was divided by heavy beams running from column to column , and between these the flat space was divided into oval and other shaped panels with light mouldings . The color scheme was in tints of pale @-@ green and cream . The panels of the ceiling were frescoed with figures in pinkish @-@ red on a blue sky or field . The walls were principally mahogany and gold , with a little color in the comparatively small wall @-@ spaces left between openings . Among the other rooms were the Turkish smoking room , with low <unk> and ancient Moorish armor , and the ballroom , in white and gold , with Louis XIV decorations . 
 The Waldorf State Apartments , consisting of nine suites , were located on the second floor . The apartments , including the Henry IV Drawing Room , featured 16th and 17th century French and Italian antiques which Boldt and his wife had brought back from Europe . Francois V Bedroom was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau , and over the years was occupied by the likes of Li Hung @-@ Chang of China , <unk> Maha <unk> , Prince of Siam , and Albert of Saxe @-@ Coburg . The apartments had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20 , with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits . There were about 6 @,@ 000 lights in the hotel , with as many as 1 @,@ 000 were small candelabra lamps mounted in specially designed fixtures . The electric fixtures were all furnished by the Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company , of New York , while the contract for the general installation work was carried out by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company , of New York , the actual work of wiring being done by the Eastern District of the General Electric Company . The building was wired throughout on the system of the Interior Conduit and Insulation Company .

 The Astoria Hotel , opened in 1897 , was situated on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street . It was designed in the German Renaissance style by Henry J. Hardenbergh , the same architect who designed the Waldorf . With dimensions of 99 by 350 feet ( 30 m × 107 m ) , its height , from the floor of the sub @-@ basement , which was 33 feet ( 10 m ) below the street level , to the roof @-@ line , was about 270 feet ( 82 m ) , or about 240 feet ( 73 m ) above the street @-@ level . It was 16 stories in height , including the four stories in the roof . The building was constructed of stone , marble and brick , with a steel skeleton frame and modern fireproof interior construction , and was embellished with " French Second Empire Mansard @-@ roofed towers with iron @-@ work cresting as well as Austrian Baroque onion @-@ domes over corners turrets " . There were 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms , with miles of corridors , vestibules and balls . The entrance featured a double set of plate glass doors to give protection in cold weather , and a U @-@ shaped driveway for horse and carriages . 
 The main corridor was nicknamed " Peacock Alley " by the New York press . The corridor and foyer were treated with pilasters and columns of Sienna marble and a color scheme on the walls and ceilings of salmon @-@ pink , with cream @-@ color and pale @-@ green . The capitals of the columns and pilasters were of solid brass gilded or lacquered . The main corridor ran the entire length of the building from east to west . To the left of it was the Astor Dining Room , fronting on Fifth Avenue , which measured 50 by 92 feet ( 15 m × 28 m ) . Great care was taken with it to faithfully reproduce the original dining room of the mansion , three floors above where it had stood , with all of the original paneling , carpeting , drapery and fireplace mantel and Italian Renaissance pilasters and columns , carved of marble from northern Russia . The panels of silk hangings were of rose pompadour , and a series of Charles Yardley Turner mural paintings filled arches and panels at the south end of the room . On the right of the main corridor was the Garden Court of Palms , 88 by 57 feet ( 27 m × 17 m ) , rising three stories to a dome @-@ like roof of amber glass 56 feet ( 17 m ) above the floor . This , too , was used as a dining room . It was decorated in the Italian style , finished in gray , terracotta and <unk> marble . On the 34th Street side of the corridor was the cafe , 40 by 95 feet ( 12 m × 29 m ) , finished in English oak in the style of the German Renaissance , with Flemish decoration . The bar formed another room 40 by 50 feet ( 12 m × 15 m ) . 
 On the first floor , at the head @-@ of the east main staircase , was the Astor Gallery , 87 by 102 feet ( 27 m × 31 m ) , looking out on 34th Street . The gallery , with seven French windows reaching 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) from floor to ceiling , opened out on a terrace over the entrance to the hotel . The interior was finished in the style of the Hôtel de <unk> , with a blue , gray and gold color scheme . There was a parquet floor , and on the south side , opposite the street windows , were other windows which opened into the main corridor on the second floor . The musicians ' balcony , upheld by two caryatids , was at the east end . All the balcony railings were of gilded metal work . The mural paintings were notable : four panels , two at either end of the room , and twelve pendentive panels , six on either side and painted by Edward Simmons depicted the four seasons and the twelve months of the year . The " Colonial Room " was decorated in red , contrasting with white woodwork . The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner , with large drawing rooms , dining room , butler 's pantry , hallway , three bedrooms , three maids ' bedrooms and five bathrooms , all finished in old English oak . All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor . There was a bath for nearly every room , and every bathroom had windows opening to the air , not into shafts . In every room , there was a large trunk closet . 
 The ballroom , in the Louis XIV style , has been described as the " pièce de résistance " of the hotel , measuring 65 feet ( 20 m ) by 95 feet ( 29 m ) and 40 feet ( 12 m ) ( three stories ) in height . It had a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1 @,@ 200 at concerts , and featured tints of ivory @-@ gray and cream in its design . Noted vocalists such as Enrico Caruso and Nellie Melba performed in the ballroom , with conductor Anton Seidl leading a series of concerts there in the year the combined hotels opened for business . It was possible to buy season tickets for the musical offerings ; a box for a season was US $ 350 and a seat for a season on the ballroom floor was priced at US $ 60 . 
 On the hotel 's top floor was the roof @-@ garden , enclosed on all sides by glass , with a glass roof over . It was furnished with rattan chairs and lounges in pale @-@ green and pink , hung across with gauzy fabric . On the roof on the 34th Street side was the grand promenade , 90 by 200 feet ( 27 m × 61 m ) , on solid footing high in the air , with a band stand , fountains , and trellises of columns . The roof garden restaurant occupied a space 75 by 84 feet ( 23 m × 26 m ) , and was roofed in . The ceiling was 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) high . At the northeast and northwest corners of the roof garden were towers , with spiral stairways within , leading up to the copper covered roofs of the pavilions , which were 250 feet ( 76 m ) above the sidewalk . The palm gardens , used as cafes , rose to a height of two and three stories respectively and were roofed @-@ over with domes of tinted glass . Balconies at the various floor levels opened on to these courts to overlook them . The materials used were cream @-@ colored brick and terracotta , and were Italian Renaissance in style . 
 In the sub @-@ basement were the Sprague screw machines for the electric elevators , the fire pumps , the house pumps , the ice plant , and the six Babcock & Wilcox <unk> tube boilers . The elevator system , which served the house from <unk> to roof , was electric , taking its power from the generating plant within the building . There were 18 elevators . The machinery was located in the sub @-@ basement . The boilers aggregated about 3 @,@ 000 horse power , the electric generators taking 2 @,@ 200 horse @-@ power of the total energy . The elevators were run by it , as were the 15 @,@ 000 incandescent lamps , branching from 7 @,@ 500 outlets . The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub @-@ basement that forced the fresh air between steam @-@ coils , where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms . This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere .

 William Waldorf Astor ( 1848 – 1919 ) was a wealthy American attorney , politician , businessman , and newspaper publisher of the Astor family . He was the only child of financier / philanthropist John Jacob Astor III ( 1822 – 1890 ) and Charlotte Augusta Gibbes ( 1825 – 1887 ) . Described as being a " very prickly sort of person " , he had a background in Europe and earned wealth buying and selling country estates in England including Cliveden and Hever Castle . In his early adult years , Astor returned to the United States and began studies at Columbia Law School . He was called to the United States Bar in 1875 . He worked for a short time in law practice and in the management of his father 's estate of financial and real estate holdings . On his death in 1919 , he was reputed to have been worth £ 200 million , which he left in trust for his two sons Waldorf and John Jacob . His half share of the Waldorf Astoria and the Astor Hotel at the time were reported to have been worth £ 10 million . 
 George Boldt ( 1851 – 1916 ) , the founding proprietor , was a Prussian @-@ born American hotelier and self @-@ made millionaire who influenced the development of the urban hotel as a civic social center and luxury destination . His motto was " the guest is always right " , and he became a wealthy and prominent figure internationally . The hotel was built to his specifications . He served as president and director of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel Company , as well as the Waldorf – Astoria Segar Company and the Waldorf Importation Company . He also owned and operated the Bellevue @-@ Stratford Hotel , an elite boutique hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia , with his wife , Louise . Boldt was described as " Mild mannered , undignified , unassuming " , resembling " a typical German professor with his close @-@ cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed ... and his pince @-@ nez glasses on a black silk cord " . Boldt retained his contacts with the European elite and he and his wife made frequent trips to Europe , bringing back with them many antiques , a characteristic of the Waldorf Astoria . Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed . 
 Lucius M. Boomer ( 1878 – 1947 ) was an American hotelier and businessman , responsible for the general management of the hotel for many years . Physically impressive and brassy , he displayed total dedication to his job and great discipline and care towards his staff , becoming one of the most famous hoteliers of his time . Boomer became interested in the hotel after the death of Boldt in 1916 and purchased it , before buying the Bellevue @-@ Stratford two years later . Following the retirement of Louis Sherry in 1920 , he became directing head of the Louis Sherry Ice Cream and Chocolate Company , and was later president of restaurant chain Savarin , Inc . Boomer was primarily responsible for the decision to demolish the hotel and build the new one on Park Avenue in 1931 . He continued to manage the hotel until his death in Norway in July 1947 . 
 Henry J. Hardenbergh ( 1847 – 1918 ) was an American architect who designed both hotels in the German Renaissance style . Apprenticed in New York from 1865 to 1870 under Detlef Lienau , in 1870 , opened his own practice there . He obtained his first contracts for three buildings at Rutgers College in New Brunswick , New Jersey — the expansion of Alexander Johnston Hall ( 1871 ) , designing and building Geology Hall ( 1872 ) and the Kirkpatrick Chapel ( 1873 ) — through family connections . Hardenbergh designed the Dakota Apartments in 1884 , and after building the Waldorf he went on to have an illustrious career as " America 's premiere architect of grand hotels " , designing the Manhattan Hotel ( 1896 ) , the Plaza Hotel ( 1907 ) , the Martinique Hotel ( 1911 ) and numerous other hotels in cities such as Boston and Washington , D.C. 
 Louis Sherry ( 1855 – 1926 ) was an American restaurateur , caterer , confectioner and hotelier during the Gilded Age and early 20th century , who was of considerable renown in the business . His name is typically associated with an upscale brand of candy and ice cream , and also the The Sherry @-@ Netherland hotel in New York City . In 1919 , Sherry announced an " alliance " with the Waldorf – Astoria that involved both his candies and catering services . Although it was not disclosed at that time , at some point ownership of Louis Sherry Inc. was significantly vested in " Boomer @-@ duPont interests " , a reference to Lucius M. Boomer , then chairman of the Waldorf – Astoria , and T. Coleman du Pont . 
 Oscar Tschirky ( 1866 – 1950 ) , known as " Oscar of the Waldorf " , was a Swiss chef , maître d 'hôtel from the hotel 's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943 . Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland ten years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf and over the years grew to possess an encyclopedic @-@ like knowledge of cuisine and the special trimmings and preferences that the regular diners desired . He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf ( 1896 ) , a 900 @-@ page book featuring all of the recipes of the day , including his own , such as Waldorf salad , Eggs Benedict and Thousand Island dressing , which remain popular worldwide today . James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who " composed sonatas in soups , symphonies in salads , minuets in sauces , lyrics in entrees " . In 1902 Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf – Astoria , a booklet which explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite . Tschirky continued to work for the Waldorf Astoria after the original hotel was demolished until his retirement in 1943 . 
 = Indiana State House = 
 The Indiana State House is the state capitol building of the U.S. state of Indiana . Housing the Indiana General Assembly , the office of the Governor of Indiana , the Supreme Court of Indiana , and other state officials , it is located in the state capital Indianapolis at 200 West Washington Street . Built in 1888 , it is the fifth building to house the state government . 
 The first statehouse , located in Corydon , Indiana , is still standing and is maintained as a state historic site . The second building was the old Marion County courthouse which was demolished and replaced in the early 20th century . The third building was a structure modeled on the Parthenon , but was condemned in 1877 because of structural defects and razed so the current statehouse could be built on its location .

 When Indiana became a state in 1816 , the capital was located in Corydon . The first capitol building was a humble , two @-@ story limestone building constructed in 1813 to house the legislature of the Indiana Territory . The building was constructed by a company owned by Dennis Pennington , a member of the early territorial legislature . Construction cost $ 1 @,@ 500 , paid for by the citizens of Harrison County , and was completed in three years . It measured forty @-@ feet square with walls two @-@ feet @-@ thick and ten @-@ foot ceilings . The building was made of limestone cut from a nearby quarry and , at the time of its completion , was one of the largest buildings in the state . 
 The capitol contained three rooms and quickly became too small for the state government , which had to erect additional office buildings across the street for the state 's administration . The lower floor of the statehouse was used by the Indiana House of Representatives . The upper floor was split into two rooms , one for the Indiana State Senate and another for the Indiana Supreme Court , with a narrow hall between them . The building was abandoned as the capitol in 1824 and was given to Harrison County to use as a courthouse . The old capitol building is still preserved and is now a state historic site .

 When the state government relocated to Indianapolis in December 1824 , the government was housed in the Marion County Courthouse . The courthouse had been constructed with state funds in 1822 after Indianapolis was chosen as the site for the new capitol . The courthouse served as the state capitol building for twelve years . At the time Indianapolis was a frontier site , nearly 60 miles ( 97 km ) from the nearest settlement of significance , making large scale construction impractical . 
 The relocation to Indianapolis was an arduous task . At the time it was an eleven @-@ day journey by horseback from Corydon to the new capital . To complicate matters , no road existed and a path for the wagons had to be cut through the dense forests during the winter transit as the long caravan moved north . The caravan was large because it contained the state treasury , state library , state records , the furniture of the General Assembly , Supreme Court , and <unk> Offices , along with a whole host of other implements to aid the caravan on its long journey . Colonel Samuel Merrill , the state treasurer , was authorized by the General Assembly to oversee the move . Ultimately , it took more than a month to relocate the government to Indianapolis . The first session of the General Assembly convened there in January 1825 . 
 = = = Third statehouse = = = 
 In 1831 , the Indiana General Assembly approved construction of a new statehouse . The building was to be funded by the sale of lots of land in Indianapolis . A commission was established and Commissioner James Blake offered a $ 150 prize to the architect who could design the best statehouse . The firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis created the winning design . Their plans were for a structure that was inspired by the ancient Greek Parthenon . The building looked very much like the Parthenon except for a large central dome . Town and Davis was awarded the contract to construct the building , and completed it ahead of schedule in 1835 . 
 The statehouse was built of blue limestone , two stories high . The governor and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor , and the legislature occupied the upper floor , with each house in its own wing . The building was the site of many great events in its history , including a bier for Abraham Lincoln . The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out of style , and the building was beginning to become decrepit . The building 's limestone foundation began to fail , and many feared a general structural collapse of the building . In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed . A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found . By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office , the building was about to be condemned . It was finally demolished in 1877 . 
 = = = Fourth statehouse = = = 
 When the third statehouse was condemned in 1876 the government abandoned the building . The General Assembly relocated to a large office building that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court . The Governor and the executive staff relocated to another office building . The office building was used as the statehouse during the interim period that the new statehouse was being built . In 1887 , before the new statehouse had been completed , enough of the lower floors were usable for the government to move out of the cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure .

 With Indiana 's rapid increase of population during the middle of the 19th century , the state 's government increased in size , causing the previous capitol building to become crowded . In 1865 , a state office building had to be constructed to house some of the burgeoning government , and the Supreme Court and several bureaus were relocated into the new building . When the statehouse was condemned in 1877 , the state was without a real capitol building , and the administration of Governor James D. Williams proposed the construction of the current state capitol building . The plan was approved by the Indiana General Assembly during the legislative session of 1878 . After the third state capitol building had been razed , the new building was constructed on the same site . Two million dollars ( USD ) were appropriated for construction of the new building , and it was completed in 1888 . Governor Williams , who was famed for his frugality , was able to complete the project for $ 1 @.@ 8 million and returned the extra $ 200 @,@ 000 to the general fund . 
 A team of commissioners , including former Civil War general and civil engineer Thomas A. Morris , planned and oversaw the project . The structure was designed by Edwin May , an Indianapolis architect . Not wanting to repeat the mistakes made in the construction of the previous statehouse , the legislature required the new capitol to be built on a solid foundation , so that it would last for many decades . Construction began in 1880 and the cornerstone was laid on September 28 . Edwin May died in February of that year , and Adolph <unk> supervised the project for the entire construction period . The interior was modeled in the Italian Renaissance style . Wherever possible , materials native to Indiana were used . Doors were made of Indiana oak , and Indiana limestone was used throughout the structure . The building 's cornerstone is a ten @-@ ton block of limestone quarried in Spencer , Indiana . The central dome was completed in 1883 . The building was also wired for electricity , even though Indianapolis did not yet have an electrical power grid . In 1887 , the new capitol was sufficiently finished for the first legislative session to be held there . Construction ultimately endured eight years , and the building was finally completed in October 1888 . With the pinnacle of the building reaching 256 feet ( 78 m ) high , it was the second tallest building in the state at the time of its completion . 
 A hole was bored in the cornerstone , and a time capsule was placed inside containing forty @-@ two items . The items included annual reports from all the government agencies , a Bible , samples of several varieties of crops grown in Indiana , several new coins , local maps and newspapers , a book on the history of Indianapolis , and pamphlets from many of the city 's institutions . 
 The building is designed in the shape of a cross . A large central rotunda with a glass domed ceiling connects the four wings . The structure is four stories high . The first floor houses the executive offices of the administration . Offices for the Indiana House of Representatives are on the second floor 's east side , while those for the Indiana State Senate are on the second floor 's west side . Offices of the Indiana Supreme Court are on the north end of the second floor . The seventy @-@ thousand volume Supreme Court Law Library is located on third floor . The third floor also holds the House , Senate , and Supreme Court chambers , and the fourth floor holds the Indiana Court of Appeals courtroom and the offices of nine of the fifteen judges on the Court . Additional executive office and storage space . The building was constructed for the purpose of holding the entire government of the state . For several decades all the government bureaus were housed within the building , until the government again outgrew the structure ; most of the state 's bureaus have gradually been moved out of the building . In front of the Statehouse stands a statue of Oliver Morton , governor of Indiana during the Civil War . 
 = = = Renovation = = = 
 In 1988 , the administration of Governor Robert D. Orr proposed that the Indiana General Assembly renovate the statehouse as part of " Hoosier Celebration ' 88 " , the building 's one @-@ hundredth anniversary . The General Assembly approved , and the building had an extensive , 11 million dollar renovation that continued until 1995 . 
 During the renovation process , all of the statehouse 's stonework , consisting of marble , granite , and limestone columns and blocks , was cleaned and polished . All of the buildings woodwork was repaired or replaced . Broken glass in the central dome skylight was replaced . The building 's lighting was updated with new chandeliers based on the original designs , and most interior walls were repainted . The building was wired for a new data network to make the building ready for 21st @-@ century technology . 
 In 1984 the statehouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places , and it remains a protected building . The statehouse is open for public tours during the work week and with limited tours during weekend mornings .

 = Highway 61 Revisited = 
 Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth studio album by the American singer @-@ songwriter Bob Dylan , released on August 30 , 1965 by Columbia Records . Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music , Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album , except for the closing 11 @-@ minute ballad , " Desolation Row " . Critics have focused on the innovative way in which Dylan combined driving , blues @-@ based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America . Author Michael Gray has argued that in an important sense the 1960s " started " with this album . 
 Leading with the hit single " Like a Rolling Stone " , the album features songs that Dylan has continued to perform live over his long career , including " Ballad of a Thin Man " and " Highway 61 Revisited " . He named the album after the major American highway which connected his birthplace , Duluth , Minnesota , to southern cities famed for their musical heritage , including St. Louis , Memphis , New Orleans , and the Delta blues area of Mississippi . 
 Highway 61 Revisited peaked at No. 3 in the United States charts and No. 4 in the United Kingdom . The album was ranked No. 4 on Rolling Stone 's " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " . " Like a Rolling Stone " was a top @-@ 10 hit in several countries , and was listed at No. 1 on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list . Two other songs , " Desolation Row " and " Highway 61 Revisited " , were listed at No. 187 and No. 373 respectively .

 In his memoir Chronicles : Volume One , Dylan described the kinship he felt with the route that supplied the title of his sixth album : " Highway 61 , the main thoroughfare of the country blues , begins about where I began . I always felt like I 'd started on it , always had been on it and could go anywhere , even down in to the deep Delta country . It was the same road , full of the same contradictions , the same one @-@ horse towns , the same spiritual ancestors ... It was my place in the universe , always felt like it was in my blood . " 
 When he was growing up in the 1950s , Highway 61 stretched from the Canadian border through Duluth , where Dylan was born , and St. Paul all the way down to New Orleans . Along the way , the route passed near the birthplaces and homes of influential musicians such as Muddy Waters , Son House , Elvis Presley and Charley Patton . The " empress of the blues " , Bessie Smith , died after sustaining serious injuries in an automobile accident on Highway 61 . Critic Mark Polizzotti points out that blues legend Robert Johnson is alleged to have sold his soul to the devil at the highway 's crossroads with Route 49 . The highway had also been the subject of several blues recordings , notably Roosevelt Sykes ' " Highway 61 Blues " ( 1932 ) and Mississippi Fred McDowell 's " 61 Highway " ( 1964 ) . 
 Dylan has stated that he had to overcome considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title . He told biographer Robert Shelton : " I wanted to call that album Highway 61 Revisited . Nobody understood it . I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said : ' Let him call it what he wants to call it ' . " Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan 's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues : " Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit , since it is such a long , blues @-@ travelled highway . Many bluesmen had been there before [ Dylan ] , all recording versions of a blues called ' Highway 61 ' . "

 In May 1965 , Dylan returned from his tour of England feeling exhausted and dissatisfied with his material . He told journalist Nat Hentoff : " I was going to quit singing . I was very drained . " The singer added , " It 's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don 't dig you . " 
 As a consequence of his dissatisfaction , Dylan wrote 20 pages of verse he later described as a " long piece of vomit " . He reduced this to a song with four verses and a chorus — " Like a Rolling Stone " . He told Hentoff that writing and recording the song washed away his dissatisfaction , and restored his enthusiasm for creating music . Describing the experience to Robert Hilburn in 2004 , nearly 40 years later , Dylan said : " It 's like a ghost is writing a song like that ... You don 't know what it means except the ghost picked me to write the song . " 
 Highway 61 Revisited was recorded in two blocks of recording sessions that took place in Studio A of Columbia Records , located in Midtown Manhattan . The first block , June 15 and June 16 , was produced by Tom Wilson and resulted in the single " Like a Rolling Stone " . On July 25 , Dylan performed his controversial electric set at the Newport Folk Festival , where some of the crowd booed his performance . Four days after Newport , Dylan returned to the recording studio . From July 29 to August 4 , he and his band completed recording Highway 61 Revisited , but under the supervision of a new producer , Bob Johnston . 
 = = = Recording sessions , June 15 – 16 = = = 
 Tom Wilson produced the initial recording sessions for Highway 61 Revisited on June 15 – 16 , 1965 . Dylan was backed by Bobby Gregg on drums , Joe Macho , Jr. on bass , Paul Griffin on piano , and Frank Owens on guitar . For lead guitar , the singer recruited Michael Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band . The musicians began the June 15 session by recording a fast version of " It Takes a Lot to Laugh , It Takes a Train to Cry " and the song " Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence " , which was omitted from the Highway 61 album . Dylan and his band next attempted to record " Like a Rolling Stone " ; at this early stage , Dylan 's piano dominated the backing , which was in 3 / 4 time . " Barbed Wire Fence " , the fast version of " It Takes a Lot to Laugh " , and an early take of " Like a Rolling Stone " were eventually released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1 – 3 ( Rare & Unreleased ) 1961 – 1991 . 
 The musicians returned to Studio A the following day , when they devoted almost the entire session to recording " Like a Rolling Stone " . Present on this occasion was Al Kooper , a young musician invited by Wilson to observe , but who wanted to play on the session . Kooper managed to sit in on the session , and he improvised an organ riff that , critics Greil Marcus and Mark Polizzotti argue , became a crucial element of the recording . The fourth take was ultimately selected as the master , but Dylan and the band recorded eleven more takes . 
 = = = Recording sessions , July 29 – August 4 = = = 
 To create the material for Highway 61 Revisited , Dylan spent a month writing in his new home in the Byrdcliffe artists ' colony of Woodstock in upstate New York . When he returned to Studio A on July 29 , he was backed by the same musicians with Harvey Brooks on bass replacing Joe Macho and his producer had changed from Tom Wilson to Bob Johnston . 
 Their first session together was devoted to three songs . After recording several takes each of " Tombstone Blues " , " It Takes a Lot to Laugh " and " Positively 4th Street " , masters were successfully recorded . " Tombstone Blues " and " It Takes a Lot to Laugh " were included in the final album , but " Positively 4th Street " was issued as a single @-@ only release . At the close of the July 29 session , Dylan attempted to record " Desolation Row " , accompanied by Al Kooper on electric guitar and Harvey Brooks on bass . There was no drummer , as the drummer had gone home . This electric version was eventually released in 2005 , on The Bootleg Series Vol . 7 . 
 On July 30 , Dylan and his band returned to Studio A and recorded three songs . A master take of " From a Buick 6 " was recorded and later included on the final album , but most of the session was devoted to " Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window ? " Dylan was unsatisfied with the results and set the song aside for a later date ; it was eventually re @-@ recorded with the Hawks in October . 
 After Dylan and Kooper spent the weekend in Woodstock writing chord charts for the songs , sessions resumed at Studio A on August 2 . " Highway 61 Revisited " , " Just Like Tom Thumb 's Blues " , " Queen Jane Approximately " , and " Ballad of a Thin Man " were recorded successfully and masters were selected for the album . 
 One final session was held on August 4 , again at Studio A. Most of the session was devoted to completing " Desolation Row " . Johnston has related that Nashville musician Charlie McCoy was visiting New York , and he invited McCoy to play guitar at the session . According to some sources , seven takes of " Desolation Row " were recorded , and takes six and seven were spliced together for the master recording . 
 The resulting album , Highway 61 Revisited , has been described as " Dylan 's first purely ' rock ' album " , a realization of his wish to leave his old music format behind and move on from his all @-@ acoustic first four albums and half @-@ acoustic , half @-@ electric fifth album , Bringing It All Back Home . Documentary director D. A. Pennebaker , who filmed Dylan on his acoustic UK tour in May 1965 , has said : " I didn 't know that he was going to leave acoustic . I did know that he was getting a little dragged by it . "

 Highway 61 Revisited opens with " Like a Rolling Stone " , which has been described as revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks , organ chords , and Dylan 's voice , " at once so young and so snarling ... and so cynical " . Michael Gray characterized " Like a Rolling Stone " as " a chaotic amalgam of blues , impressionism , allegory , and an intense directness : ' How does it feel ? ' " Polizzotti writes that the composition is notable for eschewing traditional themes of popular music , such as romance , and instead expresses resentment and a yearning for revenge . It has been suggested that Miss Lonely , the song 's central character , is based on Edie Sedgwick , a socialite and actress in the Factory scene of pop artist Andy Warhol . Critic Mike Marqusee has written that this composition is " surely a Dylan cameo " , and that its full poignancy becomes apparent upon the realization that " it is sung , at least in part , to the singer himself : he 's the one ' with no direction home ' . " " Like A Rolling Stone " reached number two in the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1965 , and was a top @-@ 10 hit in Australia , Canada , the Netherlands , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom . 
 The fast @-@ paced , two @-@ chord blues song " Tombstone Blues " , driven by Michael Bloomfield 's lead guitar , uses a parade of historical characters — outlaw Belle Starr , biblical temptress Delilah , Jack the Ripper ( represented in this song as a successful businessman ) , John the Baptist ( described here as a torturer ) , and blues singer Ma Rainey who Dylan humorously suggests shared a sleeping bag with composer Beethoven — to sketch an absurdist account of contemporary America . For critics Mark Polizzotti and Andy Gill , the reality behind the song is the then @-@ escalating Vietnam War ; both writers hear the " king of the Philistines " who sends his slaves " out to the jungle " as a reference to President Lyndon B. Johnson . 
 On July 29 , 1965 , Dylan and his band resumed recording " It Takes a Lot to Laugh , It Takes a Train to Cry " . Tony Glover , who observed the recording session , has recalled that Dylan re @-@ worked the song at the piano while the other musicians took a lunch break . Critic Sean Egan writes that by slowing down the tempo , Dylan transformed the song from an " insufferably smart @-@ alec number into a slow , tender , sensual anthem " . Gill points out that the lyrics reveal the singer 's talent for borrowing from old blues numbers , adapting the lines " Don 't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea / Don 't my gal look good when she 's coming after me " from " Solid Road " by bluesmen Brownie McGhee and Leroy Carr . 
 AllMusic critic Bill Janovitz describes " From a Buick 6 " as a " raucous , up @-@ tempo blues " , which is played " almost recklessly " . The song opens with a snare shot similar to the beginning of " Like a Rolling Stone " . Partially based on Sleepy John Estes ' 1930 song " Milk Cow Blues " , the guitar part is patterned after older blues riffs by Robert Johnson , Charlie Patton and Big Joe Williams . Robert Shelton hears the song as " an earthy tribute to another funky earth @-@ mother " , while for Heylin it is close to filler material ; he argues that only through the musicians ' performance is Dylan able to " convince us he is doing more than just listing the number of ways in which this ' graveyard woman ' is both a lifesaver and a death @-@ giver " . 
 " Ballad of a Thin Man " is driven by Dylan 's piano , which contrasts with " the spooky organ riffs " played by Al Kooper . Marqusee describes the song as one of " the purest songs of protest ever sung " , as it looks at the media and its inability to understand both the singer and his work . He writes that the song became the anthem of an in @-@ group , " disgusted by the old , excited by the new ... elated by their discovery of others who shared their feelings " , with its refrain " Something is happening here / But you don 't know what it is / Do you , Mr Jones ? " epitomizing the " hip exclusivity " of the burgeoning counterculture . Robert Shelton describes the song 's central character , Mr Jones , as " one of Dylan 's greatest archetypes " , characterizing him as " a Philistine ... superficially educated and well bred but not very smart about the things that count " . 
 = = = Side two = = = 
 Polizzotti , in his study of Highway 61 Revisited , writes that the opening track of Side Two , " Queen Jane Approximately " is in a similar vein to " Like a Rolling Stone " , but the song offers " a touch of sympathy and even comfort in place of relentless mockery " . The song is structured as a series of ABAB quatrain verses , with each verse followed by a chorus that is simply a repeat of the last line of each verse : " Won 't you come see me Queen Jane ? " . Gill calls this song " the least interesting track " on Highway 61 , but praises the piano ascending the scale during the harmonica break as an evocation of " the stifling nature of an upper class existence " . " Queen Jane Approximately " was released as the B @-@ side of Dylan 's " One of Us Must Know ( Sooner or Later ) " single in early 1966 . 
 Dylan commences the title song of his album , " Highway 61 Revisited " , with the words " Oh God said to Abraham , ' Kill me a son ' / Abe says , ' Man , you must be puttin ' me on ' " . As Gill has pointed out , Abraham was the name of Dylan 's father , which makes the singer the son whom God wants killed . Gill comments that it is befitting that this song , celebrating a highway central to the history of the blues , is a " raucous blues boogie " . He notes that the scope of the song broadens to make the highway a road of endless possibilities , peopled by dubious characters and culminating in a promoter who " seriously considers staging World War III out on Highway 61 " . The song is punctuated by the sound of a " Siren Whistle " , credited as " Police Car " to Dylan in the album liner notes . " Highway 61 Revisited " was released as the B @-@ side of his " Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window ? " single on November 30 , 1965 . 
 " Just Like Tom Thumb 's Blues " has six verses and no chorus . The lyrics describe a nightmarish experience in Juarez , Mexico , where , in Shelton 's words , " our anti @-@ hero stumbles amid sickness , despair , whores and saints . " He battles with corrupt authorities , alcohol and drugs before resolving to return to New York City . In this song , critics have heard literary references to Malcolm Lowry 's Under the Volcano , Edgar Allan Poe 's " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " and Jack Kerouac 's Desolation Angels . The backing musicians , Bobby Gregg on drums , Mike Bloomfield on electric guitar , and two pianists , Paul Griffin on tack piano and Al Kooper on Hohner Pianet , produce a mood that , for Gill , perfectly complements the " enervated tone " of the lyrics . Heylin notes that Dylan took great care — sixteen takes — to get the effect he was after , with lyrics that subtly " [ skirt ] the edge of reason " . 
 Dylan concludes Highway 61 Revisited with the sole acoustic exception to his rock album . Gill has characterized " Desolation Row " as " an 11 @-@ minute epic of entropy , which takes the form of a Fellini @-@ esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of iconic characters " . These include historical celebrities such as Einstein and Nero , the biblical characters Noah and Cain and Abel , the Shakespearian figures of Ophelia and Romeo , ending with literary titans T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound . The song opens with a report that " they 're selling postcards of the hanging " , and adds " the circus is in town " . Polizzotti connects this song with the lynching of three black circus workers in Duluth , Minnesota , which was Dylan 's birthplace , and describes " Desolation Row " as a cowboy song , " the ' Home On The Range ' of the frightening territory that was mid @-@ sixties America " . In the penultimate verse , the passengers on the Titanic are shouting " Which side are you on ? " . Shelton suggests Dylan is asking , " What difference which side you 're on if you 're sailing on the Titanic ? " and is thus satirizing " simpleminded political commitment " .
