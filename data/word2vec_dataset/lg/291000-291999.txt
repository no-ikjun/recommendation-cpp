 The game was released as a standard version and a collector 's edition . The Collector 's Edition contains the standard retail game and a DVD containing a documentary film entitled " Great SAS Missions , " which consists of archive footage of the SAS in action and accounts from former SAS members . The DVD contains a " making @-@ of " featurette and a level walkthrough by the developers . Also included is a limited edition poster and an exclusive hardcover art book featuring never @-@ before @-@ seen concept , development , and final artwork . These elements were packaged in a larger cardboard version of the standard retail box . The collector 's edition was originally only available in the U.S. , but was later released in other countries . A " Game of the Year " edition was later released on PC , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 . The PlayStation 3 version included the Variety map pack on the disc , and while the Xbox 360 Game of the Year edition initially included an insert in the packaging which could be redeemed on Xbox Live Marketplace to download the Variety map pack , later releases did not contain the inserts , and so were no different from the original release of the game .

 As part of an exclusivity deal between Microsoft and Activision , multiplayer map packs for the Call of Duty franchise , beginning with Modern Warfare , were released first on Xbox 360 . The deal would ultimately last until Black Ops III in 2015 , which introduces a new deal with Sony and PlayStation platforms . 
 Infinity Ward released the Variety Map Pack for the Xbox 360 on April 4 , 2008 . It includes the multiplayer maps " <unk> " , " Creek " , " Chinatown " , and " Broadcast " . The same map pack was released for the PlayStation 3 on April 24 , 2008 . The Variety Map Pack was downloaded by over one million people in its first nine days of release , a record for paid Xbox Live downloadable content , valued at US $ 10 million . It was released as a free download for Windows on June 5 , 2008 , sponsored by NVIDIA , along with patch 1 @.@ 6 . A further patch for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game was announced over a year later in August 2009 ; the patch primarily addressed online multiplayer exploits . Patch 1 @.@ 7 was released in June 2008 . This patch can be applied to the Game of the Year edition directly with no prior patches . Earlier versions must have patch 1 @.@ 6 applied first .

 Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare on release received critical acclaim from many video game publications . The gameplay has been cited by reviewers to bring the genre to " a new level of immersion and intensity that we had never seen before . " Official Xbox Magazine said about the multiplayer , " it 's the multiplayer mode that solidifies the game 's instant @-@ classic status " and that " the campaign never lets up . " GameSpot gave a favorable review for Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , saying that the " high quality of that campaign and its terrific multiplayer options make Call of Duty 4 a fantastic package . " X @-@ Play commented that " while it may not have revolutionized the genre , it comes damn close to perfecting it . " GamePro claims that " the amazingly deep multiplayer rivals Halo 3 's in terms of reach and scope . " 
 The game 's story has received a considerable amount of acclaim from reviewers . GamePro notes that " the intense single @-@ player campaign offers up an action packed experience that features a tremendously compelling narrative ; there are moments in the game that will send chills down your spine . " GameSpot mentioned that the fact the " single @-@ player campaign is over in a flash " as the only major flaw . While IGN described the campaign as " still very linear " like that of its predecessors , " eschewing the concept of sandbox gameplay , " it noted that this resulted in " a much richer , more focused experience " with " beautifully scripted set pieces . " IGN 's Voodoo Extreme similarly remarked that it " virtually plays on a rail , but that 's part of its charm . " In contrast to later entries in the Call of Duty franchise , Ben " Yahtzee " Croshaw of Zero Punctuation gave the game a positive review , praising how it " never sacrifices gameplay for story , or vice versa " and that it featured " less of the smarmy , black @-@ and @-@ white , ' My Country , ' Tis of Thee ' jingoism that turns me off most war games " . 
 Nevertheless , the game has also received criticism . Xbox World 360 stated " It 's smoke and mirrors and a host of cheap tricks , " commenting on the notion that the game did not revolutionize the genre . Pelit also remarked that " the structure of the single player game should ... have been updated " and that " barging from one invisible checkpoint to the next throughout the whole campaign just isn 't good enough anymore .

 Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition was ported by Treyarch . The Wii version of Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare has fewer features than the other console versions . It does not support split @-@ screen multiplayer , and the graphics are not as developed . However , it supports co @-@ operative gameplay in the campaign on a single screen . At any moment , a second Wii remote can be activated giving the second player their own aiming crosshairs . The game received an aggregated score of 76 % on Metacritic . IGN gave the Wii version of the game , Call of Duty : Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition , a score of 7 @.@ 0 , saying the visuals and pointer controls are not as polished as the Wii version of World at War , though they did mention the customization options and multiplayer are impressive . Official Nintendo Magazine gave it 80 % , praising it for packing everything from its next @-@ gen counterpart , but again criticizing the visuals . GameTrailers gave the game an 8 @.@ 8 , saying that despite some sacrifices , it retains everything good from its original version . Game Informer scored the game at a 6 @.@ 5 , stating that while the game was rather poor graphically , even by Wii standards , the bigger problem was the Wii remote , stating that it did not have enough buttons to support Modern Warfare 's control scheme , and also that it was quite imprecise , contrasting it with the dual analog system used by the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions , and the mouse and keyboard system on the Windows version of the game . GameSpot gave the game an 8 @.@ 5 , stating that the online was as addictive as the other versions , they also said that the controls " are precise and customizable enough to let you be all you can be " .

 Before Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare was released , it was predicted to sell even more copies than the highly successful Halo 3 ; it had received reviews as high as Halo 3 's , it was launching on three systems as opposed to one for Halo 3 , and demand for the game led to a wide range of retailers only having enough available to satisfy pre @-@ orders . It fulfilled the prediction and the Xbox 360 version became the best @-@ selling video game in the United States from November 2007 to January 2008 according to the NPD Group . The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would go on to sell 1 @.@ 57 million and 444 @,@ 000 units , respectively , in the United States in November 2007 . 1 @.@ 47 million units of the Xbox 360 version were sold in December 2007 ; the game sold 331 @,@ 000 copies for the Xbox 360 and 140 @,@ 000 copies for the PlayStation 3 in January 2008 . The Xbox 360 version was the third best @-@ selling video game of 2007 in the U.S. with 3 @.@ 04 million units sold , behind Halo 3 , which sold 4 @.@ 82 million units , according to the NPD Group . By January 2008 , Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare had sold more than 7 million copies worldwide , and was the best @-@ selling game of 2007 . On June 3 , 2008 , Infinity Ward reported that the game had sold over 10 million units . During a May 2009 conference call , Activision announced that the game has sold 13 million copies , surpassing Super Mario Galaxy as the best selling game released that week of November 2007 . By November 2013 , the game had sold 15 @.@ 7 million copies . 
 Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare was widely distributed online in the form of infringing copies . Robert Bowling , Community Manager at Infinity Ward stated , " We pulled some disturbing numbers this past week about the amount of PC players currently playing Multiplayer ... What wasn 't fantastic was the percentage of those numbers who were playing on stolen copies of the game on stolen / cracked CD keys of pirated copies . "

 = Thoroughbred = 
 The Thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing . Although the word thoroughbred is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse , it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed . Thoroughbreds are considered " hot @-@ blooded " horses that are known for their agility , speed and spirit . 
 The Thoroughbred as it is known today was developed in 17th- and 18th @-@ century England , when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian , Barb , and Turkoman breeding . All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th century and 18th century , and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding . During the 18th and 19th centuries , the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world ; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia , Europe , Japan and South America during the 19th century . Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today , and more than 118 @,@ 000 foals are registered each year worldwide . 
 Thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing , but are also bred for other riding disciplines such as show jumping , combined training , dressage , polo , and fox hunting . They are also commonly crossbred to create new breeds or to improve existing ones , and have been influential in the creation of the Quarter Horse , Standardbred , Anglo @-@ Arabian , and various warmblood breeds . 
 Thoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion , which has resulted in high accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from the lungs . Other health concerns include low fertility , abnormally small hearts and a small hoof @-@ to @-@ body @-@ mass ratio . There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed , and research is ongoing . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 The typical Thoroughbred ranges from 15 @.@ 2 to 17 @.@ 0 hands ( 62 to 68 inches , 157 to 173 cm ) high , averaging 16 hands ( 64 inches , 163 cm ) . They are most often bay , dark bay or brown , chestnut , black , or gray . Less common colors recognized in the United States include roan and palomino . White is very rare , but is a recognized color separate from gray . The face and lower legs may be marked with white , but white will generally not appear on the body . Coat patterns that have more than one color on the body , such as Pinto or Appaloosa , are not recognized by mainstream breed registries . Good @-@ quality Thoroughbreds have a well @-@ chiseled head on a long neck , high withers , a deep chest , a short back , good depth of hindquarters , a lean body , and long legs . Thoroughbreds are classified among the " hot @-@ blooded " breeds , which are animals bred for agility and speed and are generally considered spirited and bold . 
 Thoroughbreds born in the Northern Hemisphere are officially considered a year older on the first of January each year ; those born in the Southern Hemisphere officially are one year older on the first of August . These artificial dates have been set to enable the standardization of races and other competitions for horses in certain age groups . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 The Thoroughbred is a distinct breed of horse , although people sometimes refer to a purebred horse of any breed as a thoroughbred . The term for any horse or other animal derived from a single breed line is purebred . While the term probably came into general use because the English Thoroughbred 's General Stud Book was one of the first breed registries created , in modern usage horse breeders consider it incorrect to refer to any animal as a thoroughbred except for horses belonging to the Thoroughbred breed . Nonetheless , breeders of other species of purebred animals may use the two terms interchangeably , though thoroughbred is less often used for describing purebred animals of other species . The term is a proper noun referring to this specific breed , though often not capitalized , especially in non @-@ specialist publications , and outside the US . For example , the Australian Stud Book , The New York Times , and the BBC do not capitalize the word .

 = = = Beginnings in England = = = 
 = = = = Early racing = = = = 
 Flat racing existed in England by at least 1174 , when four @-@ mile races took place at Smithfield , in London . Racing continued at fairs and markets throughout the Middle Ages and into the reign of King James I of England . It was then that handicapping , a system of adding weight to attempt to equalize a horse 's chances of winning as well as improved training procedures , began to be used . During the reigns of Charles II , William III , Anne , and George I , the foundation of the Thoroughbred was laid . Under James ' grandson , Charles II , a keen <unk> and owner , and James ' great @-@ granddaughter Queen Anne , royal support was given to racing and the breeding of race horses . With royal support , horse racing became popular with the public , and by 1727 , a newspaper devoted to racing , the Racing Calendar , was founded . Devoted exclusively to the sport , it recorded race results and advertised upcoming meets . 
 = = = = Foundation stallions = = = = 
 All modern Thoroughbreds trace back to three stallions imported into England from the Middle East in the late 17th and early 18th centuries : the Byerley Turk ( 1680s ) , the Darley Arabian ( 1704 ) , and the Godolphin Arabian ( 1729 ) . Other stallions of oriental breeding were less influential , but still made noteworthy contributions to the breed . These included the Alcock 's Arabian , D 'Arcy 's White Turk , Leedes Arabian , and Curwen 's Bay Barb . Another was the Brownlow Turk , who , among other attributes , is thought to be largely responsible for the gray coat color in Thoroughbreds . In all , about 160 stallions of Oriental breeding have been traced in the historical record as contributing to the creation of the Thoroughbred . The addition of horses of Eastern bloodlines , whether Arabian , Barb , or Turk , to the native English mares ultimately led to the creation of the General Stud Book ( GSB ) in 1791 and the practice of official registration of horses . According to Peter Willett , about 50 % of the foundation stallions appear to have been of Arabian bloodlines , with the remainder being evenly divided between Turkoman and Barb breeding . 
 Each of the three major foundation sires was , coincidentally , the ancestor of a grandson or great @-@ great @-@ grandson who was the only male descendant to perpetuate each respective horse 's male line : <unk> was the only descendant of his grandsire , the Godolphin Arabian , to maintain a male line to the present ; the Byerley Turk 's male line was preserved by Herod ( or King Herod ) , a great @-@ great @-@ grandson ; and the male line of the Darley Arabian owes its existence to great @-@ great @-@ grandson Eclipse , who was the dominant racehorse of his day and never defeated . One genetic study indicates that 95 % of all male Thoroughbreds trace their direct male line ( via the Y chromosome ) to the Darley Arabian . However , in modern Thoroughbred pedigrees , most horses have more crosses to the Godolphin Arabian ( 13 @.@ 8 % ) than to the Darley Arabian ( 6 @.@ 5 % ) when all lines of descent ( maternal and paternal ) are considered . Further , as a percentage of contributions to current Thoroughbred bloodlines , Curwen 's Bay Barb ( 4 @.@ 2 % ) appears more often than the Byerley Turk ( 3 @.@ 3 % ) . The majority of modern Thoroughbreds alive today trace to a total of only 27 or 28 stallions from the 18th and 19th centuries . 
 = = = = Foundation mares = = = = 
 The mares used as foundation breeding stock came from a variety of breeds , some of which , such as the Irish Hobby , had developed in northern Europe prior to the 13th century . Other mares were of oriental breeding , including Barb , Turk and other bloodlines , although most researchers conclude that the number of Eastern mares imported into England during the 100 years after 1660 was small . The 19th century researcher Bruce Lowe identified 50 mare " families " in the Thoroughbred breed , later augmented by other researchers to 74 . However , it is probable that fewer genetically unique mare lines existed than Lowe identified . Recent studies of the mtDNA of Thoroughbred mares indicate that some of the mare lines thought to be genetically distinct may actually have had a common ancestor ; in 19 mare lines studied , the haplotypes revealed that they traced to only 15 unique foundation mares , suggesting either a common ancestor for foundation mares thought to be unrelated or recording errors in the GSB . 
 = = = Later development in Britain = = = 
 By the end of the 18th century , the English Classic races had been established . These are the St. Leger Stakes , founded in 1776 , the Epsom Oaks , founded in 1779 , and the Epsom Derby in 1780 . Later , the 2 @,@ 000 Guineas Stakes and the 1 @,@ 000 Guineas Stakes were founded in 1809 and 1814 . The 1 @,@ 000 Guineas and the Oaks are restricted to fillies , but the others are open to racehorses of either sex aged three years . The distances of these races , ranging from 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to 1 @.@ 75 miles ( 2 @.@ 82 km ) , led to a change in breeding practices , as breeders concentrated on producing horses that could race at a younger age than in the past and that had more speed . In the early 18th century , the emphasis had been on longer races , up to 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) , that were run in multiple heats . The older style of race favored older horses , but with the change in distances , younger horses became preferred . 
 Selective breeding for speed and racing ability led to improvements in the size of horses and winning times by the middle of the 19th century . Bay Middleton , a winner of the Epsom Derby , stood over 16 hands high , a full hand higher than the Darley Arabian . Winning times had improved to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional Arabian bloodlines was impossible . This was borne out in 1885 , when a race was held between a Thoroughbred , Iambic , considered a mid @-@ grade runner , and the best Arabian of the time , Asil . The race was over 3 miles ( 4 @,@ 800 m ) , and although Iambic was handicapped by carrying 4 @.@ 5 stone ( 29 kg ; 63 lb ) more than Asil , he still managed to beat Asil by 20 lengths . An aspect of the modern British breeding establishment is that they breed not only for flat racing , but also for steeplechasing . Up until the end of the 19th century , Thoroughbreds were bred not only for racing but also as saddle horses . 
 Soon after the start of the 20th century , fears that the English races would be overrun with American @-@ bred Thoroughbreds because of the closing of US racetracks in the early 1910s , led to the Jersey Act of 1913 . It prohibited the registration of any horse in the General Stud Book ( GSB ) if they could not show that every ancestor traced to the GSB . This excluded most American @-@ bred horses , because the 100 @-@ year gap between the founding of the GSB and the American Stud Book meant that most American @-@ bred horses possessed at least one or two crosses to horses not registered in the GSB . The act was not repealed until 1949 , after which a horse was only required to show that all its ancestors to the ninth generation were registered in a recognized Stud Book . Many felt that the Jersey Act hampered the development of the British Thoroughbred by preventing breeders in the United Kingdom from using new bloodlines developed outside the British Isles . 
 = = = In America = = = 
 The first Thoroughbred horse in the American Colonies was <unk> Rock , imported in 1730 . Maryland and Virginia were the centers of Colonial Thoroughbred breeding , along with South Carolina and New York . During the American Revolution importations of horses from England practically stopped but were restarted after the signing of a peace treaty . Two important stallions were imported around the time of the Revolution ; Messenger in 1788 and <unk> before that . Messenger left little impact on the American Thoroughbred , but is considered a foundation sire of the Standardbred breed . <unk> , who won the Derby Stakes in 1780 , had a significant impact on American Thoroughbred breeding , mainly through his son Sir Archy . John F. Wall , a racing historian , said that Sir Archy was the " first outstanding stallion we can claim as native American . " He was retired from the racetrack because of lack of opponents . 
 After the American Revolution , the center of Thoroughbred breeding and racing in the United States moved west . Kentucky and Tennessee became notable centers . Andrew Jackson , later President of the United States , was a breeder and racer of Thoroughbreds in Tennessee . Famous match races held in the early 19th century helped popularize horse racing in the United States . One took place in 1823 , in Long Island , New York , between Sir Henry and American Eclipse . Another was a match race between Boston and Fashion in 1838 that featured bets of $ 20 @,@ 000 from each side . The last major match races before the American Civil War were both between Lexington and Lecompte . The first was held in 1854 in New Orleans and was won by Lecompte . Lexington 's owner then challenged Lecompte 's owner to a rematch , held in 1855 in New Orleans and won by Lexington . Both of these horses were sons of Boston , a descendant of Sir Archy . Lexington went on to a career as a breeding stallion , and led the sires list of number of winners for sixteen years , fourteen of them in a row . 
 After the American Civil War , the emphasis in American racing changed from the older style of four @-@ mile ( 6 km ) races in which the horses ran in at least two heats . The new style of racing involved shorter races not run in heats , over distances from five furlongs up to 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) . This development meant a change in breeding practices , as well as the age that horses were raced , with younger horses and sprinters coming to the fore . It was also after the Civil War that the American Thoroughbred returned to England to race . Iroquois became the first American @-@ bred winner of the Epsom Derby in 1881 . The success of American @-@ bred Thoroughbreds in England led to the Jersey Act in 1913 , which limited the importation of American Thoroughbreds into England . After World War I , the breeders in America continued to emphasize speed and early racing age but also imported horses from England , and this trend continued past World War II . After World War II , Thoroughbred breeding remained centered in Kentucky , but California , New York , and Florida also emerged as important racing and breeding centers . 
 Thoroughbreds in the United States have historically been used not only for racing but also to improve other breeds . The early import Messenger was the foundation of the Standardbred , and Thoroughbred blood was also instrumental in the development of the American Quarter Horse . The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred . Between World War I and World War II , the U.S. Army used Thoroughbred stallions as part of their Remount Service , which was designed to improve the stock of cavalry mounts . 
 = = = In Europe = = = 
 Thoroughbreds began to be imported to France in 1817 and 1818 with the importation of a number of stallions from England , but initially the sport of horse racing did not prosper in France . The first Jockey Club in France was not formed until 1833 , and in 1834 the racing and regulation functions were split off to a new society , the Societe d <unk> pour l <unk> des Races de <unk> en France , better known as the Jockey @-@ Club de Paris . The French Stud Book was founded at the same time by the government . By 1876 , French @-@ bred Thoroughbreds were regularly winning races in England , and in that year a French breeder @-@ owner earned the most money in England on the track . World War I almost destroyed French breeding because of war damage and lack of races . After the war , the premier French race , the Grand Prix , resumed and continues to this day . During World War II , French Thoroughbred breeding did not suffer as it had during the first World War , and thus was able to compete on an equal footing with other countries after the war . 
 Organized racing in Italy started in 1837 , when race meets were established in Florence and Naples and a meet in Milan was founded in 1842 . Modern flat racing came to Rome in 1868 . Later importations , including the Derby Stakes winners Ellington ( 1856 ) and Melton ( 1885 ) , came to Italy before the end of the 19th century . Modern Thoroughbred breeding in Italy is mostly associated with the breeding program of Federico Tesio , who started his breeding program in 1898 . Tesio was the breeder of Nearco , one of the dominant sires of Thoroughbreds in the later part of the 20th century . 
 Other countries in Europe have Thoroughbred breeding programs , including Germany , Russia , Poland , and Hungary . 
 = = = In Australia and New Zealand = = = 
 Horses arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 along with the earliest colonists . Although horses of part @-@ Thoroughbred blood were imported into Australia during the late 18th century , it is thought that the first pureblood Thoroughbred was a stallion named Northumberland who was imported from England in 1802 as a coach horse sire . By 1810 , the first formal race meets were organized in Sydney , and by 1825 the first mare of proven Thoroughbred bloodlines arrived to join the Thoroughbred stallions already there . In 1825 , the Sydney Turf Club , the first true racing club in Australia , was formed . Throughout the 1830s , the Australian colonies began to import Thoroughbreds , almost exclusively for racing purposes , and to improve the local stock . Each colony formed its own racing clubs and held its own races . Gradually , the individual clubs were integrated into one overarching organization , now known as the Australian Racing Board . Thoroughbreds from Australia were imported into New Zealand in the 1840s and 1850s , with the first direct importation from England occurring in 1862 . 
 = = = In other areas = = = 
 Thoroughbreds have been exported to many other areas of the world since the breed was created . Oriental horses were imported into South Africa from the late 17th century in order to improve the local stock through crossbreeding . Horse racing was established there in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , and Thoroughbreds were imported in increasing numbers . The first Thoroughbred stallions arrived in Argentina in 1853 , but the first mares did not arrive until 1865 . The Argentine Stud Book was first published in 1893 . Thoroughbreds were imported into Japan from 1895 , although it was not until after World War II that Japan began a serious breeding and racing business involving Thoroughbreds . 
 = = Registration , breeding , and population = = 
 About 37 @,@ 000 Thoroughbred foals are registered each year in North America , with the largest numbers being registered in the states of Kentucky , Florida and California . Australia is the second largest producer of Thoroughbreds in the world with almost 30 @,@ 000 broodmares producing about 18 @,@ 250 foals annually . Britain produces about 5 @,@ 000 foals a year , and worldwide , there are more than 195 @,@ 000 active broodmares , or females being used for breeding , and 118 @,@ 000 newly registered foals in 2006 alone . The Thoroughbred industry is a large agribusiness , generating around $ 34 billion in revenue annually in the United States and providing about 470 @,@ 000 jobs through a network of farms , training centers and race tracks . 
 Unlike a significant number of registered breeds today , a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred ( with The Jockey Club registry ) unless conceived by live cover , the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion . Artificial insemination ( AI ) and embryo transfer ( ET ) , though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries , cannot be used with Thoroughbreds . One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI , and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns , AI still requires more detailed record keeping . The main reason , however , may be economic ; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover . Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds , although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible . As an example , in 2008 , the Australian stallion <unk> De Lago covered 227 mares . By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI , it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages . 
 Concern exists that the closed stud book and tightly regulated population of the Thoroughbred is at risk of loss of genetic diversity because of the level of inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population . According to one study , 78 % of alleles in the current population can be traced to 30 foundation animals , 27 of which are male . Ten foundation mares account for 72 % of maternal ( tail @-@ female ) lineages , and , as noted above , one stallion appears in 95 % of tail male lineages . Thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through the maternal line , called the distaff line . The line that a horse comes from will often determine the price paid regardless of the actual talent or potential of the horse .

Also in 2007 , Doncaster Bloodstock Sales , another British sales firm , sold 2 @,@ 248 horses for a total value of 43 @,@ 033 @,@ 881 guineas , making an average of 15 @,@ 110 guineas per horse . Australian prices at auction during the 2007 @-@ 2008 racing and breeding season were as follows : 1 @,@ 223 Australian <unk> sold for a total of $ 31 @,@ 352 @,@ 000 , an average of $ 25 @,@ 635 each . 4 @,@ 903 yearlings sold for a total value of A $ 372 @,@ 003 @,@ 961 , an average of A $ 75 @,@ 853 . Five hundred two @-@ year @-@ olds sold for A $ 13 @,@ 030 @,@ 150 , an average of A $ 26 @,@ 060 , and 2 @,@ 118 broodmares totalled A $ 107 @,@ 720 @,@ 775 , an average of A $ 50 @,@ 860 . 
 Averages , however , can be deceiving . For example , at the 2007 Fall Yearling sale at Keeneland , 3 @,@ 799 young horses sold for a total of $ 385 @,@ 018 @,@ 600 , for an average of $ 101 @,@ 347 per horse . However , that average sales price reflected a variation that included at least 19 horses that sold for only $ 1 @,@ 000 each and 34 that sold for over $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 apiece . 
 The highest price paid at auction for a Thoroughbred was set in 2006 at $ 16 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 for a two @-@ year @-@ old colt named The Green Monkey . Record prices at auction often grab headlines , though they do not necessarily reflect the animal 's future success ; in the case of The Green Monkey , injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in 2008 , and he never won a race . Conversely , even a highly successful Thoroughbred may be sold by the pound for a few hundred dollars to become horsemeat . The best @-@ known example of this was the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand , exported to Japan to stand at stud , but was ultimately slaughtered in 2002 , presumably for pet food . 
 However , the value of a Thoroughbred may also be influenced by the purse money it wins . In 2007 , Thoroughbred racehorses earned a total of $ 1 @,@ 217 @,@ 854 @,@ 602 in all placings , an average earnings per starter of $ 16 @,@ 924 . In addition , the track record of a race horse may influence its future value as a breeding animal . 
 Stud fees for stallions that enter breeding can range from $ 2 @,@ 500 to $ 500 @,@ 000 per mare in the United States , and from ₤ 2000 pounds to £ 75 @,@ 000 pounds or more in Britain . The record stud fee to date was set in the 1980s , when the stud fee of the late Northern Dancer reached $ 1 million . During the 2008 Australian breeding season seven stallions stood at a stud fee of A $ 110 @,@ 000 or more , with the highest fee in the nation at A $ 302 @,@ 500 . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Although the Thoroughbred is primarily bred for racing , the breed is also used for show jumping and combined training because of its athleticism , and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses , dressage horses , and youth show horses . The larger horses are sought after for hunter / jumper and dressage competitions , whereas the smaller horses are in demand as polo ponies . 
 = = = Horse racing = = = 
 Thoroughbred horses are primarily bred for racing under saddle at the gallop . Thoroughbreds are often known for being either distance runners or sprinters , and their conformation usually reflects what they have been bred to do . Sprinters are usually well muscled , while <unk> , or distance runners , tend to be smaller and slimmer . The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse . Although there have been champion racehorses of every height , from Zenyatta who stood 17 @.@ 2 hands , to Man o ' War and Secretariat who both stood at 16 @.@ 2 hands , down to Hyperion , who was only 15 @.@ 1 , the best racehorses are generally of average size . Larger horses mature more slowly and have more stress on their legs and feet , predisposing them to lameness . Smaller horses are considered by some to be at a disadvantage due to their shorter stride and a tendency of other horses to bump them , especially in the starting gate . Historically , Thoroughbreds have steadily increased in size : the average height of a Thoroughbred in 1700 was about 13 @.@ 3 hands high . By 1876 this had increased to 15 @.@ 3 . 
 In 2007 , there were 71 @,@ 959 horses who started in races in the United States , and the average Thoroughbred racehorse in the United States and Canada ran 6 @.@ 33 times in that year . In Australia , there were 31 @,@ 416 horses in training during 2007 , and those horses started 194 @,@ 066 times for A $ 375 @,@ 512 @,@ 579 of prize money . During 2007 , in Japan , there were 23 @,@ 859 horses in training and those horses started 182 @,@ 614 times for A $ 857 @,@ 446 @,@ 268 of prize money . In Britain , the British Racing Authority states there were 8 @,@ 556 horses in training for flat racing for 2007 , and those horses started 60 @,@ 081 times in 5 @,@ 659 races . 
 Statistically , fewer than 50 % of all race horses ever win a race , and less than 1 % ever win a stakes race such as the Kentucky Derby or the Epsom Derby . Any horse who has yet to win a race is known as a maiden . 
 Horses finished with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions . A number of agencies exist to help make the transition from the racetrack to another career , or to help find retirement homes for ex @-@ racehorses . 
 = = = Other disciplines = = = 
 In addition to racing , Thoroughbreds compete in eventing , show jumping and dressage at the highest levels of international competition , including the Olympics . They are also used as show hunters , <unk> , and in western riding speed events such as barrel racing . Mounted police divisions employ them in non @-@ competitive work , and recreational riders also use them . Thoroughbreds are one of the most common breeds for use in polo in the United States . They are often seen in the fox hunting field as well . 
 = = = Crossbreeding = = = 
 Thoroughbreds are often crossed with horses of other breeds to create new breeds or to enhance or introduce specific qualities into existing ones . They have been influential on many modern breeds , including the American Quarter Horse , the Standardbred , and possibly the Morgan , a breed that went on to influence many of the gaited breeds in North America . Other common crosses with the Thoroughbred include crossbreeding with Arabian bloodlines to produce the Anglo @-@ Arabian as well as with the Irish Draught to produce the Irish Sport Horse . Thoroughbreds are often crossed with various Warmblood breeds due to their refinement and performance capabilities . 
 = = Health issues = = 
 Although Thoroughbreds are seen in the hunter @-@ jumper world and in other disciplines , modern Thoroughbreds are primarily bred for speed , and racehorses have a very high rate of accidents as well as other health problems . 
 One tenth of all Thoroughbreds suffer orthopedic problems , including fractures . Current estimates indicate that there are 1 @.@ 5 career @-@ ending breakdowns for every 1 @,@ 000 horses starting a race in the United States , an average of two horses per day . The State of California reported a particularly high rate of injury , 3 @.@ 5 per 1000 starts . Other countries report lower rates of injury , with the United Kingdom having 0 @.@ 9 injuries / 1 @,@ 000 starts ( 1990 – 1999 ) and the courses in Victoria , Australia , producing a rate of 0 @.@ 44 injuries / 1 @,@ 000 starts ( 1989 – 2004 ) . Thoroughbreds also have other health concerns , including a majority of animals who are prone to bleeding from the lungs ( exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage ) , 10 % with low fertility , and 5 % with abnormally small hearts . Thoroughbreds also tend to have smaller hooves relative to their body mass than other breeds , with thin soles and walls and a lack of cartilage mass , which contributes to foot soreness , the most common source of lameness in racehorses . 
 = = = Selective breeding = = = 
 One argument for the health issues involving Thoroughbreds suggests that inbreeding is the culprit . It has also been suggested that capability for speed is enhanced in an already swift animal by raising muscle mass , a form of selective breeding that has created animals designed to win horse races . Thus , according to one postulation , the modern Thoroughbred travels faster than its skeletal structure can support . <unk> Robert Miller states that " We have selectively bred for speeds that the anatomy of the horse cannot always cope with . " 
 Poor breeding may be encouraged by the fact that many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury . If the injury is linked to a conformational fault , the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation . Additionally , some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs . This can help increase the horse 's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career , but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on . 
 = = = Excess stress = = = 
 A high accident rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds , particularly in the United States , are first raced as 2 @-@ year @-@ olds , well before they are completely mature . Though they may appear full @-@ grown and are in superb muscular condition , their bones are not fully formed . However , catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5 @-@ year @-@ olds than in 2- and 3 @-@ year @-@ olds . Some believe that correct , slow training of a young horse ( including foals ) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal . This is because , during the training process , microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling . If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal , the bone becomes stronger . If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins , the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury . 
 Studies have shown that track surfaces , horseshoes with toe grabs , use of certain legal medications , and high @-@ intensity racing schedules may also contribute to a high injury rate . One promising trend is the development of synthetic surfaces for racetracks , and one of the first tracks to install such a surface , <unk> Park in Florence , Kentucky , saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from 24 in 2004 – 05 to three in the year following Polytrack installation . The material is not perfected , and some areas report problems related to winter weather , but studies are continuing . 
 = = = Medical challenges = = = 
 The level of treatment given to injured Thoroughbreds is often more intensive than for horses of lesser financial value but also controversial , due in part to the significant challenges in treating broken bones and other major leg injuries . Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life @-@ threatening because a horse 's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems , laminitis , and other infections . If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily , there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load . While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time , a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human 's " bed rest " because of the risk of developing sores , internal damage , and congestion . 
 Whenever a racing accident severely injures a well @-@ known horse , such as the major leg fractures that led to the <unk> of 2006 Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro , or 2008 Kentucky Derby runner @-@ up Eight Belles , animal rights groups have denounced the Thoroughbred racing industry . On the other hand , advocates of racing argue that without horse racing , far less funding and incentives would be available for medical and biomechanical research on horses . Although horse racing is hazardous , veterinary science has advanced . Previously hopeless cases can now be treated , and earlier detection through advanced imaging techniques like <unk> can keep at @-@ risk horses off the track . 
 = Flatline ( song ) = 
 " Flatline " is a song by English girl group Mutya Keisha Siobhan , which consists of the original line @-@ up of the group Sugababes . Written by the trio alongside British artist Dev Hynes , who also produced it , it was released via digital retailers on 6 September 2013 by Polydor Records , who signed the band in 2012 . It is a synthpop song in which the drums and the male backing vocals get gradually stronger until a climactic part . Lyrically , it addresses the deterioration of a relationship . 
 Upon its release , " Flatline " received acclaim from music journalists , who favoured its production and the singers ' vocal harmonies . Commercially , the song charted at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart , however , it reached number 14 in Ireland . To promote the song , the group released a music video , directed by Auleta and filmed at Venice Beach . They have also performed " Flatline " at their Sacred Three Tour , and other headlining sets including Scala and G @-@ A @-@ Y. 
 = = Conception and release = = 
 In April 2012 , it was reported that the original line @-@ up of the Sugababes had signed a £ 1 million record deal with Polydor Records . In July 2012 , it was officially confirmed that the group had reformed under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan and were writing songs for a new album under Polydor . The name was officially registered through the European Union on 27 June 2012 . 
 " Flatline " was written by Keisha Buchanan , Mutya Buena and Siobhán Donaghy , alongside British musician Dev Hynes . It was entirely developed and recorded in Los Angeles in February 2013 , after composing most of the material for their debut as Mutya Keisha Siobhan . The group specifically went to the city to record a " killer " lead single for their album . Travelling to Los Angeles resulted in the trio composing the song entirely in their first day in the city . Hynes started randomly playing the keyboard and bass , and invited the trio to " vibe with him " . The group pursued a Coldplay @-@ influenced sound for the song 's chorus , however after realizing that their voices were not " manly enough " , Hynes contacted band Spector member Fred Macpherson to sing backing vocals for the track , 
 On 4 June 2013 , Mutya Keisha Siobhan announced the title of the song . They later uploaded a one @-@ minute , eleven @-@ second preview of the track to their official SoundCloud page on 13 June . The track was originally scheduled for release in the UK and Ireland on 1 September 2013 , but was then delayed until 15 September for unknown reasons . The release date was then changed a second time , being brought forward to 6 September . The release of the actual song was preceded by Polydor sending an EP to digital retailers , including 4 remixes of the song . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Having a length of three minutes and fifty @-@ one seconds ( 3 : 51 ) , " Flatline " is styled in the genres of pop and R & B , and was produced by Dev Hynes . It is composed in the key of G major , and contains a metronome of 128 beats per minute . Musically , it carries out a chord progression of D – Em – Bm – C , while the group members ' vocal ranges go from the notes of G3 to E5 . Lyrically , the song addresses the deterioration of a relationship , which is more visible on the song 's chorus , where the trio sings " I can feel a flatline , that ought to be a wave " . 
 It commences with a " <unk> " guitar riff , set against a 90s @-@ inspired piano @-@ driven R & B melodies and " bubbling " 80s pop beats , which is reminiscent of the production found in American recording artist Solange Knowles ' extended play True — which , much like " Flatline " , was produced entirely by Hynes . Siobhán Donaghy sings the first verse of the track , being followed by Keisha Buchanan , who gives her vocals during the pre @-@ chorus , in which she references the playing cards King and Queen . After the chorus , the second verse is sung by Mutya Buena , and the song eventually enters a crescendo , as the backing vocals get louder and the drums stronger . This section of the song was described by Michael Cragg of The Guardian as being " Florence @-@ esque " , in which the group sings the chorus repeatedly along with several ad @-@ libs . A writer from Fact wrote that the song " build [ s ] from Robyn @-@ style melodrama into fist @-@ pumping stadium fare " .

 Since its release , the song has received widespread critical acclaim . Eve Barlow from NME claimed that it was " worth the 12 @-@ year wait " and dismissed the current Sugababes line @-@ up . Robert Copsey of Digital Spy was extremely positive about the song , awarding it five stars out of five , and commented : " [ It ] isn 't the sort of smack around the face you 'd normally expect but rather one that draws you in slowly but surely before swallowing you whole . " Writing for The Guardian , Michael Cragg said there was " something indescribably captivating " about the song , and likened it to the group 's debut single " Overload " — as the Sugababes . Laura Snapes from Pitchfork Media was enthusiastic about Hynes ' production , classifying it as " immaculate " , and highlighted the group 's vocal harmonies . 
 Billboard 's Jason Lipshutz called it an " immediately affecting " 2013 song and favoured the use of the word " miscellaneous " on its lyrics . Robbie Daw from the music website Idolator was in sync with the aforementioned comments , calling it a " synthy , <unk> , glorious pop gem that comes just in time for the summer " . Carl Smith of <unk> deemed " Flatline " " a bit amazing " and believed that the artists ' harmonies could rival the group Little Mix , while noting that the song did not follow any current musical trend . Bradley Stern from MuuMuse opined that the song had " revitalized the very essence " of the Sugababes , named it one of the best of 2013 and commented that it sounded like a newly recorded version of One Touch . Much like previous critics , Michelle <unk> of DIY highlighted the singers ' harmonies and noted that Hynes had " inject [ ed ] his solid @-@ gold formula " to the song 's production . 
 Drowned in Sound 's writing staff picked " Flatline " included it in their list of 2013 's best songs on number sixteenth , as did Edge on the Net , that put it on seventh place . 
 = = = Chart performance = = = 
 Only entering two European charts , " Flatline " reached number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart , however it peaked at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart . The group denied allegations of it being a " flop " : " I don 't think our song got lost on the radio . I think there were certain things that happened behind the scenes that couldn 't be helped . Our goal was to put a song out that people liked and we think we 've done that " . They also expressed preference in going on tour and releasing an album than having a " throw @-@ away hit " on the charts . " To NME , Buchanan reiterated those sentiments and denied rumours floating at the time that speculated that the group had been dropped by Polydor . 
 = = Promotion = = 
 The official lyric video for " Flatline " was released online on 19 July 2013 . It was created by a fan named Jonas , who sent the visual to the group 's Twitter account . One week after , the singers announced that they would make it their official lyric video , and thanked him for the submission . The clip sees the group adopting " mod @-@ style " graphics , as the lyrics are spelled out in the screen in a colourful , 3D way . During their headline set at Scala , a nightclub in London , held on 1 August 2013 , Mutya Keisha Siobhan played various Sugababes @-@ era hits alongside new album songs , and closed the performance with a medley that mixed " Flatline " with select verses of " Push the Button " . On 19 August , it was announced that their first televised performance of " Flatline " would be on Alan Carr : Chatty Man . They eventually performed the single on 6 September episode of the show . Eleven days after , the trio performed the track during their set at gay nightclub G @-@ A @-@ Y. The trio also performed it during their tour , entitled The Sacred Three Tour .

 The official music video for " Flatline " was shot by fashion photographer KT Auleta at the Venice Beach in Venice , Los Angeles , during the week of 8 — 14 July 2013 . The trio revealed that they had seen her work on the Italian edition of Vogue and thought it was " amazing " , therefore , they picked her to film the visual . The group described the video treatment which Auleta wrote as having " summed up how [ they ] felt about the song " , and further revealed that they opted to film the video in Los Angeles as it was the city in which they wrote " Flatline " with Hynes . The singers teased the music video with pictures of them at the set . The video was ultimately released on 19 August 2013 . 
 The visual begins with a shot of the three singers walking down a street in Venice Beach , followed by them getting ice cream and being on top of a motorcycle . As the singers lip @-@ sync their verses , the camera zooms in each singer . These are interspersed with clips of the trio standing in front of a wall with several <unk> . Later on , they are seen sitting on chairs on a beach , with " coquettish " sunglasses ; walking near the sea . As the song builds to its last compass , they run to an orange convertible , in which they drive to a desert . They reach the desert and are joined by a marching band , who play the drums heard in the song . The group exits the car and start dancing to the sound of the drums . The very last scene of the music video sees Siobhan driving them away as they have their hands in the air , and the screen fades to black . 
 For Popjustice , Michael Cragg said that the video did not " help the song " , and negatively regarded that it resembled a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes video of a photoshoot .

 = Tree : A Life Story = 
 Tree : A Life Story ( or Tree : A Biography in Australia ) is a Canadian non @-@ fiction book written by David Suzuki and Wayne Grady , and illustrated by Robert Bateman . The book profiles the life of a Douglas @-@ fir tree , from seed to maturity to death . The story provides ecological context by describing interactions with other lifeforms in the forest and historical context through parallels with world events that occur during the tree 's 700 years of life . <unk> from the biographical narrative , scattered throughout the book , provide background into related topics , such as the history of botany . 
 Suzuki was inspired to write a biography of a tree when he noticed a Douglas @-@ fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its trunk and speculated what caused it to grow into that shape . Suzuki studied the topic with the help of a research assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book . Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004 . In the Canadian market , it peaked at number three in the Maclean 's and the National Post 's non @-@ fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards . In February 2005 it was published in Australia by Allen & Unwin . The premise and writing were well received by critics . While several reviewers found that the authors succeeded in using accessible language , others found it too technical . 
 = = Background = = 
 Inspiration for the book came from a Douglas @-@ fir tree with a curve in its trunk . While sitting by the tree , at his home on Quadra Island , near Vancouver , David Suzuki realized that even though his family had played on it for years , he did not know how old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed . Suzuki , a science writer and broadcaster , and former zoologist , speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight . He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people and the story of this tree 's life . It also reminded him of an idea he had for a children 's book about interconnectivity of life , especially within plants . Along with a research assistant , he studied the topic . Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator . Science writer and former <unk> editor Wayne Grady agreed to participate . Suzuki provided the research , framework , and some original writing and Grady did most of the writing . Together , Grady in Ontario and Suzuki in Vancouver , went through five drafts . Wildlife artist Robert Bateman was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki . In creating the book , their intention was to illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree 's role over time . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The book consists of five chapters : " Birth " , " Taking Root " , " Growth " , " Maturity " , and " Death " . The book opens with acknowledgments and an introduction , and closes with selected references and an index . In the introduction , Suzuki describes the tree at his home and the series of ideas and events that led to the writing of the book . Along with the narrative of the tree 's life , the book includes digressions into related topics , such as the history of botany and animal life in the forest . The tree written about in the book is not any specific Douglas @-@ fir , but rather a generic one . 
 The first chapter , " Birth " , begins with lightning starting a forest fire . The heat dries the Douglas @-@ fir cones enough for their scales to spread and release winged seeds . Rain water transports one seed to a sunlit area with well @-@ drained soil . Rodents and insectivores , whose food stashes were destroyed in the fire , eat truffles , which survived underground , and leave feces containing nitrogen @-@ fixing bacteria in the soil . Following one dormant winter stage , the seed begins to germinate . 
 In the second chapter , " Taking Root " , the embryonic root emerges through a small opening in the seed coat and through cell division , aided by plant hormones , it grows downward . Water and nutrients enter the root by osmosis and are transported to the seedling . A symbiotic relationship develops between the roots and the truffles . The roots give its extra sugars to the truffles , which it uses for energy , and the truffles assist the roots ' uptake of water and nutrients . From excess starches and nutrients gathered by the root , a stem similar to the root but surrounded with thin , grayish bark , grows upwards . As the starch reserves are exhausted , its first needles sprout and photosynthesis begins . The tree anchors itself with a deep taproot and a web of roots begin to grow laterally . Some roots develop symbiotic relationships with near @-@ by red alders which excel at nitrogen @-@ fixation but lack the storage capacity that the Douglas @-@ fir can offer . In early April of every year , a new layer grows between the bark and wood . As this new layer takes over transportation of fluids throughout the tree , last year 's layer of cells die and form a ring in the wood . 
 After about 20 years , the tree begins to develop fertile cones . Buds form where auxins accumulate ; these become either new needles or cones . The buds remain undifferentiated until July and continue to develop throughout the fall and winter . The next year , some buds will open in mid @-@ May exposing a new set of needles . The cone buds on the lower end of the tree while other buds burst open in April releasing a mist of pollen . The cones at the top of the tree open their scales for wind @-@ borne pollen to enter . Within the cone , the pollen fertilizes a seed which is released in September . The quantity and quality of seed production varies year @-@ to @-@ year but a particularly effective crop is produced about every 10 years . Less than 0 @.@ 1 % of seeds survive Douglas squirrels , dark @-@ eyed <unk> , and other seed @-@ eating animals . 
 Over the centuries , the tree grows thicker and taller as successive rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches . The tree becomes part of an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees , shrubs , and ferns . In the canopy , a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches . Exposed to light , air , and rain , the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects , fungus , and new plants . 
 In the opening of the final chapter , " Death " , the tree is 550 years old and stands 80 meters ( 260 feet ) tall . Under the weight of too much snow accumulating on the canopy mat , a branch breaks off . Stresses from a long winter with a dry summer weaken the tree 's immune system . The exposed area where the branch broke becomes infected with insects and fungus . Insect larvae eat the buds and the fungus spreads into the middle of the tree and down to the roots . With its vascular tissue system compromised , the tree diverts nutrients elsewhere , resulting in needles turning orange on the abandoned branches . Death takes years to occur as successive parts are slowly starved of nutrients . As a snag , it becomes home to a succession of animals , like woodpeckers , owls , squirrels , and bats . Eventually the roots rot enough that a rainstorm blows it down . Mosses and fungi grow on the <unk> , followed by colonies of termites , ants , and mites , which all help decompose the remaining wood . 
 = = Genre and style = = 
 Tree is a popular science book , intended to profile the life of single tree using terminology targeted at a general audience . The narrative provides ecological context , describing animals and plants that interact with the tree , as well as historical context . Parallels to the tree 's age are made with historical events , like the tree taking root as empirical science was taking root in Europe during the life of 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon . The book is most commonly described , and marketed , as a " biography " . One reviewer grouped it with the 2005 book The Golden Spruce as part of a new genre : an " <unk> " . 
 The book is written in the third person , omniscient , style . Grady 's writing moderates Suzuki 's characteristic rhetoric to create writing that is accessible , with a tone described as " a breezy casualness that welcomes the reader " . According to Suzuki , making the book accessible required telling the story from a human perspective , including some anthropomorphism of biological processes . 
 = = Publication = = 
 The book was published by Greystone Books , an imprint of Douglas & McIntyre based in Vancouver that specializes in nature , travel , and sports topics . They published the hardcover version of Tree in September 2004 . The book is small , measuring only 19 × 14 cm ( 7 @.@ 6 × 5 @.@ 4 inches ) with 192 pages . Suzuki and Grady promoted it through media interviews and book signing events across Canada . In February 2005 , Allen & Unwin published it in Australia as Tree : A Biography . The Recording for the Blind & <unk> released the audio book in April 2006 . Greystone Books published the trade paperback in February 2007 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In the Canadian market , the hardcover edition peaked at number three in the MacLean 's and the National Post 's non @-@ fiction best seller lists . The magazine Science & Spirit published an excerpt in the January – February 2005 edition . It was nominated for the 2004 Canadian Science Writers ' Association 's Science in Society Journalism Award for ' General Audience Book ' , the 2005 B.C. Booksellers ' Choice Award and the 2006 Council on Botanical and Horticultural Libraries ' Annual <unk> Award for best ' General Interest ' book . The French translation was nominated for the 2006 Governor General 's Awards for best English to French translation . 
 The premise of a biography for a tree was well received . The writing was called engaging , lyrical , and compelling . Robert Wiersema wrote , " Tree is science writing at its finest . It 's sweeping but focused , keenly aware of both the minutiae and the big picture . ... Although some of the concepts are complex , the writing is always accessible ... Scientific matters are explained in layman 's terms , and the text never bogs down or bottlenecks . " However , some reviewers found the language too technical . In the Montreal Gazette , Bronwyn Chester wrote that the scientific language " <unk> [ es ] our feeling and concern for this tree through too much information " . Robert Bateman 's black and white illustrations , while skilled , were said to add little to the narrative .

Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released , and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage . Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world , and is now attended by around 175 @,@ 000 people , requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security , transport , water , and electricity supply . The majority of staff are volunteers , helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes . 
 The festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie , counterculture , and free festival movements . It retains vestiges of these traditions , such as the Green Fields area , which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields . After the 1970s , the festival took place almost every year and grew in size , with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers . Michael Eavis hosted the first festival , then called Pilton Festival , after seeing an open @-@ air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music . 
 Glastonbury Festival was held intermittently from 1970 until 1981 ; since then , it has been held every year , except for " fallow years " taken every five years , intended to give the land , local population , and organisers a break . 
 = = History = = 
 A series of concerts , lectures and recitals called the Glastonbury Festivals was established with a summer school in the town of Glastonbury between 1914 and 1926 by classical composer Rutland Boughton ( 1878 – 1960 ) , and with their location attracted a bohemian audience by the standards of the time . They featured works by then @-@ contemporary composers , sponsored by the Clark family , as well as a wide range of traditional works , from Everyman to James Shirley 's Cupid and Death .

 Glastonbury was heavily influenced by hippie ethics and the free festival movement in the early 1970s , beginning with the Isle of Wight Festival , which featured performances by The Who , amongst many other artists . Organiser Michael Eavis decided to host the first festival , then called Pilton Festival , after seeing an open @-@ air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970 . The festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area , encompassing the Green Futures and Healing Field . 
 The first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pilton Pop , Blues & Folk Festival , mounted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970 , and attended by 1 @,@ 500 people . The original headline acts were The Kinks and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders but these acts were replaced at short notice by Tyrannosaurus Rex , later known as T. Rex . Tickets were £ 1 . Other billed acts of note were Quintessence , Stackridge , and Al Stewart . 
 = = = = Glastonbury Free Festival 1971 = = = = 
 The " Glastonbury Fair " of 1971 was instigated by Andrew Kerr after being found and introduced to Michael Eavis by David <unk> and organised with help from Jean <unk> , Kikan <unk> , John Massara , Jeff Dexter , Arabella Churchill , Thomas <unk> , Bill Harkin , Gilberto Gil , Mark Irons , John Coleman , and Jytte <unk> . The 1971 festival featured the first incarnation of the " Pyramid Stage " . Conceived by Bill Harkin the stage was a one @-@ tenth replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza built from scaffolding and metal sheeting and positioned over a blind spring which was found by dowsing . 
 Performers included David Bowie , Mighty Baby , Traffic , Fairport Convention , Gong , Hawkwind , Skin Alley , The Worthy Farm <unk> and Melanie . It was paid for by its supporters and advocates of its ideal , and embraced a mediaeval tradition of music , dance , poetry , theatre , lights , and spontaneous entertainment . The 1971 festival was filmed by Nicolas Roeg and David Puttnam and was released as a film called simply Glastonbury Fayre . 
 = = = = Glastonbury Festival 1979 = = = = 
 There was a small unplanned event in 1978 , when the convoy of vehicles from the Stonehenge festival was directed by police to Worthy Farm ; the festival was then revived the following year ( 1979 ) by Churchill , <unk> , Kerr and Eavis , in an event for the Year of the Child , which lost money . 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 The 1980s saw the festival become an annual fixture , barring periodic fallow years . In 1981 , Michael Eavis took control of the festival , and it was organised in conjunction with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) . That year a new Pyramid Stage was constructed from telegraph poles and metal sheeting ( repurposed from materials of the Ministry of Defence ) , a permanent structure which doubled as a hay @-@ barn and cow @-@ shed during the winter . 
 In the 1980s , the children 's area of the festival ( which had been organised by Arabella Churchill and others ) became the starting point for a new children 's charity called Children 's World . 1981 was the first year that the festival made profits , and Eavis donated £ 20 @,@ 000 of them to CND . In the following years , donations were made to a number of organisations , and since the end of the Cold War the main beneficiaries have been Oxfam , Greenpeace and WaterAid , who all contribute towards the festival by providing features and volunteers , who work at the festival in exchange for free entry . 
 Since 1983 , large festivals have required licences from local authorities . This led to certain restrictions being placed on the festival , including a crowd limit and specified times during which the stages could operate . The crowd limit was initially set at 30 @,@ 000 but has grown every year to over 100 @,@ 000 . 
 1984 saw the stage invaded by children during The Smiths set . Weather Report played the main stage , and Elvis Costello headlined the last night for almost three hours . 
 In 1985 , the festival grew too large for Worthy Farm , but neighbouring <unk> Farm was purchased . That year saw a wet festival with considerable rain ; Worthy Farm is a dairy farm and what washed down into the low areas was a mixture of mud and liquefied cow dung . This did not prevent festival @-@ goers from enjoying the knee @-@ deep slurry in front of the pyramid stage . 
 1989 was the first year that impromptu , unofficial sound systems sprung up around the festival site - a portent of things to come . These sound systems would play loud , electronic acid house music ' round the clock , with the largest , the Hypnosis sound system , rivaling the volume of some of the official stages and running non @-@ stop throughout the festival . These systems were seen by some as a refreshing wind of change that would rejuvenate a tired subculture , and by others as a blessed nuisance . 
 = = = 1990s = = = 
 The biggest festival yet was held in 1990 ; however , the day after the festival ended , violence - between the security guards and new age travellers ( the so @-@ called Battle of Yeoman 's Bridge ) - led to the organisers taking 1991 off to rethink the festival . An expanded festival returned in 1992 , and this proved a great success . 1992 was the first year that the new age travellers were not initially allowed onto the site free , and a sturdier fence was designed . This success was carried through to 1993 which , like 1992 , was hot and dry . 
 In 1994 , the Pyramid Stage burned down just over a week before the festival ; a temporary main stage was erected in time for the festival . The 1994 festival also introduced a 150 kW wind turbine which provided some of the festival power . This festival also included the setting of a new world record on 26 June when 826 people , juggling at least three objects each , kept 2 @,@ 478 objects in the air . This was also the year the festival was first televised by Channel 4 ; concentrating on the main two music stages , providing a glimpse of the festival for those who knew little of it . Channel 4 televised the festival the following year as well , which proved to be very successful . 
 The enhanced TV coverage in 1994 was a crucial factor in ensuring that Orbital 's performance at the festival achieved legendary status . As a result of Channel 4 's coverage , living rooms across the country were able to experience what a rave might look like , and suddenly dance music - which had been attacked by the establishment and mainstream press for years - didn 't seem so dangerous . Indeed , 1994 was a crucial turning point for dance music 's role at the festival . Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the Orbital gig , Michael Eavis noted that it marked dance music 's appearance on the mainstream agenda . " What was previously underground made it on to one of the big stages , and there was no going back from there . As the police and the council made me very well aware , the buzz had been around the raves and the market sound systems and in the travellers ' fields for years . But it needed a showcase to make it legal . " The gig opened the way for others such as the Chemical Brothers , Massive Attack and Underworld , who all played high @-@ profile stages in the following years – developments that led to the launch of the festival 's Dance Village in 1997 . 
 1995 saw the attendance rise drastically due to the security fence being breached on the Friday of the festival . Estimates suggest there may have been enough fence @-@ jumpers to double the size of the festival . This aside , 1995 proved to be a highly successful year with memorable performances from Oasis , Elastica , Pulp , PJ Harvey , Jeff Buckley , Jamiroquai and The Cure . This was also the first year of the festival having a dance tent to cater for the rise in popularity of dance music , following the success of Orbital 's headline appearance the previous year . The dance acts of 1995 were led by Massive Attack on the Friday and Carl Cox on the Saturday . The festival took a year off in 1996 to allow the land to recover and give the organisers a break . This would be a pattern which would be followed every five years until 2011 , with the gap year moving to 2012 . 1996 also saw the release of Glastonbury the Movie which was filmed at the 1993 and 1994 festivals . 
 The festival returned in 1997 bigger than ever . This time there was major sponsorship from The Guardian and the BBC , who had taken over televising the event from Channel 4 . This was also the year of the mud , with the site suffering severe rainfalls which turned the entire site into a muddy bog . However those who stayed for the festival were treated to many memorable performances , including Radiohead 's headlining Pyramid Stage set on the Saturday which is said to be one of the greatest ever Glastonbury performances . The live recording of " Paranoid Android " from this performance , as well as others such as " The Day Before Yesterday 's Man " by The <unk> , were released on a BBC CD entitled Mud For It . 
 In 1998 the festival was once again struck with severe floods and storms , and again some festival goers departed early - but those who stayed were treated to performances from acts such as Pulp , Robbie Williams and Blur . Tony Bennett , however , overcame the messy environment in an immaculate white suit and tie . 1998 was also the first year that attendance officially broke the 100 @,@ 000 mark . 
 Another hot dry year was recorded in 1999 , much to the relief of organisers and festival goers . The festival was again overcrowded due to fence @-@ jumpers , but this would not prove to be a major problem until the following year , when an additional 100 @,@ 000 people gatecrashed the site , increasing the attendance to an estimated 250 @,@ 000 people total . The 1999 festival is also remembered for the Manic Street Preachers requesting and being given their own backstage toilets ; however , it was revealed by the band that this was a joke - the " reserved " sign on the toilet was not at the authorisation of the management . 
 = = = 2000s = = = 
 2000 saw a new Pyramid Stage introduced as well as new features such as The Glade and The Leftfield . The festival was headlined by Pet Shop Boys and David Bowie playing 30 years after his first appearance . The Pyramid Stage also hosted an unusual event on the Saturday morning , with the wedding of two festival @-@ goers , who had written to the organisers asking for permission to get married there , taking place and conducted by actor Keith Allen in front of a small group of friends and any other festival @-@ goers who still happened to be awake . This year also saw an estimated 250 @,@ 000 people attend the festival ( only 100 @,@ 000 tickets were sold ) due to gatecrashers . This led to public safety concerns and the local District Council refused any further licences until the problem was solved . The organisers took 2001 off to devise anti @-@ <unk> measures and secure the future of the festival , after the Roskilde Festival 2000 accident ( though this was also a scheduled break , one which took place every five years from 1991 , the year after the battle of Yeoman 's Bridge , until the 2012 Olympics extended the five @-@ year sequence from the planned 2011 rest year ) . It was at this point that the Mean Fiddler Organisation was invited to help , which was seen by some as a " sell @-@ out " to corporate culture . 
 In 2002 , the festival returned after its planned fallow year , with the controversial Mean Fiddler now handling the logistics and security — especially installing a substantial surrounding fence ( dubbed the " <unk> " ) that reduced numbers to the levels of a decade earlier . The lower attendance led to a much more relaxed atmosphere and massively reduced crime levels compared to previous years . There were some incidents outside the fence involving frustrated individuals who arrived at the festival assuming they would be able to simply jump the fence and not pay for the music and performances , but despite this the event was hailed as a great success by the media companies that had taken an interest in the festival . 2002 also saw Coldplay headline the Pyramid Stage for the first time while the show was closed by a set from Rod Stewart on the Sunday night . 
 There were some criticisms of the 2002 festival that it lacked atmosphere , because of the reduced number of people , which reflected the smaller numbers jumping the fence . The number of tickets was increased to 150 @,@ 000 for 2003 which sold out within one day of going on sale , in marked contrast to the two months it took to sell 140 @,@ 000 in 2002 . It was also the first year that tickets sold out before the full line @-@ up was announced . This was also the year Radiohead returned to headline the Pyramid Stage . Revenue raised for good causes from ticket and commercial licence sales topped £ 1 million , half of which went to Oxfam , Greenpeace and Water Aid . 
 In 2004 , tickets sold out within 24 hours amid much controversy over the ticket ordering process , which left potential festival goers trying for hours to connect to the overloaded telephone and internet sites . The website got two million attempted connections within the first five minutes of the tickets going on sale and an average of 2 @,@ 500 people on the phone lines every minute . The festival was not hit by extreme weather , but high winds on the Wednesday delayed entry , and steady rain throughout Saturday turned some areas of the site to mud . The festival ended with Muse headlining the Pyramid Stage on Sunday , after Oasis had headlined on Friday . Franz Ferdinand and Sir Paul McCartney also performed . In the British press publications appeared about the use of psychedelic drugs by festival visitors . The magazine NME pronounced that 2004 would be " the third summer of love " due to the resurgence of the " <unk> " that was praised as a natural alternative to ecstasy , which was said to be declining in popularity ( LSD fuelled the first summer of love in 1967 ; ecstasy and LSD the second in 1988 ) . 
 After the 2004 festival , Michael Eavis commented that 2006 would be a year off — in keeping with the previous history of taking one " fallow year " in every five to give the villagers and surrounding areas a rest from the yearly disruption . This was confirmed after the licence for 2005 was granted . 
 In 2005 the 112 @,@ 500 ticket quota sold out rapidly — in this case in 3 hours 20 minutes . For 2005 , the enclosed area of the festival was over 900 acres ( 3 @.@ 6 km2 ) , had over 385 live performances , and was attended by around 150 @,@ 000 people . The Sunday headliner was originally scheduled to be Kylie Minogue , who instead pulled out in May to receive treatment for breast cancer . Basement Jaxx were announced as a replacement on 6 June . Both Coldplay and Basement Jaxx performed a cover of Kylie 's " Can 't Get You Out Of My Head " during their concert . 2005 saw a big increase in the number of dance music attractions , with the multiple tents of the Dance Village replacing the solitary dance tent of previous years . This new area contained the East and West dance tents , the Dance Lounge , Roots Stage , and Pussy Parlour , as well as a relocated G Stage , formerly situated in the Glade . The introduction of the innovative silent disco by Emily Eavis allowed revellers to party into the early hours without disturbing the locals — a requirement of the festival 's licensing . Following the death of DJ John Peel in the autumn of 2004 , the New Tent was renamed the John Peel Tent , in homage to his encouragement and love of new bands at Glastonbury . The opening day of the 2005 festival was delayed by heavy rain and thunderstorms : Several stages , including the Acoustic Tent ( and one of the bars ) , were struck by lightning , and the valley was hit with flash floods that left some areas of the site under more than four feet of water . The severity of the weather flooded several campsites , the worst affected being the base of Pennard Hill , and seriously disrupted site services . However Mendip District Council 's review of the festival called it one of the " safest ever " and gives the festival a glowing report in how it dealt with the floods . 
 There was no festival in 2006 . Instead , a documentary film directed by Julien Temple was released to make up for the lack of a festival . The film consists of specially shot footage by Temple at the festival , as well as footage sent in by fans and archive footage . Glastonbury was released in the UK on 14 April 2006 . 
 Glastonbury 2007 ( 20 – 24 June ) was headlined by Arctic Monkeys , The Killers , and The Who on Friday , Saturday and Sunday , respectively . Dame Shirley Bassey was also featured . In 2007 , over 700 acts played on over 80 stages and the capacity expanded by 20 @,@ 000 to 177 @,@ 000 . This was the first year that " The Park " area opened . Designed by Emily Eavis , its main stage featured extra sets by several artists playing on the main stages including Pete Doherty and Gruff Rhys , whilst the BBC launched their new " Introducing " stage in the area . The festival had the largest attendance since the construction of the security fence , and the largest legitimate attendance to date : ticket allocation was raised by 27 @,@ 500 to 137 @,@ 500 , which were charged at £ 145 and sold out in 1 hour 45 minutes . As an extra precaution against touts ( scalpers ) , purchasers had to pre @-@ register , including submission of a passport photo which was security printed into the ticket . Continued periods of rain throughout much of the festival caused muddy conditions , though without the flooding of 2005 , in part due to the new £ 750 @,@ 000 flood defences . However this constant rain made the general conditions within the site worse than 2 years before and more like the mud plains of 1998 . It was difficult to find anywhere to sit down that had not turned to mud and key choke points , such as the thoroughfare at the front right of the Pyramid stage , turned into a quagmire . Muddy conditions on the temporary roads on the periphery of the site led to delays for people leaving the site . On 25 June , when the vast majority of festival goers were attempting to leave the festival , cars in the western car parks took over nine hours to exit the site . There was no stewarding provision in these areas , no information was disseminated regarding the delays , no organised marshalling of traffic was undertaken by the festival organisers , and no provision of drinking water was made to people stranded in their vehicles . Verbal and physical violence was witnessed between festival goers . When cars were finally allowed to leave the site the surrounding roads were found to be clear . Reported crime was down from 2005 but the number of arrests were " well up " , after a proactive operation of the police and security on site . There were 236 reported crimes , down from 267 in 2005 ; of these , 158 were drug related ( 183 in 2005 ) . 1 @,@ 200 people required medical aid with 32 hospitalised , most of which were accidents caused by the mud . There was one fatality : a West Midlands man found unconscious early on the Saturday morning died in Yeovil District Hospital of a suspected drugs overdose . 
 On 20 December 2007 , Arabella Churchill , an instrumental figure in the conception of the 1971 festival and since the 1980s area coordinator of the Theatre Field , died at St Edmund 's Cottages , Bove Town , Glastonbury at the age of 58 . She had suffered a short illness due to pancreatic cancer , for which she had refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy . She was a convert to Buddhism , and arrangements following her death respected her belief . Michael Eavis , paying tribute to her after her death , said " Her vitality and great sense of morality and social responsibility have given her a place in our festival history second to none " . 
 The Glastonbury Festival 2008 was held on 27 , 28 and 29 June , headlined by Kings of Leon , Jay @-@ Z and The Verve on Friday , Saturday and Sunday , respectively , with other notable acts including Neil Diamond , Shakin ' Stevens , The Levellers , and Stackridge , who opened the first festival in 1970 . Continuing the procedure introduced in 2007 , ticket buyers had to pre @-@ register and submit a passport photo between the 1 February and 14 March in order to buy tickets which went on sale at 9 am on Sunday 6 April . Following 40 @,@ 000 tickets not being sold , the pre @-@ registration process was reopened on 8 April . Several reasons have been cited for this , including the poor weather of the previous four years and the controversial choice of featuring the hip hop artist , Jay @-@ Z , as a headlining act . A day before the festival began , Michael Eavis announced that there were still around 3 @,@ 000 tickets remaining , making it possible that it would be the first festival in 15 years not to sell out in advance . It had also been announced that any remaining tickets would be sold from major branches of HMV . This year saw the introduction of a new field adjacent to the Sacred space and Park Stage . Not named by the organisers , the festival goers themselves called it " <unk> " in reference to the flags located there . After the huge number of tents left behind in 2007 and when one of Michael Eavis 's cows died after ingesting a metal tent @-@ peg left in the soil , the Festival devised its Love the Farm , Leave No Trace campaign which gently pushed revellers to respect the environment and clear up after themselves . The Festival had always pushed a green agenda and new initiatives in 2008 included biodegradable tent pegs handed out free to all campers and <unk> running on waste vegetable oil . These new efforts were rewarded with The Greener Festival Award for 2008 alongside a number of other festivals also committed to environmentally friendly music festivals . The 2008 festival was reported to have cost £ 22 million to produce . 
 The Glastonbury Festival 2009 took place between 24 and 28 June 2009 . In marked contrast with previous years , the 137 @,@ 500 tickets went on sale on 5 October 2008 , earlier than ever before , with pre @-@ registered customers able either to pay in full , or place a £ 50 reserve deposit to be paid by 1 February . Tickets for the festival sold out . The full line up was released on 25 May 2009 and included headliners Blur , Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young on the Pyramid stage . The Other stage was headlined by The Prodigy , Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand . Other notable performers included Jarvis Cocker , Rolf Harris , Fairport Convention ( who played at the first Glastonbury Festival ) , Tom Jones , Steel Pulse , Doves , Lady Gaga , Jason Mraz , Nick Cave , Pete Doherty , Hugh Cornwell , Status Quo , The Gaslight Anthem ( in which Springsteen appeared on stage during their song " The ' 59 Sound " ) , Madness , Dizzee Rascal , Crosby , Stills & Nash , Lily Allen , Kasabian , Florence and the Machine , Alejandro Toledo and the Magic <unk> .

 The Glastonbury Festival 2010 took place between 23 and 28 June . On the last night , Michael Eavis appeared on the main stage with headline artist Stevie Wonder to sing the chorus of the latter 's " Happy Birthday " , marking the festival 's 40th year . Tickets went on sale on 4 October 2009 , using the same £ 50 deposit scheme introduced the previous year ; unlike the previous two years , and more in common with earlier festivals , the tickets for the 2010 edition sold out in less than 24 hours . U2 were due to headline the Pyramid Stage on Friday night at Glastonbury 2010 , but due to Bono sustaining a back injury they were forced to pull out . According to the media , Bono was " gutted " , even having written a song especially for the festival . Damon Albarn 's Gorillaz were brought in to replace U2 , and joined Muse and Stevie Wonder for the Saturday and Sunday headline slots respectively . It would be Damon Albarn 's second headlining act in two years . Pet Shop Boys returned after 10 years to headline the Other Stage on the Saturday Night . The entire stage set from their Pandemonium Tour was brought in for the performance which was extremely well received . Radiohead 's Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood made a surprise appearance with a nine song set . The weather at the festival was among some of the best ever , the festival @-@ goers enjoying 3 days of abundant sunshine and very warm to hot temperatures , which reached close to 30 degrees on the Sunday ; it was the first rain @-@ free festival since 2002 and the hottest since the festival began . 
 During 2010 Michael Eavis received a donation from British Waterways of timber from the old gates at Caen Hill Locks in Wiltshire . This was used to construct a new bridge which was dedicated to the memory of Arabella Churchill . The following year more of the redundant lock gates were used to build the Campo <unk> amphitheatre . 
 The Glastonbury Festival 2011 took place from Wednesday 22 until Sunday 26 June 2011 . The tickets were sold out within 4 hours of going on sale on Sunday 3 October 2010 . Headline acts for 2011 were U2 on the Friday night , Coldplay on the Saturday and Beyoncé on Sunday . This made Beyoncé the first woman to headline at the festival since 1999 . 
 The festival was not held in 2012 , giving the site and organisers a " fallow year " which originally would have been in 2011 , in keeping with the tradition of taking a break every fifth year . Michael Eavis cited the shortage and likely cost of portable toilets and policing , due to the needs of the 2012 Summer Olympics , as being amongst the reasons . The decision to move the fallow year to 2012 also proved to be a fortunate one , as Somerset experienced spells of persistent heavy rain in the period up to and including the week that the festival would normally have been held . Indeed , Emily Eavis suggested that the festival itself might have been called off , such was the severity of the weather . Registration for tickets to the 2013 festival began in June 2011 and ticket booking opened at 9am on Sunday 7 October 2012 , with 135 @,@ 000 selling out in a record time of one hour and forty minutes . 
 To mark the 2012 Glastonbury weekend , Eavis was invited to guest edit the local paper , the Western Daily Press , on Saturday 23 June . 
 During the 2014 festival , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old Berkshire man suffered from a suspected reaction to Ketamine and later died in Bristol Royal Infirmary . Despite this , police reported that crime was down 30 % from last year but reminded festival goers to look after their possessions . 
 Before the 2015 festival Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl fell off a stage during a show in Gothenburg a few weeks before and broke his leg , forcing their late withdrawal from the line @-@ up . Florence and the Machine were moved from second @-@ top on the bill to Friday 's headliner , while Florence 's vacant gap was filled by Reading & Leeds headliners The Libertines , and their performance was well received . Kanye West and The Who were the headliners for the Saturday and Sunday , respectively . Other notable acts who performed included Motorhead ( their final festival appearance in the UK before Lemmy 's death ) , Pharrell Williams , Deadmau5 , Patti Smith , the <unk> , Lionel Richie , Catfish and the <unk> , Enter Shikari , the Chemical Brothers , Alt @-@ J , Paloma Faith , Mary J. Blige and Paul Weller , as well as an appearance by the 14th Dalai Lama . 
 On 28 August 2015 it was announced that hundreds of pairs of discarded <unk> boots from the 2015 festival were donated to the migrant camp at Calais .

 Since 1981 , the festival has been organised by local farmer and site owner Michael Eavis ( through his company Glastonbury Festivals Ltd ) . Eavis ran the festival with his wife Jean until her death in 1999 , and is now assisted by his daughter Emily Eavis . Since 2002 , Festival Republic ( a company consisting of both Live Nation and MCD ) has taken on the job of managing the logistics and security of the festival through a 40 % stake in the festival management company . Each year a company , joint owned by Glastonbury Festivals Ltd and Festival Republic , is created to run the festival , with profits going to the parent companies . Glastonbury Festivals Ltd donates most of their profits to charities , including donations to local charity and community groups and paying for the purchase and restoration of the Tithe Barn in Pilton . 
 Several stages and areas are managed independently , such as The Left Field which is managed by a cooperative owned by Battersea and Wandsworth TUC , Worthy FM and a field run by Greenpeace . The sound systems on site have a total power of 650 @,@ 000 watts , with the main stage having 250 speakers . There are over 4 @,@ 000 toilets , 2000 long @-@ drop and 1300 compost , with water supplies including two reservoirs holding 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 litres ( 440 @,@ 000 imp gal ) of water . 
 With the exception of technical and security staff , the festival is mainly run by volunteers . Some 2000 stewards are organised by the aid charity Oxfam . In return for their work at the festival Oxfam receive a donation , which in 2005 was £ 200 @,@ 000 . Medical facilities are provided by Festival Medical Services who have done so since 1979 . The bars are organised by the Workers Beer Company , sponsored by Carlsberg ( previously Budweiser ) , who recruit teams of volunteer staff from small charities and campaign groups . In return for their help , typically around 18 hours over the festival , volunteers are paid in free entry , transport and food , while their charities receive the wages the volunteers earn over the event . 
 Catering , and some retail services , are provided by various small companies , typically mobile catering vans , with over 400 food stalls on site in 2010 . The camping retail chain <unk> , and independent shops , set up makeshift outlets at the festival . Additionally charities and organisations run promotional or educational stalls , such as the Hare Krishna tent which provide free vegetarian food . Network Recycling manage refuse on the site , and in 2004 recycled 300 tonnes and composted 110 tonnes of waste from the site . 
 Significant logistical operations take place to bring people into the festival by public transport each year . Additional festival trains are provided to Castle Cary railway station , mostly from London Paddington . The station operates as a mini hub with waiting shuttle buses transferring passengers from Castle Cary to the festival site as required . This is an intensive operation on the Wednesday and Thursday each year with local bus and coach operators providing these buses over the two days . Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival . On the Monday , passengers are transferred back in just one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement . National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required . 
 The festival is powered by <unk> who provide over 27 megawatts of power to the site with 250 bio @-@ diesel generators , run on 60 @,@ 000 litres of waste vegetable oil ( <unk> ) fuel . The power generated is enough to power the city of Bath and the Pyramid Stage is powered by 4 generators itself . There is 24 km of festoon lighting around the site , also installed by <unk> . This is run with time clocks so the lights are only on when they are needed , contributing to the festival 's green requirements . 
 = = Location = = 
 The festival takes place in south west England at Worthy Farm between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle in Somerset , six miles east of Glastonbury , overlooked by the Glastonbury Tor in the " Vale of Avalon " . The area has a number of legends and spiritual traditions , and is a " New Age " site of interest : ley lines are considered to converge on the Tor . The nearest town to the festival site is Shepton Mallet , three miles ( 5 km ) north east , but there continues to be interaction between the people espousing alternative lifestyles living in Glastonbury and the festival . The farm is situated between the A361 and A37 roads . 
 Worthy Farm is situated at grid reference ST 590 397 in a valley at the head of the Whitelake River , between two low limestone ridges , part of the southern edge of the Mendip Hills . On the site is a confluence of the two small streams that make the Whitelake River . In the past the site has experienced problems with flooding , though after the floods that occurred during the 1997 and 1998 festival , drainage was improved . This did not prevent flooding during the 2005 festival , but allowed the flood water to dissipate within hours . The Highbridge branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ran through the farm on an embankment , but was dismantled in 1966 and now forms a main thoroughfare across the site . Another prominent feature is the high @-@ voltage electricity line which crosses the site east @-@ west . 
 In recent years the site has been organised around a restricted backstage compound , with the Pyramid stage on the north , and Other stage on the south of the compound . Attractions on the east of the site include the acoustic tent , comedy tent and circus . To the south are the green fields , which include displays of traditional and environmentally friendly crafts . In King 's Meadow , the hill at the far south of the site , is a small megalith circle which , like Stonehenge , is coordinated with the summer solstice , and since 1990 represents a Stone circle .

 Most people who stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent . There are many different camping areas , each with its own atmosphere . <unk> and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas , whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite . <unk> Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family @-@ only campsite . A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground . Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival @-@ goers must bring their own tents . <unk> have been at the festival for many years . A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle . Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a <unk> and <unk> . Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided . <unk> Park also offers solar showers and a log @-@ fired <unk> sauna to cap off the experience . 
 <unk> , caravans and trailer tents are not allowed into the main festival site . However the purchase of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence ; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan ; the car , or other vehicle used to tow the caravan , may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan / caravan and connected awning , not in the accompanying vehicle . One additional tent may accompany the caravan / campervan if space within the plot allows . Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome , though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot . The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields ; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as ' campervans ' , all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities , and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival . Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site , caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned . 
 Festival @-@ goers can stay at local B & B accommodation but most are not within walking distance of the festival . There are several independent Glastonbury accommodation providers close to the main site , which include smaller campsites for tents , gypsy caravans , geo @-@ domes , private cottages and more - some festival goers choose to be ferried between the festival and their accommodation by quad @-@ bike or even private helicopter .

 Various artists have written songs entitled Glastonbury or about the festival including <unk> , The Waterboys and Scouting for Girls . Cosmic Rough Riders included " Glastonbury Revisited " on their album Enjoy The Melodic Sunshine ( <unk> ) in 2000 . Amy Macdonald , in her song " Let 's Start a Band " referenced Glastonbury : " Give me a festival and I 'll be your Glastonbury star . " Robbie Williams , in his song " The 90s " , refers to his surprise appearance on stage with Oasis in 1995 , which ultimately led to him leaving Take That : " Everybody 's worried ' what the fuck 's wrong with Robbie ? He 's not answering his phone , he 's not talking to me , I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury ' . " Joe Strummer wrote the song " Coma Girl " about his experiences at Glastonbury , — in a BBC interview Bruce Springsteen cited the song as inspiring him to play the 2009 festival . U2 wrote a song titled " Glastonbury " that was supposed to premier with their appearance at the festival , but an injury to Bono forced them to cancel . They instead premièred it in a concert in Turin on their 360 ° Tour . Marcus Brigstocke 's comic creation Giles <unk> Hogg had a special mock @-@ documentary made about him going to Glastonbury as part of the Giles <unk> @-@ Hogg Goes Off series . Deborah Crombie 's novel A Finer End takes place in Glastonbury with references to a fictional account of an original 1914 Glastonbury Fayre as well as the contemporary festival . Glastonbury is also a setting in John Osborne 's 2014 Radio 4 show The New Blur Album . 
 = Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter = 
 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit . The US $ 720 million spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) . The mission is managed by the California Institute of Technology , at the JPL , in La Cañada <unk> , California , for the NASA Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. It was launched August 12 , 2005 , and attained Martian orbit on March 10 , 2006 . In November 2006 , after five months of aerobraking , it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase . As MRO entered orbit , it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet 's surface : Mars Global Surveyor , Mars Express , 2001 Mars Odyssey , and the two Mars Exploration Rovers ( Spirit and Opportunity ) ; at the time , this set a record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars . Mars Global Surveyor and the Spirit rover have since ceased to function ; the remainder remain operational as of March 2016 . 
 MRO contains a host of scientific instruments such as cameras , spectrometers , and radar , which are used to analyze the landforms , stratigraphy , minerals , and ice of Mars . It paves the way for future spacecraft by monitoring Mars ' daily weather and surface conditions , studying potential landing sites , and hosting a new telecommunications system . MRO 's telecommunications system will transfer more data back to Earth than all previous interplanetary missions combined , and MRO will serve as a highly capable relay satellite for future missions . 
 = = Pre @-@ launch = = 
 One of two missions considered for the 2003 Mars launch window , the MRO proposal lost against what became known as the Mars Exploration Rovers . The orbiter mission was rescheduled for launch in 2005 , and NASA announced its final name , Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , on October 26 , 2000 . 
 MRO is modeled after NASA 's highly successful Mars Global Surveyor to conduct surveillance of Mars from orbit . Early specifications of the satellite included a large camera to take high resolution pictures of Mars . In this regard , James B. Garvin , the Mars exploration program scientist for NASA , proclaimed that MRO would be a " microscope in orbit " . The satellite was also to include a visible @-@ near @-@ infrared spectrograph . 
 On October 3 , 2001 , NASA chose Lockheed Martin as the primary contractor for the spacecraft 's fabrication . By the end of 2001 all of the mission 's instruments were selected . There were no major setbacks during MRO 's construction , and the spacecraft was moved to John F. Kennedy Space Center on May 1 , 2005 to prepare it for launch . 
 = = Mission objectives = = 
 MRO science operations were initially scheduled to last two Earth years , from November 2006 to November 2008 . One of the mission 's main goals is to map the Martian landscape with its high @-@ resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions . The MRO played an important role in choosing the landing site of the Phoenix Lander , which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley . The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders . After analysis with HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey 's <unk> instrument a new site was chosen . Mars Science Laboratory , a highly maneuverable rover , also had its landing site inspected . The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay . 
 MRO is using its onboard scientific equipment to study the Martian climate , weather , atmosphere , and geology , and to search for signs of liquid water in the polar caps and underground . In addition , MRO was tasked with looking for the remains of the previously lost Mars Polar Lander and Beagle 2 spacecraft . Beagle 2 was found by the orbiter at the beginning of 2015 . After its main science operations are completed , the probe 's extended mission is to be the communication and navigation system for landers and rover probes . 
 = = Launch and orbital insertion = = 
 On August 12 , 2005 , MRO was launched aboard an Atlas V @-@ 401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . The Centaur upper stage of the rocket completed its burns over a fifty @-@ six @-@ minute period and placed MRO into an interplanetary transfer orbit towards Mars . 
 MRO cruised through interplanetary space for seven and a half months before reaching Mars . While en route most of the scientific instruments and experiments were tested and calibrated . To ensure proper orbital insertion upon reaching Mars , four trajectory correction maneuvers were planned and a fifth emergency maneuver was discussed . However , only three trajectory correction maneuvers were necessary , which saved 60 pounds ( 27 kg ) fuel that would be usable during MRO 's extended mission . 
 MRO began orbital insertion by approaching Mars on March 10 , 2006 , and passing above its southern hemisphere at an altitude of 370 – 400 kilometers ( 230 – 250 mi ) . All six of MRO 's main engines burned for 27 minutes to slow the probe from 2 @,@ 900 to 1 @,@ 900 meters per second ( 9 @,@ 500 to 6 @,@ 200 ft / s ) . The helium pressurization tank was colder than expected , which reduced the pressure in the fuel tank by about 21 kilopascals ( 3 @.@ 0 psi ) . The reduced pressure caused the engine thrust to be diminished by 2 % , but MRO automatically compensated by extending the burn time by 33 seconds . 
 Completion of the orbital insertion placed the orbiter in a highly elliptical polar orbit with a period of approximately 35 @.@ 5 hours . Shortly after insertion , the periapsis – the point in the orbit closest to Mars – was 426 km ( 265 mi ) from the surface ( 3 @,@ 806 km ( 2 @,@ 365 mi ) from the planet 's center ) . The apoapsis – the point in the orbit farthest from Mars – was 44 @,@ 500 km ( 27 @,@ 700 mi ) from the surface ( 47 @,@ 972 km ( 29 @,@ 808 mi ) from the planet 's center ) . 
 On March 30 , 2006 , MRO began the process of aerobraking , a three @-@ step procedure that cuts in half the fuel needed to achieve a lower , more circular orbit with a shorter period . First , during its first five orbits of the planet ( one Earth week ) , MRO used its thrusters to drop the periapsis of its orbit into aerobraking altitude . This altitude depends on the thickness of the atmosphere because Martian atmospheric density changes with its seasons . Second , while using its thrusters to make minor corrections to its periapsis altitude , MRO maintained aerobraking altitude for 445 planetary orbits ( about five Earth months ) to reduce the apoapsis of the orbit to 450 kilometres ( 280 mi ) . This was done in such a way so as to not heat the spacecraft too much , but also dip enough into the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down . After the process was complete , MRO used its thrusters to move its periapsis out of the edge of the Martian atmosphere on August 30 , 2006 . 
 In September 2006 MRO fired its thrusters twice more to fine @-@ tune its final , nearly circular orbit to approximately 250 to 316 km ( 155 to 196 mi ) above the Martian surface , with a period of about 112 minutes . The SHARAD radar antennas were deployed on September 16 . All of the scientific instruments were tested and most were turned off prior to the solar conjunction that occurred from October 7 to November 6 , 2006 . After the conjunction ended the " primary science phase " began . 
 On November 17 , 2006 NASA announced the successful test of the MRO as an orbital communications relay . Using the NASA rover " Spirit " as the point of origin for the transmission , the MRO acted as a relay for transmitting data back to Earth . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 On September 29 , 2006 ( sol 402 ) , MRO took its first high resolution image from its science orbit . This image is said to resolve items as small as 90 cm ( 3 feet ) in diameter . On October 6 , NASA released detailed pictures from the MRO of Victoria crater along with the Opportunity rover on the rim above it . In November , problems began to surface in the operation of two MRO spacecraft instruments . A stepping mechanism in the Mars Climate Sounder ( MCS ) skipped on multiple occasions resulting in a field of view that is slightly out of position . By December normal operations of the instrument was suspended , although a mitigation strategy allows the instrument to continue making most of its intended observations . Also , an increase in noise and resulting bad pixels has been observed in several CCDs of the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) . Operation of this camera with a longer warm @-@ up time has alleviated the issue . However , the cause is still unknown and may return . 
 HiRISE continues to return images that have enabled discoveries regarding the geology of Mars . Foremost among these is the announcement of banded terrain observations indicating the presence and action of liquid carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) or water on the surface of Mars in its recent geological past . HiRISE was able to photograph the Phoenix lander during its parachuted descent to <unk> Borealis on May 25 , 2008 ( sol 990 ) . 
 The orbiter continued to experience recurring problems in 2009 , including four spontaneous resets , culminating in a four @-@ month shut @-@ down of the spacecraft from August to December . While engineers have not determined the cause of the recurrent resets , they have created new software to help troubleshoot the problem should it recur . 
 On March 3 , 2010 , the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter passed another significant milestone , having transmitted over 100 <unk> of data back to Earth , which was more than all other interplanetary probes sent from Earth combined . 
 On August 6 , 2012 ( sol <unk> , the orbiter passed over Gale crater , the landing site of the Mars Science Laboratory mission , during its EDL phase . It captured an image via the HiRISE camera of the Curiosity rover descending with its <unk> and supersonic parachute . 
 NASA reported that the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , as well as the Mars Odyssey Orbiter and MAVEN orbiter had a chance to study the Comet Siding Spring flyby on October 19 , 2014 . 
 On July 29 , 2015 , the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was placed into a new orbit to provide communications support during the arrival of the InSight Mars lander mission on September 28 , 2016 . The maneuver 's engine burn lasted for 75 seconds . 
 = = Instruments = = 
 Three cameras , two spectrometers and a radar are included on the orbiter along with two " science @-@ facility instruments " , which use data from engineering subsystems to collect science data . Three technology experiments will test and demonstrate new equipment for future missions . It is expected MRO will obtain about 5 @,@ 000 images per year . 
 = = = HiRISE ( camera ) = = = 
 The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera is a 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 ft 8 in ) reflecting telescope , the largest ever carried on a deep space mission , and has a resolution of 1 <unk> ( <unk> ) , or 0 @.@ 3 m ( 1 ft 0 in ) from an altitude of 300 km ( 190 mi ) . In comparison , satellite images of Earth are generally available with a resolution of 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 ft 8 in ) , and satellite images on Google Maps are available to 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) . HiRISE collects images in three color bands , 400 to 600 nm ( blue @-@ green or B @-@ G ) , 550 to 850 nm ( red ) and 800 to 1 @,@ 000 nm ( near infrared or NIR ) . 
 Red color images are 20 @,@ 264 pixels across ( 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) wide ) , and B @-@ G and NIR are 4 @,@ 048 pixels across ( 1 @.@ 2 km ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) wide ) . HiRISE 's onboard computer reads these lines in time with the orbiter 's ground speed , and images are potentially unlimited in length . Practically however , their length is limited by the computer 's 28 Gigabit ( Gb ) memory capacity , and the nominal maximum size is 20 @,@ 000 × 40 @,@ 000 pixels ( 800 megapixels ) and 4 @,@ 000 × 40 @,@ 000 pixels ( 160 megapixels ) for B @-@ G and NIR images . Each 16 @.@ 4 Gb image is compressed to 5 Gb before transmission and release to the general public on the HiRISE website in JPEG 2000 format . To facilitate the mapping of potential landing sites , HiRISE can produce stereo pairs of images from which topography can be calculated to an accuracy of 0 @.@ 25 m ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) . HiRISE was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. 
 = = = CTX ( camera ) = = = 
 The Context Camera ( CTX ) provides grayscale images ( 500 to 800 nm ) with a pixel resolution up to about 6 m ( 20 ft ) . CTX is designed to provide context maps for the targeted observations of HiRISE and CRISM , and is also used to mosaic large areas of Mars , monitor a number of locations for changes over time , and to acquire stereo ( 3D ) coverage of key regions and potential future landing sites . The optics of CTX consist of a 350 mm ( 14 in ) focal length <unk> Cassegrain telescope with a 5 @,@ 064 pixel wide line array CCD . The instrument takes pictures 30 km ( 19 mi ) wide and has enough internal memory to store an image 160 km ( 99 mi ) long before loading it into the main computer . The camera was built , and is operated by Malin Space Science Systems . CTX mapped 50 % of Mars by February 2010 . In 2012 it found the impacts of six 55 @-@ pound ( 25 @-@ kilogram ) entry ballast masses from Mars Science Laboratory 's landing of Curiosity rover . 
 = = = MARCI ( camera ) = = = 
 The Mars Color Imager ( MARCI ) is a wide @-@ angle , relatively low @-@ resolution camera that views the surface of Mars in five visible and two ultraviolet bands . Each day , MARCI collects about 84 images and produces a global map with pixel resolutions of 1 to 10 km ( 0 @.@ 62 to 6 @.@ 21 mi ) . This map provides a daily weather report for Mars , helps to characterize its seasonal and annual variations , and maps the presence of water vapor and ozone in its atmosphere . The camera was built and is operated by Malin Space Science Systems . It has a 180 @-@ degree fisheye lens with the seven color filters bonded directly a single CCD sensor . 
 = = = CRISM ( spectrometer ) = = = 
 The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars ( CRISM ) instrument is a visible and near infrared ( <unk> ) spectrometer that is used to produce detailed maps of the surface mineralogy of Mars . It operates from 370 to <unk> nm , measures the spectrum in 544 channels ( each 6 @.@ 55 nm wide ) , and has a resolution of 18 m ( 59 ft ) at an altitude of 300 km ( 190 mi ) . CRISM is being used to identify minerals and chemicals indicative of the past or present existence of water on the surface of Mars . These materials include iron , oxides , phyllosilicates , and carbonates , which have characteristic patterns in their visible @-@ infrared energy . 
 = = = Mars Climate Sounder = = = 
 The Mars Climate Sounder ( MCS ) looks both down and horizontally through the atmosphere in order to quantify the global atmosphere ’ s vertical variations . It is a spectrometer with one visible / near infrared channel ( 0 @.@ 3 to 3 @.@ 0 μm ) and eight far infrared ( 12 to 50 μm ) channels selected for the purpose . MCS observes the atmosphere on the horizon of Mars ( as viewed from MRO ) by breaking it up into vertical slices and taking measurements within each slice in 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) increments . These measurements are assembled into daily global weather maps to show the basic variables of Martian weather : temperature , pressure , humidity , and dust density . 
 This instrument , supplied by NASA ’ s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , California , utilizes technological advances to achieve the measurement objectives of a heavier , larger instrument originally developed at JPL for the 1992 Mars Observer and 1998 Mars Climate Orbiter missions . 
 = = = SHARAD ( radar ) = = = 
 MRO 's Shallow Subsurface Radar ( SHARAD ) experiment is designed to probe the internal structure of the Martian polar ice caps . It also gathers planet @-@ wide information about underground layers of ice , rock and possibly liquid water that might be accessible from the surface . SHARAD uses HF radio waves between 15 and 25 MHz , a range that allows it to resolve layers as thin as 7 m ( 23 ft ) to a maximum depth of 1 km ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) . It has a horizontal resolution of 0 @.@ 3 to 3 km ( 0 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 9 mi ) . SHARAD is designed to operate in conjunction with the Mars Express <unk> , which has lower resolution but penetrates to a much greater depth . Both SHARAD and <unk> were made by the Italian Space Agency . 
 = = = Engineering instruments = = = 
 In addition to its imaging equipment , MRO carries a variety of engineering instruments . The Gravity Field Investigation Package measures variations in the Martian gravitational field through variations in the spacecraft 's velocity . Velocity changes are detected by measuring doppler shifts in MRO 's radio signals received on Earth . The package also includes sensitive onboard accelerometers used to deduce the in situ atmospheric density of Mars during aerobraking . 
 The Electra communications package is a UHF software @-@ defined radio ( SDR ) that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities . It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach , land , and operate on Mars . In addition to protocol controlled inter @-@ spacecraft data links of 1 kbit / s to 2 Mbit / s , Electra also provides Doppler data collection , open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e − 13 USO . Doppler information for approaching vehicles can be used for final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation . Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers . The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter . The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft , Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover . 
 The Optical Navigation Camera images the Martian moons , Phobos and Deimos , against background stars to precisely determine MRO 's orbit . Although moon imaging is not mission critical , it was included as a technology test for future orbiting and landing of spacecraft . The Optical Navigation Camera was tested successfully in February and March 2006 . There is a proposal to search for small moons , dust rings , and old orbiters with it .

 Workers at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver assembled the spacecraft structure and attached the instruments . Instruments were constructed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson , Arizona , Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel , Maryland , the Italian Space Agency in Rome , and Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego . The total cost of the spacecraft was $ 720 million USD . 
 The structure is made of mostly carbon composites and aluminum @-@ honeycombed plates . The titanium fuel tank takes up most of the volume and mass of the spacecraft and provides most of its structural integrity . The spacecraft 's total mass is less than 2 @,@ 180 kg ( 4 @,@ 810 lb ) with an <unk> dry mass less than 1 @,@ 031 kg ( 2 @,@ 273 lb ) . 
 = = = Power systems = = = 
 MRO gets all of its electrical power from two solar panels , each of which can move independently around two axes ( up @-@ down , or left @-@ right rotation ) . Each solar panel measures 5 @.@ 35 m × 2 @.@ 53 m ( 17 @.@ 6 ft × 8 @.@ 3 ft ) and has 9 @.@ 5 m2 ( 102 sq ft ) covered with 3 @,@ 744 individual photovoltaic cells . Its high @-@ efficiency triple junction solar cells are able to convert more than 26 % of the Sun 's energy directly into electricity and are connected together to produce a total output of 32 volts . At Mars , each of the panels produces more than 1 @,@ 000 watts of power ; in contrast , the panels would generate 3 @,@ 000 watts in a comparable Earth orbit by being closer to the Sun . 
 MRO has two rechargeable nickel @-@ hydrogen batteries used to power the spacecraft when it is not facing the Sun . Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50 ampere @-@ hours ( 180 <unk> ) . The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft , but allows the operators to extend the battery life — a valuable capability , given that battery drain is one of the most common causes of long @-@ term satellite failure . Planners anticipate that only 40 % of the batteries ' capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft . 
 = = = Electronic systems = = = 
 MRO 's main computer is a 133 MHz , 10 @.@ 4 million transistor , 32 @-@ bit , <unk> processor . This processor is a radiation @-@ hardened version of a PowerPC 750 or G3 processor with a specially built motherboard . The <unk> is a successor to the <unk> . This processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern PC processor , but it is extremely reliable , resilient , and can function in solar flare @-@ ravaged deep space . The operating system software is <unk> and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring . 
 Data is stored in a 160 Gb ( 20 GB ) flash memory module consisting of over 700 memory chips , each with a 256 Mbit capacity . This memory capacity is not actually that large considering the amount of data to be acquired ; for example , a single image from the HiRISE camera can be as large as 28 Gb . 
 = = = Telecommunications system = = = 
 The Telecom Subsystem on MRO is the best digital communication system sent into deep space so far and for the first time using capacity approaching turbo @-@ codes . The Electra communications package is a UHF software @-@ defined radio ( SDR ) that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities . It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach , land , and operate on Mars . The system consists of a very large ( 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) ) antenna , which is used to transmit data through the Deep Space Network via X @-@ band frequencies at 8 GHz , and it demonstrates the use of the Ka band at 32 GHz for higher data rates . Maximum transmission speed from Mars is projected to be as high as 6 Mbit / s , a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters . The spacecraft carries two 100 @-@ watt X @-@ band amplifiers ( one of which is a backup ) , one 35 @-@ watt Ka @-@ band amplifier , and two Small Deep Space Transponders ( <unk> ) . 
 Two smaller low @-@ gain antennas are also present for lower @-@ rate communication during emergencies and special events , such as launch and Mars Orbit Insertion . These antennas do not have focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any direction . They are an important backup system to ensure that MRO can always be reached , even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth . 
 The Ka @-@ band subsystem was used for demonstration purposes . Due to lack of spectrum at 8 @.@ 41 GHz X @-@ band , future high @-@ rate deep space missions will use 32 GHz Ka @-@ band . NASA Deep Space Network ( <unk> ) implemented Ka @-@ band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes ( Goldstone , Canberra and Madrid ) over its 34 @-@ m beam @-@ waveguide ( <unk> ) antenna <unk> . During the cruise phase , spacecraft Ka @-@ band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas . Ka @-@ band tests were also planned during the science phase , but during aerobraking a switch failed , limiting the X @-@ band high gain antenna to a single amplifier . If this amplifier fails all high @-@ speed X @-@ band communications will be lost . The Ka downlink is the only remaining backup for this functionality , and since the Ka @-@ band capability of one of the SDST transponders has already failed , ( and the other might have the same problem ) JPL decided to halt all Ka @-@ band demonstrations and hold the remaining capability in reserve . 
 By November 2013 , the MRO had passed 200 <unk> in the amount of science data returned . The data returned by the mission alone is more than three times the total data returned via NASA 's Deep Space Network for all the other missions managed by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the past 10 years . 
 = = = Propulsion and attitude control = = = 
 The spacecraft uses a 1 @,@ 175 l ( 258 imp gal ; 310 US gal ) fuel tank filled with 1 @,@ 187 kg ( 2 @,@ 617 lb ) of hydrazine <unk> . Fuel pressure is regulated by adding pressurized helium gas from an external tank . Seventy percent of the propellant was used for orbital insertion , and it has enough propellant to keep functioning into the 2030s . 
 MRO has twenty rocket engine thrusters on board . Six large thrusters each produce 170 N ( 38 lbf ) of thrust for a total of 1 @,@ 020 N ( 230 lbf ) meant mainly for orbital insertion . These thrusters were originally designed for the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander . Six medium thrusters each produce 22 N ( 4 @.@ 9 lbf ) of thrust for trajectory correction maneuvers and attitude control during orbit insertion . Finally , eight small thrusters each produce 0 @.@ 9 N ( 0 @.@ 20 lbf ) of thrust for attitude control during normal operations . 
 Four reaction wheels are also used for precise attitude control during activities requiring a highly stable platform , such as high @-@ resolution imaging , in which even small motions can cause blurring of the image . Each wheel is used for one axis of motion . The fourth ( skewed ) wheel is a backup in case one of the other three wheels fails . Each wheel weighs 10 kg ( 22 lb ) and can be spun as fast as 100 Hz or 6 @,@ 000 rpm . 
 In order to determine the spacecraft 's orbit and facilitate maneuvers , sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter 's frame . Two star trackers , digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars , provide NASA with full , three @-@ axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude . A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit ( <unk> ) , provided by Honeywell , measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non @-@ gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity . Each <unk> is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring @-@ laser gyroscopes . These systems are all critically important to MRO , as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high @-@ quality pictures that the mission requires . It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft , so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations .

 An article in the journal Science in September 2009 , reported that some new craters on Mars have excavated relatively pure water ice . After being exposed , the ice gradually fades as it sublimates away . These new craters were found and dated by the CTX camera , and the identification of the ice was confirmed with the Compact Imaging Spectrometer ( CRISM ) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) . The ice was found in a total of five locations . Three of the locations are in the <unk> quadrangle . These locations are 55 @.@ 57 ° N 150 @.@ 62 ° E ﻿ / 55 @.@ 57 ; 150 @.@ 62 ; 43 @.@ 28 ° N 176 @.@ 9 ° E ﻿ / 43 @.@ 28 ; 176 @.@ 9 ; and 45 ° N 164 @.@ 5 ° E ﻿ / 45 ; 164 @.@ 5 .

 = = = Ice in lobate debris aprons = = = 
 Radar results from SHARAD suggested that features termed lobate debris aprons ( LDAs ) contain large amounts of water ice . Of interest from the days of the Viking <unk> , these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs . They have a convex topography and a gentle slope ; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff . In addition , lobate debris aprons can show surface <unk> just as rock glaciers on the Earth . SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris ( i.e. rocks and dust ) ; a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed , suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation ( between the two reflections ) . Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies of the Mars Odyssey from orbit , water ice is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south ( high latitudes ) . 
 = = = Chloride deposits = = = 
 Using data from Mars Global Surveyor , Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , scientists have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals . Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters . The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over large areas of the Martian surface . Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution . Carbonates , sulfates , and silica should precipitate out ahead of them . <unk> and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface . Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms . Furthermore , such areas could preserve traces of ancient life .

 In 2009 , a group of scientists from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water . Different types of clays ( also called phyllosilicates ) were found in many locations . The <unk> identified included aluminum smectite , iron / magnesium smectite , kaolinite , <unk> , and chlorite . Rocks containing carbonate were found around the <unk> basin . Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed . Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates . The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris . Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite , alunite , hematite , opal , and gypsum . Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow .

 Concealing @-@ Coloration in the Animal Kingdom : An Exposition of the Laws of Disguise Through Color and Pattern ; Being a Summary of Abbott H. Thayer ’ s Discoveries is a book published ostensibly by Gerald H. Thayer in 1909 , and revised in 1918 , but in fact a collaboration with and completion of his father Abbott Handerson Thayer 's major work . 
 The book , illustrated artistically by Abbott Thayer , sets out the controversial thesis that all animal coloration has the evolutionary purpose of camouflage . Thayer rejected Charles Darwin 's theory of sexual selection , arguing in words and paintings that even such conspicuous animal features as the peacock 's tail or the brilliant pink of flamingoes or roseate spoonbills were effective as camouflage in the right light . 
 The book introduced the concepts of disruptive coloration to break up an object 's outlines , of masquerade , as when a butterfly mimics a leaf , and especially of countershading , where an animal 's tones make it appear flat by concealing its self @-@ shadowing . 
 The book was criticised by big game hunter and politician Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that every aspect of animal coloration is effective as camouflage . Roosevelt 's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer 's thesis and the book 's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence . The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott , who valued Thayer 's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage . Thayer was mocked to a greater or lesser extent by other scientific reviewers . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Abbott Thayer ( 1849 @-@ 1921 ) was an American artist , known for his figure paintings , often of " virginal , spiritual beauty " , which were sometimes , as in his most famous painting , Angel , modeled on his children . He had studied at an art school in Paris , but unlike James McNeill Whistler he returned to the United States . Along with seeking timeless beauty , Thayer also became obsessed with nature , which he felt contained the pure beauty that he was seeking to capture in his paintings . 
 Thayer 's close observation led him to notice what scientists such as Edward Bagnall Poulton were just beginning to describe . This was that many animals were " painted " the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity in figures . A canvas is flat , and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat . To make a body appear to have depth and solidity , the artist paints in shadows on the body itself . The top of an animal 's back , facing the sky , remains bright , while it must become darker towards its underside . Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading , nature could and did make animals appear flat . He was so passionate about this " concealing coloration " theory that he called it his " second child " . Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars , but he had not realized that the phenomenon was widespread , and he championed Thayer 's theory in a 1902 article in Nature . 
 However , Thayer was not a scientist , and he lacked a scientist 's inclination to attempt to test and disprove every aspect of a new theory . Instead , Thayer came to believe that the theory belonged to artists , with their trained perception : " The whole basis of picture making consists in contrasting against its background every object in the picture " , he argued . 
 The obsession led him to deny that animals could be colored for other reasons : for protection by mimicry , as the naturalist Henry Walter Bates had proposed , supported by many examples of butterflies from South America ; through sexual selection , as Charles Darwin had argued , again supported by many observations . The unbalanced treatment of animal coloration in Concealing @-@ Coloration in the Animal Kingdom encapsulates Thayer 's partial understanding and his rejection of other theories . 
 The same obsession led him , later , to attempt to persuade the military to adopt camouflage based on his ideas , traveling to London in 1915 , and writing " passionate letters " to the Assistant Secretary to the US Navy , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , in 1917 .

 Gerald Thayer describes the book as having two main purposes : to present Abbott Thayer 's research to naturalists ; and to make the subject available to a wider readership . 
 The book 's list of contents reveals Thayer 's heavy reliance on bird examples , filling 16 of the 27 chapters . Other vertebrates occupy 5 chapters . Insects receive 3 chapters , of which two are dedicated to lepidoptera - one to caterpillars , one to adult butterflies and moths ; the remaining one devotes 14 pages to all other insects , starting with <unk> including the leaf @-@ mimic grasshoppers . 
 = = = Illustrations = = = 
 The book has 16 colored plates of paintings by Abbott Thayer and Richard S. Meryman , including the well known frontispiece " Peacock amid foliage " , and the heavily criticised images of wood ducks , blue jays against snow , roseate spoonbills and flamingoes " at dawn or sunset , and the skies they picture " . The last 4 colored plates are of caterpillars . Gerald Thayer claims that " The illustrations are of particular importance , inasmuch as they include what we believe to be the first scientific paintings ever published of animals lighted as they actually are in nature " . 
 There are 140 black and white figures , mainly photographs with a few diagrams and drawings . Half the photographs are of birds . The photographs are from various sources , " gleaned from periodicals , or secured by special advertising . "

 Chapter 1 sets out the " long @-@ ignored laws " of " protective coloration " , an act which " has waited for an artist " to perceive . Thayer explains the principle of countershading with a diagram , arguing that a naive view of being " colored like their surroundings " does not explain how animal camouflage works . He acknowledges the prior work of Edward Bagnall Poulton ( The Colours of Animals , 1890 ) in identifying countershading in caterpillars , quoting some passages where Poulton describes how larvae and pupae can appear flat . Countershading is named as " the law which underlies protective coloration " , rather than as one of several principles . 
 Chapter 2 defines the book 's terms , equating " mimicry " with " protective resemblance " , so that it becomes a form of " protective or disguising coloration " . Thayer distinguishes " concealing @-@ colors " ( mainly countershading for " invisibility " ) from the " other " branch of protective coloration , which includes most kinds of mimicry , for " deceptive visibility " . The two branches are then named " obliterative coloration " and " mimicry " . Mimicry is dismissed as playing " a very insignificant part " in the " higher orders " , i.e. it is limited mainly to invertebrates . A fine photograph of a " white fowl , lacking counter @-@ shading , against a flat white cloth " demonstrates that camouflage is more than color matching . Thayer then gives several examples of what he considers countershaded animals . 
 Chapter 3 describes the combination of markings with countershading , with photographs of a model bird and of a woodcock , showing how in the correct position these are well camouflaged with " wonderful obliterative picture @-@ patterns " , but wrongly positioned or upside down ( with a photograph of a dead woodcock ) they are easily visible . 
 Chapters 4 and 5 illustrate more " picture @-@ patterns " in well camouflaged birds including Wilson 's snipe and whip @-@ poor @-@ will ( nighthawks and <unk> , <unk> ) . Thayer describes these as showing " obliteration , or merging with the background " but that their patterning is close to mimicry as they " perfectly " resemble objects such as " a stone or mossy log " . 
 Chapter 6 argues that some birds such as the ruffed grouse have patterns designed as camouflage against distant backgrounds , with a painting of a bird against a forest background as evidence . " The bird is in plain sight , but invisible " . For the great horned owl , a piece of the wing is " super @-@ imposed " on a photograph of a wood , " to show how closely the owl 's patterns reproduce such a forest interior . " The text describes the owl as having " a highly developed forest @-@ vista pattern " . Chapter 7 similarly argues for grass and heather patterns on " terrestrial " ( as opposed to arboreal ) birds . The disruptively patterned white @-@ tailed ptarmigan is shown in " a very remarkable photograph " by Evan Lewis . Thayer attempts to classify the camouflage types , for example writing 
 The principal feature of the pattern made by grasses over ground is a more or less intricate lace @-@ work of crisscrossing , light @-@ colored , linear forms , some straight , some curled and twisted , relieving with varying intensity against dark . 
 Chapter 8 continues the theme with " scansorial " or tree climbing birds . Chapter 9 claims that " obliterative shading , pure and simple , is the rule among the Shore Birds " such as sandpipers and curlew . Chapter 10 describes the " background @-@ picturing " of bitterns , birds which live in reedbeds , where 
 The light stripes on the bill were repeated and continued by the light stripes on the sides of the head and neck , and together they imitated very closely the look of separate , bright reed @-@ stems ; while the dark stripes pictured reeds in shadow , or the shadowed interstices between the stems . 
 Chapter 11 argues ( in a way that was heavily criticised when the book appeared , see below ) that water birds , some of them highly conspicuous like the jacana and notoriously the male wood duck , are colored for camouflage : " The beautifully contrasted black @-@ and @-@ white bars on the flanks of the Wood Duck ( Aix sponsa ) are ripple pictures , and as potent [ as camouflage ] , in their place , as the most elaborate markings of land birds " . Chapter 12 argues that the " pure white " of ocean birds such as gulls and terns equally functions as camouflage . Thayer admits that these often appear conspicuous , but argues that against varied backgrounds , white offers " the greatest average inconspicuousness against the ocean " ( his italics ) or against the bright sky when seen from below . 
 Chapter 13 analyses " markings and patterns in detail , starting with a color plate that shows the effect of disruptive patterning , which Thayer calls " strong ' secant ' and ' ruptive ' patterns " . Using a photograph of an oystercatcher at its nest by Cherry and Richard Kearton , Thayer argues that the boldly marked bird ( mainly black above , white below , with red beak ) is both countershaded and " <unk> " patterned . Chapter 14 discusses the barred markings of hawks and owls , with further fine plates of photographs by the <unk> of disruptively patterned waders and their cryptic chicks . The ringed plover is described as having " eye @-@ masking and ' obliterative ' shadow @-@ and @-@ hole @-@ picturing pattern " . 
 Chapter 15 describes the leg feather patterns of hawks , asserting that these " pantaloons " mask these " dangerous talons " to facilitate attack , just as their beaks , like the beaks of wading birds , are masked paradoxically with " gaudy colors " . Chapter 16 controversially claims that the iridescent colours of , for example , the speculum wing patch of the mallard and other ducks is " obliterative " , the " brightly changeable plumage " serving to camouflage the wearer in varying conditions . Thayer asserts that such brightly colored species as the European kingfisher and the purple gallinule are camouflaged : 
 <unk> should perhaps be considered second only to obliterative [ counter ] shading as a factor in the <unk> of birds ; its universality attests its value . 
 Chapter 17 argues that bird plumage has " many devices " to conceal the animals ' outlines . Even the " enormously developed feather @-@ appendages " of the birds of paradise are argued to provide camouflage in this way . Sexual display is mentioned but dismissed as not being the sole reason for the colours , outlines and patterns of the male birds . Chapter 18 briefly discusses mimicry , before returning to " the evident paramount importance of the obliterative function " , this time of the " brilliant , <unk> " heads of hummingbirds . The one case that Thayer admits is mimetic is the goatsucker of Trinidad , a plant mimic that perches " by day and night " on a tree stump or branch , where the purpose of the mimicry is crypsis . Chapter 19 concludes the description of bird plumage , claiming that birds from the tropical forests to the " snowy north " , including woodpeckers and the blue jay are all " colored for inconspicuousness " . 
 Chapters 20 , 21 , and 22 discuss the " disguising @-@ coloration " of mammals , including the whales which " are equipped with a full obliterative shading of surface @-@ colors " . The bats are admitted to have very little in the way of countershading , unlike all other families in the order . Thayer notes that a few species with strong defences such as hedgehogs , porcupines , echidnas , pangolins and " some armadillos " are exceptions , along with some beasts which " enjoy a like security by virtue of their gigantic bigness " , including the elephants , rhinoceroses , and hippopotami . The domestic hare is shown to be strongly countershaded with a pair of photographs " from life " , one sitting and one " laid on its back , outdoors , so that the obliterative shading is reversed " . Chapter 21 asserts that zebras " must be extraordinarily inconspicuous " against vegetation , a claim derided by Theodore Roosevelt ( see below ) . Chapter 22 addresses the problem of the " few [ beasts ] whose bold , clear patterns seem to defy that foremost obliterative law . " These include the skunks , the African <unk> ( striped polecat ) and the <unk> ( stink badger ) of Java , which all have dark underparts and white upperparts . Thayer dismisses the aposematism of these species , instead asserting the effectiveness of their camouflage : 
 <unk> , <unk> , and the rest , long believed by naturalists to be colored for warning conspicuousness ( <unk> of their foul defensive equipment ) , have , in fact , the universal obliterative coloration . 
 Several photographs using stuffed skins of skunks attempt to prove the point . The chapter goes on to claim that roseate spoonbills , flamingoes , and prongbuck are all obliteratively colored . The raccoon 's head resembles " the end of a hollow stump or log " , while its tail is said to be " distractive " , the strong banding serving like an eyespot to divert the attention of a predator to the tail rather than the head while the animal dives down a hole . But Thayer is unable to resist arguing that when " quiet , their tail @-@ bands act obliteratively " . 
 Chapter 23 looks at fish , admitting frankly that the authors " know next to nothing about fishes from the standpoint of systematic science " , but saying that they have gathered a " trustworthy general estimate " of their " disguising coloration " from market stalls , museums and books . Many fish are countershaded . The bioluminescence of some deep sea fish and other animals is seen as a problem as it is not " obliterative " ; the possibility of counterillumination camouflage is not considered . 
 Chapter 24 considers the reptiles and amphibians . These are noted to be predominantly green , often with " ruptive " patterns . Plate 11 treats a " Copperhead snake on dead leaves " , the caption explaining that " This is a bona @-@ fide study of a Copperhead Snake among dead leaves — its normal situation . " There is a full @-@ page sheet of card , cut out in the shape of the snake lying on a bed of leaves . When this is folded back , a painting by Rockwell Kent and Abbott Thayer " ( Also G.H. Thayer and E.B. Thayer ) " is revealed , showing the snake 's outline powerfully disrupted by its zigzag pattern among the light and shade of the leaf litter . 
 Chapter 24 mentions that some terrestrial salamanders " are rather brightly pied with black and whitish , or yellow " , while other amphibians " are extremely gaudy — wearing much bright blue , green , purple and sometimes red . " It suggests that some of these markings are " baits or targets " , again to distract predators from striking at the head , while the salamander markings are left as a problem as the authors " know too little about the habits " of these species . It is admitted that " the disguising coloration of many of them is very obscure . " 
 The final chapters 25 , 26 and 27 turn to the insects . Chapter 25 looks at caterpillars , with , as Poulton had earlier noted , convincing examples of countershading . Plate 13 shows caterpillars including the " larger @-@ spotted beech @-@ leaf @-@ edge caterpillar " both in position " passing for a part of the leaf on which it is feeding " , strongly cryptic and flattened like a slightly browning leaf , and inverted , when its countershading makes it appear conspicuously solid . Chapter 26 looks at other insects and spiders , noting the " famous leaf @-@ mimicking Kallima <unk> " butterfly of India , but again claiming that even conspicuous butterflies are in fact " obliterative " . Eye @-@ spots are mentioned , but instead of noting that these might be distractive , they are asserted to be " dazzling " , appearing as holes , and thus functioning as disruptive camouflage . 
 The text ends with a paragraph that asks if it is " any wonder that artists should feel keen delight in looking at the disguising @-@ patterns worn by animals ? " These are " triumphs of art " , where the student can find " in epitome , painted and perfected by Nature herself " , the typical color and pattern scheme of each kind of landscape . 
 Color and pattern , line and shading , — all are true beyond the power of man to imitate , or even fully to discern . 
 An appendix provides extracts from a " very remarkable addition to our subject " , Poulton 's 1907 observations of color change in chameleons .

 = = = Contemporary reviews = = = 
 = = = = Theodore Roosevelt = = = = 
 The Thayers ' views were vigorously criticised in 1911 by Theodore Roosevelt , an experienced big game hunter and naturalist familiar with animal camouflage as well as a politician , in a lengthy article in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History . 
 Roosevelt begins by writing that the Thayers expounded the " doctrine " of concealing coloration " in its extreme form " , which he thought had been " pushed to such a fantastic extreme and to include such wild absurdities as to call for the application of common sense thereto . " Then , " to show the sweeping claims made " , Roosevelt quotes verbatim eight passages from the book , one after the other , 500 words in all , the last one being " ' All patterns and colors whatsoever of all animals that ever prey or are preyed upon are under certain normal circumstances obliterative . ' " 
 He then observes that the Thayers ' claims , both in " pictures " and in writing , are not so much arguments as plain " misstatements of facts , or wild guesses put forward as facts . " He puts these down to enthusiasm rather than dishonesty , and as an example critiques the picture ( the book 's frontispiece ) of the peacock in a tree 
 with the blue sky showing through the leaves in just sufficient quantity here and there to warrant the author @-@ artists explaining that the wonderful blue hues of the peacock 's neck are obliterative because they make it fade into the sky . 
 This , Roosevelt writes , would be an extremely rare sight in nature . Worse , the female ( the peahen ) would , he argues , be conspicuous in those conditions . The Thayers have chosen a blue sky to argue that the peacock is camouflaged ; but then they choose a white sky to allow the prongbuck 's white rump to fade into that background . This , Roosevelt argues , is so dishonest that an engineer who constructed a report in that way would at once be dismissed , and the directors of a corporation who " tried to float shares on the strength of such a report " would be liable to " prosecution for fraud " . 
 Roosevelt had recently returned from his African safari , having seen , admired and shot large numbers of animals . He was scornful of Thayer 's theories , which he described as " phantasmagoria " , and the writer as " a well meaning and ill @-@ balanced enthusiast " . Thayer 's suggestion that the white markings on the body of the harnessed bush buck are meant to resemble " flecks of water shine " is dismissed as wild , with the observation from personal experience that bush buck spend little time in watery places , while the " <unk> or lechwe , which lack the spots " spend more . Roosevelt does not refrain from harshness : he describes the camouflaged flamingo theory as " probably the wildest " of " all the wild absurdities to which Mr. Thayer has committed himself " . 
 = = = = The Auk = = = = 
 Thayer was also roundly criticised in 1911 by herpetologist Thomas Barbour and conservation pioneer John C. Phillips in The Auk , where they wrote that 
 Mr. Thayer , however , along with most other enthusiasts in a field with which they can be but partially familiar , has gone too far and claimed too much . 
 Barbour and Phillips warmly welcome Thayer 's work on countershading " which he has so excellently demonstrated " ; they " protest gently " against his " slightly patronizing " treatment of the camouflage of birds like woodcock and grouse " which has been known and recognized since ornithology began " ; and go on to the attack on his claims for the flamingo : 
 <unk> hardly need this carefully arranged protection that is of value but a few minutes each day , and to be sure we see the curious cloud arrangement depicted on but very few days of the year – if ever . 
 They are equally critical of his roseate spoonbill , observing that the painting looks nothing like " actual skins of the species " . As for the wood duck , they point out its [ sexual ] " dimorphism of plumage " , and that the male spends the summer in eclipse plumage , while he is 
 most brilliant during the late autumn , winter , and early spring , when their surroundings are of a dead and monotonous color . Hence , if we attributed any protective importance to such color patterns , we should be inclined to consider this of distinct disadvantage . " 
 Barbour and Phillips note that Thayer " in his enthusiasm , has ignored or glossed over [ sexual dimorphism ] with an artistic haze . " They also question whether every animal needs protection . " By skilful <unk> we are shown how anything and everything may be rendered inconspicuous , " citing the skunk among other boldly black and white animals with both the skunk coloration and the " well @-@ known skunk smell " . They conclude by writing that they have " purposely omitted calling special attention to the strong features of the book " and that they have no axe to grind . 
 = = = = The Making of Species = = = = 
 The English ornithologists Douglas Dewar and Frank Finn write in their book The Making of Species that Thayer " seems to be of opinion that all animals are cryptically or , as he calls it , <unk> or obliteratively coloured " . They note that Edward Bagnall Poulton had written approvingly of Thayer , and that Thayer had asserted that almost all animals were countershaded . They agree that countershading exists , but to his suggestion that it is universal " we feel sorely tempted to poke fun at him " , and promptly ask any reader who agrees with Thayer that every animal is countershaded to look at a flock of rooks at sunset . They admit that camouflage is in general advantageous , but point out that the different plumages of seasonally and sexually dimorphic birds cannot all be explained as camouflage , considering the conspicuous colours of the male birds : 
 Now , if it be a matter of life @-@ and @-@ death importance to a bird to be protectively coloured , we should expect the <unk> coloured cock birds to be far less numerous than the dull @-@ plumaged hens ... [ but ] cock birds ... appear to be as least as numerous as the hens . Nor can it be said that this is due to their more secretive habits . 
 They counter the further argument that hens may be in more danger than cocks , through sitting on nests , by observing that in many dimorphic species , the showy cock shares the work of incubating the eggs . 
 = = = Modern assessment = = = 
 = = = = Hugh Cott = = = = 
 The zoologist and camouflage expert Hugh Cott , in his 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals , writes that 
 The theory of concealing coloration has been brought to some discredit through the tendency of certain writers to be carried away from the facts by their own enthusiasm , and they have brought down storms of criticism which are sometimes misdirected against the theory itself ... Thus we find Thayer straining the theory to a fantastic extreme in an endeavour to make it cover almost every type of coloration in the animal kingdom . 
 Cott attacks Thayer 's comprehensive assertion that " all patterns and colors whatsoever ... are obliterative " , and continues more specifically with a detailed rebuttal of both the text and Thayer 's contrived paintings : 
 Unfortunately certain of Thayer 's explanations and illustrations misrepresent nature and are deceptive because they depend upon observations made under abnormal circumstances . 
 Cott then gives the examples of the peacock in the woods with the blue sky behind the neck ; the " flock of red <unk> matching a red sunset sky " , and the roseate spoonbill " whose pink plumage matches a pink cloud scheme " . He then lists the cases of the white flamingo , the skunk and the white rump of the prongbuck , quoting Roosevelt ( " The raven 's coloration is of course concealing if it is put into a coal scuttle " ) , notes " How unreasonable are extreme views like that adopted by Thayer " , and admits that criticisms of " certain of Thayer 's conclusions " are justified , before returning to the attack on those critics , robustly defending the " theory of protective and aggressive resemblance " . 
 More favourably , Cott explicitly recognises Thayer 's work on countershading , though granting Edward Bagnall Poulton 's partial anticipation with his work on the chrysalis of the purple emperor butterfly . Further , Cott quotes Thayer 's description of countershading , and Cott 's Figure 1 , of countershaded fish , is captioned " Diagrams illustrating Thayer 's principle of obliterative shading " . Implicitly , also , Cott follows Thayer in his Figure 3 " Larva of Eyed Hawk @-@ moth " in both " natural ( e.g. ' up @-@ side @-@ down ' ) " and " unnatural " positions ; in his Figure 5 drawing of the disruptive effect of the stripes and bold markings of woodcock chicks ( like Thayer 's Figure 81 ) ; in his Plate 7 , with ( just like Thayer 's Figure 7 ) a photograph of a white cock against a white background ; in his Figure 18 and front cover drawings of a copperhead snake lying on a bed of leaves , with and without its disruptive pattern ( like Thayer 's Plate 11 ) and so on . 
 = = = = John Endler and Peter Forbes = = = = 
 The evolutionary biologist John Endler , reviewing the topic of camouflage in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2006 , cites Thayer 's 1909 book three times : for disruption , with " conspicuous elements [ which ] distract the predator 's attention and break up the body outline , making detection of the prey difficult " ; for " masquerade , [ where ] the prey is detected as distinct from the visual background but not recognized as edible .. , for example by resembling a leaf " ; and for countershading , where " False gradients are common in animal colour patterns , leading to misleading appearance of shape , even when they do not disrupt the body outline " . Thayer is by far the earliest source used by Endler ; the only other early source he cites ( for disruption ) is Hugh Cott 's 1940 Adaptive Coloration in Animals . 
 The art and science writer Peter Forbes notes that Thayer became obsessed by the " flattening effect " of countershading , and that far from being a scientist , he was " an artist whose idealist fervour , edged by deep insecurity , led him to regard his findings less as discovery than as revelation . " Describing Concealing @-@ Coloration as a " magnum opus " , Forbes writes that by 1909 " Thayer 's prophetic intolerance was in full flood " , that he was overcompensating for his need for approval of his artwork , and that he failed to see that acceptance of ideas in science does not depend on " the vehemence with which they are expressed " . In Forbes 's view , Thayer was battling for the rights of artists over scientists , citing Thayer ( " it properly belongs to the realm of pictorial art " ) in evidence . Apart from Thayer 's " bizarre " flamingos , Forbes calls Thayer 's opposition to Batesian mimicry " extreme " . For Forbes , " Reading Thayer 's book today is a strange experience . He sets out with the idea that every single creature is perfectly camouflaged " , and then " tries to bludgeon his readers " into agreeing . Forbes is critical of Thayer 's rejection of warning coloration , quoting Thayer 's daughter Gladys as writing " My father 's special mission was tasting butterflies " ; Thayer apparently wanted to prove that mimicry was the wrong explanation as both model and mimic tasted the same .

 The philosopher and jazz musician David Rothenberg , in his 2012 book Survival of the Beautiful on the relationship between aesthetics and evolution , argues that while the Thayers ' book set out the principles of camouflage : " From observation of nature ... art contributed to the military needs of society " , Thayer , following Charles Darwin , was " swept up in the idea that every animal had evolved to perfectly live in its surroundings " , but was emotionally unable to accept the other " half " of Darwin 's view of animal coloration : 
 Thayer was quite troubled by Darwin 's whole notion of sexual selection to explain the evolution of taste and beauty ... On the contrary , all animal patterning can be explained by the need to remain .. hidden .. Even what appears garish , including the tail of the peacock , is in fact a sophisticated form of camouflage that can dupe even such a great scientist as Charles Darwin . 
 Rothenberg then discusses the Thayers ' account of the wood duck , which Rothenburg calls " our most garishly colored duck " . He explains that the Thayers believed they , " trained as artists " , had seen what earlier observers had missed : 
 The black and white patches and stripes are ' ripple pictures depicting motion and reflections in the water ' , all ingeniously evolved to hide the bird not by inconspicuousness but by ' disruptive conspicuousness ' .

 The Smithsonian American Art Museum 's website , describing the Thayers ' book as " controversial " , writes sceptically that 
 Even bright pink flamingoes would vanish against a similar colored sky at sunset or sunrise .

 = Tropical Storm Frances ( 1998 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Frances caused extensive flooding in Mexico and Texas in September 1998 . The sixth tropical cyclone and sixth named storm of the annual hurricane season , Frances developed from a low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico on September 8 . The cyclone moved northward through the western Gulf of Mexico , making landfall across the central Texas coastline before recurving across the Midwest through southeast Canada and New England . A large tropical cyclone for the Atlantic Basin , yet an average sized system by western Pacific standards , the storm produced heavy rains across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , Texas , western Louisiana and the Great Plains . 
 The interaction between developing Frances and Pacific Tropical Storm Javier produced torrential rainfall in southeastern Mexico , causing flooding that killed over 200 people and caused $ 63 million in damage . Coastal flooding overran the coasts of Louisiana and Texas , which worsened river flooding across the region . Federal disaster declarations were made for the states of Louisiana and Texas on September 23 for damage relating to this tropical cyclone . Damage totaled US $ 500 million ( 1998 dollars ) , mainly from flooding . There was one direct death and one indirect death associated with the tropical storm . Frances was the second tropical cyclone to hit Texas during the 1998 season , with Charley being the other .

 Before the storm formed , sea surface temperatures were above normal in the Bay of Campeche and tropical eastern Pacific Ocean . After Hurricane Earl developed and moved away from the region , a broad area of low pressure formed in the southwest Caribbean on September 4 . It moved to the northwest and slowly organized in the Gulf of Mexico , although a series of tropical waves prevented rapid development . By September 8 , there was a large area of convection located over the western Gulf of Mexico . That day , the system developed into Tropical Depression Six while 160 miles ( 260 km ) east @-@ southeast of Brownsville , Texas . Initially , the depression was large , without a well @-@ defined center of circulation . It more resembled a monsoon depression commonly seen in the Western Pacific Ocean and the Northern Indian Ocean . The depression drifted southward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Frances on September 9 . 
 Frances turned to the northwest and strengthened with warm water temperatures of 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) , weak vertical shear , and a large anticyclone aloft . Just before making landfall on Corpus Christi , Texas , the storm reached a peak of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) , and quickly weakened as it continued inland . Shortly after landfall , the storm executed a small loop before turning to the north and dissipating as a tropical cyclone on September 13 . The remnant low of Frances persisted another day , becoming a frontal wave over Iowa . This frontal wave moved across the Great Lakes and New England into the north Atlantic by the 16th .

 A tropical storm warning was issued for the Texas coast between High Island and Brownsville on the afternoon of the 8th . The next afternoon , the warning area was extended southward into northeast Mexico to Tampico . By the afternoon of the 10th , strong winds along the Louisiana coast led to an extension of the tropical storm warning eastward to the Pearl River . On the 11th , as Frances moved inland , tropical storm warnings were slowly lifted .

 Federal disaster declarations were made for the states of Louisiana and Texas on September 23 for damage relating to this tropical cyclone . Although there was little wind damage , Frances caused $ 500 million ( 1998 USD ) in damage , mostly from flooding . In addition , it killed one person . Several counties in Texas and Louisiana were declared disaster areas .

 Simultaneous to Frances 's development , Tropical Storm Javier was located to the west of Mexico in the Pacific , although its moisture produced an area of thunderstorms that extended to the east toward southeastern Mexico . The interaction between the depression that became Frances and Javier produced three days of heavy rainfall along the Sierra Madre de Chiapas . On September 6 , a station named Guadalupe Victoria recorded 15 @.@ 79 in ( 401 mm ) of rainfall . The highest rainfall total in the country was 44 @.@ 06 in ( 1 @,@ 119 mm ) at Escuintla , Chiapas . In the period from 1981 to 2010 , this was the highest rainfall total in Chiapas related to a tropical cyclone . 
 About one @-@ third of the population of Chiapas , or about 800 @,@ 000 people , was directly affected by the flooding , most significantly in Motozintla and Pijijiapan . In Motozintla , near Mexico 's border with Chiapas , a two @-@ day rainfall total of 12 in ( 305 mm ) produced flash floods and mudslides . The rainfall total represented about 36 % of the town 's average annual precipitation . About 600 homes were destroyed in the town alone , and there were 30 fatalities . The rains caused 36 river basins to exceed their banks . Following the floods , officials in Motozintla created a channel to divert flooding . Throughout Chiapas , the floods damaged or destroyed 40 bridges , and there was damage to Mexican Federal Highway 200 along the Pacific coast ; this interrupted travel for several weeks . About 16 @,@ 000 houses were damaged , forcing about 25 @,@ 000 people in government shelters . The floods affected 51 @,@ 159 ha ( 126 @,@ 420 acres ) of croplands . Overall , damage was estimated at $ 63 million ( 1998 USD ) , representing Mexico 's worst natural disaster since the 1985 Mexico City earthquake . Along Sierra Madre de Chiapas , the disaster was considered a 1 in 50 year event . There were at least 229 deaths , although a government report on the flooding indicated there were over 1000 people killed or missing . After the storm , the Mexican government established a study to determine the cause and the impact of the flooding .

 Though on the outskirts of the storm , Tropical Storm Frances dropped 10 to 15 inches ( 250 to 380 mm ) of rain across southwest Louisiana , and over 23 inches ( 580 mm ) of rainfall near New Orleans , Louisiana . This rainfall helped relieve drought conditions . Along the coast , the system caused a storm surge of 5 @.@ 1 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) in Cameron , the worst experienced along the coast of southwest Louisiana since Hurricane Carla . The storm surge swept away five houses , destroyed a fishing pier , and submerged Grand Isle . A tornado in the outer bands of the storm killed one person in Lafourche Parish , while six others were injured . At least eight tornadoes were witnessed statewide , with seven touching down across Acadiana . In addition , the storm caused an indirect death in the New Orleans area in an automobile <unk> m Also , two Pacific Coast League Playoff games involving the 1998 Triple A baseball champion New Orleans Zephyrs were cancelled due to the rain from Francis , and a third almost got called off , but thanks to the assistance from Zephyr Field ground crews and the Panther Helicopters , the Third game went on as planned , and the Zephyrs won 2 @-@ 1 , Sending them to the Pacific coast League Championship series

The lowest pressure reported from a land station was 29 @.@ 33 inches of mercury ( 993 hPa ) at Rockport , Texas . Three tornadoes touched down across the Lone Star State , at Caney Creek , La Porte , and Galveston . A major disaster declaration was issued for Brazoria , Galveston , and Harris counties . 
 Tropical Storm Frances caused significant amounts of flooding across southeastern Texas , with a peak of 21 @.@ 46 inches ( 545 mm ) in Houston , Texas metropolitan area . Severe flooding was also reported in Harris County and Houston . More than 1 @,@ 400 homes and businesses in and around Houston were either damaged or destroyed by the floods . In addition , three main highways in Houston were washed out , leaving many motorists stranded . 
 Sections of the Middle Texas coast , closer to the point of landfall , and the Golden Triangle of southeast Texas reported over 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of rainfall as well , resulting in significant flood damage . Roads and bridges were submerged near Corpus Christi . Flooding was also reported along the San Bernard River where several roads and a subdivision was flooded . The flooding also disrupted barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum facility . 
 Coastal flooding occurred well in advance of the cyclone 's landfall . A storm surge of 5 @.@ 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) was measured at Sabine Pass , Texas and 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) was measured at the Matagorda Locks . <unk> 's pier and San Luis Pass pier were severely damaged . Coastal flooding worsened backwater flooding in area rivers since their waters were blocked from flowing southeast into the Gulf of Mexico . Sabine Pass was cut off from the mainland for a week , until Hermine 's passage to the east eased coastal flooding conditions . 
 = England in the Middle Ages = 
 England in the Middle Ages concerns the history of England during the medieval period , from the end of the 5th century through to the start of the Early Modern period in 1485 . When England emerged from the collapse of the Roman Empire , the economy was in tatters and many of the towns abandoned . After several centuries of Germanic immigration , new identities and cultures began to emerge , developing into predatory kingdoms that competed for power . A rich artistic culture flourished under the Anglo @-@ Saxons , producing epic poems such as Beowulf and sophisticated metalwork . The Anglo @-@ Saxons converted to Christianity in the 7th century and a network of monasteries and convents were built across England . In the 8th and 9th centuries England faced fierce Viking attacks , and the fighting lasted for many decades , establishing Wessex as the most powerful kingdom and promoting the growth of an English identity . Despite repeated crises of succession and a Danish seizure of power at the start of the 11th century , by the 1060s England was a powerful , centralised state with a strong military and successful economy . 
 The Norman invasion of England in 1066 led to the defeat and replacement of the Anglo @-@ Saxon elite with Norman and French nobles and their supporters . William the Conqueror and his successors took over the existing state system , repressing local revolts and controlling the population through a network of castles . The new rulers introduced a feudal approach to governing England , eradicating the practice of slavery but creating a much wider body of unfree labourers called serfs . The position of women in society changed as laws regarding land and lordship shifted . England 's population more than doubled during the 12th and 13th centuries , fuelling an expansion of the towns , cities and trade , helped by warmer temperatures across Northern Europe . A new wave of monasteries and friaries were established , while ecclesiastical reforms led to tensions between successive kings and archbishops . Despite developments in England 's governance and legal system , infighting between the Anglo @-@ Norman elite resulted in multiple civil wars and the loss of Normandy . 
 The 14th century in England saw the Great Famine and the Black Death , catastrophic events that killed around half of England 's population , throwing the economy into chaos and undermining the old political order . Social unrest followed , in the form of the Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 , while the changes in the economy resulted in the emergence of a new class of gentry , and the nobility began to exercise power through a system termed bastard feudalism . Nearly 1 @,@ 500 villages were deserted by their inhabitants and many men and women sought new opportunities in the towns and cities . New technologies were introduced , and England produced some of the great medieval philosophers and natural scientists . English kings in the 14th and 15th centuries laid claim to the French throne , resulting in the Hundred Years ' War . At times England enjoyed huge military success , with the economy buoyed by profits from the international wool and cloth trade , but by 1450 the country was in crisis , facing military failure in France and an ongoing recession . More social unrest broke out , followed by the Wars of the Roses , fought between rival factions in the English nobility . Henry VII 's victory in 1485 typically marks the end of the Middle Ages in England and the start of the Early Modern period . 
 = = Political history = = 
 = = = Early Middle Ages ( 600 – 1066 ) = = = 
 At the start of the Middle Ages , England was a part of Britannia , a former province of the Roman Empire . The English economy had once been dominated by imperial Roman spending on a large military establishment , which in turn helped to support a complex network of towns , roads , and villas . At the end of the 4th century , however , Roman forces had been largely withdrawn , and the English economy collapsed . Germanic immigrants began to arrive in increasing numbers during the 5th century , initially peacefully , establishing small farms and settlements . New political and social identities emerged , including an Anglian culture in the east of England and a Saxon culture in the south , with local groups establishing regiones , small polities ruled over by powerful families and individuals . By the 7th century , some rulers , including those of Wessex , East Anglia , Essex , and Kent , had begun to term themselves kings , living in villa regalis , royal centres , and collecting tribute from the surrounding regiones ; these kingdoms are often referred to as the Heptarchy . 
 In the 7th century , the kingdom of Mercia rose to prominence under the leadership of King Penda . Mercia invaded neighbouring lands until it loosely controlled around 50 regiones covering much of England . Mercia and the remaining kingdoms , led by their warrior elites , continued to compete for territory throughout the 8th century . Massive earthworks , such as the defensive dyke built by Offa of Mercia , helped to defend key frontiers and towns . In 789 , however , the first Scandinavian raids on England began ; these Viking attacks grew in number and scale until in 856 the Danish <unk> here or Great Army , invaded England , captured York and defeated the kingdom of East Anglia . Mercia and Northumbria fell in 875 and 876 , and Alfred of Wessex was driven into internal exile in 878 . 
 However , Alfred eventually won a sequence of victories against the Danes , exploiting the fear of the Viking threat to raise large numbers of men and using a network of defended towns called burhs to defend his territory and mobilise royal resources . Suppressing internal opposition to his rule , Alfred contained the invaders within a region known as the Danelaw and confirmed the kings of Wessex as the rulers of the <unk> , all of the English . Wessex expanded further north into Mercia and the Danelaw , and by the 950s and the reigns of Eadred and Edgar , York was finally permanently retaken from the Danes . Punitive raids into neighbouring areas , including Wales and Northumbria , followed as the kingdom flexed its new military power . 
 With the death of Edgar , however , the royal succession became problematic . Æthelred took power in 978 following the murder of his brother Edward , but England was then invaded by Sweyn Forkbeard , the son of a Danish king . Attempts to bribe Sweyn not to attack using danegeld payments failed , and he took the throne in 1013 . Swein 's son , Cnut , liquidated many of the older English families following his seizure of power in 1016 . Æthelred 's son , Edward the Confessor , had survived in exile in Normandy and returned to claim the throne in 1042 . Edward was childless , and the succession again became a concern . England became dominated by the Godwin family , who had taken advantage of the Danish killings to acquire huge wealth . When Edward died in 1066 , Harold Godwinson claimed the throne , defeating his rival Norwegian claimant , Harald Hardrada , at the battle of Stamford Bridge . 
 = = = High Middle Ages ( 1066 – 1272 ) = = = 
 In 1066 , William , the Duke of Normandy , took advantage of the English succession crisis to invade . With an army of Norman followers and mercenaries , he defeated Harold at the battle of Hastings and rapidly occupied the south of England . William used a network of castles to control the major centres of power , granting extensive lands to his main Norman followers and co @-@ opting or eliminating the former Anglo @-@ Saxon elite . Major revolts followed , which William suppressed before intervening in the north @-@ east of England , establishing Norman control of York and devastating the region . Some Norman lords used England as a launching point for attacks into South and North Wales , spreading up the valleys to create new Marcher territories . By the time of William 's death in 1087 , England formed the largest part of an Anglo @-@ Norman empire , ruled over by a network of nobles with landholdings across England , Normandy , and Wales . England 's growing wealth was critical in allowing the Norman kings to project power across the region , including funding campaigns along the frontiers of Normandy . 
 Norman rule , however , proved unstable ; successions to the throne were contested , leading to violent conflicts between the claimants and their noble supporters . William II inherited the throne but faced revolts attempting to replace him with his older brother Robert or his cousin Stephen of Aumale . In 1100 , William II died while hunting . Despite Robert 's rival claims , his younger brother Henry I immediately seized power . War broke out , ending in Robert 's defeat at <unk> and his subsequent life imprisonment . Robert 's son Clito remained free , however , and formed the focus for fresh revolts until his death in 1128 . Henry 's only legitimate son , William , died aboard the White Ship disaster of 1120 , sparking a fresh succession crisis : Henry 's nephew , Stephen of Blois , claimed the throne in 1135 , but this was disputed by the Empress Matilda , Henry 's daughter . Civil war broke out across England and Normandy , resulting in a long period of warfare later termed the Anarchy . Matilda 's son , Henry , finally agreed to a peace settlement at Winchester and succeeded as king in 1154 . 
 Henry II was the first of the Angevin rulers of England , so @-@ called because he was also the Count of Anjou in Northern France . Henry had also acquired the huge duchy of Aquitaine by marriage , and England became a key part of a loose @-@ knit assemblage of lands spread across Western Europe , later termed the Angevin Empire . Henry reasserted royal authority and rebuilt the royal finances , intervening to claim power in Ireland and promoting the Anglo @-@ Norman colonisation of the country . Henry strengthened England 's borders with Wales and Scotland , and used the country 's wealth to fund a long @-@ running war with his rivals in France , but arrangements for his succession once again proved problematic . Several revolts broke out , led by Henry 's children who were eager to acquire power and lands , sometimes backed by France , Scotland and the Welsh princes . After a final confrontation with Henry , his son Richard succeeded to the throne in 1189 . 
 Richard spent his reign focused on protecting his possessions in France and fighting in the Third Crusade ; his brother , John , inherited England in 1199 but lost Normandy and most of Aquitaine after several years of war with France . John fought successive , increasingly expensive , campaigns in a bid to regain these possessions . John 's efforts to raise revenues , combined with his fractious relationships with many of the English barons , led to confrontation in 1215 , an attempt to restore peace through the signing of the Magna Carta , and finally the outbreak of the First Barons ' War . John died having fought the rebel barons and their French backers to a stalemate , and royal power was re @-@ established by barons loyal to the young Henry III . England 's power structures remained unstable and the outbreak of the Second Barons ' War in 1264 resulted in the king 's capture by Simon de Montfort . Henry 's son , Edward , defeated the rebel factions between 1265 and 1267 , restoring his father to power . 
 = = = Late Middle Ages ( 1272 – 1485 ) = = = 
 On becoming king , Edward I rebuilt the status of the monarchy , restoring and extending key castles that had fallen into disrepair . Uprisings by the princes of North Wales led to Edward mobilising a huge army , defeating the native Welsh and undertaking a programme of English colonisation and castle building across the region . Further wars were conducted in Flanders and Aquitaine . Edward also fought campaigns in Scotland , but was unable to achieve strategic victory , and the costs created tensions that nearly led to civil war . Edward II inherited the war with Scotland and faced growing opposition to his rule as a result of his royal favourites and military failures . The Despenser War of 1321 – 22 was followed by instability and the subsequent overthrow , and possible murder , of Edward in 1327 at the hands of his French wife , Isabella , and a rebel baron , Roger Mortimer . Isabella and Mortimer 's regime lasted only a few years before falling to a coup , led by Isabella 's son Edward III , in 1330 . 
 Like his grandfather , Edward III took steps to restore royal power , but during the 1340s the Black Death arrived in England . The losses from the epidemic , and the recurring plagues that followed it , had a major impact on events in England for many years to come . Meanwhile , Edward , under pressure from France in Aquitaine , made a challenge for the French throne . Over the next century , English forces fought many campaigns in a long @-@ running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years ' War . Despite the challenges involved in raising the revenues to pay for the war , Edward 's military successes brought an influx of plundered wealth to many parts of England and enabled substantial building work by the king . Many members of the English elite , including Edward 's son the Black Prince , were heavily involved in campaigning in France and administering the new continental territories . 
 Edward 's grandson , the young Richard II , faced political and economic problems , many resulting from the Black Death , including the Peasants ' Revolt that broke out across the south of England in 1381 . Over the coming decades , Richard and groups of nobles vied for power and control of policy towards France until Henry of Bolingbroke seized the throne with the support of parliament in 1399 . Ruling as Henry IV , he exercised power through a royal council and parliament , while attempting to enforce political and religious conformity . His son , Henry V , reinvigorated the war with France and came close to achieving strategic success shortly before his death in 1422 . Henry VI became king at the age of only nine months and both the English political system and the military situation in France began to unravel . 
 A sequence of bloody civil wars , later termed the Wars of the Roses , finally broke out in 1455 , spurred on by an economic crisis and a widespread perception of poor government . Edward IV , leading a faction known as the Yorkists , removed Henry from power in 1461 but by 1469 fighting recommenced as Edward , Henry , and Edward 's brother George , backed by leading nobles and powerful French supporters , vied for power . By 1471 Edward was triumphant and most of his rivals were dead . On his death , power passed to his brother Richard of Gloucester , who initially ruled on behalf of the young Edward V before seizing the throne himself as Richard III . The future Henry VII , aided by French and Scottish troops , returned to England and defeated Richard at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 , bringing an end to the majority of the fighting , although lesser rebellions against his Tudor dynasty would continue for several years afterwards .

 = = = = Early Middle Ages ( 600 – 1066 ) = = = = 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms were hierarchical societies , each based on ties of allegiance between powerful lords and their immediate followers . At the top of the social structure was the king , who stood above many of the normal processes of Anglo @-@ Saxon life and whose household had special privileges and protection . Beneath the king were thegns , nobles , the more powerful of which maintained their own courts and were termed ealdormen . The relationship between kings and their nobles was bound up with military symbolism and the ritual exchange of weapons and armour . Freemen , called churls , formed the next level of society , often holding land in their own right or controlling businesses in the towns . <unk> , peasants who worked land belonging to a thegn , formed a lower class still . The very lowest class were slaves , who could be bought and sold and who held only minimal rights . 
 The balance of power between these different groups changed over time . Early in the period , kings were elected by members of the late king 's council , but primogeniture rapidly became the norm for succession . The kings further bolstered their status by adopting Christian ceremonies and nomenclature , introducing ecclesiastical coronations during the 8th century and terming themselves " Christ 's deputy " by the 11th century . Huge estates were initially built up by the king , bishops , monasteries and thegns , but in the 9th and 10th centuries these were slowly broken up as a consequence of inheritance arrangements , marriage settlements and church purchases . In the 11th century , the royal position worsened further , as the ealdormen rapidly built up huge new estates , making them collectively much more powerful than the king — this contributed to the political instability of the final Anglo @-@ Saxon years . As time went by , the position of the churls deteriorated , as their rights were slowly eroded and their duties to their lords increased . 
 The kingdom of Wessex , which eventually laid claim to England as a whole , evolved a centralised royal administration . One part of this was the king 's council , the witenagemot , comprising the senior clergy , ealdormen , and some of the more important thegns ; the council met to advise the king on policy and legal issues . The royal household included officials , thegns and a secretariat of clergy which travelled with the king , conducting the affairs of government as it went . Under the Danish kings , a bodyguard of housecarls also accompanied the court . At a regional level , ealdormen played an important part in government , defence and taxation , and the post of sheriff emerged in the 10th century , administering local shires on behalf of an ealdorman . Anglo @-@ Saxon mints were tightly controlled by the kings , providing a high quality currency , and the whole country was taxed using a system called hidage . 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxon kings built up a set of written laws , issued either as statutes or codes , but these laws were never written down in their entirety and were always supplemented by an extensive oral tradition of customary law . In the early part of the period local assemblies called moots were gathered to apply the laws to particular cases ; in the 10th century these were replaced by hundred courts , serving local areas , and shire moots dealing with larger regions of the kingdom . Many churchmen and thegns were also given permission by the king to hold their own local courts . The legal system depended on a system of oaths , in which the value of different individuals swearing on behalf of the plaintiff or defendant varied according to their social status - the word of a companion of the king , for example , was worth twelve times that of a churl . If fines were imposed , their size similarly varied accord to the oath @-@ value of the individual . The Anglo @-@ Saxon authorities struggled to deal with the <unk> between families that emerged following violent killings , attempting to use a system of <unk> , a payment of blood money , as a way of providing an alternative to long @-@ running vendettas . 
 = = = = High Middle Ages ( 1066 – 1272 ) = = = = 
 Within twenty years of the Norman conquest , the former Anglo @-@ Saxon elite were replaced by a new class of Norman nobility , with around 8 @,@ 000 Normans and French settling in England . The new earls ( successors to the <unk> ) , sheriffs and church seniors were all drawn from their ranks . In many areas of society there was continuity , as the Normans adopted many of the Anglo @-@ Saxon governmental institutions , including the tax system , mints and the centralisation of law @-@ making and some judicial matters ; initially sheriffs and the hundred courts continued to function as before . The existing tax liabilities were captured in Domesday Book , produced in 1086 . 
 Changes in other areas soon began to be felt . The method of government after the conquest can be described as a feudal system , in that the new nobles held their lands on behalf of the king ; in return for promising to provide military support and taking an oath of allegiance , called homage , they were granted lands termed a fief or an honour . Major nobles in turn granted lands to smaller landowners in return for homage and further military support , and eventually the peasantry held land in return for local labour services , creating a web of loyalties and resources enforced in part by new <unk> courts . This system had been used in Normandy and concentrated more power in the king and the upper elite than the former Anglo @-@ Saxon system of government . The practice of slavery declined in the years after the conquest , as the Normans considered the practice backward and contrary to the teachings of the church . The more prosperous peasants , however , lost influence and power as the Normans made holding land more dependent on providing labour services to the local lord . They sank down the economic hierarchy , swelling the numbers of unfree villeins or serfs , forbidden to leave their manor or seek alternative employment . 
 At the centre of power , the kings employed a succession of clergy as chancellors , responsible for running the royal chancery , while the familia regis , the military household , emerged to act as a bodyguard and military staff . England 's bishops continued to form an important part in local administration , alongside the nobility . Henry I and Henry II both implemented significant legal reforms , extending and widening the scope of centralised , royal law ; by the 1180s , the basis for the future English common law had largely been established , with a standing law court in Westminster — an early Common Bench — and travelling judges conducting eyres around the country . King John extended the royal role in delivering justice , and the extent of appropriate royal intervention was one of the issues addressed in the Magna Carta of 1215 . The emerging legal system reinvigorated the institution of serfdom in the 13th century by drawing an increasingly sharp distinction between freemen and villeins . 
 Many tensions existed within the system of government . Royal <unk> and wealth stretched across England , and placed the king in a privileged position above even the most powerful of the noble elite . Successive kings , though , still needed more resources to pay for military campaigns , conduct building programmes or to reward their followers , and this meant exercising their feudal rights to interfere in the land @-@ holdings of nobles . This was contentious and a frequent issue of complaint , as there was a growing belief that land should be held by hereditary right , not through the favour of the king . Property and wealth became increasingly focused in the hands of a subset of the nobility , the great magnates , at the expense of the wider baronage , encouraging the breakdown of some aspects of local feudalism . As time went by , the Norman nobility intermarried with many of the great Anglo @-@ Saxon families , and the links with the Duchy began to weaken . By the late 12th century , mobilising the English barons to fight on the continent was proving difficult , and John 's attempts to do so ended in civil war . Civil strife re @-@ emerged under Henry III , with the rebel barons in 1258 – 59 demanding widespread reforms , and an early version of Parliament was summoned in 1265 to represent the rebel interests . 
 = = = = Late Middle Ages ( 1272 – 1485 ) = = = = 
 On becoming king in 1272 , Edward I reestablished royal power , overhauling the royal finances and appealing to the broader English elite by using Parliament to authorise the raising of new taxes and to hear petitions concerning abuses of local governance . This political balance collapsed under Edward II and savage civil wars broke out during the 1320s . Edward III restored order once more with the help of a majority of the nobility , exercising power through the exchequer , the common bench and the royal household . This government was better organised and on a larger scale than ever before , and by the 14th century the king 's formerly peripatetic chancery had to take up permanent residence in Westminster . Edward used Parliament even more than his predecessors to handle general administration , to legislate and to raise the necessary taxes to pay for the wars in France . The royal lands — and incomes from them — had diminished over the years , and increasingly frequent taxation was required to support royal initiatives . Edward held elaborate chivalric events in an effort to unite his supporters around the symbols of knighthood . The ideal of chivalry continued to develop throughout the 14th century , reflected in the growth of knightly orders ( including the Order of the Garter ) , grand tournaments and round table events . 
 Society and government in England in the early 14th century were challenged by the Great Famine and the Black Death . The economic and demographic crisis created a sudden surplus of land , undermining the ability of landowners to exert their feudal rights and causing a collapse in incomes from rented lands . Wages soared , as employers competed for a scarce workforce . Legislation was introduced to limit wages and to prevent the consumption of luxury goods by the lower classes , with prosecutions coming to take up most of the legal system 's energy and time . A poll tax was introduced in 1377 that spread the costs of the war in France more widely across the whole population . The tensions spilled over into violence in the summer of 1381 in the form of the Peasants ' Revolt ; a violent retribution followed , with as many as 7 @,@ 000 alleged rebels executed . A new class of gentry emerged as a result of these changes , renting land from the major nobility to farm out at a profit . The legal system continued to expand during the 14th century , dealing with an ever wider set of complex problems . 
 By the time that Richard II was deposed in 1399 , the power of the major noble magnates had grown considerably ; powerful rulers such as Henry IV would contain them , but during the minority of Henry VI they controlled the country . The magnates depended upon their income from rent and trade to allow them to maintain groups of paid , armed retainers , often sporting controversial livery , and buy support amongst the wider gentry ; this system has been dubbed bastard feudalism . Their influence was exerted both through the House of Lords at Parliament and through the king 's council . The gentry and wealthier townsmen exercised increasing influence through the House of Commons , opposing raising taxes to pay for the French wars . By the 1430s and 1440s the English government was in major financial difficulties , leading to the crisis of 1450 and a popular revolt under the leadership of Jack Cade . Law and order deteriorated , and the crown was unable to intervene in the factional fighting between different nobles and their followers . The resulting Wars of the Roses saw a savage escalation of violence between the noble leaderships of both sides : captured enemies were executed and family lands attainted . By the time that Henry VII took the throne in 1485 , England 's governmental and social structures had been substantially weakened , with whole noble lines extinguished . 
 = = = Women in society = = = 
 Medieval England was a patriarchal society and the lives of women were heavily influenced by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority . However , the position of women varied considerably according to various factors , including their social class ; whether they were unmarried , married , widowed or remarried ; and in which part of the country they lived . Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period , as women typically had more limited life @-@ choices , access to employment and trade , and legal rights than men . 
 In Anglo @-@ Saxon society , noblewomen enjoyed considerable rights and status , although the society was still firmly patriarchal . Some exercised power as abbesses , exerting widespread influence across the early English Church , although their wealth and authority diminished with the monastic reforms of the 9th century . Anglo @-@ Saxon queens began to hold lands in their own right in the 10th century and their households contributed to the running of the kingdom . Although women could not lead military forces , in the absence of their husbands some noblewomen led the defence of manors and towns . Most Anglo @-@ Saxon women , however , worked on the land as part of the agricultural community , or as brewers or bakers . 
 After the Norman invasion , the position of women in society changed . The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined , in part as a result of the development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system ; some women benefited from this , while others lost out . The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the 12th century , clarifying the right of free women to own property , but this did not necessarily prevent women from being forcibly remarried against their wishes . The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government . Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events , even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour . As in earlier centuries , most women worked in agriculture , but here roles became more clearly gendered , with ploughing and managing the fields defined as men 's work , for example , and dairy production becoming dominated by women . 
 The years after the Black Death left many women widows ; in the wider economy labour was in short supply and land was suddenly readily available . In rural areas peasant women could enjoy a better standard of living than ever before , but the amount of work being done by women may have increased . Many other women travelled to the towns and cities , to the point where they outnumbered men in some settlements . There they worked with their husbands , or in a limited number of occupations , including spinning , making clothes , victualling and as servants . Some women became full @-@ time ale brewers , until they were pushed out of business by the male @-@ dominated beer industry in the 15th century . Higher status jobs and apprenticeships , however , remained closed to women . As in earlier times , noblewomen exercised power on their estates in their husbands ' absence and again , if necessary , defended them in sieges and skirmishes . Wealthy widows who could successfully claim their rightful share of their late husband 's property could live as powerful members of the community in their own right . 
 = = = Identity = = = 
 An English cultural identity first emerged from the interaction of the Germanic immigrants of the 5th and 6th centuries and the indigenous Romano @-@ British inhabitants . Although early medieval chroniclers described the immigrants as Angles and Saxons , they came from a much wider area across Northern Europe , and represented a range of different ethnic groups . Over the 6th century , however , these different groups began to coalesce into stratified societies across England , roughly corresponding to the later Angle and Saxon kingdoms recorded by Bede in the 8th century . By the 9th century , the term the <unk> was being officially used to refer to a single English people , and promoted for propaganda purposes by chroniclers and kings to inspire resistance to the Danish invasions . 
 The Normans and French who arrived after the conquest saw themselves as different from the English . They had close family and economic links to the Duchy of Normandy , spoke Norman French and had their own distinctive culture . For many years , to be English was to be associated with military failure and serfdom . During the 12th century , the divisions between the English and Normans began to dissolve as a result of intermarriage and cohabitation . By the end of the 12th century , and possibly as early as the 1150 , contemporary commentators believed the two peoples to be blending , and the loss of the Duchy in 1204 reinforced this trend . The resulting society still prized wider French cultural values , however , and French remained the language of the court , business and international affairs , even if Parisians mocked the English for their poor pronunciation . By the 14th century , however , French was increasingly having to be formally taught , rather than being learnt naturally in the home , although the aristocracy would typically spend many years of their lives in France and remained entirely comfortable working in French . 
 During the 12th and 13th centuries , the English began to consider themselves superior to the Welsh , Scots and Bretons . The English perceived themselves as civilised , economically prosperous and properly Christian , while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy , barbarous and backward . Following the invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century , similar feelings were expressed about the Irish , with the distinctions clarified and reinforced in 14th @-@ century English legislation . The English also felt strongly about the foreign traders who lived in the special enclaves in London in the Late Middle Ages ; the position of the Jews is described below , but Italian and Baltic traders were also regarded as aliens and were frequently the targets of violence during economic downturns . Even within England , different identities abounded , each with their own sense of status and importance . Regional identities could be important - men and women from Yorkshire , for example , had a clear identity within English society , and professional groups with a distinct identity , such as lawyers , engaged in open fighting with others in cities such as London . 
 = = = Jews = = = 
 The Jewish community in England played an important role in England throughout much of the period . The first Jews arrived in England in the aftermath of the Norman invasion , when William the Conqueror brought over wealthy members of the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London . The Jewish community expanded out across England and provided essential money @-@ lending and banking services that were otherwise banned by the usury laws . During the 12th century , the Jewish financial community grew richer still , operating under royal protection and providing the king with a source of ready credit . All major towns had Jewish centres , and even the smaller towns saw visits by travelling Jewish merchants . Towards the end of Henry II 's reign , however , the king ceased to borrow from the Jewish community and instead turned to extracting money from them through arbitrary taxation and fines . The Jews became vilified and accusations were made that they conducted ritual child murder , encouraging the pogroms carried out against Jewish communities in the reign of Richard I. After an initially peaceful start to John 's reign , the king again began to extort money from the Jewish community and , with the breakdown in order in 1215 , the Jews were subject to fresh attacks . Henry III restored some protection and Jewish money @-@ lending began to recover . Despite this , the Jewish community became increasingly impoverished and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by Edward I , being replaced by foreign merchants . 
 = = Religion = = 
 = = = Rise of Christianity = = = 
 Christianity had been the official imperial religion of the Roman Empire , and the first churches were built in England in the second half of the 4th century , overseen by a hierarchy of bishops and priests . Many existing pagan shrines were converted to Christian use and few pagan sites still operated by the 5th century . The collapse of the Roman system in the late 5th century , however , brought about the end of formal Christian religion in the east of England , and the new Germanic immigrants arrived with their own polytheistic gods , including Woden , Thunor and Tiw , still reflected in various English place names . Despite the resurgence of paganism in England , Christian communities still survived in more western areas such as Gloucestershire and Somerset . 
 The movement towards Christianity began again in the late 6th and 7th centuries , helped by the conversion of the Franks in Northern France , who carried considerable influence in England . Pope Gregory I sent a team of missionaries to convert King Æthelberht of Kent and his household , starting the process of converting Kent . Augustine became the first Archbishop of Canterbury and started to build new churches across the South @-@ East , reusing existing pagan shrines . Oswald and Oswiu , kings of Northumbria , were converted in the 630s and 640s , and the wave of change carried on through the middle of the 7th century across the kingdoms of Mercia , the South Saxons and the Isle of Wight . The process was largely complete by the end of the 7th century , but left a confusing and disparate array of local practices and religious ceremonies . This new Christianity reflected the existing military culture of the Anglo @-@ Saxons : as kings began to convert in the 6th and 7th centuries , conversion began to be used as a justification for war against the remaining pagan kingdoms , for example , while Christian saints were imbued with martial properties . 
 The Viking invasions of the 8th and 9th centuries reintroduced paganism to North @-@ East England , leading in turn to another wave of conversion . Indigenous Scandinavian beliefs were very similar to other Germanic groups , with a pantheon of gods including Odin , Thor and Ullr , combined with a belief in a final , apocalyptic battle called Ragnarok . The Norse settlers in England were converted relatively quickly , assimilating their beliefs into Christianity in the decades following the occupation of York , which the Archbishop had survived . The process was largely complete by the early 10th century and enabled England 's leading Churchmen to negotiate with the warlords . As the Norse in mainland Scandinavia started to convert , many mainland rulers recruited missionaries from England to assist in the process . 
 = = = Religious institutions = = = 
 With the conversion of much of England in the 6th and 7th centuries , there was an explosion of local church building . English monasteries formed the main basis for the church , however , and were often sponsored by local rulers , taking various forms , including mixed communities headed by abbesses , bishop @-@ led communities of monks , and others formed around married priests and their families . Cathedrals were constructed , staffed either with secular canons in the European tradition or , uniquely to England , chapters of monks . These institutions were badly affected in the 9th century by Viking raids and predatory annexations by the nobility . By the start of the 10th century , monastic lands , financial resources and the quality of monasteries ' religious work had been much diminished . Reforms followed under the kings of Wessex who promoted the Benedictine rule then popular on the Continent . A reformed network of around 40 monastic institutions across the south and east of England , under the protection of the king , helped re @-@ establish royal control over the reconquered Danelaw . 
 The 1066 Norman conquest brought a new set of Norman and French churchmen to power ; some adopted and embraced aspects of the former Anglo @-@ Saxon religious system , while others introduced practices from Normandy . Extensive English lands were granted to monasteries in Normandy , allowing them to create daughter priories and monastic cells across the kingdom . The monasteries were brought firmly into the web of feudal relations , with their holding of land linked to the provision of military support to the crown . The Normans adopted the Anglo @-@ Saxon model of monastic cathedral communities , and within seventy years the majority of English cathedrals were controlled by monks ; every English cathedral , however , was rebuilt to some extent by the new rulers . England 's bishops remained powerful temporal figures , and in the early 12th @-@ century raised armies against Scottish invaders and built up extensive holdings of castles across the country . 
 New orders began to be introduced into England . As ties to Normandy waned , the French Cluniac order became fashionable and their houses were introduced in England . The Augustinians spread quickly from the beginning of the 12th century onwards , while later in the century the Cistercians reached England , creating houses with a more austere interpretation of the monastic rules and building the great abbeys of Rievaulx and Fountains . By 1215 , there were over 600 monastic communities in England , but new endowments slowed during the 13th century , creating long @-@ term financial problems for many institutions . The Dominican and Franciscan friars arrived in England during the 1220s , establishing 150 friaries by the end of the 13th century ; these mendicant orders rapidly became popular , particularly in towns , and heavily influenced local preaching . The religious military orders that became popular across Europe from the 12th century onwards acquired possessions in England , including the Templars , Teutons and Hospitallers . 
 = = = Church , state and heresy = = = 
 The Church had a close relationship with the English state throughout the Middle Ages . The bishops and major monastic leaders played an important part in national government , having key roles on the king 's council . Bishops often oversaw towns and cities , managing local taxation and government . This frequently became untenable with the Viking incursions of the 9th century , and in locations such as Worcester the local bishops came to new accommodations with the local ealdormen , exchanging some authority and revenue for assistance in defence . The early English church was racked with disagreement on doctrine , which was addressed by the Synod of Whitby in 664 ; some issues were resolved , but arguments between the archbishops of Canterbury and York as to which had primacy across Britain began shortly afterwards and continued throughout most of the medieval period . 
 William the Conqueror acquired the support of the Church for the invasion of England by promising ecclesiastical reform . William promoted celibacy amongst the clergy and gave ecclesiastical courts more power , but also reduced the Church 's direct links to Rome and made it more accountable to the king . Tensions arose between these practices and the reforming movement of Pope Gregory VII , which advocated greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy , condemned the practice of simony and promoted greater influence for the papacy in church matters . Despite the bishops continuing to play a major part in royal government , tensions emerged between the kings of England and key leaders within the English Church . Kings and archbishops clashed over rights of appointment and religious policy , and successive archbishops including Anselm , Theobald of Bec , Thomas Becket and Stephen Langton were variously forced into exile , arrested by royal knights or even killed . By the early 13th century , however , the church had largely won its argument for independence , answering almost entirely to Rome . 
 In the 1380s , several challenges emerged to the traditional teachings of the Church , resulting from the teachings of John Wycliffe , a member of Oxford University . Wycliffe argued that scripture was the best guide to understanding God 's intentions , and that the superficial nature of the liturgy , combined with the abuses of wealth within the Church and the role of senior churchmen in government , distracted from that study . A loose movement that included many members of the gentry pursued these ideas after Wycliffe 's death in 1384 and attempted to pass a Parliamentary bill in 1395 : the movement was rapidly condemned by the authorities and was termed " Lollardy " . The English bishops were charged to control and counter this trend , disrupting Lollard preachers and to enforcing the teaching of suitable sermons in local churches . By the early 15th century , combating Lollard teachings had become a key political issue , championed by Henry IV and his Lancastrian followers , who used the powers of both the church and state to combat the heresy . 
 = = = Pilgrimages and Crusades = = = 
 Pilgrimages were a popular religious practice throughout the Middle Ages in England , with the tradition dating back to the Roman period . Typically pilgrims would travel short distances to a shrine or a particular church , either to do penance for a perceived sin , or to seek relief from an illness or other condition . Some pilgrims travelled further , either to more distant sites within Britain or , in a few cases , onto the continent . 
 During the Anglo @-@ Saxon period , many shrines were built on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations , while other pilgrims visited prominent monasteries and sites of learning . Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome , which was a popular destination from the 7th century onwards ; sometimes these trips were a form of convenient political exile . Under the Normans , religious institutions with important shrines , such as Glastonbury , Canterbury and Winchester , promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations , maximising the value of the historic miracles associated with the sites . Accumulating relics became an important task for ambitious institutions , as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site . Indeed , by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England , adding to the attractiveness of pilgrimages to prominent relics . 
 Participation in the Crusades was also seen as a form of pilgrimage , and indeed the same Latin word , <unk> , was sometimes applied to both activities . While English participation in the First Crusade between 1095 and 1099 was limited , England played a prominent part in the Second , Third and Fifth Crusades over the next two centuries , with many crusaders leaving for the Levant during the intervening years . The idea of undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem was not new in England , however , as the idea of religiously justified warfare went back to Anglo @-@ Saxon times . Many of those who took up the Cross to go on a Crusade never actually left , often because the individual lacked sufficient funds to undertake the journey . Raising funds to travel typically involved crusaders selling or mortgaging their lands and possessions , which had an impact on their families and , at times , a considerable impact on the economy as a whole . 
 = = Economy and technology = = 
 = = = Geography = = = 
 England had a diverse geography in the medieval period , from the Fenlands of East Anglia or the heavily wooded Weald , through to the upland moors of Yorkshire . Despite this , medieval England broadly formed two zones , roughly divided by the rivers Exe and Tes : the south and east of England had lighter , richer soils , able to support both arable and pastoral agriculture , while the poorer soils and colder climate of the north and west produced a predominantly pastoral economy . Slightly more land was covered by trees than in the 20th century , and bears , beavers and wolves lived wild in England , bears being hunted to extinction by the 11th century and beavers by the 12th . Of the 10 @,@ 000 miles of roads that had been built by the Romans , many remained in use and four were of particular strategic importance — the Icknield Way , the Fosse Way , Ermine Street and Watling Street — which criss @-@ crossed the entire country . The road system was adequate for the needs of the period , although it was significantly cheaper to transport goods by water . The major river networks formed key transport routes , while many English towns formed navigable inland ports . 
 For much of the Middle Ages , England 's climate differed from that in the 21st century . Between the 9th and 13th centuries England went through the Medieval Warm Period , a prolonged period of warmer temperatures ; in the early 13th century , for example , summers were around 1 ° C warmer than today and the climate was slightly drier . These warmer temperatures allowed poorer land to be brought into cultivation and for grapevines to be cultivated relatively far north . The Warm Period was followed by several centuries of much cooler temperatures , termed the Little Ice Age ; by the 14th century spring temperatures had dropped considerably , reaching their coldest in the 1340s and 1350s . This cold end to the Middle Ages impacted significantly on English agriculture and living conditions . 
 Even at the start of the Middle Ages the English landscape had been shaped by human occupation over many centuries . Much woodland was new , the result of fields being reclaimed by brush after the collapse of the Roman Empire . Human intervention had established wood pastures , an ancient system for managing woods and animals , and coppicing , a more intensive approach to managing woodlands . Other agricultural lands included arable fields and <unk> , while in some parts of the country , such as the South @-@ West , waste moorland remained testament to earlier over @-@ farming in the Bronze Age . England 's environment continued to be shaped throughout the period , through the building of dykes to drain marshes , tree clearance and the large @-@ scale extraction of peat . Managed parks for hunting game , including deer and boars , were built as status symbols by the nobility from the 12th century onwards , but earlier versions of parks , such as hays , may have originated as early as the 7th century . 
 = = = Economy and demographics = = = 
 The English economy was fundamentally agricultural , depending on growing crops such as wheat , barley and oats on an open field system , and husbanding sheep , cattle and pigs . In the late Anglo @-@ Saxon period many peasants moved away from living in isolated hamlets and instead came together to form larger villages engaged in arable cultivation . Agricultural land became typically organised around manors , and was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage directly , called demesne land , and the majority of the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants . These peasants would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord 's demesne fields or through rent in the form of cash and produce . By the 11th century , a market economy was flourishing across much of England , while the eastern and southern towns were heavily involved in international trade . Around 6 @,@ 000 watermills were built to grind flour , freeing up labour for other more productive agricultural tasks . 
 Although the Norman invasion caused some damage as soldiers looted the countryside and land was confiscated for castle building , the English economy was not greatly affected . Taxes were increased , however , and the Normans established extensive forests that were exploited for their natural resources and protected by royal laws . The next two centuries saw huge growth in the English economy , driven in part by the increase in the population from around 1 @.@ 5 million in 1086 to between 4 and 5 million in 1300 . More land , much of it at the expense of the royal forests , was brought into production to feed the growing population and to produce wool for export to Europe . Many hundreds of new towns , some of them planned communities , were built across England , supporting the creation of guilds , charter fairs and other medieval institutions which governed the growing trade . Jewish financiers played a significant role in funding the growing economy , along with the new Cistercian and Augustinian religious orders that emerged as major players in the wool trade of the north . Mining increased in England , with a silver boom in the 12th century helping to fuel the expansion of the money supply . 
 Economic growth began to falter at the end of the 13th century , owing to a combination of overpopulation , land shortages and depleted soils . The Great Famine shook the English economy severely and population growth ceased ; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population . The agricultural sector shrank rapidly , with higher wages , lower prices and diminishing profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system centring on the charging of cash rents for lands . As returns on land fell , many estates , and in some cases entire settlements , were simply abandoned , and nearly 1 @,@ 500 villages were deserted during this period . A new class of gentry emerged who rented farms from the major nobility . Unsuccessful government attempts were made to regulate wages and consumption , but these largely collapsed in the decades following the Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 . 
 The English cloth industry grew considerably at the start of the 15th century , and a new class of international English merchant emerged , typically based in London or the South @-@ West , prospering at the expense of the older , shrinking economies of the eastern towns . These new trading systems brought about the end of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company . Fishing in the North Sea expanded into deeper waters , backed by commercial investment from major merchants . Between 1440 and 1480 , however , Europe entered a recession and England suffered the Great Slump : trade collapsed , driving down agricultural prices , rents and ultimately the acceptable levels of royal taxation . The resulting tensions and discontent played an important part in Jack Cade 's popular uprising in 1450 and the subsequent Wars of the Roses . By the end of Middle Ages the economy had begun to recover and considerable improvements were being made in metalworking and shipbuilding that would shape the Early Modern economy . 
 = = = Technology and science = = = 
 Technology and science in England advanced considerably during the Middle Ages , driven in part by the Greek and Islamic thinking that reached England from the 12th century onwards . Many advances were made in scientific ideas , including the introduction of Arabic numerals and a sequence of improvements in the units used for measuring time . Clocks were first built in England in the late 13th century , and the first mechanical clocks were certainly being installed in cathedrals and abbeys by the 1320s . Astrology , magic and palm reading were also considered important forms of knowledge in medieval England , although some doubted their reliability . 
 The period produced some influential English scholars . Roger Bacon , a philosopher and Franciscan friar , produced works on natural philosophy , astronomy and alchemy ; his work set out the theoretical basis for future experimentation in the natural sciences . William of Ockham helped to fuse Latin , Greek and Islamic writing into a general theory of logic ; " Ockham 's Razor " was one of his oft @-@ cited conclusions . English scholars since the time of Bede had believed the world was probably round , but Johannes de Sacrobosco estimated the circumference of the earth in the 13th century . Despite the limitations of medieval medicine , <unk> Anglicus published the Compendium <unk> , one of the longest medical works ever written in Latin . Prominent historical and science texts began to be translated into English for the first time in the second half of the 14th century , including the Polychronicon and The Travels of Sir John Mandeville . The universities of Oxford and Cambridge were established during the 11th and 12th centuries , drawing on the model of the University of Paris . 
 Technological advances proceeded in a range of areas . <unk> to grind grain had existed during most of the Anglo @-@ Saxon period , using horizontal mill designs ; from the 12th century on many more were built , eliminating the use of hand mills , with the older horizontal mills gradually supplanted by a new vertical mill design . Windmills began to be built in the late 12th century and slowly became more common . Water @-@ powered fulling mills and powered hammers first appeared in the 12th century ; water power was harnessed to assist in smelting by the 14th century , with the first blast furnace opening in 1496 . New mining methods were developed and horse @-@ powered pumps were installed in English mines by the end of the Middle Ages . The introduction of hopped beer transformed the brewing industry in the 14th century , and new techniques were invented to better preserve fish . Glazed pottery became widespread in the 12th and 13th centuries , with stoneware pots largely replacing wooden plates and bowls by the 15th century . William Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde began using the printing press during the late 15th century . Transport links were also improved ; many road bridges were either erected or rebuilt in stone during the long economic boom of the 12th and 13th centuries . England 's maritime trade benefited from the introduction of cog ships , and many docks were improved and fitted with cranes for the first time . 
 = = Warfare = = 
 = = = Armies = = = 
 Warfare was endemic in early Anglo @-@ Saxon England , and major conflicts still occurred approximately every generation in the later period . Groups of well @-@ armed noblemen and their households formed the heart of these armies , supported by larger numbers of temporary troops levied from across the kingdom , called the fyrd . By the 9th century , armies of 20 @,@ 000 men could be called up for campaigns , with another 28 @,@ 000 men available to guard urban defences . The most common weapon was the spear , with swords used by the wealthier nobles ; cavalry was probably less common than in wider Europe , but some Anglo @-@ Saxons did fight from horseback . The Viking attacks on England in the 9th century led to developments in tactics , including the use of shield walls in battle , and the Scandinavian seizure of power in the 11th century introduced housecarls , a form of elite household soldier who protected the king . 
 Anglo @-@ Norman warfare was characterised by attritional military campaigns , in which commanders tried to raid enemy lands and seize castles in order to allow them to take control of their adversaries ' territory , ultimately winning slow but strategic victories . Pitched battles were occasionally fought between armies but these were considered risky engagements and usually avoided by prudent commanders . The armies of the period comprised bodies of mounted , armoured knights , supported by infantry . Crossbowmen become more numerous in the 12th century , alongside the older <unk> . At the heart of these armies was the familia regis , the permanent military household of the king , which was supported in war by feudal levies , drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign . Mercenaries were increasingly employed , driving up the cost of warfare considerably , and adequate supplies of ready cash became essential for the success of campaigns . 
 In the late 13th century Edward I expanded the familia regis to become a small standing army , forming the core of much larger armies up to 28 @,@ 700 strong , largely comprising foot soldiers , for campaigns in Scotland and France . By the time of Edward III , armies were smaller in size , but the troops were typically better equipped and uniformed , and the archers carried the longbow , a potentially devastating weapon . Cannons were first used by English forces at battles such as Crécy in 1346 . Soldiers began to be contracted for specific campaigns , a practice which may have hastened the development of the armies of retainers that grew up under bastard feudalism . By the late 15th century , however , English armies were somewhat backward by wider European standards ; the Wars of the Roses were fought by inexperienced soldiers , often with outdated weapons , allowing the European forces which intervened in the conflict to have a decisive effect on the outcomes of battles . 
 = = = Navies = = = 
 The first references to an English navy occur in 851 , when chroniclers described Wessex ships defeating a Viking fleet . These early fleets were limited in size but grew in size in the 10th century , allowing the power of Wessex to be projected across the Irish Sea and the English Channel ; Cnut 's fleet had as many as 40 vessels , while Edward the Confessor could muster 80 ships . Some ships were manned by sailors called <unk> and <unk> , probably drawn from the coastal towns , while other vessels were mobilised as part of a national levy and manned by their regular crews . Naval forces played an important role during the rest of the Middle Ages , enabling the transportation of troops and supplies , raids into hostile territory and attacks on enemy fleets . English naval power became particularly important after the loss of Normandy in 1204 , which turned the English Channel from a friendly transit route into a contested and critical border region . English fleets in the 13th and 14th centuries typically comprised specialist vessels , such as galleys and large transport ships , and pressed merchant vessels conscripted into action ; the latter increasingly included cogs , a new form of sailing ship . Battles might be fought when one fleet found another at anchor , such as the English victory at Sluys in 1340 , or in more open waters , as off the coast of Winchelsea in 1350 ; raiding campaigns , such as the French attacks on the south of England between 1338 and 1339 , could cause devastation from which some towns never fully recovered . 
 = = = Fortifications = = = 
 Many of the fortifications built by the Romans in England survived into the Middle Ages , including the walls surrounding their military forts and cities . These defences were often reused during the unstable post @-@ Roman period . The Anglo @-@ Saxon kings undertook significant planned urban expansion in the 8th and 9th centuries , creating burhs , often protected with earth and wood ramparts . <unk> walls sometimes utilised older Roman fortifications , both for practical reasons and to bolster their owners ' reputations through the symbolism of former Roman power . 
 Although a small number of castles had been built in England during the 1050s , after the conquest the Normans began to build timber motte and bailey and ringwork castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories . During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone , with characteristic square keeps that supported both military and political functions . Royal castles were used to control key towns and forests , whilst baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates ; a feudal system called the castle @-@ guard was sometimes used to provide garrisons . Castles and sieges continued to grow in military sophistication during the 12th century , and in the 13th century new defensive town walls were constructed across England . 
 By the 14th century , castles were combining defences with luxurious , sophisticated living arrangements and landscaped gardens and parks . Early gunpowder weapons were used to defend castles by the end of the 14th century and gunports became an essential feature for a fashionable castle . The economics of maintaining castles meant that many were left to decline or abandoned ; in contrast , a small number of castles were developed by the very wealthy into palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid elaborate architecture . Smaller defensible structures called tower houses emerged in the north of England to protect against the Scottish threat . By the late medieval period , town walls were increasingly less military in character and more often expressions of civic pride or part of urban governance : many grand gatehouses were built in the 14th and 15th centuries for these purposes .

 = = = Art = = = 
 Medieval England produced art in the form of paintings , carvings , books , fabrics and many functional but beautiful objects . A wide range of materials were used , including gold , glass and ivory , the art usually drawing overt attention to the materials utilised in the designs . Anglo @-@ Saxon artists created carved ivories , illuminated manuscripts , embroidered cloths , crosses and stone sculpture , although relatively few of these have survived to the modern period . They produced a wide range of metalwork , frequently using gold and garnets , with brooches , buckles , sword hilts and drinking horns particularly favoured designs . Early designs , such as those found at the Sutton Hoo burial , used a zoomorphic style , heavily influenced by German fashions , in which animal shapes were distorted into flowing shapes and positioned alongside geometric patterns . From the 7th century onwards more naturalistic designs became popular , showing a plasticity of form and incorporating both animals and people into the designs . In the 10th century , Carolingian styles , inspired by Classical imagery , began to enter from the continent , becoming widely used in the reformed Benedictine monasteries across the south and east of England . 
 The Norman conquest introduced northern French artistic styles , particular in illuminated manuscripts and murals , and reduced the demand for carvings . In other artistic areas , including embroidery , the Anglo @-@ Saxon influence remained evident into the 12th century , and the famous Bayeux Tapestry is an example of older styles being <unk> under the new regime . Stained glass became a distinctive form of English art during this later medieval period , although the coloured glass for these works was almost entirely imported from Europe . Little early stained glass in England has survived , but it typically had both an ornamental and educational function , while later works also commemorated the sponsors of the windows into the designs . English tapestry making and embroidery in the early 14th century were of an especially high quality ; works produced by nuns and London professionals were exported across Europe , becoming known as the opus <unk> . English illuminated books , such as the Queen Mary Psalter , were also famous in this period , featuring rich decoration , a combination of grotesque and natural figures and rich colours . The quality of illuminated art in England declined significantly in the face of competition from Flanders in the 14th century , and later English illuminated medieval pieces generally imitated Flemish styles . 
 = = = Literature , drama and music = = = 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxons produced extensive poetry in Old English , some of which was written down as early as the 9th century , although most surviving poems were compiled in the 10th and early 11th century . Beowulf , probably written between 650 and 750 , is typical of these poems , portraying a vivid , heroic tale , ending with the protagonist 's death at the hands of a dragon , but still showing signs of the new Christian influences in England . Old English was also used for academic and courtly writing from the 9th century onwards , including translations of popular foreign works , including The Pastoral Care . 
 Poetry and stories written in French were popular after the Norman conquest , and by the 12th century some works on English history began to be produced in French verse . Romantic poems about tournaments and courtly love became popular in Paris and this fashion spread into England in the form of lays ; stories about the court of King Arthur were also fashionable , due in part to the interest of Henry II . English continued to be used on a modest scale to write local religious works and some poems in the north of England , but most major works were produced in Latin or French . In the reign of Richard II there was an upsurge in the use of Middle English in poetry , sometimes termed " Ricardian poetry " , although the works still emulated French fashions . The work of Geoffrey Chaucer from the 1370s onwards , however , culminating in the influential Canterbury Tales , was uniquely English in style . Major pieces of courtly poetry continued to be produced into the 15th century by <unk> 's disciples , and Thomas Malory compiled the older Arthurian tales to produce Le Morte d 'Arthur . 
 Music and singing were important in England during the medieval period , being used in religious ceremonies , court occasions and to accompany theatrical works . Singing techniques called <unk> were introduced in England in the 13th century , accompanied by instruments such as the guitar , harp , pipes and organ . Henry IV sponsored an extensive range of music in England , while his son Henry V brought back many influences from occupied France . Carols became an important form of music in the 15th century ; originally these had been a song sung during a dance with a prominent refrain — the 15th century form lost the dancing and introduced strong religious overtones . Ballads were also popular from the late 14th century onwards , including the Ballad of Chevy Chase and others describing the activities of Robin Hood . Miracle plays were performed to communicate the Bible in various locations . By the late 14th century , these had been extended into vernacular mystery plays which performed annually over several days , broken up into various cycles of plays ; a handful have survived into the 21st century . Guilds competed to produce the best plays in each town and performances were often an expression of civic identity . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 In the century after the collapse of the Romano @-@ British economy , very few substantial buildings were constructed and many villas and towns were abandoned . New long- and round @-@ houses were constructed in some settlements , while in others timber buildings were built imitating the older Roman styles . The Germanic immigrants constructed small rectangular buildings from wood , and occasionally grander halls . However , the conversion to Christianity in the 6th and 7th centuries reintroduced Italian and French masons , and these craftsmen built stone churches , low in height , following a narrow , rectangular plan , plastered inside and fitted with glass and colourful vestments . This Romanesque style developed throughout the period , featuring characteristic circular arches . By the 10th and 11th centuries , much larger churches and monastery buildings were being built , featuring square and circular towers after the contemporary European fashion . The palaces constructed for the nobility centred on great timber halls , while manor houses began to appear in rural areas . 
 The Normans brought with them architectural styles from their own duchy , where austere stone churches were preferred . Under the early Norman kings this style was adapted to produce large , plain cathedrals with ribbed vaulting . During the 12th century the Anglo @-@ Norman style became richer and more ornate , with pointed arches derived from French architecture replacing the curved Romanesque designs ; this style is termed Early English Gothic and continued , with variation , throughout the rest of the Middle Ages . In the early 14th century the Perpendicular Gothic style was created in England , with an emphasis on verticality , immense windows and soaring arcades . Fine timber roofs in a variety of styles , but in particular the hammerbeam , were built in many English buildings . In the 15th century the architectural focus turned away from cathedrals and monasteries in favour of parish churches , often decorated with richly carved woodwork ; in turn , these churches influenced the design of new chantry chapels for existing cathedrals . 
 Meanwhile , domestic architecture had continued to develop , with the Normans , having first occupied the older Anglo @-@ Saxon dwellings , rapidly beginning to build larger buildings in stone and timber . The elite preferred houses with large , ground @-@ floor halls but the less wealthy constructed simpler houses with the halls on the first floor ; master and servants frequently lived in the same spaces . Wealthier town @-@ houses were also built using stone , and incorporated business and domestic arrangements into a single functional design . By the 14th century grander houses and castles were sophisticated affairs : expensively tiled , often featuring murals and glass windows , these buildings were often designed as a set of apartments to allow greater privacy . Fashionable brick began to be used in some parts of the country , copying French tastes . Architecture that emulated the older defensive designs remained popular . Less is known about the houses of peasants during this period , although many peasants appear to have lived in relatively substantial , timber @-@ framed long @-@ houses ; the quality of these houses improved in the prosperous years following the Black Death , often being built by professional craftsmen .

 = = = Historiography = = = 
 The first history of medieval England was written by Bede in the 8th century ; many more accounts of contemporary and ancient history followed , usually termed chronicles . In the 16th century , the first academic histories began to be written , typically drawing primarily on the chroniclers and interpreting them in the light of current political concerns . Edward Gibbon 's 18th @-@ century writings were influential , presenting the medieval period as a dark age between the glories of Rome and the rebirth of civilisation in the Early Modern period . Late Victorian historians continued to use the chroniclers as sources , but also deployed documents such as Domesday Book and Magna Carta , alongside newly discovered financial , legal and commercial records . They produced a progressive account of political and economic development in England . The growth of the British Empire spurred interest in the various periods of English hegemony during the Middle Ages , including the Angevin Empire and the Hundred Years ' War . 
 By the 1930s , older historical analyses were challenged by a range of neo @-@ positivist , Marxist and econometric approaches , supported by a widening body of documentary , archaeological and scientific evidence . Marxist and Neo @-@ Marxist analyses continued to be popular in the post @-@ war years , producing seminal works on economic issues and social protests . Post @-@ modern analysis became influential in the 1970s and 1980s , focusing on identity , gender , interpretation and culture . Many studies focused on particular regions or groups , drawing on new records and new scientific approaches , including landscape and environmental archaeology . Fresh archaeological finds , such as the Staffordshire Hoard , continue to challenge previous interpretations , and historical studies of England in the Middle Ages have never been so diverse as in the early 21st century . 
 = = = Popular representations = = = 
 The period has also been used in a wide range of popular culture . William Shakespeare 's plays on the lives of the medieval kings have proved to have had long lasting appeal , heavily influencing both popular interpretations and histories of figures such as King John and Henry V. Other playwrights have since taken key medieval events , such as the death of Thomas Becket , and used them to draw out contemporary themes and issues . The medieval mystery plays continue to be enacted in key English towns and cities . Film @-@ makers have drawn extensively on the medieval period , often taking themes from Shakespeare or the Robin Hood ballads for inspiration . Historical fiction set in England during the Middle Ages remains persistently popular , with the 1980s and 1990s seeing a particular growth of historical detective fiction . The period has also inspired fantasy writers , including J. R. R. Tolkien 's stories of Middle @-@ earth . English medieval music was revived from the 1950s , with choral and musical groups attempting to authentically reproduce the original sounds . Medieval living history events were first held during the 19th and early 20th centuries , and the period has inspired a considerable community of historical re @-@ enactors , part of England 's growing heritage industry .

 = Romeo & Juliet : Sealed with a Kiss = 
 Romeo & Juliet : Sealed with a Kiss is a 2006 American animated romantic fantasy film loosely following the play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare . The film is about two star @-@ crossed seals , Romeo and Juliet ( voiced by Daniel and Patricia <unk> respectively ) , who fall in love against the wishes of their warring families . It was released in Europe in mid @-@ 2006 and on October 27 in the United States . 
 The film was written , animated , and directed entirely by one man , former Disney animator Phil Nibbelink . The film , created on an estimated budget of $ 2 million , took 4 ½ years to complete and required 112 @,@ 000 frames , all drawn by Nibbelink on a Wacom tablet directly into Flash 4 in combination with Moho software . Despite the film 's negative reviews , it won an award in Best in Show at the Southwest Film Festival . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Warring Capulets ( Michael Toland ) and Montagues ( Stephen Goldberg ) , portrayed as Steller and California sea lions respectively , have their feud watched sadly by Capulet 's only daughter , Juliet ( Patricia Trippett ) . A fight on the shore is ended when the Prince ( Phil Nibbelink ) , a large and monstrous elephant seal , appears and warns the two groups that , should there be any more disturbance , the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island , a fin shaped rock where a shark lives . Romeo ( Daniel <unk> ) , Montague 's only son , is depressed , wishing to fall in love with someone . His humorous friend , Mercutio ( Chip Albers ) , urges him and another of his friends , Benvolio ( Sam Gold ) , to go to a Capulet party later that evening . They attend the party , covered in white sand to look like Capulets , and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at first sight . Juliet , however , was promised by her father to marry the Prince , who attends the party . Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc , and are revealed to be Montagues . Later that evening , the play 's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows . Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning , and she will not have to marry the Prince . 
 Romeo begs Friar Lawrence , a sea otter , to wed them . After some thought , the friar believes their marriage will end the feud between their families , and agrees . Romeo and Juliet are wed that morning and traverse the sea in their happiness . However , even the other sea and land animals strongly oppose their being together . A fish finds them a lovely couple , but warns them that they will be in big trouble if the Prince finds out . Back on the beach , Mercutio is telling many jokes , which leads to him making insulting jokes against the Capulets , and the Prince is headed in that direction . When he arrives , Mercutio mocks him as well . Romeo rushes to aid his friend , but after a struggle Mercutio falls off the cliff where Juliet met Romeo the previous evening , and everyone thinks that he is dead . The Prince , jealous of Juliet 's affection for Romeo , exiles Romeo to Shark Island . In despair , Juliet seeks the Friar 's help , and he gives her a potion to put her in a deathlike state . Mercutio is revealed to be alive and sees the whole thing , remarking , " What a tangled web we weave . " 
 Lawrence shows the Capulet seals that Juliet is " dead " , right as they were celebrating the marriage . But Benvolio sees her as well , and swims to Shark Island to tell Romeo . The Friar chases him to stop him , but is attacked by a shark . After receiving the terrible news from Benvolio , Romeo heads to the shore to see if Juliet is truly dead . Friar Lawrence arrives too late and tries to follow Romeo , only to have his tail maimed by the shark . After an undersea chase and some help from the fish Romeo and Juliet met earlier , Lawrence escapes and heads to the beach . A heartbroken Romeo walks past the mourning Capulets and tries to kiss Juliet , only to have some of the potion slip into his own mouth , putting him in a deathlike state as well . Both groups of seals begin to weep for their loss , and Lawrence , who has just arrived , teaches them a lesson about where hatred leads them . Suddenly , Romeo and Juliet awaken , and all is well . Mercutio returns , and the Prince finds a new mate , a large elephant seal like himself . The movie ends with the two families at peace , and Romeo and Juliet remaining together .

 = Lion = 
 The lion ( Panthera leo ) is one of the big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae . The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa . With some males exceeding 250 kg ( 550 lb ) in weight , it is the second @-@ largest living cat after the tiger . Wild lions currently exist in sub @-@ Saharan Africa and in India ( where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park ) . In ancient historic times , their range was in most of Africa , including North Africa , and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India . In the late Pleistocene , about 10 @,@ 000 years ago , the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans : Panthera leo spelaea lived in northern and western Europe and Panthera leo atrox lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru . The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN , having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30 – 50 % per two decades during the second half of the twentieth century . Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks . Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood , habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern . Within Africa , the West African lion population is particularly endangered . 
 In the wild , males seldom live longer than 10 to 14 years , as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity . In captivity they can live more than 20 years . They typically inhabit savanna and grassland , although they may take to bush and forest . Lions are unusually social compared to other cats . A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males . Groups of female lions typically hunt together , preying mostly on large ungulates . Lions are apex and keystone predators , although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows . While lions do not typically hunt humans , some have . Sleeping mainly during the day , lions are active primarily at night ( nocturnal ) , although sometimes at twilight ( crepuscular ) . 
 Highly distinctive , the male lion is easily recognised by its mane , and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture . Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period , with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France dated to 17 @,@ 000 years ago , through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred . It has been extensively depicted in sculptures , in paintings , on national flags , and in contemporary films and literature . Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire , and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century . Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic subspecies . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The lion 's name , similar in many Romance languages , is derived from the Latin leo , and the Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) . The Hebrew word <unk> ( <unk> ) may also be related . It was one of the species originally described by Linnaeus , who gave it the name Felis leo , in his eighteenth @-@ century work , Systema Naturae . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The lion 's closest relatives are the other species of the genus Panthera : the tiger , the snow leopard , the jaguar , and the leopard . Studies from 2006 and 2009 concluded that the jaguar is a sister species to the lion and the leopard is a sister taxon to the jaguar / lion clade while 2010 and 2011 studies have swapped the positions leopard and jaguar . P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800 @,@ 000 years ago , before spreading throughout the Holarctic region . It appeared in the fossil record in Europe for the first time 700 @,@ 000 years ago with the subspecies Panthera leo fossilis at <unk> in Italy . From this lion derived the later cave lion ( Panthera leo spelaea ) , which appeared about 300 @,@ 000 years ago . Lions died out in northern Eurasia at the end of the last glaciation , about 10 @,@ 000 years ago ; this may have been secondary to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Traditionally , 12 recent subspecies of lion were recognised , distinguished by mane appearance , size , and distribution . Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability , most of these forms were probably not true subspecies , especially as they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had " striking , but abnormal " morphological characteristics . Today , only eight subspecies are usually accepted , although one of these , the Cape lion , formerly described as Panthera leo <unk> , is probably invalid . Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too many . While the status of the Asiatic lion ( P. l. persica ) as a subspecies is generally accepted , the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved . Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies ; therefore , all sub @-@ Saharan lions have sometimes been considered a single subspecies . However , a recent study revealed lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa . According to this study , Western African lions are more closely related to Asian lions than to South or East African lions . These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa , and a subsequent recolonisation of these parts from Asia . 
 Previous studies , which were focused mainly on lions from eastern and southern parts of Africa , already showed these can be possibly divided in two main clades : one to the west of the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east . Lions from Tsavo in eastern Kenya are much closer genetically to lions in Transvaal ( South Africa ) , than to those in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya . Another study revealed there are three major types of lions , one North African – Asian , one southern African and one middle African . Conversely , Per Christiansen found that using skull morphology allowed him to identify the subspecies krugeri , <unk> , persica , and senegalensis , while there was overlap between <unk> with senegalensis and krugeri . The Asiatic lion persica was the most distinctive , and the Cape lion had characteristics allying it more with P. l. persica than the other sub @-@ Saharan lions . He had analysed 58 lion skulls in three European museums . Based on recent genetic studies , the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group has provisionally proposed to assign the lions occurring in Asia and West , Central and North Africa to the subspecies Panthera leo leo and the lions inhabiting South and East Africa to the subspecies Panthera leo <unk> . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has followed this revised taxonomic classification , as being based on " the best available scientific and commercial information " , in listing these two subspecies as , respectively , endangered and threatened . 
 The majority of lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies . Approximately 77 % of the captive lions registered by the International Species Information System are of unknown origin . Nonetheless , they might carry genes that are extinct in the wild , and might be therefore important to maintain overall genetic variability of the lion . It is believed that those lions , imported to Europe before the middle of the nineteenth century , were mainly either Barbary lions from North Africa or lions from the Cape . 
 = = = = Recent = = = = 
 Eight recent ( Holocene ) subspecies are recognised today : 
 = = = = Pleistocene = = = = 
 Several additional subspecies of lion existed in prehistoric times : 
 P. l. fossilis , known as the Middle Pleistocene European cave lion , flourished about 500 @,@ 000 years ago ; fossils have been recovered from Germany and Italy . It was larger than today 's African lions , reaching sizes comparable to the American cave lion and slightly larger than the Upper Pleistocene European cave lion . 
 P. l. spelaea , known as the European cave lion , Eurasian cave lion , or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion , occurred in Eurasia 300 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 years ago . This species is known from Paleolithic cave paintings , ivory carvings , and clay busts , indicating it had protruding ears , tufted tails , perhaps faint tiger @-@ like stripes , and at least some had a ruff or primitive mane around their necks , possibly indicating males . 
 P. l. atrox , known as the American lion or American cave lion , was abundant in the Americas from Canada to Peru in the Pleistocene Epoch until about 10 @,@ 000 years ago . This form is the sister clade of P. l. spelaea , and likely arose when an early P. l. spelaea population became isolated south of the North American continental ice sheet about 0 @.@ 34 Mya . One of the largest purported lion subspecies to have existed , its body length is estimated to have been 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 5 m ( 5 @.@ 2 – 8 @.@ 2 ft ) . 
 = = = = Dubious = = = = 
 P. l. youngi or Panthera youngi , flourished 350 @,@ 000 years ago . Its relationship to the extant lion subspecies is obscure , and it probably represents a distinct species . 
 P. l. <unk> , known as the Sri Lanka lion , appears to have become extinct around 39 @,@ 000 years ago . It is only known from two teeth found in deposits at <unk> . Based on these teeth , P. <unk> erected this subspecies in 1939 . 
 P. l. <unk> , the Beringian cave lion of Yakutia ( Russia ) , Alaska ( United States ) , and the Yukon Territory ( Canada ) , has been considered a subspecies separate from P. l. spelaea on morphological grounds . However , mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained from cave lion fossils from Europe and Alaska were indistinguishable . 
 P. l. <unk> or Mesopotamian lion , flourished during the Neo @-@ Assyrian Period ( approximately 1000 – 600 BC ) . It inhabited the Mesopotamian Plain where it probably represents a distinct sub @-@ species . Nearly all ancient Mesopotamian representations of male lions demonstrate full underbelly hair in which until recently was only identified in the Barbary lion ( Panthera leo leo ) from Northern Africa and in most Asiatic lions ( P. l. persica ) from captivity in colder climates . Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly hair in this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia ( including Babylon , Elam and ancient Persia ) represent an extinct sub @-@ species . Many of the images of these lions are derived from lion hunting sculptures so that the extinction of this sub @-@ species likely resulted from overhunting in the ancient world . 
 P. l. europaea , known as the European lion , was probably identical with Panthera leo persica or Panthera leo spelea . It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and over @-@ exploitation . It inhabited the Balkans , the Italian Peninsula , southern France , and the Iberian Peninsula . It was a very popular object of hunting among ancient Romans and Greeks . 
 P. l. maculatus , known as the <unk> or spotted lion , sometimes is believed to be a distinct subspecies , but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern . If it was a subspecies in its own right , rather than a small number of <unk> coloured individuals , it has been extinct since 1931 . A less likely identity is a natural leopard @-@ lion hybrid commonly known as a <unk> . 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 Lions have been known to breed with tigers ( most often the Siberian and Bengal subspecies ) to create hybrids called ligers and <unk> ( or tigons ) . They also have been crossed with leopards to produce <unk> , and jaguars to produce <unk> . The <unk> is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring <unk> , while the Congolese spotted lion is a complex lion @-@ jaguar @-@ leopard hybrid called a <unk> . Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos , but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies . Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China . 
 The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress . Because the growth @-@ inhibiting gene from the female tiger mother is absent , the growth @-@ promoting gene passed on by the male lion father is unimpeded by a regulating gene and the resulting ligers grow far larger than either parent . They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species ( spots and stripes on a sandy background ) . Male ligers are sterile , but female ligers often are fertile . Males have about a 50 % chance of having a mane , but if they grow them , their manes will be modest : around 50 % the size of a pure lion mane . 
 <unk> are much bigger than normal lions , typically 3 @.@ 65 m ( 12 @.@ 0 ft ) in length , and can weigh up to 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) . 
 The less common <unk> or <unk> is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger . In contrast to ligers , tigons are often relatively small in comparison to their parents , because of reciprocal gene effects . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Of the living felids the lion is second only to the tiger in length and weight . Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger , although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened , with a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than that of a tiger . However , due to the amount of skull variation in the two species , usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species . Lion colouration varies from light buff to yellowish , reddish , or dark ochraceous brown . The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black . Lion cubs are born with brown rosettes ( spots ) on their body , rather like those of a leopard . Although these fade as lions reach adulthood , faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts , particularly on lionesses . 
 Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious sexual dimorphism – that is , males and females look distinctly different . They also have specialised roles that each gender plays in the pride . For instance , the lioness , the hunter , lacks the male 's thick mane . The colour of the male 's mane varies from blond to black , generally becoming darker as the lion grows older . The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a hairy tuft . In some lions , the tuft conceals a hard " spine " or " spur " , approximately 5 mm long , formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together . The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail – the function of the tuft and spine are unknown . Absent at birth , the tuft develops around 5 1 ⁄ 2 months of age and is readily identifiable at 7 months . 
 Weights for adult lions range between 150 to 250 kg ( 330 to 550 lb ) for males and 120 to 185 kg ( 265 to 408 lb ) for females . The size of adult lions varies across their range with those from the southern African populations in Zimbabwe , the Kalahari and Kruger Park averaging around 189 @.@ 6 kg ( 418 lb ) and 126 @.@ 9 kg ( 280 lb ) in males and females respectively compared to 174 @.@ 9 kg ( 386 lb ) and 119 @.@ 5 kg ( 263 lb ) of male and female lions from East Africa . Reported body measurements in males are head @-@ body lengths ranging from 170 to 250 cm ( 5 ft 7 in to 8 ft 2 in ) , tail lengths of 90 – 105 cm ( 2 ft 11 in – 3 ft 5 in ) . In females reported head @-@ body lengths range from 140 to 175 cm ( 4 ft 7 in to 5 ft 9 in ) , tail lengths of 70 – 100 cm ( 2 ft 4 in – 3 ft 3 in ) , however , the frequently cited maximum head and body length of 250 cm ( 8 ft 2 in ) fits rather to extinct Pleistocene forms , like the American lion , with even large modern lions measuring several centimetres less in length . Record measurements from hunting records are supposedly a total length of nearly 3 @.@ 6 m ( 12 ft ) for a male shot near <unk> , southern Angola in October 1973 and a weight of 313 kg ( 690 lb ) for a male shot outside <unk> in eastern Transvaal , South Africa in 1936 . Another notably outsized male lion , which was shot near Mount Kenya , weighed in at 272 kg ( 600 lb ) . 
 = = = Mane = = = 
 The mane of the adult male lion , unique among cats , is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species . In rare cases a female lion can have a mane . The presence , absence , colour , and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition , sexual maturity , climate , and testosterone production ; the rule of thumb is the darker and fuller the mane , the healthier the lion . Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favours males with the densest , darkest mane . Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male – male relationships . Darker @-@ maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival , although they suffer in the hottest months of the year . 
 Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology , including the size of the mane . Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion . Research has suggested , however , that environmental factors such as average ambient temperature influence the colour and size of a lion 's mane . The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos , for example , may result in a heavier mane . Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies . The males of the Asiatic subspecies , however , are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions . 
 In the Pendjari National Park area almost all males are maneless or have very weak manes . <unk> male lions have also been reported from Senegal , from Sudan ( <unk> National Park ) , and from Tsavo East National Park in Kenya , and the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless . The testosterone hormone has been linked to mane growth ; therefore , castrated lions often have minimal to no mane , as the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production . In addition , increased testosterone may be the cause of the maned lionesses of northern Botswana . 
 Cave paintings of extinct European cave lions almost exclusively show animals with no manes , suggesting that either they were maneless , or that the paintings depict lionesses as seen hunting in a group . 
 = = = White lions = = = 
 The white lion is not a distinct subspecies , but a special morph with a genetic condition , leucism , that causes paler colouration akin to that of the white tiger ; the condition is similar to melanism , which causes black panthers . They are not albinos , having normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin . White Transvaal lion ( Panthera leo krugeri ) individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa , but are more commonly found in captivity , where breeders deliberately select them . The unusual cream colour of their coats is due to a recessive allele . Reportedly , they have been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20 hours per day . Although lions can be active at any time , their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising , grooming , and defecating . Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn , when hunting most often takes place . They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50 minutes eating . 
 = = = Group organisation = = = 
 Lions are the most socially inclined of all wild felids , most of which remain quite solitary in nature . The lion is a predatory carnivore with two types of social organization . Some lions are residents , living in groups of related lionesses , their mates , and offspring . Such a group is called a pride . Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females . Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses , although some females do leave and become nomadic . Although extremely large prides , consisting of up to 30 individuals , have been observed , the average pride consists of five or six females , their cubs of both sexes , and one or two males ( known as a coalition if more than one ) who mate with the adult females . The number of adult males in a coalition is usually two but may increase to as many as four before decreasing again over time . The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male . Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2 – 3 years of age . The second organizational behaviour is labeled nomads , who range widely and move about sporadically , either singularly or in pairs . Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride . Note that a lion may switch lifestyles ; nomads may become residents and vice versa . Males , as a rule , live at least some portion of their lives as nomads , and some are never able to join another pride . A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride , as the females in a pride are related , and they reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group . 
 The area a pride occupies is called a pride area , whereas that by a nomad is a range . The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes , patrolling their territory . Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate . Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason , but this is less than sure upon examination : coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non @-@ hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake ; however , some take a role raising cubs , who may be left alone for extended periods of time . Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills . The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride , and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken . Other benefits include possible kin selection ( better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger ) , protection of the young , maintenance of territory , and individual insurance against injury and hunger . 
 Lionesses do most of the hunting for their pride . They are more effective hunters , as they are smaller , swifter , and more agile than the males and unencumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane , which causes overheating during exertion . They act as a coordinated group with members who perform the same role consistently in order to stalk and bring down the prey successfully . Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt , thereby being shared among the hunters ; when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area . There is more sharing of larger kills , although pride members often behave aggressively toward each other as each tries to consume as much food as possible . Near the conclusion of the hunt , males have a tendency to dominate the kill once the lionesses have succeeded . They are more likely to share this with the cubs than with the lionesses , but males rarely share food they have killed by themselves . 
 Both males and females can defend the pride against intruders , but the male lion is better @-@ suited for this purpose due to its stockier , more powerful build . Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders , while others lag behind . Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride . Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group . An alternative hypothesis is that there is some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders , and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses . The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride . 
 = = = Hunting and diet = = = 
 Lions prefer to scavenge when the opportunity presents itself with carrion providing more than 50 % of their diet . They scavenge animals either dead from natural causes ( disease ) or killed by other predators , and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures , being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in distress . In fact , most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by the hyenas instead of the lions . 
 The lionesses do most of the hunting for the pride . The male lion associated with the pride usually stays and watches over young cubs until the lionesses return from the hunt . Typically , several work together and encircle the herd from different points . Once they have closed in on the herd , they usually target the animal closest to them . The attack is short and powerful ; they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap . The prey usually is killed by strangulation , which can cause cerebral ischemia or asphyxia ( which results in <unk> , or " general " , hypoxia ) . The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal 's mouth and nostrils in its jaws ( which would also result in asphyxia ) . 
 Lions usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey . However , they are not particularly known for their stamina – for instance , a lioness ' heart makes up only 0 @.@ 57 % of her body weight ( a male 's is about 0 @.@ 45 % of his body weight ) , whereas a hyena 's heart is close to 1 % of its body weight . Thus , they only run fast in short bursts , and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack . They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility ; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night . They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately 30 metres ( 98 feet ) or less . 
 The prey consists mainly of medium @-@ sized mammals , with a preference for wildebeest , zebras , buffalo , and warthogs in Africa and nilgai , wild boar , and several deer species in India . Many other species are hunted , based on availability , mainly ungulates weighing between 50 and 300 kg ( 110 and 660 lb ) such as kudu , hartebeest , gemsbok , and eland . Occasionally , they take relatively small species such as Thomson 's gazelle or springbok . Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals , even healthy adults , but in most parts of their range they rarely attack very large prey such as fully grown male giraffes due to the danger of injury . Giraffes and buffaloes are almost invulnerable to a solitary lion as well . 
 Extensive studies show that lionesses normally prey on mammals with an average weight of 126 kg ( 278 lb ) , while kills made by male lions average 399 kg ( 880 lb ) . In Africa , wildebeest rank at the top of preferred prey ( making nearly half of the lion prey in the Serengeti ) followed by zebra . Lions do not prey on fully grown adult elephants ; most adult hippopotamuses , rhinoceroses , and smaller gazelles , impala , and other agile antelopes are generally excluded . However , giraffes and buffaloes are often taken in certain regions . For instance , in Kruger National Park , giraffes are regularly hunted . In <unk> Park , Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62 % of the lion 's diet , due to the high number density of buffaloes . Occasionally hippopotamus is also taken , but adult rhinoceroses are generally avoided . <unk> are often taken depending on availability . The lions of <unk> , Botswana , have adapted to hunting young elephants during the dry season , and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing individuals between the ages of four and eleven years . In the Kalahari desert in South Africa , black @-@ maned lions may chase baboons up a tree , wait patiently , then attack them when they try to escape : 
 Lions also attack domestic livestock and in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet . Lions are capable of killing other predators such as leopards , cheetahs , hyenas , and wild dogs , though ( unlike most felids ) they seldom devour the competitors after killing them . A lion may gorge itself and eat up to 30 kg ( 66 lb ) in one sitting ; if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more . On a hot day , the pride may retreat to shade leaving a male or two to stand guard . As revealed by fossil evidence at Olduvai , Tanzania , lions will occasionally drag their carcasses to a more sheltered spot to eat ( as tigers and leopards are known to do ) , allowing them to consume more of a carcass without interference from scavengers . An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg ( 11 lb ) of meat per day , a male about 7 kg ( 15 lb ) . 
 Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey , cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt ; this is especially true with larger species . Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas , which may be attracted by vultures from kilometres away in open savannas . Lionesses do most of the hunting ; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting , except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo . In typical hunts , each lioness has a favoured position in the group , either stalking prey on the " wing " then attacking , or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses . There is evidence that male lions are just as successful at hunting as females ; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush . Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age , although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old . They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two . 
 = = = = Predator competition = = = = 
 Lions and spotted hyenas occupy the same ecological niche , meaning they compete for prey and carrion in the areas where they coexist . A review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58 @.@ 6 % . Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas unless the lions are on a kill or are being harassed by the hyenas , while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions whether there is food or not . Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas : in the Ngorongoro crater , it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas , causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate . On the other hand , in Northern Botswana 's Chobe National Park , the situation is reversed : hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills : they obtain food from 63 % of all lion kills . When confronted on a kill by lions , spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30 – 100 m ( 98 – 328 ft ) until the lions have finished , but they are also bold enough to feed alongside lions , and even force the lions off a kill . The two species may attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason . Lion predation can account for up to 71 % of hyena deaths in Etosha . Spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories . Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them , but will react fearfully to the scent . The size of male lions allows them occasionally to confront hyenas in otherwise evenly matched brawls and so to tip the balance in favour of the lions . 
 Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as cheetahs and leopards where they co @-@ occur , stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance . The cheetah has a 50 % chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators . Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs , up to 90 % of which are lost in their first weeks of life due to attacks by other predators . Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and hide their cubs in thick brush . Leopards also use such tactics , but have the advantage of being able to subsist much better on small prey than either lions or cheetahs . Also , unlike cheetahs , leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions ; however , lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills . Similarly , lions dominate African wild dogs , not only taking their kills but also preying on young and ( rarely ) adult dogs . Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant . However , there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs . 
 The Nile crocodile is the only sympatric predator ( besides humans ) that can singly threaten the lion . Depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion , either can lose kills or carrion to the other . Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land , while the reverse is true for lions entering waterways , as evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs . 
 = = = = Man @-@ eating = = = = 
 While lions do not usually hunt people , some ( usually males ) seem to seek out human prey ; one well @-@ publicised case includes the Tsavo <unk> , where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya @-@ Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898 . The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals ' predatory behaviour . The lions were larger than normal , lacked manes , and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay . The infirmity theory , including tooth decay , is not favoured by all researchers ; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man @-@ eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents , prey depletion in human @-@ dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans . 
 In their analysis of Tsavo and general man @-@ eating , <unk> <unk> and <unk> acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man @-@ eating , but that the behaviour is " not unusual , nor necessarily ' aberrant ' " where the opportunity exists ; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present , lions will regularly prey upon human beings . The authors note that the relationship is well @-@ attested among other <unk> and primates in the paleontological record . 
 The lion 's proclivity for man @-@ eating has been systematically examined . American and Tanzanian scientists report that man @-@ eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005 . At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period – a number far exceeding the more famed " Tsavo " incidents of a century earlier . The incidents occurred near Selous National Park in Rufiji District and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border . While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern , the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because , in this case , conservation contributes directly to human deaths . Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages . Another study of 1 @,@ 000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon ( when there was less moonlight ) were a strong indicator of increased night attacks on people . 
 Author Robert R. Frump wrote in The Man @-@ eaters of Eden that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions ; park officials have conceded that man @-@ eating is a problem there . Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night . For nearly a century before the border was sealed , Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm .
