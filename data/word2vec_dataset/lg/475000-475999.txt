 … And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica , released on August 25 , 1988 , by Elektra Records . It was the band 's first studio album to feature bassist Jason Newsted after the death of Cliff Burton in 1986 . … And Justice for All is musically progressive , with long and complex songs , fast tempos , and few verse @-@ chorus structures . The album is noted for its sterile production , which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the mixing process . The lyrics feature themes of political and legal injustice seen through the prisms of censorship , war , and nuclear brinkmanship . 
 The album 's front cover , designed by Stephen Gorman on a scheme by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich , features a representation of Lady Justice , bound by ropes , with one breast bare and its scales tipping toward one plate filled with money . The phrase " … And Justice for All " appears spray @-@ painted in the lower right corner . The album title is derived from the American Pledge of Allegiance . Originally released on one vinyl disc , the album was quickly re @-@ released as a double album without additional tracks . Three songs from the album were released as singles : " Harvester of Sorrow " , " Eye of the Beholder " , and " One " , while the title track was released as a promotional single . 
 … And Justice for All was acclaimed by music critics . It was included in The Village Voice 's annual Pazz & Jop critics ' poll of the year 's best albums , and the single " One " earned Metallica its first Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1990 . The group 's best @-@ selling album at the time , it was the first underground metal album to achieve chart success in the United States .

 … And Justice for All was Metallica 's first full @-@ length studio album to feature bassist Jason Newsted after the death of Cliff Burton in 1986 . Newsted had previously played on Metallica 's The $ 5 @.@ 98 E.P. : Garage Days Re @-@ Revisited , an extended play released in 1987 . The band intended to record the album earlier , but was sidetracked by the large number of festival dates scheduled for the summer of 1987 , including the European leg of the Monsters of Rock festival . Another reason was frontman James Hetfield 's arm injury in a skateboarding accident . The band 's previous studio album , Master of Puppets , marked the end of Metallica 's contract with the Music for Nations label . Manager Peter Mensch wanted the band to sign with British record distributor Phonogram Records , and Phonogram chairman Martin Hooker was keen to obtain the band 's contract . To persuade Metallica to choose his label Hooker offered them a bigger deal , " worth well over £ 1 million , which at that time was the biggest deal we 'd ever offered anyone " . His explanation was that the final figure for combined British and European sales of all three Metallica albums was more than 1 @.@ 5 million copies . The album title was revealed in April 1988 : … And Justice for All , after the final words of the Pledge of Allegiance . The artwork was created by Stephen Gorman , based on a concept developed by Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich . It depicts a cracked statue of a blindfolded Lady Justice , bound by ropes with her breasts exposed and her scales overflowing with dollar bills . The title appears graffiti @-@ style in the lower right corner . 
 = = Production and recording = = 
 … And Justice for All was recorded from January to May 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles . Metallica produced the album with Flemming Rasmussen . Rasmussen was initially unavailable for the planned start on January 1 , 1988 , and the band brought in Mike Clink , who had caught their attention for producing Guns N ' Roses ' debut Appetite for Destruction ( 1987 ) . Things did not work out as planned , and three weeks later Rasmussen became available after Ulrich gave him a call . Rasmussen listened to Clink 's rough mixes for the album on his February 14 flight to Los Angeles , and upon his arrival Clink was fired . Hetfield explained that recording with Clink did not work out so well , and Rasmussen came over as a last @-@ minute replacement . However , Clink is credited with engineering the drums on two of the album 's tracks : " The Shortest Straw " and " Harvester of Sorrow " . While waiting for Rasmussen to arrive , the band recorded two cover songs — " <unk> " and " The Prince " — to " fine ‑ tune the sound while they got into the studio vibe " . Both were released as B @-@ sides of the " Harvester of Sorrow " CD single , as separate B @-@ sides for " Eye of the Beholder " and " One " respectively , and were included on the covers album Garage Inc . ( 1998 ) . 
 Rasmussen 's first task was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound with which the band was dissatisfied . A guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich 's drumming were used . The band played in a live room , recording the instruments separately . Each song used three reels : one for drums , a second for bass and guitars and a third for anything else . Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions ; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began , and Rasmussen said that Hetfield " wasn 't really interested in singing " but instead " wanted that hard vibe " . Metallica 's recording process was new to Jason Newsted , who questioned his impact on the overall sound and the lack of discussion with the rest of the team . Newsted had a different experience with his previous band , Flotsam and Jetsam , describing their style as " basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall " . He recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band , with only the assistant engineer present . Newsted noted that his parts were at the same audio frequency as Hetfield 's guitar parts , and this created a " [ battle ] for the same frequency " . Steve Thompson , who mixed the album , claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums . Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production , but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the poor sound quality of the record . 
 = = Music = = 
 … And Justice for All is a musically progressive album featuring long and complex songs , fast tempos and few verse @-@ chorus structures . Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range , writing songs with multiple sections , heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures . Hetfield later explained : " Songwriting @-@ wise , [ the album ] was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do . ' We 've jammed six riffs into one song ? Let 's make it eight . Let 's go crazy with it . ' " Music critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album 's epically constructed songs : " The tempo shifts , gear changes , lapses , <unk> and abrupt halts " . BBC Music 's Eamonn Stack wrote that … And Justice for All sounds different from the band 's previous albums , with longer songs , sparser arrangements , and harsher vocals by Hetfield . According to journalist Martin Popoff , the album was less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes , unusual song structures and layered guitars . He argued that the album is more of a progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound . Music writer Joel McIver called the album 's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands " at the mellower end of extreme metal " . According to writer Christopher Knowles , Metallica took " the thrash concept to its logical conclusion " on the album . 
 The album was noted for its " dry , sterile " production . Rasmussen said that was not his intention , as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the previous two albums . He was not present during the album 's mixing , for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand . Rasmussen felt that , in his absence from the mixing process , Thompson and Barbiero ended up using only the close microphones on the mix and none of the room microphones , thus causing the " clicking " , thin drum sound . Popoff noted that because of the strange production , the bass guitar was nearly inaudible , while the guitars sounded " strangled mechanistic " . He saw the " synthetic " percussion as another reason for the album 's compressed sound . The sound has nearly @-@ inaudible bass guitar , which Rasmussen claims was ordered by Hetfield and Ulrich after hearing the initial mixes , resulting in his belief that " Jason Newsted , [ engineer ] Toby Wright and I are probably the only people who know what the bass parts actually sounded like on that album " . Thompson similarly blamed Ulrich for the inaudible bass , stating that Ulrich ordered him to remove the bass from the mix . In their defence , Hetfield and Ulrich said that most of Newsted 's bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines to the point of being indiscernible from each other . A lack of direction is also partly to blame ; since the album was largely produced by the band , there was no one present in the studio to guide the band 's new bassist and tell him what was expected of him , something a producer would typically do . Newsted was not satisfied with the final mixes : " The Justice album wasn 't something that really felt good for me , because you really can 't hear the bass . " 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 The lyrical content of … And Justice for All is conceptually unified around notions of political and legal injustice as seen through the prism of war , censored speech , and nuclear brinksmanship . The majority of the songs raise issues that differ from the violent retaliation of the previous releases . Tom King wrote that for the first time the lyrics dealt with political and environmental issues . He named contemporaries Nuclear Assault as the only other band who applied ecological lyrics to thrash metal songs rather than singing about Satan and Egyptian plagues . McIver noted that Hetfield , the band 's main lyricist , wrote about topics that he had not addressed before , such as his revolt against the establishment . Ulrich described the songwriting process as their " CNN years " , with him and Hetfield watching the channel in search for song subjects — " I 'd read about the blacklisting thing , we 'd get a title , ' The Shortest Straw , ' and a song would come out of that . " 
 Concerns about the environmental plight of the planet ( " Blackened " ) , corruption ( " … And Justice for All " ) , and blacklisting and discrimination ( " The Shortest Straw " ) are emphasized with traditional existential themes . Issues such as freedom of speech and civil liberties are presented from a grim and pessimistic point of view . " One " was unofficially entitled " antiwar anthem " because of the lyrics which portray the suffering of a wounded soldier . " Dyers Eve " is a lyrical rant from Hetfield to his parents . Burton received co @-@ writing credit on " To Live Is to Die " as the bass line was a medley of unused recordings Burton had performed prior to his death . Because the original recordings are not used on the track , the composition is credited as written by Burton and played by Newsted . The spoken word at the end of the song ( " When a man lies , he murders some part of the world . These are the pale deaths which men <unk> their lives . " ) was written by German poet Paul Gerhardt , but was erroneously attributed to Burton in the liner notes . The second half of the speech ( " All this I cannot bear to witness any longer . Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home ? " ) was written by Burton .

 Released on August 25 , 1988 , by Elektra Records , … And Justice for All was acclaimed by music critics . In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone , Michael Azerrad said that Metallica 's compositions are impressive and called the album 's music " a marvel of precisely channeled aggression " . Spin magazine 's Sharon <unk> called it a " gem of a double record " and found the music both edgy and technically proficient . Simon Reynolds , writing in Melody Maker , said that " other bands would give their eye teeth " for the songs ' riffs and found the album 's densely complicated style of metal to be distinct from the monotonous sound of contemporary rock music : " Everything depends on utter punctuality and supreme surgical finesse . It 's probably the most incisive music I 've ever heard , in the literal sense of the word . " Borivoj Krgin of Metal Forces said that it was the most ideal album he has heard because of typically exceptional production and musicianship that is more impressive than on Master of Puppets . In a less enthusiastic review for The Village Voice , Robert Christgau felt that the band 's compositions lack song form and that the album " goes on longer " than Master of Puppets . In 1988 , … And Justice for All was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance , but with much controversy , it lost to Jethro Tull 's Crest of a Knave . In 2007 , Entertainment Weekly , named the win one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history . 
 In a retrospective review , Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that … And Justice for All was both the band 's " most ambitious " and ultimately " flattest @-@ sounding " album . AllMusic 's Steve Huey noted that Metallica followed the blueprint of the previous two albums , with more sophisticated songs and " apocalyptic " lyrics that envisioned a society in decay . Music journalist Mick Wall was critical of the progressive elements on the album and felt that , apart from " One " and " Dyers Eve " , most of the album sounded clumsy . Colin Larkin , writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music ( 2006 ) , wrote that , apart from the praiseworthy " One " , the album diminished the band 's creativity by concentrating the songs with too many riffs . Ulrich said in retrospect that the album has improved with time and it is well @-@ revered among their contemporaries .

 The I @-@ 351 @-@ class submarine ( <unk> , I @-@ san @-@ <unk> @-@ go @-@ jū @-@ ichi @-@ gata <unk> ) was a class of tanker / transport submarines built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during World War II . The IJN called this type of submarine <unk> type submarine ( <unk> , Sen @-@ Ho @-@ gata <unk> ) . The type name , was shortened to <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , Submarine Tanker ) . The IJN designed these submarines to support flying boats in forward areas . By the time the first submarine was finished , this capability was no longer needed and she was converted into an oil tanker . That boat , I @-@ 351 , was sunk on the return leg of her second voyage in 1945 ; the second boat was destroyed by an American air raid before she was completed . Four additional submarines were planned , but were cancelled before they were laid down . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The I @-@ 351 @-@ class submarines were ordered under the 5th Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942 to support IJN flying boats in areas where there were no shore facilities and seaplane tenders could not operate . They were designed to support up to three flying boats with fuel , ammunition , water and even replacement aircrew . 
 These submarines had a length of 111 meters ( 364 ft 2 in ) overall , a beam of 10 @.@ 2 meters ( 33 ft 6 in ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 1 meters ( 20 ft 0 in ) . They displaced 3 @,@ 512 long tons ( 3 @,@ 568 t ) on the surface and 4 @,@ 290 long tons ( 4 @,@ 360 t ) submerged . They had a diving depth of 90 meters ( 300 ft ) and a crew of 77 officers and enlisted men plus accommodations for 13 aircrew . 
 The boats had two propellers , each of which was driven by a 1 @,@ 850 @-@ brake @-@ horsepower ( 1 @,@ 380 kW ) diesel engine as well as a 600 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 447 kW ) electric motor . This arrangement gave the I @-@ 351 @-@ class submarines a maximum speed of 15 @.@ 75 knots ( 29 @.@ 17 km / h ; 18 @.@ 12 mph ) while surfaced and 6 @.@ 3 knots ( 11 @.@ 7 km / h ; 7 @.@ 2 mph ) submerged . They had a range of 13 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 24 @,@ 000 km ; 15 @,@ 000 mi ) at 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) while on the surface and 100 nmi ( 190 km ; 120 mi ) at 3 knots ( 5 @.@ 6 km / h ; 3 @.@ 5 mph ) while submerged . This gave them an endurance of 60 days . 
 The boats were equipped with four 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes in the bow and they carried four torpedoes . For surface combat they were designed to carry one 14 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) deck gun , but this was unavailable when the submarines were under construction and three 81 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) Type 3 mortars were substituted . The submarines were fitted with seven 25 mm Type 96 anti @-@ aircraft guns , in two twin and three single mounts . 
 The I @-@ 351 @-@ class submarines were initially equipped to carry 365 long tons ( 371 t ) of aviation gasoline , 11 long tons ( 11 t ) of fresh water , and either sixty 550 @-@ pound ( 250 kg ) bombs or 30 bombs and 15 aircraft torpedoes . Four of the torpedoes could be replaced by an equal number of reload torpedoes for the submarine .

 Only I @-@ 351 and I @-@ 352 were actually laid down , the other four submarines were cancelled before their keels were laid .

 = Geyser = 
 A geyser ( US pronunciation : / <unk> / ; UK / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) is a spring characterized by intermittent discharge of water ejected <unk> and accompanied by steam . 
 The formation of geysers is due to particular <unk> conditions , which exist in only a few places on Earth , so they are a fairly rare phenomenon . Generally all geyser field sites are located near active volcanic areas , and the geyser effect is due to the proximity of magma . Generally , surface water works its way down to an average depth of around 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) where it contacts hot rocks . The resultant boiling of the pressurized water results in the geyser effect of hot water and steam spraying out of the geyser 's surface vent ( a hydrothermal explosion ) . 
 Over one thousand known geysers exist worldwide . At least 1 @,@ 283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone National Park , Wyoming , United States , and an average of 465 geysers are active there in a given year . A geyser 's eruptive activity may change or cease due to ongoing mineral deposition within the geyser plumbing , exchange of functions with nearby hot springs , earthquake influences , and human intervention . 
 Jet @-@ like eruptions , often referred to as cryogeysers , have been observed on several of the moons of the outer solar system . Due to the low ambient pressures , these eruptions consist of vapor without liquid ; they are made more easily visible by particles of dust and ice carried aloft by the gas . Water vapor jets have been observed near the south pole of Saturn 's moon Enceladus , while nitrogen eruptions have been observed on Neptune 's moon Triton . There are also signs of carbon dioxide eruptions from the southern polar ice cap of Mars . In the latter two cases , instead of being driven by geothermal energy , the eruptions seem to rely on solar heating via a solid @-@ state greenhouse effect . 
 = = Name = = 
 The word geyser comes from Geysir , the name of an erupting spring at <unk> , Iceland ; that name , in turn , comes from the Icelandic verb <unk> , " to gush " , the verb itself from Old Norse . 
 = = Form and function = = 
 Geysers are temporary geological features . Geysers are generally associated with volcanic areas . As the water boils , the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam and water to the surface through the geyser 's internal plumbing . The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain . 
 = = = Intense heat = = = 
 The heat needed for geyser formation comes from magma that needs to be near the surface of the earth . The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth 's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas . The pressures encountered at the areas where the water is heated make the boiling point of the water much higher than at normal atmospheric pressures . 
 = = = Water = = = 
 The water that is ejected from a geyser must travel underground through deep , pressurized fissures in the Earth 's crust . 
 = = = A plumbing system = = = 
 In order for the heated water to form a geyser , a plumbing system is required . This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated . Geysers are generally aligned along faults . The plumbing system is made up of a system of fractures , fissures , porous spaces and sometimes cavities . <unk> in the system are essential to the building up of pressure before an eruption . 
 = = Eruptions = = 
 Geyser activity , like all hot spring activity , is caused by surface water gradually seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by magma . The <unk> heated water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks . Geysers differ from non @-@ eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure ; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected to one or more narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock . 
 As the geyser fills , the water at the top of the column cools off , but because of the narrowness of the channel , convective cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible . The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath , not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker , allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated , i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard @-@ pressure boiling point . 
 Ultimately , the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins ; steam bubbles rise to the top of the column . As they burst through the geyser 's vent , some water overflows or splashes out , reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water underneath . With this release of pressure , the superheated water flashes into steam , boiling violently throughout the column . The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent . 
 The rocks in the nearby region produce a material called geyserite . <unk> — mostly silicon dioxide ( SiO2 ) , is dissolved from the rocks and gets deposited on the walls of the geyser 's plumbing system and on the surface . The deposits make the channels carrying the water up to the surface pressure @-@ tight . This allows the pressure to be carried all the way to the top and not be leaked out into the loose gravel or soil that are normally under the geyser fields . 
 Eventually the water remaining in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends ; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir , and the whole cycle begins again . The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser ; <unk> in Iceland erupts for a few seconds every few minutes , while Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10 minutes every 8 – 12 hours . 
 = = General categorization = = 
 There are two types of geysers : fountain geysers which erupt from pools of water , typically in a series of intense , even violent , bursts ; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter ( including geyserite ) , usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes . Old Faithful , perhaps the best @-@ known geyser at Yellowstone National Park , is an example of a cone geyser . Grand Geyser , the tallest predictable geyser on earth , ( although Geysir in Iceland is taller , it is not predictable ) , also at Yellowstone National Park , is an example of a fountain geyser . 
 There are many volcanic areas in the world that have hot springs , mud pots and fumaroles , but very few have erupting geysers . The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist . For example , even when other necessary conditions exist , if the rock structure is loose , eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers . 
 As a result , most geysers form in places where there is volcanic rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter , or geyserite , along the inside of the plumbing systems which are very slender . Over time , these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly , thus enabling the geyser to persist , as mentioned in the previous section . 
 Geysers are fragile phenomena and if conditions change , they may go dormant or extinct . Many have been destroyed simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants . However , the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy . During its long dormant periods , eruptions were sometimes artificially induced — often on special occasions — by the addition of surfactants to the water . 
 = = Biology of geysers = = 
 The specific colours of geysers derive from the fact that despite the apparently harsh conditions , life is often found in them ( and also in other hot habitats ) in the form of thermophilic prokaryotes . No known eukaryote can survive over 60 ° C ( 140 ° F ) . 
 In the 1960s , when the research of biology of geysers first appeared , scientists were generally convinced that no life can survive above around 73 ° C maximum ( 163 ° F ) — the upper limit for the survival of cyanobacteria , as the structure of key cellular proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) would be destroyed . The optimal temperature for thermophilic bacteria was placed even lower , around 55 ° C average ( 131 ° F ) . 
 However , the observations proved that it is actually possible for life to exist at high temperatures and that some bacteria even prefer temperatures higher than the boiling point of water . Dozens of such bacteria are known . Thermophiles prefer temperatures from 50 to 70 ° C ( 122 to 158 ° F ) , whilst <unk> grow better at temperatures as high as 80 to 110 ° C ( 176 to 230 ° F ) . As they have heat @-@ stable enzymes that retain their activity even at high temperatures , they have been used as a source of thermostable tools , that are important in medicine and biotechnology , for example in manufacturing antibiotics , plastics , detergents ( by the use of heat @-@ stable enzymes lipases , <unk> and proteases ) , and fermentation products ( for example ethanol is produced ) . Among these , the first discovered and the most important for biotechnology is Thermus aquaticus . The fact that such bacteria exist also stretches our imagination about life on other celestial bodies , both within and beyond the solar system . 
 = = Major geyser fields and their distribution = = 
 Geysers are quite rare , requiring a combination of water , heat , and fortuitous plumbing . The combination exists in few places on Earth . 
 = = = Yellowstone National Park , U.S. = = = 
 Yellowstone is the largest geyser locale , containing thousands of hot springs , and approximately 300 to 500 geysers . It is home to half of the world 's total number of geysers in its nine geyser basins . It is located mostly in Wyoming , USA , with small portions in Montana and Idaho . Yellowstone includes the world 's tallest active geyser ( Steamboat Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin ) , as well as the renowned Old Faithful Geyser , Beehive Geyser , <unk> Geyser , Lion Geyser , Plume Geyser , Aurum Geyser , Castle Geyser , Sawmill Geyser , Grand Geyser , Oblong Geyser , Giant Geyser , Daisy Geyser , Grotto Geyser , Fan & Mortar Geysers , & Riverside Geyser , all in the Upper Geyser Basin which alone contains nearly 180 geysers . 
 = = = Valley of Geysers , Russia = = = 
 The Valley of Geysers ( " Dolina <unk> " in Russian ) located in the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia is the only geyser field in Eurasia and the second largest concentration of geysers in the world . The area was discovered and explored by Tatyana <unk> in 1941 . Approximately 200 geysers exist in the area along with many hot @-@ water springs and perpetual <unk> . The area was formed due to a vigorous volcanic activity . The peculiar way of eruptions is an important feature of these geysers . Most of the geysers erupt at angles , and only very few have the geyser cones that exist at many other of the world 's geyser fields . On June 3 , 2007 , a massive mudflow influenced two thirds of the valley . It was then reported that a thermal lake was forming above the valley . Few days later , waters were observed to have receded somewhat , exposing some of the submerged features . <unk> Geyser , one of the field 's largest , was not buried in the slide and has recently been observed to be active . 
 = = = El Tatio , Chile = = = 
 The name " El Tatio " comes from the Quechua word for oven . El Tatio is located in the high valleys on the Andes surrounded by many active volcanoes in Chile , South America at around 4 @,@ 200 metres ( 13 @,@ 800 ft ) above mean sea level . The valley is home to approximately 80 geysers at present . It became the largest geyser field in the Southern Hemisphere after the destruction of many of the New Zealand geysers , and is the third largest geyser field in the world . The salient feature of these geysers is that the height of their eruptions is very low , the tallest being only 6 metres ( 20 ft ) high , but with steam columns that can be over 20 metres ( 66 ft ) high . The average geyser eruption height at El Tatio is about 750 millimetres ( 30 in ) . 
 = = = Taupo Volcanic Zone , New Zealand = = = 
 The Taupo Volcanic Zone is located on New Zealand 's North Island . It is 350 kilometres ( 217 mi ) long by 50 km wide ( 31 mi ) and lies over a subduction zone in the Earth 's crust . Mount Ruapehu marks its southwestern end , while the submarine Whakatane volcano ( 85 km or 53 mi beyond White Island ) is considered its northeastern limit . Many geysers in this zone were destroyed due to geothermal developments and a hydroelectric reservoir , but several dozen geysers still exist . In the beginning of the 20th century , the largest geyser ever known , the Waimangu Geyser existed in this zone . It began erupting in 1900 and erupted periodically for four years until a landslide changed the local water table . Eruptions of Waimangu would typically reach 160 metres ( 520 ft ) and some <unk> are known to have reached 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) . Recent scientific work indicates that the Earth 's crust below the zone may be as little as 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) thick . Beneath this lies a film of magma 50 km wide ( 31 mi ) and 160 km long ( 99 mi ) . 
 = = = Iceland = = = 
 Due to the high rate of volcanic activity in Iceland , it is home to some famous geysers in the world . Geysers and hot springs are distributed all over the island . Many of the geysers are located in <unk> . Geysers are known to have existed in at least a dozen other areas on the island . The Great Geysir , which first erupted in the 14th century , gave rise to the word geyser . By 1896 , Geysir was almost dormant before an earthquake that year caused eruptions to begin again , occurring several times a day , but in 1916 , eruptions all but ceased . Throughout much of the 20th century , eruptions , usually following earthquakes , did happen from time to time . Some man @-@ made improvements were made to the spring and eruptions were forced with soap on special occasions . Earthquakes in June 2000 subsequently reawakened the giant for a time but it is not currently erupting regularly . The nearby <unk> geyser erupts every 5 – 8 minutes to a height of some 30 metres ( 98 ft ) . 
 = = = Extinct and dormant geyser fields = = = 
 There used to be two large geysers fields in Nevada — <unk> and Steamboat Springs — but they were destroyed by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants . At the plants , geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local water table to the point that geyser activity could no longer be sustained . 
 Many of New Zealand ’ s geysers have been destroyed by humans in the last century . Several New Zealand geysers have also become dormant or extinct by natural means . The main remaining field is <unk> at Rotorua . Two thirds of the geysers at <unk> <unk> were flooded by the <unk> hydroelectric dam in 1961 . The Wairakei field was lost to a geothermal power plant in 1958 . The Taupo Spa field was lost when the Waikato River level was deliberately altered in the 1950s . The <unk> field was destroyed by the Mount Tarawera eruption in 1886 . 
 = = <unk> geysers = = 
 There are various other types of geysers which are different in nature compared to the normal steam @-@ driven geysers . These geysers differ not only in their style of eruption but also in the cause that makes them erupt . Such geysers are not true geysers but are yet referred as such as they all emit water under pressure . 
 = = = Artificial geysers = = = 
 In a number of places where there is geothermal activity , wells have been drilled and fitted with impermeable casements that allow them to erupt like geysers . The vents of such geysers are artificial , but are tapped into natural hydrothermal systems . These so @-@ called artificial geysers , technically known as erupting geothermal wells , are not true geysers . Little Old Faithful Geyser , in Calistoga , California , is an example . The geyser erupts from the casing of a well drilled in the late 19th century . According to Dr. John Rinehart in his book A Guide to Geyser Gazing ( 1976 p . 49 ) , a man had drilled into the geyser in search for water . He had actually " simply opened up a dead geyser " . 
 = = = Cold @-@ water geysers = = = 
 The eruptions of cold @-@ water geysers are similar to those of their hot @-@ water counterparts , except that CO2 @-@ bubbles drive the eruption instead of steam . In cold @-@ water geysers , CO2 @-@ laden water lies in a confined aquifer , in which water and CO2 are trapped by less permeable overlying strata . This water and CO2 can escape this strata only in weak regions like faults , joints , or drilled wells . A drilled borehole provides an escape for the pressurized water and CO2 to reach the surface . The magnitude and frequency of such eruptions depend on various factors such as plumbing depth , CO2 concentrations , aquifer yield etc . The column of water exerts enough pressure on the gaseous CO2 so that it remains in the water in small bubbles . When the pressure decreases due to formation of a fissure , the CO2 bubbles expand . This expansion displaces the water and causes the eruption . Cold @-@ water geysers may look quite similar to their steam @-@ driven counterparts ; however , often CO2 @-@ laden water is more white and frothy . The best known of these is probably Crystal Geyser , near Green River , Utah . There are also two cold @-@ water geysers in Germany , <unk> Born ( a.k.a. <unk> ) and <unk> Geyser ( a.k.a. <unk> <unk> ) , and one in Slovakia , <unk> . 
 = = = Perpetual <unk> = = = 
 This is a natural hot spring that spouts water constantly without stopping for recharge . Some of these are incorrectly called geysers , but because they are not periodic in nature they are not considered true geysers . 
 = = Commercialization = = 
 Geysers are used for various activities such as electricity generation , heating and tourism . Many geothermal reserves are found all around the world . The geyser fields in Iceland are some of the most commercially viable geyser locations in the world . Since the 1920s hot water directed from the geysers has been used to heat greenhouses and to grow food that otherwise could not have been cultivated in Iceland 's inhospitable climate . Steam and hot water from the geysers has also been used for heating homes since 1943 in Iceland . In 1979 the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) actively promoted development of geothermal energy in the " Geysers @-@ Calistoga Known Geothermal Resource Area " ( <unk> ) near Calistoga , California through a variety of research programs and the Geothermal Loan Guarantee Program . The Department is obligated by law to assess the potential environmental impacts of geothermal development .

 There are several bodies in the Solar System where jet @-@ like eruptions , often termed cryogeysers ( cryo meaning " icy cold " ) , have been observed or are believed to occur . Unlike geysers on Earth , these represent eruptions of volatiles , together with entrained dust or ice particles , without liquid . 
 Enceladus 
 Geyser @-@ like plumes of water vapour , together with ice particles and smaller amounts of other components ( such as carbon dioxide , nitrogen , ammonia , hydrocarbons and silicates ) , have been observed erupting from vents associated with the " tiger stripes " in the south polar region of Saturn 's moon Enceladus by the Cassini orbiter . The mechanism by which the plumes are generated remains uncertain , but they are believed to be powered at least in part by tidal heating resulting from orbital eccentricity due to a 2 : 1 mean @-@ motion orbital resonance with the moon Dione . These jets are believed to be the source of Saturn 's E Ring . 
 Europa 
 In December 2013 , the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes above the south polar region of Europa , one of Jupiter 's Galilean moons . It is thought that Europa 's lineae might be venting this water vapor into space , caused by similar processes also occurring on Enceladus . 
 Mars 
 Similar solar @-@ heating @-@ driven jets of gaseous carbon dioxide are believed to erupt from the south polar cap of Mars each spring . Although these eruptions have not yet been directly observed , they leave evidence in the form of dark spots and lighter fans atop the dry ice , representing sand and dust carried aloft by the eruptions , and a spider @-@ like pattern of grooves created below the ice by the out @-@ rushing gas . 
 Triton 
 One of the great surprises of the Voyager 2 flyby of Neptune in 1989 was the discovery of geyser @-@ like eruptions on its moon Triton . Astronomers noticed dark plumes rising to some 8 km above the surface , and depositing material up to 150 km downwind . These plumes represent invisible jets of gaseous nitrogen , together with dust . All the geysers observed were located close to Triton 's subsolar point , indicating that solar heating drives the eruptions . It is thought that the surface of Triton probably consists of a semi @-@ transparent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate , which creates a kind of " solid greenhouse effect " , heating and vaporizing nitrogen below the ice surface it until the pressure breaks the surface at the start of an eruption . Voyager 's images of Triton 's southern hemisphere show many streaks of dark material laid down by geyser activity . 
 = The Hudsucker Proxy = 
 The Hudsucker Proxy is a 1994 comedy film co @-@ written , produced , and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . Sam Raimi co @-@ wrote the script and served as second unit director . The film stars Tim Robbins as a naïve business @-@ school graduate who is installed as president of a manufacturing company , Jennifer Jason Leigh as a newspaper reporter , and Paul Newman as a company director who hires the young man as part of a stock scam . 
 The script was finished in 1985 , but production did not start until 1991 , when Joel Silver acquired the script for Silver Pictures . Warner Bros. subsequently agreed to distribute the film , with further financing from PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films . Filming at Carolco Studios in Wilmington , North Carolina lasted from November 1992 to March 1993 . The New York City scale model set was designed by Micheal J. McAlister and Mark Stetson , with further effects provided by The Computer Film Company . Upon its release in March 1994 , The Hudsucker Proxy received mixed reviews from critics , and was a box office flop . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In December 1958 , Norville Barnes ( Tim Robbins ) , a business college graduate from Muncie , Indiana , arrives in New York City looking for a job . He struggles due to lack of experience and becomes a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries . Meanwhile , the company 's founder and president , Waring Hudsucker ( Charles Durning ) , unexpectedly commits suicide during a business meeting by jumping out of a top @-@ floor window . Afterwards , Sidney J. Mussburger ( Paul Newman ) , a ruthless member of the board of directors , learns Hudsucker 's stock shares will be soon sold to the public ; he mounts a scheme to buy the controlling interest in the company by temporarily depressing the stock price by hiring an incompetent president to replace Hudsucker . 
 In the mailroom , Norville is assigned to deliver a " Blue Letter " , a top @-@ secret communication from Hudsucker , sent shortly before his death , to Mussburger . However , Norville takes the opportunity to pitch an invention he 's been working on which turns out to be a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation , " you know , for kids . " Believing Norville to be an idiot , Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker . Across town , Amy Archer ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) , a brassy Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus , is assigned to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is . She gets a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary , pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from Muncie . One night , Amy searches the building to find clues and meets Moses , a man who operates the tower 's giant clock and knows " just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker " . He tells her Mussburger 's plot , and she takes the story back to her Chief ( John Mahoney ) , but he does not believe a word of it . 
 The other executives decide to produce Norville 's invention in hopes that it will flop and depress the company 's stock . The invention turns out to be the hula hoop , which initially fails but then turns into an enormous success . Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon . Amy , who had fallen for his naive charm , is infuriated over Norville 's new attitude and leaves him . Buzz , the eager elevator operator , pitches a new invention : the flexi @-@ straw . Norville dismisses it and fires Buzz . Meanwhile , Aloysius ( Harry <unk> ) , a Hudsucker janitor , discovers Amy 's true identity and informs Mussburger . Mussburger reveals Amy 's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year . Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital . 
 On New Year 's Eve , Amy finds Norville drunk at a beatnik bar . She apologizes , but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz , whom Mussburger had convinced that Norville had stolen the hula hoop idea . Norville escapes to the top floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform . He climbs out on the ledge , where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight . All of a sudden , Moses stops the clock and time freezes . Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him the Blue Letter that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger contains a legal document indicating that Hudsucker 's shares would go to his immediate successor , who is now Norville . Moses fights and defeats Aloysius inside the tower , allowing Norville to fall safely to the ground . Norville and Amy reconcile . As 1959 progresses , it is Mussburger who is sent to the asylum while Norville develops a new invention " for kids " , an enigmatic circle on a folded sheet of paper that will ultimately turn out to be a frisbee .

 The Coen brothers first met Sam Raimi when Joel Coen worked as an assistant editor on Raimi 's The Evil Dead ( 1981 ) . Together , they began writing the script for The Hudsucker Proxy in 1981 , and continued during the filming of Crimewave ( 1985 ) , and post @-@ production on Blood Simple ( 1985 ) , in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi . The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of Preston Sturges , such as Christmas in July ( 1940 ) and the Hollywood satire , Sullivan 's Travels ( 1941 ) . The sentimental tone and decency of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of Frank Capra , like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town ( 1936 ) , Meet John Doe ( 1941 ) , and It 's a Wonderful Life ( 1946 ) . The dialogue is an homage to Howard Hawks ' His Girl Friday ( 1940 ) , while Jennifer Jason Leigh 's performance as fast @-@ talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn , in both the physical and vocal mannerisms . Other movies that observers found references to include Executive Suite ( 1954 ) and Sweet Smell of Success ( 1957 ) . The brothers had no intention commenting on or parodying such movies , instead as Ethan said " It 's the case where , having seen those movies , we say ' They 're really fun - let 's do one ; as opposed to ' They 're really <unk> let 's comment upon them . " Raimi describes the script as " " big @-@ business comedy . It 's a return to the very large love story comedies they used to make in the forties and early fifties . " So they brothers started to pace around their apartment , taking turns on the typewriter , and when they found themselves stuck at a point , Raimi would do all sorts of trick to get the boys back up . For example , While Ethan is pacing around , he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off , He even said he threw firecrackers at them . 
 One film critic described the numerous influences : " From his <unk> name to his physical clumsiness , Norville Barnes is a Preston Sturges hero trapped in a Frank Capra story , and never should that twain meet , especially not in a world that seems to have been created by Fritz Lang – the mechanistic <unk> of the mailroom contrasted with the Bauhaus gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss @-@ labour split in Metropolis ( 1927 ) . " An interviewer proposed that the characters represent capitalism versus labour economics . Joel Coen replied : " Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned , but that question is independent of whether or not we 're interested in them – and we 're not . " The Hudsucker Proxy presents various narrative motifs pertaining to the Rota <unk> and visual motifs concerning the shape of circles . This includes Moses ' monologue at the beginning , the Hudsucker Clock , Mussburger 's wristwatch , the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee , as well as Norville and Amy 's conversation about Karma . 
 The first image the Coens and Raimi conceived was of Norville Barnes about to jump from the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him . The inclusion of the hula hoop came as a result of a plot device . Joel remembers , " We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous . Something that would seem , by any sort of rational measure , to be doomed to failure , but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success . " Ethan said , " The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie , and that just made it seem more appropriate . " Joel : " What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie . The tension between vertical lines and circles ; you have these tall buildings , then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot ... in the structure of the movie itself . It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning , with a big flashback . " It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay . As early as 1985 , the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project " takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business . The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes . " 
 Despite having finished the script in 1985 , Joel explained , " We couldn 't make Hudsucker back then because we weren 't that popular yet . Plus , the script was too expensive and we had just completed Blood Simple , which was an independent film . " After completing Barton Fink ( 1991 ) , the Coens were looking forward to doing a more mainstream film . The Hudsucker Proxy was revived and the Coens and Raimi performed a brief rewrite . Producer Joel Silver , a fan of the Coens ' previous films , acquired the script for his production company , Silver Pictures , and pitched the project at Warner Bros. Pictures . Silver also allowed the Coens complete artistic control .

 This was the first time the Coen brothers chose big stars to act in their movie . Joel Silver 's first choice for Norville Barnes was Tom Cruise , but the Coens persisted in a desire to cast Tim Robbins . Winona Ryder and Bridget Fonda were in competition for the role of Amy Archer before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast . Leigh had previously auditioned for a role in the Coens 's Miller 's Crossing and Barton Fink . Her failed auditions prompted the Coens to cast her in The Hudsucker Proxy . To prepare for her role as Amy Archer , Leigh read the biographies some of the most substantial ladies of the thirties and forties such as , Rosalind Russell , Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur . When casting the role of Sidney Mussburger , " Warner Bros. suggested all sorts of names , " remembered Joel . " A lot of them were comedians who were clearly wrong . Mussburger is the bad guy and Paul Newman brought that character to life . " However , the Coens first offered the role to Clint Eastwood , but he was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts . 
 Once Newman and Robbins signed on , PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films agreed to co @-@ finance the film with Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures . The film was shot on five sound stages at Carolco Studios in Wilmington , North Carolina beginning on November 30 , 1992 . Raimi served as second unit director , shooting the hula hoop sequence and Waring Hudsucker 's suicide . Production designer Dennis Gassner was influenced by fascist architecture , particularly the work of Albert Speer , as well as Terry Gilliam 's Brazil ( 1985 ) , Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art Deco movement . Gassner contemplated using five huge rooms needed to accommodate the sound stages . Gassner noted " You see , we wanted things to be big . " He said that the huge 1950 's @-@ inspired table up in the boardroom was so long , it had to be built in five sections and later on assembled on the soundstage . The intention for the set sizes was to generate an oppressive feel . Principal photography ended on March 18 , 1993 . 
 In addition , numerous sequences were filmed in downtown Chicago , particularly in the Merchandise Mart building for the entrance and lobby to Hudsucker Industries and the Hilton Chicago Christmas ballroom . 
 The presses in the News & Observer building in downtown Raleigh , North Carolina appeared in the movie .

 The visual effects supervisor was Michael J. McAlister ( Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , Willow ) with Mark Stetson ( Superman Returns , Peter Pan ) as miniatures supervisor . Peter Chesney , mechanical effects designer on many Coen brothers films , created a pair of 16 @-@ foot angel wings for actor Charles Durning , who portrayed Waring Hudsucker . " I made a complicated steel armature with a lot of electric motors to time everything so he can fold up his wings , unfold them and flap them about . Then we covered them with real duck and turkey feathers , " says Chesney . " We modeled them after photographs of a hovering dove landing in slow motion . " The buildings in the background ( designed by McAlister and Stetson ) were 1 : 24 scale models , shot separately and merged in post @-@ production . To lengthen the sequence , the model of the Hudsucker building was the equivalent of 90 stories , not 45 . 
 Despite the New York City setting , additional skyscrapers in Chicago , Illinois provided inspiration for the opening sequence of the skyline , such as the Merchandise Mart and Aon Center . Skyscrapers from New York City included the <unk> Building , the Fred F. French Building and One Wall Street , Manhattan . " We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and sort of put them into one neighborhood , " Gassner continued , " a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor . " First of all , a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950 's New York for the opening shot . So a miniature city was created , as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of 1950 's New York skyline , instead they wanted a more stylized version of it . So Gassner used the book New York in The Forties as a reference to create the look for the cityscape . It took three months and 27 crew member to create the miniature city at the scale of 24 : 1 . As for the Hudsucker building , they made it at the scale of 6 : 1 for closer shots including the long @-@ zoom in of Norville at the beginning . For that scene to be created , it started off with a wide angle shot , moving closer towards Tim Robbins , who was standing in a full sized set , which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock . ‘ Marrying a live @-@ action image with a painted or miniature element was , of course , nothing new , however , in the case of the zoom @-@ in on Robbins from such a distance , keeping the full @-@ size set locked in with the model building , ‘ that was state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art and the only way to do it was with computers . ’ says McAlister . Most of the buildings were created with two sides only , as they will only be seen from the front and the side , and some only needed one side as they were only going to be seen from the front , while the Hudsucker building was made completely three @-@ dimensional . The work of The Computer Film Company ( supervised by Janek <unk> ) included manipulations of the zoom @-@ in shot of Norville at the beginning , as well as CGI snow and composites of the falling sequences . 
 To create the two suicide falls , the miniature New York set was hung sideways to allow full movement along the heights of the buildings . McAlister calculated that such a drop would take seven seconds , but for dramatic purposes it was extended to around thirty . Problems occurred when the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins decided that these shots would be more effective with a wide @-@ angle lens . " The buildings had been designed for an 18 mm lens , but as we tried a 14 mm lens , and then a 10 mm , we liked the shots more and more . " However , the wider amount of vision meant that the edges of the frame went beyond the fringes of the model city , leaving empty spaces with no buildings . In the end , extra buildings were created from putting the one @-@ sided buildings together and placing them at the edges . Charles Durning 's fall was shot conventionally , but because Tim Robbins had to stop abruptly at the camera , his was shot in reverse as he was pulled away from the camera . 
 According to <unk> Magazine # 74 ( July 1998 ) , the skyscraper models created for The Hudsucker Proxy were re @-@ used for Godzilla .

 The score to The Hudsucker Proxy was written by Carter Burwell , the fifth of his collaborations with the Coen Brothers . " Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia " from the ballet Spartacus by Khachaturian is the basis of the main theme and additional music from the ballet runs under the Hula @-@ Hoop sequence . The popular music of the time is also reflected in the character of Vic <unk> , played by Peter Gallagher and modeled after Dean Martin , who sings " Memories Are Made of This . " Additional inspiration comes from Aram Khachaturian 's Gayane suite . A section from the ballet is used by Burwell for the scene in which Norville and Amy meet for the first time . The composer 's " Sabre Dance " ( from Gayane ) is also used when the boy is the first to try the hula hoop .

 Warner Bros. held test screenings and audience comments were largely mixed . The studio suggested re @-@ shoots , but the Coens , who held final cut privilege , refused because they were very nervous working with their biggest budget to date and were eager for mainstream success . The producers eventually added footage that had been cut and also shot minor pick @-@ ups for the ending . Variety magazine claimed that the pick @-@ ups were done to try to save the film because Warner feared it was going to be a box office bomb . Joel Coen addressed the issue in an interview : " First of all , they weren 't reshoots . They were a little bit of additional footage . We wanted to shoot a fight scene at the end of the movie . It was the product of something we discovered editing the movie , not previewing it . We 've done additional shooting on every movie , so it 's normal . " 
 The film premiered in January 1994 at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City , Utah . In addition , The Hudsucker Proxy was screened at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival on May 12 , 1994 .

 Along with the film 's being a disappointment at the box office , The Hudsucker Proxy opened to lukewarm reviews from critics . Rotten Tomatoes reports 58 % approval based on 40 reviews with the consensus : " <unk> strange and visually distinctive , The Hudsucker Proxy is ultimately almost -- but not quite -- as smart and absorbing as it needs to be . " 
 Roger Ebert praised the production design , scale model work , matte paintings , cinematography , and characters . " But the problem with the movie is that it 's all surface and no substance , " Ebert wrote . " Not even the slightest attempt is made to suggest that the film takes its own story seriously . Everything is style . The performances seem deliberately angled as satire . " Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described The Hudsucker Proxy as being " pointlessly flashy and compulsively overloaded with references to films of the 1930s . Missing in this film 's performances is a sense of humanity , the crucial ingredient in the movies Hudsucker is clearly trying to evoke . Hudsucker isn 't the real thing at all . It 's just a proxy . " 
 Todd McCarthy , writing in Variety , called the film " one of the most inspired and technically stunning pastiches of old Hollywood pictures ever to come out of the New Hollywood . But a pastiche it remains , as nearly everything in the Coen brothers ' latest and biggest film seems like a <unk> but artificial synthesis , leaving a hole in the middle where some emotion and humanity should be . " James Berardinelli gave a largely positive review . " The Hudsucker Proxy skewers Big Business on the same shaft that Robert Altman ran Hollywood through with The Player . From the Brazil @-@ like scenes in the cavernous mail room to the convoluted machinations in the board room , this film is pure satire of the nastiest and most enjoyable sort . In this surreal world of 1958 can be found many of the issues confronting large corporations in the 1990s , all twisted to match the filmmakers ' vision . " 
 Warner Home Video released The Hudsucker Proxy on DVD in May 1999 . No featurettes were included . It was one of the first Blu @-@ Ray Disc titles released through the Warner Archive Collection in 2013 , but it still lacked any featurettes . 
 Two decades after the film 's release , Scout <unk> of RogerEbert.com praised the film for its stylistic adventurousness and expansion upon the themes and concepts of the films that inspired it . " Whereas the comedies of the 1930s and ' 40s could talk quickly and move quickly , they couldn 't run at a full gallop like the Coen Brothers . Their camera soars , traveling at the speed of progress , gossip , capitalism itself . Everything races at top speed . The production design , the one thing everyone felt comfortable praising , is a marvel . Every frame doubles as a survey of early modern art , from Art Deco to Futurism . " 
 = William Longchamp = 
 William Longchamp ( died 1197 ) , sometimes known as William de Longchamp or William de Longchamps , was a medieval Lord Chancellor , Chief Justiciar , and Bishop of Ely in England . Born to a humble family in Normandy , he owed his advancement to royal favour . Although contemporary writers accused Longchamp 's father of being the son of a peasant , he held land as a knight . Longchamp first served an illegitimate son of King Henry II , but quickly transferred to the service of Richard I , Henry 's eldest surviving son . When Richard became King in 1189 , Longchamp paid £ 3 @,@ 000 for the office of Chancellor , and was soon named to the see , or bishopric , of Ely and appointed legate by the pope . 
 Longchamp governed England while Richard was on the Third Crusade , but his authority was challenged by Richard 's brother , John , who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England . Longchamp 's relations with the other leading English nobles were also strained , which contributed to the demands for his exile . Soon after Longchamp 's departure from England , Richard was captured on his journey back to England from the crusade and held for ransom by Henry VI , Holy Roman Emperor . Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard 's release . Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard 's return to England , he lost much of his former power . He aroused a great deal of hostility among his contemporaries during his career , but he retained Richard 's trust and was employed by the king until the bishop 's death in 1197 . Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law , which remained well known throughout the later Middle Ages . 
 = = Background and early life = = 
 Longchamp 's ancestors originated in the village of Longchamps , Normandy , but he was born near the Norman village of <unk> . His father , Hugh de Longchamp , also held land in England , as did many other Norman nobles after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 . Hugh Nonant — one of Longchamp 's opponents — declared that the elder Longchamp was the son of a peasant , which seems unlikely , as Hugh de Longchamp appears to have held a knight 's tenancy in Normandy . The family was originally of humble background , but rose through service to King Henry II . The elder Longchamp also held land in Herefordshire in England , including the manor of Wilton near Ross in Wales . Hugh married a woman named Eve , a relative of the Lacy family . Historian David Balfour suggests that Eve was the daughter of Gilbert de Lacy , the son of Roger de Lacy , exiled by King William II in 1095 for rebellion . 
 Longchamp 's sister , <unk> , married the castellan of Dover Castle . A second sister , <unk> , came to England with Longchamp , but otherwise is unknown . A sister is recorded as having married Stephen Devereux , but whether this is <unk> is unclear . Of Longchamp 's brothers , Osbert remained a layman , and owed much of his advancement to William ; Stephen served King Richard I on crusade ; Henry , another layman , became a sheriff along with Osbert ; and Robert became a monk . Two of Longchamp 's brothers became abbots . 
 Longchamp entered public life at the close of Henry II 's reign , as an official for the King 's illegitimate son Geoffrey . He soon left Geoffrey 's service , and served in Henry II 's chancery , or writing office , before he entered service with Henry 's son Richard . Richard , who was Duke of Aquitaine at the time , named Longchamp chancellor of the Duchy of Aquitaine . Longchamp first distinguished himself at the court of King Philip II of France in Paris in 1189 , when he acted as Richard 's envoy in a dispute with William Marshall , King Henry 's envoy . By that time , Longchamp was already one of Richard 's trusted advisors . 
 = = Chancellor and Justiciar = = 
 On Richard 's accession to the throne of England in 1189 Longchamp became Chancellor of England . Longchamp paid 3 @,@ 000 pounds ( £ ) for the office of Chancellor . This was followed by an increase in the price of having chancery documents sealed with the Great Seal , necessary for their authentication , perhaps to help Longchamp recoup the cost of office . At the council held at Pipewell on 15 September 1189 , the king raised Longchamp to the bishopric of Ely . Richard named three other bishops at the same time : Godfrey de Lucy to Winchester , Richard FitzNeal to London , and Hubert Walter to Salisbury . Longchamp was consecrated on 31 December 1189 and enthroned at Ely on 6 January 1190 . 
 Before leaving England in 1189 , Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp 's hands and appointed him jointly with Hugh de Puiset , the Bishop of Durham , to the office of Chief Justiciar , at that time not strictly a judicial office . Instead , the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king 's authority when the king was outside the kingdom , able to act in the king 's name . Along with Puiset , the king named Hugh Bardulf , William Briwerre , Geoffrey fitz Peter , and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship , under Puiset and Longchamp . As Justiciar , Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits , even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary . Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together , and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh , and authority south of the river to Longchamp . Historian 's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time , or if in theory the two were supposed to co @-@ equal in their respective spheres . By June , Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar 's office . He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time . Supposedly Richard paid 1 @,@ 500 marks ( £ 1 @,@ 000 ) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp . 
 Longchamp granted the citizens of London the right to elect their own sheriffs , and to collect and remit their monetary levy of £ 300 directly to the Exchequer , the treasury of England . On Longchamp 's visits to his diocese he was accompanied by a large train of retainers and animals , which became notorious throughout the country as a sign of his extravagance . Under his legatine authority , the bishop held legatine councils of the church at Gloucester and Westminster in 1190 . He also acted to restore authority in York , which had suffered a breakdown in order after the massacre of Jews in March 1190 . Also in 1190 , he sent an army against Rhys ap Gruffydd , a Welsh prince who was attempting to throw off the control of the marcher lords that surrounded Wales . 
 = = Disputes with John = = 
 Longchamp 's relations with the English people were made more difficult because he was a native of Normandy , and often insensitive to English customs . The medieval writer William of Newburgh claimed that Longchamp was " an obscure foreigner of unproven ability and loyalty " . For example , it appears likely that Longchamp did not speak English , making his relations with his flock more difficult . The leading nobles complained that Longchamp marginalised the other officials Richard had appointed to serve with him , and that he brought in foreigners to fill offices . Although the first charge is mostly untrue , the second appears to have been valid , as Longchamp did install non @-@ natives in judicial offices and as sheriffs . He also attempted to seize control of a number of English castles by granting their custody to relatives and dependents . 
 Throughout 1190 , Longchamp 's relations with Richard 's younger brother John were difficult . This led to Longchamp besieging Lincoln Castle because the castellan would not surrender the castle and allow himself to be replaced by Longchamp 's nominee . The castellan , Gerard de <unk> , had sworn allegiance to John and stated he would no longer recognise the chancellor 's authority . In response , John took the two castles of Tickhill and Northampton . News of the dispute reached Richard , who sent Walter de Coutances , the Archbishop of Rouen , to England in late spring 1191 , with orders to negotiate a peace between John and Longchamp . Eventually , Walter brokered a compromise between the two as a result of which Gerard was confirmed as castellan and John relinquished the castles . Longchamp also agreed to work to ensure John 's succession to the throne in the event of Richard 's death . 
 Longchamp 's legatine commission from the papacy expired in spring 1191 , on the death of Clement III , thus removing one of Longchamp 's power bases . The legation was , however , renewed a few months later by Clement 's successor , Celestine III . A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191 , when Henry II 's illegitimate son Geoffrey , Archbishop of York , was arrested by Longchamp 's subordinates , led by the castellan of Dover Castle , Longchamp 's brother @-@ in @-@ law . Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop 's return to England , but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans , and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin 's Priory . Longchamp 's men laid siege to the priory , and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey . The violence of the attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket 's martyrdom , and public opinion turned against Longchamp . Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard , but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival . 
 An intense propaganda campaign led by partisans of John ensued . One of the leaders of the campaign against Longchamp was Hugh Nonant , the Bishop of Coventry , and he along with other magnates , including Geoffrey , who had been released , convened a trial on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London . Longchamp did not attend , but he was deposed and excommunicated , and after trying to hold the Tower of London , he was forced to surrender due to lack of support from the citizens of London . The council then declared his offices forfeit , and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody . The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour . 
 Longchamp went to Dover in late 1191 to seek transport to the continent . During his escape , he was unable to answer the local people when they spoke to him in English . He attempted to leave England in various disguises , including a monk 's habit and women 's clothes . Hugh Nonant wrote that Longchamp attempted on one occasion to hide dressed as a prostitute , which led to him being assaulted by a fisherman who mistook him for a whore . Longchamp eventually succeeded in leaving England , on 29 October . 
 = = Exile and return = = 
 Longchamp went to the court of Henry VI , the Holy Roman Emperor , who was holding King Richard I captive at <unk> . The bishop arranged for Richard to be held at the imperial court and negotiated a payment plan for the ransom , 100 @,@ 000 marks , under the terms of which the emperor agreed to release Richard once 70 @,@ 000 marks had been paid and hostages for the payment of the rest had been received . When the Emperor in January 1194 called a meeting of the imperial magnates to debate King Philip II of France 's offer to pay the Emperor to keep Richard captive , Longchamp attended along with Walter of Coutances and Eleanor of Aquitaine , Richard 's mother . After further diplomatic wrangling , Richard was freed on 4 February 1194 . 
 Richard rewarded Longchamp with the custody of Eye and an appointment as Sheriff of Essex and Sheriff of Hertfordshire when the pair returned to England , but Longchamp soon became embroiled in a renewal of his disagreement with Archbishop Geoffrey of York . Richard left England in May 1194 , and Longchamp accompanied him to the continent , never to return to England ; Longchamp returned to the Emperor 's court in 1195 . Richard continued to use Longchamp in diplomacy — although it was Geoffrey who arranged a truce with King Philip in 1194 — as well as retaining the bishop as chancellor , but the main power in England was now Hubert Walter . Longchamp spent the rest of his life outside his diocese , usually accompanying the king . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Longchamp died in January 1197 , at Poitiers , while on a diplomatic mission to Rome for Richard , and was buried at the abbey of Le Pin . Much of the information on his career comes from people hostile to him , for example , Gerald of Wales called Longchamp that " monster with many heads " . The historian Austin Lane Poole says that Gerald described Longchamp as more like an ape than a man . Longchamp was reportedly a cultured and well @-@ educated man . He was supported by others among his contemporaries , including Pope Clement III , who , when he appointed Longchamp legate , wrote that he did so at the urging of the English bishops . When he was one of four men named bishop in 1189 , medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes wrote that the four new bishops were " men of no little virtue and fame " . Historian John Gillingham wrote that Longchamp 's " record of his life in politics and administration was a good one , spoiled only by his failure in 1191 " . 
 One of Longchamp 's probable innovations as chancellor was the replacement of the first person singular previously used in documents drafted in the king 's name with the majestic plural or " royal we " . He wrote a work on law entitled <unk> legum et <unk> , a manual on the usage of both civil and canon law in the Angevin possessions on the continent , composed sometime between 1181 and 1189 . It was well known in the Middle Ages , and served as a practical guide for those involved in litigation . The medieval poet Nigel <unk> ( also known as Nigel de Longchamps ) dedicated to the bishop a satirical poem , Speculum <unk> ( " Mirror of Fools " ) , on the habits of students . Richard Barre , a medieval writer and judge , dedicated his work Compendium de <unk> et novo testamento to Longchamp . Longchamp was one of Barre 's patrons , and secured the post of Archdeacon of Ely for him as well as judicial posts . 
 Two writers have seen in the assembly that met to try Longchamp in 1191 a precursor to the gathering at Runnymede in 1215 that drew up Magna Carta , as it was one of the earliest examples of the nobles of the realm coming together to force the government to rule with their advice . Longchamp also promoted the careers of his brothers ; Henry and Osbert became sheriffs in the 1190s , Osbert the Sheriff of Yorkshire . His brother Robert , a cleric , also benefitted , becoming prior of the Ely cathedral chapter and later abbot of St Mary 's Abbey , York .

 Hawk made his wrestling debut in 1949 . He began as an amateur in Ohio and was discovered by professional boxer Jack Dempsey , who convinced him to wrestle professionally . His ring name came from a variety of sources : his sister called him " Rip " as a nickname , while a promoter gave him the last name " Hawk " due to his nose and his movements in the wrestling ring . His nickname , " The Profile " , was taken from actor John Barrymore . He began wrestling professionally in Ohio around his 18th birthday , and later moved to Chicago , where he trained for a year with Karl <unk> . He also briefly wrestled in New York . 
 Hawk was soon drafted to serve in the Korean War . He joined the United States Marine Corps and continued to wrestle during his service . He was discharged from the Marine Corps in 1954 , believing he could make a better living from wrestling . He competed in several territories after returning to the United States , including Tennessee and Atlanta , Georgia , Iowa . He later moved to Missouri , where he competed in St. Joseph and St. Louis . In St. Joseph , he had a scripted feud with Sonny Myers and Larry Hamilton . He continued to move around and held his first championship , the NWA Rocky Mountain Heavyweight Championship , while wrestling for NWA Western States Sports in 1958 . 
 = = = Jim Crockett Promotions = = = 
 Hawk moved to North Carolina in the early 1960s , where he began competing for Jim Crockett Promotions , an organization run by Jim Crockett , Sr. that promoted events in the Carolinas . He met fellow wrestler Swede Hanson and approached Crockett about forming a tag team with Hanson . Crockett agreed to the idea , and Hawk and Hanson began competing as the " Blond Bombers " , named after their matching blond hair and their strength in the ring . While competing in Australia , Hawk met manager Gary Hart . He approached Crockett and convinced him to bring Hart to the Carolinas to manage Hawk and Hanson . 
 The team competed as heels ( villains ) and was unique for wearing suits to their matches , as most wrestlers did not worry about dressing like professionals outside of the ring . They aroused anger from many spectators , some of whom threw acid or threatened the team with knives and guns . They also had a following among some fans , and a fan club was formed for them at one point . During interviews , Hawk spoke for the team while Hanson stood silently ; Hawk occasionally insulted Hanson in the interviews , but Hanson did not respond . The team competed in the Carolinas and Virginia , as well as touring overseas in Australia , New Zealand , and Japan . 
 Hawk wrestled in other territories , including Texas , where he held the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship and the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship ( the latter while teaming with Rock Hunter ) . Nine of his championships came as a member of the Blond Bombers , however . Hawk and Hanson were booked in an angle to win their first title together , the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship , on August 3 , 1965 . They combined to hold the NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Championship on four occasions , which was the center of their feud with Johnny Weaver and George Becker . They were also booked to win the IWA World Tag Team Championship on a wrestling tour of Tasmania . 
 The Blond Bombers were involved in a series of unusual matches in Jim Crockett Promotions ; they faced other heel tag teams , which was a rarity at the time because most promoters stuck to good versus evil storylines . They competed against such teams as Aldo <unk> and Bronko <unk> , Gene and Ole Anderson , and Skull Murphy and Brute Bernard . Hawk , along with Johnny Weaver , was also involved in booking , or scheduling , events in Jim Crockett Promotions , a task he took on in the early 1970s . He also collaborated with Johnny Ringo to design the National Wrestling Alliance logo . 
 In 1971 , Hanson suffered a heart attack and had to take time off of wrestling . Hawk competed as a singles wrestler and feuded with the Brisco brothers ( Jack and Jerry ) . During this rivalry , Hawk held the NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Championship four times . He was then paired with Ric Flair , who was billed as his nephew . On July 4 , 1974 , Hawk and Flair were booked the NWA Mid @-@ Atlantic Tag Team Championship . 
 Hanson returned to wrestling but soon became a face ( fan favorite ) and feuded with Hawk . The former partners faced each other in tag team matches in which Hanson teamed with Tiger Conway , Jr. and Hawk teamed with Flair . Eventually , the partners were dropped and the two faced each other in a series of singles matches . Hawk left Jim Crockett Promotions permanently in 1975 due to differences with booker George Scott . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Hawk then took on a new partner , Roger Kirby , with whom he held the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship twice over the next two years . Hawk and Hanson reunited as a tag team in Texas , where they competed for NWA Western States Sports . In 1976 and 1977 , they were booked to win the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship three times . After their final title reign , Hanson left to wrestle elsewhere while Hawk continued to wrestle in Texas . 
 Hawk and Hanson were inducted into the NWA Legends Hall of Heroes in 2007 . Hawk returned in 2008 to posthumously induct long @-@ time rival and real @-@ life friend Johnny Weaver .

 = New York State Route 37 = 
 New York State Route 37 ( NY 37 ) is a state highway in the North Country of New York in the United States , extending for 127 @.@ 40 miles ( 205 @.@ 03 km ) on a west – east axis . The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) in Pamelia , Jefferson County . Its eastern terminus is at a junction with US 11 , NY 11B , and NY 30 in Malone , Franklin County . In between the termini , NY 37 passes through Ogdensburg and Massena . It is a two @-@ lane , <unk> , full access roadway for most of its entire length , except for portions between Massena and western Franklin County , where the route widens to a four @-@ lane divided highway . 
 NY 37 was assigned in 1930 to the portion of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway between Redwood and Malone as well as to a previously unnumbered roadway between Watertown and Redwood . The Redwood – Malone portion was originally part of NY 3 when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 . NY 37 has since been rerouted in areas , primarily near Ogdensburg and Massena . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Watertown to Ogdensburg = = = 
 NY 37 begins at an intersection with US 11 just north of Watertown in the town of Pamelia . Between Watertown and Theresa , NY 37 follows a north – south alignment and parallels Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) , located just west of NY 37 . Southwest of Theresa , I @-@ 81 turns to the northwest as NY 37 intersects NY 26 and NY 411 , the westward continuation of NY 26 . NY 26 joins NY 37 around the western edge of the village before splitting to the northwest a short distance to the north . NY 37 , however , continues northward , passing through Redwood before curving northeast as it enters St. Lawrence County . 
 Across the county line , NY 37 parallels NY 12 to the north as both routes proceed northeast . Roughly 7 miles ( 11 km ) from the county line , NY 37 encounters Hammond , a small village located west of Black Lake . Past Hammond , Route 37 heads north toward Morristown , where it meets NY 12 , the primary roadway along the St. Lawrence River 's southern bank west of this point . NY 12 ends here ; however , NY 37 takes over the routing of NY 12 and proceeds northeast along the edge of the St. Lawrence River . Just east of NY 12 , NY 37 meets the northernmost point of NY 58 . 
 Midway between Morristown and Ogdensburg , NY 37 enters St. Lawrence State Park , one of many New York state parks located on the southern bank of the river . The route exits the park and heads northeast to Ogdensburg , where it meets NY 68 ( the former routing of NY 37 into Ogdensburg ) west of the city . While NY 68 continues into downtown , NY 37 turns eastward , then northeastward and bypasses the city to the south . Near the Ogdensburg International Airport , NY 37 meets NY 812 at an interchange . Here , NY 812 joins NY 37 and the two routes intersect NY 68 once more before leaving Ogdensburg . 
 = = = Ogdensburg to Massena = = = 
 Just outside Ogdensburg , NY 812 separates from NY 37 to continue northward to Canada over the Ogdensburg – Prescott International Bridge , where it becomes Highway 16 farther inland . NY 37 , however , continues to follow the south bank of the St. Lawrence River , passing Galop Island State Park on its way to Waddington , where it intersects the northernmost point on NY 345 . East of the village , NY 37 passes south of the riverside Coles Creek State Park and traverses Coles Creek itself . 
 In the Louisville hamlet of Louisville Corner ( west of Massena ) , NY 37 departs the St. Lawrence River and intersects the western end of NY 131 , a northerly bypass of Massena along the riverbank . Farther east in Massena , NY 37 intersects NY 37B , the former routing of NY 37 through Massena , west of the village before crossing over the Grasse River and intersecting the northern termini of both NY 56 ( where NY 37 widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway ) and NY 420 . NY 37B later rejoins NY 37 east of the village , as does NY 131 directly north of the Massena International Airport . 
 = = = Eastern St. Lawrence and Franklin counties = = = 
 East of the airport in the town of Massena , NY 37 begins to parallel the north bank of the Raquette River as it intersects NY 37C near a hamlet named for the waterway . NY 37 and the river continue northeast to the vicinity of the hamlet of Rooseveltown , where NY 37 formerly connected to a large traffic circle linking NY 37 to the Three Nations Crossing as well as County Route 45 ( CR 45 ) . The traffic circle has since been replaced with a T @-@ intersection and traffic light because of the expansion of the American Customs facility . Upon crossing into Franklin County and the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation a short distance to the east , the road narrows back to a two @-@ lane undivided highway and crosses over the Raquette River . 
 Although most of NY 37 in the town of Bombay is contained within the reservation , a short portion east of Hogansburg and the St. Regis River and west of Tarbell Road is located outside the reservation limits . Within this stretch , NY 37 meets both the eastern end of NY 37C and the northern terminus of NY 95 . East of the reservation , NY 37 roughly parallels the CSX Transportation @-@ owned Montreal Subdivision northeast to Fort Covington , where NY 37 crosses the railroad line and intersects Water Street ( unsigned NY <unk> ) , a connector to Quebec Route 132 on the northern side of the Canadian border . 
 East of Fort Covington , NY 37 follows a more southeasterly routing as it separates from the northernmost extents of the state . In the Westville hamlet of Westville Center , NY 37 meets the western terminus of NY 122 . Farther south , NY 37 enters the village of Malone , where it terminates at US 11 , NY 11B and NY 30 . 
 = = History = = 
 The portion of NY 37 from Redwood to Malone was originally part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway , an international auto trail connecting Portland , Maine , on the Atlantic Ocean coast to Portland , Oregon , east of the Pacific Ocean . When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , the entirety of the Roosevelt Highway in New York was designated NY 3 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 3 was rerouted to follow its current routing between Watertown and Plattsburgh . The former routing of NY 3 along the St. Lawrence River became part of the new NY 37 , which utilized a previously unnumbered highway between Watertown and Redwood via Theresa . Initially , NY 37 directly served Theresa by way of modern CR 136 , CR 46 , and CR 193 ; however , it was realigned c . 1934 to bypass the village to the west . 
 When NY 37 was first assigned , it entered Ogdensburg on Main Street ( modern NY 68 ) and exited the city on Ford Street and Proctor Avenue . East of the city , NY 37 used less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of its modern alignment before turning south to follow Van Rensselaer Road to Waddington . The modern , riverside alignment of NY 37 between Ogdensburg and Waddington was designated as NY 37A as part of the 1930 renumbering . In the late 1950s , the alignments of NY 37 and NY 37A were flipped , placing NY 37 on its current routing and NY 37A on Van Rensselaer Road . During the same time period , NY 37 was rerouted to follow a new bypass around the southern edge of Ogdensburg . 
 In the Massena area , NY 37 originally broke from its modern alignment west of the village and followed what is now NY 37B east to Main Street . Here , it turned south onto Main Street to traverse the Grasse River before continuing east on Orvis Street ( and meeting modern NY 37B at Center Street ) to reconnect to its current alignment east of the village . Lastly , from modern NY 131 adjacent to the Massena International Airport to Rooseveltown , NY 37 was initially routed on <unk> Road , NY 37C , and Roosevelt Road . In the mid @-@ 1950s , construction began on a new southern bypass of Massena that connected to NY 37 at the modern termini of NY 37B . It was completed and opened to traffic by 1958 . Work on an eastward , divided highway extension of the bypass to Rooseveltown began c . 1961 . The final section , from the hamlet of Raquette River to Rooseveltown , opened to traffic later that year . 
 = = Suffixed routes = = 
 NY 37 once had as many as four suffixed routes ; two have since been removed . 
 NY 37A was an alternate route of NY 37 between Ogdensburg and Waddington . It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to what is now NY 37 between the two locations . At the time , NY 37 was routed on Van Rensselaer Road . The alignments of NY 37 and NY 37A were flipped in the late 1950s . On April 10 , 1980 , the NY 37A designation was removed . Ownership and maintenance of Van Rensselaer Road was transferred from the state of New York to St. Lawrence County on September 1 , 1982 , at which time the highway was redesignated as CR 28 . 
 NY 37B ( 4 @.@ 03 miles or 6 @.@ 49 kilometres ) is the former routing of NY 37 through Massena . NY 37B leaves NY 37 west of the village and rejoins its parent just east of Massena . It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering . 
 NY 37C ( 9 @.@ 89 miles or 15 @.@ 92 kilometres ) is a loop off of NY 37 in northeastern St. Lawrence County and northwestern Franklin County . While NY 37 follows a direct east – west routing between Massena and the Bombay community of Hogansburg , NY 37C dips south to serve to the Brasher community of Helena . NY 37C was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering . 
 NY <unk> was a spur connecting NY 37 to NY 26 in Theresa , utilizing part of NY 37 's original alignment through the Theresa area . It was assigned c . 1936 and removed in the mid @-@ 1960s . It is now maintained by Jefferson County as CR 136 and CR 46 .

 = 2nd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division ( United States ) = 
 The 2nd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division , originally known as the 13th Infantry Brigade was an infantry brigade of the United States Army , and a part of the 7th Infantry Division . The brigade was based at Fort Ord , California for most of its history . 
 Activated for service in World War I , the unit saw brief service in the conflict , but never fought as an entire unit . After the Korean War , it was reactivated as a brigade , and was returned to the United States where it saw action in Operation Just Cause and Operation Golden Pheasant . The 2nd Brigade was sent to quell civil unrest resulting from the 1992 Los Angeles Riots . The brigade was finally deactivated in 1993 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 The 2nd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division was first constituted and activated in the regular army as the 13th Infantry Brigade on 6 December 1917 at Camp Wheeler , Georgia . One month later it organized and prepared for deployment to Europe to participate in World War I as a part of the American Expeditionary Force , along with the rest of the division . The 13th Infantry Brigade was one of two brigades assigned to the division headquarters , the other being the 14th Infantry Brigade . Serving within the brigade were the 34th Infantry Regiment and the 55th Infantry Regiment , bringing the total strength of the brigade to around 8 @,@ 000 men . Most of the brigade sailed to Europe aboard the SS Leviathan . 
 During its time in France , the brigade did not participate as a whole in any engagements , though its infantry and reconnaissance elements did engage German forces . On 11 October 1918 the 13th Brigade and 7th Division first came under shelling attacks . At Saint @-@ Mihiel the units also came under chemical attack . Elements of the 7th probed up toward Prény near the Moselle River , capturing positions and driving German forces out of the region . It was around this time that the division first received its shoulder sleeve insignia , which the 13th Brigade wore as a part of the division . 
 In early November , the 13th Brigade began readying itself for an attack on the Hindenburg Line with the division , which was part of the Second Army . The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre Plain , but before it could begin a full assault , the Allies signed an Armistice ending hostilities . After 33 days on the front lines , the 7th Division suffered 1 @,@ 988 casualties . It was awarded one campaign streamer for Lorraine . The brigade performed occupation duties for the next year as it began preparations to return to the continental United States . 
 The 13th Brigade returned to the United States in late 1919 , and gradually demobilized at Camp George G. Meade , Maryland until 1921 . On 22 September of that year , the Headquarters Company , 7th Division was inactivated , and the 13th and 14th Brigades deactivated with it . 
 = = = Reorganization = = = 
 On 1 July 1940 , the 7th Infantry Division was reactivated at Camp Ord , California Under the command of Major General Joseph W. Stilwell . The Headquarters element , 13th and 14th Brigades did not reactivate , however , and the division was instead centered around three infantry regiments ; the 17th Infantry Regiment , the 32nd Infantry Regiment , and the 53rd Infantry Regiment . The 13th Brigade was not activated for the duration of the war and its headquarters formation was not used to form a new unit . 
 = = = Post @-@ Korean War = = = 
 In the wake of the Korean War , between 1953 and 1971 , the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone . Its main garrison was Camp Casey , South Korea . During these occupation duties , the division saw a complete reorganization in compliance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan . In 1963 , the division 's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade , 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade became the 2nd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division . The 14th Infantry Brigade redesignated at the 3rd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division . These renamed formations retained all of the lineage and campaign credits of their previous designations . On 2 April 1971 , the division and its brigades returned to the United States and inactivated at Fort Lewis , Washington . 
 In October 1974 the 7th and two brigades reactivated at their former garrison , Fort Ord ( a National Guard " <unk> " brigade , the 41st , would periodically train with the division as its third brigade ) . The unit did not see any action in Vietnam or during the post war era , but was tasked to keep a close watch on South American developments . It trained at Fort Ord , Camp Roberts , and Fort Hunter Liggett . On 1 October 1985 the division redesignated as the 7th Infantry Division ( Light ) , organized again as a light infantry division . It was the first US division specially designed as such . The various battalions of the 17th , 31st , and 32nd Regiments moved from the division , replaced by battalions from other regiments , including battalions from the 21st Infantry Regiment , the 27th Infantry Regiment , and the 9th Infantry Regiment . The 27th Infantry and the 9th Infantry Regiment participated in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras . In 1989 the 2nd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division participated in Operation Just Cause in Panama . 
 In 1991 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closing of Fort Ord due to the escalating cost of living on the Central California coastline . By 1994 , the garrison was closed and the Division was assigned to relocate to Fort Lewis , Washington . The 2nd Brigade , to include its Headquarters and Headquarters Company along with the 3rd Brigade 's 3rd Battalion 17th Infantry Regiment and other assigned military police companies participated in one final mission in the United States before inactivation ; quelling the 1992 Los Angeles Riots , called Operation Garden Plot . In 1993 the division was slated to move to Fort Lewis , WA and inactivate as part of the post @-@ Cold War drawdown of the US Army , but the 2nd and 3rd Brigades of the 7th inactivated at Ft . Ord in 1993 . The 1st Brigade relocated to Ft . Lewis and was later reflagged as the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division while the division headquarters formally inactivated on 16 June 1994 at Fort Lewis .

 = Orthodox Church in America = 
 The Orthodox Church in America ( OCA ) is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox church in North America . The OCA consists of more than 700 parishes , missions , communities , monasteries and institutions in the United States and Canada . In 2011 , it had an estimated 84 @,@ 900 members in the United States . 
 The OCA began when eight Russian Orthodox monks established a mission in Alaska , then part of Russian America , in 1794 . This became a diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867 . By the late 19th century , the Russian Orthodox Church had grown in other areas of the United States due to the arrival of immigrants from areas of Eastern and Central Europe , many of them formerly of the Eastern Catholic churches ( " Greek Catholics " ) , and from the Middle East . These immigrants , regardless of nationality or ethnic background , were united under a single North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church . 
 After the Bolshevik Revolution , Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow directed all Russian Orthodox churches outside of Russia to govern themselves autonomously . Orthodox churches in America became a self @-@ governing Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America in 1924 under the leadership of Metropolitan Platon ( Rozhdestvensky ) , popularly called the Metropolia . The Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America was granted autocephaly by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1970 , and renamed the Orthodox Church in America . Its hierarchs are part of the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of North and Central America . 
 = = Official name = = 
 According to the April 1970 Tomos of Autocephaly granted by the Russian Orthodox Church , the official name of the Church is The Autocephalous Orthodox Church in America . The more comprehensive March 1970 Agreement of Tomos of Autocephaly , however , states in Article VIII that the legal name of the Church was changed to " Orthodox Church in America " ( with no definite article ) . 
 In 2005 , Tikhon ( Fitzgerald ) , then Bishop of the OCA Diocese of the West , commented that the official name of the jurisdiction is The Orthodox Church in America ( <unk> ) , but the definite article was dropped due to a printing error . The former uses ( Orthodox Church in America and OCA ) remain the most common both within and outside the jurisdiction .

 The first Native Americans to become Orthodox were the Aleuts living in contact with Siberian fur traders in the mid 18th century . They had been baptized mostly by their Orthodox trading partners or during occasional visits by priests serving aboard exploring vessels of the Russian navy . Russian colony in Alaska was established in 1784 by merchant Grigory Shelikhov . Shelikhov 's attempt to colonize Kodiak Island was met with resistance by the native population . He returned to Russia and installed Alexandr Baranov as director of the colony . In order to convince the Russian imperial court of the seriousness of his colonial ambitions , Shelikhov recruited volunteers from the <unk> , an environment that appears strikingly similar to the Kodiak archipelago 's landscape , and <unk> monasteries to travel to the new colony . 
 The volunteers , led by Archimandrite Joasaph ( <unk> ) , departed Saint Petersburg on December 21 , 1793 , and arrived at Kodiak Island on September 24 , 1794 . When they arrived they were shocked by the harsh treatment of the Kodiak natives at the hands of the Russian settlers and Baranov . They sent reports to Shelikhov detailing the abuse of the local population , but were ignored . In response , however , the Holy Synod created an auxiliary episcopal see in Alaska in 1796 , and elected Fr . Joasaph as bishop . Fr . Joasaph and a small party returned to Russia in 1798 for his consecration , and to offer first @-@ hand accounts of what they had seen . During their return voyage to the colony in May 1799 , their ship sank and all aboard died . In 1800 , Baranov placed the remaining monks under house arrest , and forbade them to have any further contact with the local population . 
 Despite the lack of leadership , the Orthodox mission in Alaska continued to grow . In 1811 , however , the Holy Synod officially closed the episcopal see . It was not until 1823 that the Holy Synod sent instructions for a new priest to travel to Alaska . John <unk> of Irkutsk volunteered for the journey , and left Russia in May 1823 . He and his family arrived at Unalaska Island on July 29 , 1824 . In 1840 , after the death of his wife , <unk> accepted monastic tonsure and , taking the name Innocent , ordination as the Bishop of Kamchatka , the Kurile and Aleutian Islands , making him the first ruling bishop of the Alaskan mission since Bishop Joasaph . Bishop Innocent was elevated to archbishop in 1850 . For his missionary and scholarly work that had focused on blending indigenous Alaskan languages and cultures with Orthodox tradition , Innocent became a saint of the Orthodox Church in America in 1977 , and is referred to as the Enlightener of the Aleuts and Apostle to the Americas . 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 In 1868 , the first Orthodox church in the continental United States was established in San Francisco , California . Numerous parishes were established across the country throughout the rest of the 19th century . Although these parishes were typically multi @-@ ethnic , most received support from the missionary diocese . In 1872 the diocesan see was relocated from Alaska to the city of San Francisco , California in the United States . The mission itself was instituted as a separate Diocese of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands on June 10 , 1870 , subsequent to the sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867 . In November 1870 , the first Orthodox church in New York City was consecrated . 
 Eastern @-@ Rite Catholicism was viewed with suspicion by several Latin @-@ Rite bishops in the United States ; some , such as Archbishop John Ireland of Saint Paul , Minnesota , were actually hostile , especially concerning the matter of married clergy . In 1891 , Alexis Toth brought a group of 361 Eastern Catholics into Orthodoxy . From then until his death in 1909 , Toth brought approximately 20 @,@ 000 Eastern Catholics from 65 independent communities to Orthodoxy . By 1917 , 163 Eastern @-@ Rite Catholic parishes consisting of more than 100 @,@ 000 faithful had been converted . For his efforts , Toth was glorified as a saint by the OCA in 1994 . 
 In recognition of the expansion of the Church beyond Alaska , Bishop Tikhon ( <unk> ) petitioned the Holy Synod to change the diocese 's title to the Diocese of the Aleutians and North America . This was approved in February 1900 . He consecrated an auxiliary bishop for Alaska in 1903 , and in 1904 he consecrated Raphael <unk> to administer to the Arab parishes . In 1905 , Bishop Tikhon relocated the diocesan administration from San Francisco to New York City . 
 In a report to the Holy Synod that year , Bishop Tikhon proposed dramatic changes in the operation of the diocese . Recognizing the needs of the growing multi @-@ ethnic Orthodox community , he recommended reforming the missionary diocese into a self @-@ supporting American diocese , composed of numerous ethnic auxiliary dioceses . His plan called for Russian ( New York ) , Arab ( Brooklyn ) , Serbian ( Chicago ) , and Greek dioceses . Additionally , he called for the formation of a governing council , composed of clergy and laity , which would meet to discuss administrative and canonical issues . On March 5 , 1907 , the first All @-@ American Sobor convened in Mayfield , Pennsylvania . Following Archbishop Tikhon 's reassignment to Russia that year , however , few of his reforms were implemented . 
 During this period , education and charity was a focus of the diocese . In 1905 , Archbishop Tikhon oversaw the creation of an Orthodox seminary in Minneapolis , Minnesota . St. Platon 's Seminary moved from Minneapolis to Tenafly , New Jersey in 1912 and enrolled 78 students from then until 1923 . In 1916 , an unaccredited Russian Women 's College was established in Brooklyn . An immigrant society and orphanage also were established , as well as the first Orthodox monasteries in the United States ( Saint Tikhon 's Monastery for men in 1905 and Holy Virgin Protection for women in 1915 ) . 
 By 1917 , the American diocese was the largest in the Russian Orthodox Church . It had grown from ten parishes in 1890 to more than 350 . Most of the funding for the diocese was provided by Russian Church , via the Imperial Missionary Society . The connections between the American diocese and the Russian Church would be severely compromised by the events of that year . 
 = = = Revolution and turmoil = = = 
 The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent establishment of the Communist Soviet government ushered in a period of repression for the Russian Orthodox Church . Church property was confiscated , and when Patriarch Tikhon resisted , he was imprisoned from April 1922 until June 1923 . On November 20 , 1920 , Patriarch Tikhon formally authorized Russian Orthodox bishops to set up temporarily independent organizations , until such time as normal communications with and governance from the patriarchate could be restored . 
 Ethnic groups within the American diocese began to re @-@ align themselves with other national churches . In 1918 , a group of Ukrainians in Canada formed the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada , and in 1922 , the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America was established . In 1926 , the Serbs aligned with the Serbian Orthodox Church . 
 In Soviet Russia , a splinter group known as the Living Church gained official state recognition in place of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1922 . In the United States , a group of Living Church clergy led by John <unk> attempted to depose ruling American hierarch Bishop Alexander ( <unk> ) . Bishop Alexander , in addition to the political and ethnic struggles of his diocese , had also to deal with mounting Church debt as a result of the loss of funds from the Russian Church . He was forced to mortgage Church property to pay creditors , and was replaced in 1922 by Archbishop Platon ( Rozhdestvensky ) , who had previously served as archbishop of the diocese from 1907 to 1914 . 
 After Archbishop Platon 's return , he was elected Metropolitan of All America and Canada at the third All @-@ American Sobor in November 1922 . Soon after , Communist authorities in Russia ( in collaboration with the Living Church ) attempted to seize Church assets in the United States . In response , the fourth All @-@ American Sobor convened in April 1924 . During the Sobor , the historic step of declaring the North American diocese to be temporarily self @-@ governing was taken . This was meant to be necessary only until relations with the Russian Church could be normalized , and the justification for the move was the earlier decree by Patriarch Tikhon . The diocese was officially incorporated as the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church of America . 
 Despite the conditions set out by Tikhon 's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met , the American diocese of the Russian church declared self @-@ governance in 1924 , against the protests of the patriarchate , with which it had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing . The refusal of the American branch to submit to the patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met . In reality , however , it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion , paired with a desire on the part of the Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia ( ROCOR ) of which it had been part . 
 Despite the declaration of self @-@ governance , <unk> and the Living Church were awarded the Church 's diocesan cathedral in New York City . To prevent further loss of property , the diocese allowed individual parishes to take ownership of their properties , which made them effectively independent . This , combined with the increasing number of ethnic parishes aligning themselves with other Orthodox jurisdictions ( as well as some non @-@ Orthodox ) , led to a unique situation in Orthodox America whereby multiple jurisdictions overlapped geographically . The remainder of the American Church became known informally as the Metropolia ( or under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan ) . Following Patriarch Tikhon 's death , the Russian Orthodox Church , led by Metropolitan Sergius , began cooperating with the Soviet government . In 1933 , the Russian Church declared the Metropolia to be schismatic . 
 A third Russian Church , the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Church Abroad ( also known as the <unk> Synod and later , the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia or ROCOR ) , formed in 1921 . The Synod saw itself as representing all Russian Orthodox abroad , including the Metropolia . The Metropolia cooperated with the Synod at first but severed relations with them in 1926 , citing the Synod 's increasing claims of authority in America . The Synod , for its part , suspended Metropolitan Platon and his clergy . In 1935 , an agreement entitled " Temporary Regulations of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad " was signed that normalized relations between the Metropolia and the ROCOR . The 6th All @-@ American Sobor , held in 1937 , affirmed that while the Metropolia remained autonomous , it reported to the ROCOR in matters of faith . 
 The ROCOR , forced to leave Yugoslavia toward the end of World War II , eventually established its base of operations in New York City . In 1946 , it was decided at the 7th All @-@ American Sobor that the Metropolia would sever its ties with the ROCOR and attempt to return to the Patriarchate of Moscow . This return was proposed with the stipulation that the Metropolia be allowed to retain its autonomy . When this condition was not met , the Metropolia continued as a self @-@ governing Church . 
 Although there were periodic attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church over the next few decades , no serious progress was made . During this time , the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change . Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti @-@ Communist ROCOR , the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English @-@ speaking converts . As a result , the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians , Ukrainians , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = = Move toward unity and independence = = = 
 Prior to the 13th All @-@ American Sobor in November 1967 , a proposal was prepared to change the name of the Church from the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church of America to the " Orthodox Church in America " . The Council of Bishops , already aware of the proposal , forbade a vote on the matter . After much debate however , a non @-@ binding straw poll was permitted . The result of the poll was decidedly in favor of the name change . As a result , the decision to deal with the matter at another Sobor ( to be held in two years ) was made . 
 In the early 1960s , the Metropolia resumed communication with the Patriarch of Moscow . In 1968 , the Metropolia and the Russian Church communicated informally to resolve long @-@ standing differences . Representatives from the Metropolia sought the right of self @-@ governance , as well as the removal of Russian jurisdiction from all matters concerning the American Church . Official negotiations on the matter began in 1969 . On April 10 , 1970 , Patriarch Alexius I and fourteen bishops of the Russian Church 's Holy Synod signed the official Tomos of Autocephaly , which made the newly renamed Orthodox Church in America the fifteenth autocephalous Orthodox Church . The name change , as well as the granting of autocephaly , was officially accepted at the 14th All @-@ American Sobor ( also known as the 1st All @-@ American Council in recognition of the Church 's new @-@ found independence ) in October 1970 . The OCA 's autocephaly is currently recognized only by a minor share of other autocephalous Orthodox Churches . All canonical Orthodox Churches recognize the OCA as canonical and its sacraments as valid , however . 
 Within the past twenty years , the OCA has established more than 220 new parishes . It was a member of the Standing Conference of Orthodox Bishops in America ( <unk> ) , together with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America , the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America ( AOCA ) and the other member jurisdictions . In 2010 , <unk> was dissolved with the creation of the new Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of North and Central America , which was mandated by Orthodox Patriarchates in 2009 at a meeting in Switzerland . Serious consideration has been given recently to a possible merger between the OCA and the AOCA . Both groups share a significant common history , in that a Syrian priest , Raphael <unk> , was sent by the Moscow Patriarchate in the late 19th century as a missionary to Arabic @-@ speaking Orthodox Christians living in North America . Raphael was ordained a bishop in 1904 , and his flock eventually became the AOCA . Bishop Raphael was canonized in March 2000 by the OCA as St. Raphael of Brooklyn . 
 = = = Financial scandal = = = 
 In 2005 , former treasurer , Protodeacon Eric Wheeler publicly accused the OCA administration of financial misconduct . Wheeler alleged that millions of dollars in donations to the church were improperly used for personal expenses or to cover shortfalls in church accounts . 
 A 32 @-@ page report was released on September 3 , 2008 , that addressed the financial scandal and recommended " discipline " for five individuals including then @-@ primate Metropolitan Herman , his predecessor Metropolitan Theodosius and two former treasurers as well as a former comptroller . The same report recommended then @-@ primate Metropolitan Herman immediately resign or retire from his post or risk bring defrocked . 
 One day after the report was released , Metropolitan Herman resigned from his position as Metropolitan . That November , the OCA elected a new Primate at its 15th Annual All @-@ American Council . Metropolitan Jonah ( <unk> ) was chosen because he had recently been appointed as a bishop ( only 11 days prior ) and was viewed to not be involved with the previous financial scandal . Metropolitan Jonah immediately took a strong stance against the previous scandal and became a very public metropolitan , seeking to repair damage done by the previous scandal and bring the OCA into the public realm . Metropolitan Jonah also sought to improve relations with non @-@ Orthodox groups and especially sought to repair the relations between the OCA and traditional Anglican groups . He was invited twice to speak at the conference of the Anglican Church of North America , in 2009 and 2012 . 
 Less than four years after his election , Metropolitan Jonah was asked by the Holy Synod , in a unanimous decision , to resign from his position . While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation , the Holy Synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions . The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk . In the statement , the Holy Synod clarified the reason they withheld information initially was to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the specific decisions made by him . 
 On November 13 , 2012 , an extraordinary All @-@ American Council elected Archbishop Tikhon Mollard of Philadelphia and Eastern Pennsylvania as the Metropolitan of All @-@ America and Canada . He was installed on January 27 , 2013 . Metropolitan Tikhon is a convert to the Orthodox faith and a long @-@ time monk of St. Tikhon 's Monastery in South Canaan , Pennsylvania . 
 = = = Recognition of autocephaly = = = 
 Currently , the Russian , Bulgarian , Georgian , Polish , Serbian , and Czech and Slovak churches recognize the autocephaly of the OCA , though the Bulgarian , Russian , and Serbian patriarchates continue to maintain parishes inside the OCA 's claimed jurisdiction . Among the churches that do not recognize it is the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople , which argues that the Russian Church did not have the authority to grant autocephaly , partly because the Russian Church at the time was considered to be heavily influenced by the Soviet government . The Ecumenical Patriarch also cites Canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon , which asserted the jurisdiction of the bishop of Constantinople in dioceses located " among the barbarians " ( i.e. outside the Roman Empire ) , is cited as the source of the Ecumenical Patriarchate 's authority in the matter . 
 <unk> for the OCA 's autocephaly claim that the decree did not need the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarchate , as it was an internal matter for the Russian Orthodox Church to decide . Many autocephalous churches , the Russian Church included , were not recognized as such for many years , albeit their autocephaly was granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate . 
 = = Membership = = 
 The exact number of OCA parishioners is debated . According to the 2006 edition of the Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches , the OCA has 1 @,@ 064 @,@ 000 members , an increase of 6 @.@ 4 percent from 2005 . This figure places the OCA as the 24th largest Christian denomination in the United States , and the second largest Eastern Orthodox church in the country , after the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America . 
 In 2000 , a study by Alexei D. <unk> , of the Patriarch <unk> Orthodox Institute , presented a substantially lower figure — 115 @,@ 100 adherents ( baptized Orthodox who attend services on at least an occasional basis and their children ) and 39 @,@ 400 full members ( persons older than 18 , paying annual Church membership fees ) . The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese , by comparison , was listed as having 440 @,@ 000 adherents . In response to the study , an OCA representative stated the Church had " around 750 @,@ 000 adults and children . " 
 In 2004 , Jonathan Ivanoff stated in a presentation at the OCA 's Evangelization Conference that the Church 's census population in 2004 was 27 @,@ 169 , and that membership from 1990 – 2000 declined 13 percent . It further stated that the OCA population in the continental United States declined between six and nine percent per year . 
 In 2011 , The Atlas of American Orthodox Christian Churches , published by Holy Cross Orthodox Press and based on research by Alexei <unk> , was released . It has extensive data on various Orthodox Churches in the United States , including both Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox groups ( as well as groups considered uncanonical by those two groups ) . The publication is endorsed by the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops and is being used by various Assembly committees as part of their research and planning . The Atlas lists the United States membership of the OCA as 84 @,@ 900 , 33 @,@ 800 of which it says are regular church attendees . It lists the OCA as having 551 parishes and 19 monasteries in the United States . It also indicates the states with the heaviest concentration of OCA parishes are , in order : Alaska ( with 86 ) , Pennsylvania ( with 83 ) , California ( with 43 ) and New York ( with 41 ) .

 = = = Episcopacy = = = 
 The supreme canonical authority of the OCA is the Holy Synod of Bishops , composed of all the church 's diocesan bishops . The ex officio chairman of the Holy Synod is the metropolitan . The Holy Synod meets twice annually , however special sessions can be called either by the metropolitan or at the request of at least three diocesan bishops . 
 = = = Metropolitan = = = 
 The primate of the OCA is the metropolitan . He also serves as the bishop of one of the Church 's dioceses . With the other bishops of the Church , the metropolitan is considered the first among equals . His official title is " Metropolitan of All @-@ America and Canada . " His role is to manage the welfare of the Church , and to act as its representative with other Orthodox Churches , religious organizations , and secular authorities . The metropolitan is elected , when necessary , by the Holy Synod at an All @-@ American Council ( a general council of OCA clergy and laity ) . There are no age or term limits for the metropolitan , and he may retire at any time , but usually does so only for health @-@ related reasons . 
 = = = Dioceses = = = 
 The diocese is the basic church body that comprises all the parishes of a determined geographical area . It is governed by the Diocesan Bishop , with the assistance of a Diocesan Assembly and a Diocesan Council . The OCA is currently composed of twelve geographic and three ethnic dioceses . The boundaries of the ethnic dioceses overlap those of certain geographic ones . These dioceses are the result of smaller ethnic jurisdictions joining the OCA at some point in its history , usually after having broken from other bodies . Dioceses are established by the Holy Synod whenever needed , and the Synod may also modify the boundaries of an existing diocese . 
 = = = All @-@ American Council = = = 
 According to the Statute of the Orthodox Church in America , the All @-@ American Council is the " highest legislative and administrative authority within the Church . " The Council is composed roughly of the Metropolitan , all bishops , priests , and selected lay delegates . The purpose of the All @-@ American Council is to discuss and vote on Church matters . When necessary , the Council has also elected new metropolitans . 
 The period between All @-@ American Councils is set at three years , although this is not always the case . The first thirteen Councils ( held from 1907 – 1970 ) are referred to as All @-@ American <unk> , reflecting the American Church 's jurisdictional ties to the Russian Orthodox Church . The fourteenth Sobor ( held in 1970 ) is jointly known as the 1st All @-@ American Council , reflecting the autocephalous status of the OCA . The most recent All @-@ American Council ( 16th ) was held in November 2012 , at which time Metropolitan Tikhon ( Mollard ) was elected . 
 = = = Metropolitan Council = = = 
 The Metropolitan Council is the permanent executive body of the Church 's administration . It is tasked with implementing the decisions of the All @-@ American Council , as well as handling the Church 's budgetary concerns . The Council is headed by a chairman ( the current Metropolitan ) , and is composed of the OCA 's chancellor , secretary , treasurer , and selected clergy and lay delegates . It usually meets twice per year , but in December 2006 a rare joint meeting between the Metropolitan Council and the Holy Synod of Bishops was held .

 Alexandre " Alex " Ménard @-@ Burrows ( born April 11 , 1981 ) is a French @-@ Canadian professional ice hockey right winger and an alternate captain for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He is known for playing in the style of an agitator and for his ascension to the NHL from being an undrafted player in the ECHL . After a two @-@ year career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) , he played in the minor leagues for three seasons . He was signed by the Canucks in 2005 from their American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Manitoba Moose . Burrows established himself as a checking forward with the Canucks in his first three NHL seasons before emerging as a scorer with four consecutive 25 + goal seasons from 2008 – 09 to 2011 – 12 . 
 Before making it to the NHL , Burrows also enjoyed a prolific ball hockey career , competing in national and international tournaments in the summers . In 2005 , he was named the International Ball Hockey Player of the Year . He has also been inducted into the Canadian and International Ball Hockey Hall of Fame . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = Junior and minor leagues = = = 
 Burrows played two seasons in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) with the Shawinigan Cataractes , beginning in 2000 – 01 . He recorded 16 goals and 30 points over 63 regular season games , then added three points over 10 post @-@ season games . The following season , he improved to 35 goals and 70 points over 64 games , third in team @-@ scoring , behind Jonathan <unk> and Jason <unk> . He went on to lead his team in post @-@ season scoring with nine goals and 21 points in 12 games as the Cataractes advanced to the Conference Finals , where they were eliminated in seven games by the Victoriaville Tigres . 
 Undrafted by a National Hockey League ( NHL ) club , Burrows went professional in 2002 – 03 with the Greenville <unk> of the ECHL , a third @-@ tier minor league . Late in his professional rookie season , he transferred to the Baton Rouge <unk> and finished with a combined 32 points in 66 games between the two teams . The following season , in 2003 – 04 , he returned to the South Division , as he was signed by the Columbia Inferno . Early in the season , he was signed by Columbia 's American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Manitoba Moose , on October 21 , 2003 , having been scouted by Moose general manager Craig <unk> . He appeared in two AHL games for Manitoba before being sent back down to the ECHL . Shortly after his return , he was suspended for three games and fined an undisclosed amount by the league for abusing officials during a game on October 24 against the Greensboro Generals . Later on in the season , he was named to the 2004 ECHL All @-@ Star Game for the Eastern Conference and recorded one assist . He went on to finish the season with 29 goals and 73 points , second in points among Columbia players to league @-@ scoring champion Tim Smith . 
 In the subsequent off @-@ season , Burrows was re @-@ signed by the Moose on August 3 , 2004 . He was initially sent back down to the ECHL after a training camp both he and head coach Randy Carlyle described as disappointing . Following an injury to Wade <unk> , he was recalled on October 29 , 2004 . He scored his first AHL goal with the Moose five days later , a game @-@ winning goal against goaltender David LeNeveu of the Utah Grizzlies in a 2 – 1 win . He finished the 2004 – 05 season with Manitoba and posted 26 points over 72 games in a fourth @-@ line role . 
 = = = Vancouver Canucks = = = 
 Having worked his way up from the ECHL , Burrows ' energetic play in the minors earned him a two @-@ way contract with the Moose 's NHL affiliate , the Vancouver Canucks , on November 8 , 2005 . He had appeared earlier in the Canucks ' training camp for the 2005 – 06 season , but was sent back to the Moose . After recording 30 points in 33 games with the Moose , he was recalled by the Canucks on January 2 , 2006 . Eight days later , Burrows scored his first career NHL goal against Ed Belfour of the Toronto Maple Leafs . He also added an assist as the Canucks won the game 4 – 3 . Establishing himself on the Canucks roster , he added his first NHL career hat trick on March 27 , 2006 , in a 7 – 4 win against the Los Angeles Kings . He finished with seven goals and 12 points over 43 games in his NHL rookie campaign . Burrows ' ascension to the NHL has been attributed to his hard @-@ working and abrasive style of play , generating momentum for his team and aggravating opposing players . 
 Burrows completed his first full campaign with the Canucks the following season in 2006 – 07 . He contributed primarily on the team 's penalty kill , which ranked first in the league . Burrows ' average shorthanded ice time per game was second among team forwards , behind Ryan Kesler . He struggled to produce offensively , however , and recorded a career @-@ low three goals and nine points in 81 games . 
 In 2007 – 08 , Burrows formed an effective duo with center Ryan Kesler on the third line as defensive forwards , countering opposing teams ' top players while contributing offensively , as well . During the season , he was fined an undisclosed amount by the league after spearing Detroit Red Wings forward Aaron Downey at centre ice during the two teams ' pre @-@ game skate on February 23 , 2008 . He finished the campaign with 12 goals , 31 points and a team @-@ high plus @-@ minus of + 11 . He was voted by Canucks ' fans to receive the team 's Most Exciting Player Award and the Fred J. Hume Award , given to the team 's " unsung hero " as voted by the Canucks Booster Club . 
 After remaining on the third line with Kesler at the start of the following season , head coach Alain Vigneault separated the two after the All @-@ Star break , placing Burrows on the first line with Daniel and Henrik Sedin , beginning on February 12 , 2009 , during a game against the Phoenix Coyotes . Burrows ' crash @-@ the @-@ net style – skating hard to the opposing team 's goalmouth for rebounds or tip @-@ ins – combined well with the Sedins ' cycling plays . Vigneault 's line adjustments were precipitated by a losing streak in January , which Burrows was instrumental in breaking . The Canucks ' home winless streak had extended to eight games , a franchise record , when Burrows broke a 3 – 3 tie with a shorthanded breakaway goal with 82 seconds remaining in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes . This sparked a resurgence in the Canucks , spearheaded by Burrows , who then immediately followed their record setting home losing streak with a record setting home winning streak , winning their next 10 games at home . Shortly thereafter , the Canucks extended his contract with a four @-@ year , $ 8 million deal on February 4 , 2009 , quadrupling his $ 525 @,@ 000 salary . Following a game against the Edmonton Oilers on April 4 , Burrows received a $ 2 @,@ 500 fine from the league for punching Oilers enforcer Zach <unk> from the bench . 
 Late in the campaign , he was selected by the Professional Hockey Writers ' Association as the Canucks ' nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy , awarded for perseverance , dedication and sportsmanship . Burrows was not shortlisted for the award , however . Prior to the last game of the season , he received his second consecutive Most Exciting Player Award . 
 Playing in a more offensive role on the first line for the latter part of the season , Burrows finished the 2008 – 09 campaign with 51 points . His 28 goals broke Andrew Brunette 's mark for the most in a single season by an ECHL alumnus ( 27 in 2006 – 07 ) . In the subsequent first round of the 2009 playoffs , Burrows scored the series @-@ winning goal in overtime to sweep the St. Louis Blues . It was his second goal of the game . The Canucks advanced to meet the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round , who defeated them in six games . Burrows ' level of play was noticeably diminished in the Chicago series and it was revealed afterwards that he required surgery to remove bone chips in his left wrist . He finished the playoffs with three goals and an assist over 10 games . 
 The following season , Burrows recorded back @-@ to @-@ back hat tricks against the Columbus Blue Jackets and Phoenix Coyotes on January 5 and 7 , 2010 , respectively . It marked the first time an NHL player notched consecutive three @-@ goal games since Ilya Kovalchuk in November 2007 and the first time a Canucks player did so since Petri <unk> in 1986 . With six goals and an assist over two games , Burrows was named the NHL First Star of the Week on January 11 , 2010 . 
 = = = = NHL officials controversy = = = = 
 The night of his first star of the week selection , Burrows and the Canucks played a controversial game against the Nashville Predators . With the game tied 2 – 2 in the third period , Burrows was penalized twice by referee Stéphane Auger – once for diving and the other for interference . The latter call was deemed questionable by media sources , including TSN and the National Post . The interference penalty along with an additional penalty committed by Henrik Sedin resulted in Nashville 's game @-@ winning , 5 @-@ on @-@ 3 powerplay goal late in the game . With three seconds to go in regulation , Burrows skated by Auger and protested the interference penalty , resulting in an unsportsmanlike minor and a ten @-@ minute misconduct . 
 Following the game , Burrows accused Auger of having a personal vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month that had made him look bad . After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward <unk> Smithson during a game on December 8 , 2009 , Auger assessed Smithson with a five @-@ minute major and a game misconduct . However , the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had embellished injury . Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game : " you made me look bad [ for calling the Smithson penalty ] so I 'm going to get you back tonight . " He went on to tell reporters that Auger " should stay out for the rest of the year making calls like that ... We just blew two points because of his officiating tonight . " 
 The following day , the NHL fined Burrows US $ 2 @,@ 500 for publicly criticizing Auger and deemed that his claims " cannot be substantiated . " Later that week , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) ' s Hockey Night in Canada telecast aired an 11 @-@ minute segment hosted by Ron MacLean and NHL vice @-@ president Colin Campbell reviewing Burrows ' past transgressions , spanning two years . The segment was widely criticized for being biased against Burrows and failing to illustrate both sides of the argument . Burrows ' parents subsequently issued a formal letter of complaint to the CBC , accusing MacLean of " verbal assassination " and for displaying " no journalistic balance . " 
 The following Saturday after the segment aired , the Canucks refused any interviews with the CBC before , during or after their game against the Chicago Blackhawks , which was broadcast on Hockey Night in Canada . The boycott was ordered by Canucks general manager Mike Gillis after MacLean refused to apologize . CBC and Canucks representatives later agreed in a conference call to " move on " and team players were allowed to resume interviews . MacLean later issued an unofficial apology aimed to clarify the situation .

 Later in the 2009 – 10 season , Burrows left during a game against the Los Angeles Kings after being hit in the throat by a Jarret Stoll slapshot . He was not injured , however , and did not miss any games thereafter . Playing a full season on the Canucks ' top line with the Sedins , he recorded a career @-@ high 35 goals , 32 assists , 67 points and a + 34 rating . His goals total ranked first on the Canucks . Fans voted him as recipient of the team 's Most Exciting Player Award for the third consecutive season . 
 The Canucks first line struggled to score in the playoffs , however . In 12 games , Burrows scored three goals , two of which were into empty nets , and notched three assists . The Canucks advanced to the second round past the Los Angeles Kings , where they were eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks for the second consecutive year . It was revealed in the off @-@ season that Burrows was suffering from a shoulder injury , which he later received surgery for . 
 While Burrows ' offensive numbers increased from playing on the top line , the Sedins ' mutually benefitted from playing with him . Daniel and Henrik had not had a constant linemate on the first line since Anson Carter played with them in 2005 – 06 . Since then , Vigneault had used a variety of wingers , including Markus Naslund , Taylor Pyatt and Steve Bernier , to fill out the unit . In those years , Daniel and Henrik were point @-@ a @-@ game players ; with Burrows on their line , they vaulted into top scorers in the league , as Henrik won the Art Ross Trophy as the league 's leading point @-@ getter ( Daniel scored at a similar pace , but played less due to an injury ) . 
 Due to rehabilitation from the shoulder surgery , Burrows missed the first ten games of the 2010 – 11 season . Continuing to play with the Sedins upon his return , he recorded 48 points ( 26 goals and 22 assists ) in 72 games , sixth in team @-@ scoring . Winning the Presidents ' Trophy , the Canucks entered the 2011 playoffs as the first seed in the West and matched up against the Blackhawks for the third consecutive year . With a 3 – 0 lead in the series , the Canucks lost their next three games , resulting in a game seven . In the deciding game , Burrows scored two goals in a 2 – 1 overtime win , helping Vancouver eliminate Chicago . After defeating the Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks in rounds two and three , the Canucks reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years . Playing the Boston Bruins , Burrows received much attention of the series for allegedly biting opposing forward Patrice Bergeron during a scrum at the end of the first period in Game 1 of the series . While the two players were being held apart by a linesman , Burrows appears to be shown biting down on Bergeron 's finger , while both players were pushing and shoving at one another . The incident was reviewed by the league , but was ruled <unk> with " no conclusive evidence that [ he ] intentionally bit [ Bergeron 's ] finger . " The following game , Burrows scored his second overtime @-@ winner of the playoffs , part of a three @-@ point effort ( two goals and an assist ) . Occurring 11 seconds into the extra period , it was the second @-@ fastest goal scored from the start of an overtime game in Stanley Cup Finals history ( Montreal Canadiens forward Brian Skrudland scored nine seconds into overtime in Game 2 of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals against the Calgary Flames ) . With two overtime goals in one playoff season , Burrows tied the NHL record , which was held by 28 other players . After leading two @-@ games @-@ to @-@ none in the series , Vancouver went on to lose the Stanley Cup to Boston in seven contests . Burrows finished the post @-@ season with 9 goals and 17 points over 25 games . 
 In 2011 – 12 , Burrows recorded 28 goals and 52 points in 80 contests , helping Vancouver to a second consecutive Presidents ' Trophy . Facing the eighth @-@ seeded Los Angeles Kings in the first round , they were eliminated in five games . Burrows had one goal during the series . The Los Angeles Kings went on to become the 2012 Stanley Cup Champions .

 Following his seventh NHL season , Burrows received his first invite to the Canadian national team for the 2012 IIHF World Championship , held in Finland and Sweden . Burrows ' Vancouver Canucks had been eliminated in the first round of the 2012 playoffs , making him available for selection . At 31 years old , he was the oldest player on the Canadian roster . Making his Team Canada debut against Slovakia in the first game of the tournament , he fell to the ice and hit his head after colliding with two opposing players . After leaving the ice , he was kept out of the contest with concerns that he had sustained a concussion . The following day , Burrows ' agent , Paul Corbeil , told reporters that while he was symptom free , a return to the lineup would not be possible for four @-@ to @-@ five days , as per team protocol in scenarios in which a concussion is suspected . Returning to the lineup a week after the hit , he scored his first career international goal against Finnish goaltender Kari Lehtonen in a 5 – 3 win . The following contest , he scored a shorthanded goal in an 8 – 0 win against Kazakhstan to earn player of the game honours for Canada .

 Burrows began playing organized ball hockey at the age of 19 . In 2001 , he won his first national championship with the Montreal Red Lites in Burnaby , British Columbia . Burrows went on to win the national championship in every year he played with the Red Lites .

In 2005 , Burrows scored two goals in a 5 – 2 win against the Toronto Midnight Express in the national final to capture his fifth consecutive Canadian title with the Red Lites . Burrows was named the Tournament MVP by the Canadian Ball Hockey Association ( <unk> ) . He returned the following year to lead the Red Lites to a sixth consecutive title in 2006 . 
 Burrows made his first appearance on the international stage in ball hockey when he was named to Canada 's national ball hockey team for the 2003 World Championships in Sierre , Switzerland . He helped Canada beat the Czech Republic 6 – 1 in the final . Tying for the lead in tournament scoring with five goals and 10 points , Burrows was named the Most Valuable Forward . Two years later , in 2005 , he won his second World Championship in as many appearances with Canada in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . He capped the season off by being named the 2005 International Player of the Year by the International Street and Ball Hockey Federation ( <unk> ) . The following year , he was voted in a Canadian poll as the country 's greatest ball hockey player ever . 
 Burrows has credited ball hockey for his fitness and discipline which has carried over to the NHL . Following his first full season with the Canucks in 2006 – 07 , Burrows retired from his ball hockey career . In 2010 , he was inducted into the <unk> Hall of Fame , along with national teammate and goaltender Michel <unk> . He is also a member of the <unk> Hall of Fame .

 Burrows was born in <unk> , Québec , to parents Rodney and Carole . His father emigrated from London , England , at 23 , while his mother , a Québec native , is an elementary school principal . Burrows has two sisters as well – one older and one younger . He grew up speaking mostly French and attended French schools . His English has a noticeable French accent . 
 In July 2010 , Burrows married his longtime girlfriend , Nancy Roy . On April 27 , 2011 , Nancy gave birth to the couple 's first child , a girl named Victoria . Alex became a second time father on March 4 , 2013 to a daughter named Lexie . They live in Montreal during the offseason . 
 Burrows was the closest friend on the Canucks to former teammate Luc Bourdon , who died in a motorcycle accident in May 2009 . In the hockey season following his death , Burrows occasionally celebrated goals with a bow @-@ and @-@ arrow mime , a gesture that Bourdon himself did after scoring during his junior career . He and his wife ( girlfriend at the time ) remained close to Bourdon 's girlfriend , Charlene Ward . 
 In the 2009 off @-@ season , Burrows was involved in an assault incident while playing in a summer ice hockey league .

 = Ahimsa in Jainism = 
 <unk> ( Ahiṃsā ) in Jainism is a fundamental principle forming the cornerstone of its ethics and doctrine . The term ahimsa means nonviolence , non @-@ injury or absence of desire to harm any life forms . Vegetarianism and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa . The Jain concept of ahimsa is very different from the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies . Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others . But according to the Jain philosophy , violence refers primarily to injuring one 's own self – behaviour which inhibits the soul 's own ability to attain moksha ( liberation from the cycle of births and deaths ) . At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one 's own soul . Furthermore , the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals , plants , micro @-@ organisms and all beings having life or life potential . All life is sacred and everyone has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential . The living beings do not have any fear from those who have taken the vow of ahimsa . According to Jainism , protection of life , also known as <unk> , is the supreme charity that a person can make . 
 Ahimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence , but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence . Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages . Ahimsa being central to the Jain philosophy , Jain <unk> have produced , through ages , quite elaborate and detailed doctrinal materials concerning its various aspects . According to Aidan Rankin , the concept of ahimsa is very much intertwined with Jainism . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Jain texts expound that there are ten vitalities or life @-@ principles , these are : the five senses , energy , respiration , life @-@ duration , the organ of speech , and the mind . Living beings are classified on the basis of their sensory organs ( <unk> ) and vitalities ( praṇa ) they possess . According to Jain texts : 
 The one @-@ sensed lives possess four vitalities – sense organ of touch , strength of body or energy , respiration , and life @-@ duration . 
 The two @-@ sensed beings have six , namely the sense of taste and the organ of speech in addition to the former four . 
 The three @-@ sensed beings have seven with the addition of the sense of smell . 
 The four @-@ sensed beings have eight with the addition of the sense of sight . 
 The five- sensed beings without mind have nine life @-@ principles with the addition of the sense of hearing . Those endowed with mind are said to have ten vitalities with the addition of the mind . 
 According to Tattvarthasutra , a major Jain text , " the severance of vitalities out of passion is injury " . Therefore , the higher the number of senses and vitalities a being has , the more is its capacity to suffer and feel pain . Hence according to Jainism , violence to higher @-@ sensed beings like man , cow , tiger and those who have five senses and the capacity to think and feel pain attracts more karma than violence to lesser @-@ sensed beings like insects , or single @-@ sensed beings like microbes and plants . Out of the five types of living beings , a householder is forbidden to kill , or destroy , intentionally , all except the lowest ( the one sensed , such as vegetables , herbs , cereals , etc . , which are endowed with only the sense of touch ) . But , the ascetic is required to avoid even injuring the one @-@ sensed form of life to the best of his ability . 
 Hence Jainism enjoins its adherents to completely avoid violence to higher @-@ sensed beings and as far as possible minimise violence to lower @-@ sensed and single @-@ sensed beings . 
 = = Vow of Ahiṃsā = = 
 In Jainism , both ascetics and householders ( śrāvaka ) have to follow five major vows ( vratas ) . Ascetics observe these fives vows more strictly and therefore observe complete abstinence . 
 1 . Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow . The votary must not to hurt any living being by actions , words or thoughts . Jain text , Puruşārthasiddhyupāya deals with the conduct required of the householder ( śrāvaka ) and therefore discusses the fundamental vow of Ahimsa in detail . The text expounds that " all these subdivisions ( injury , falsehood , stealing , <unk> , and attachment ) are hiṃsā as indulgence in these <unk> the pure nature of the soul . Falsehood etc. have been mentioned separately only to make the disciple understand through illustrations . " 
 2 . Satya ( Truth ) - The underlying cause of falsehood is passion and therefore , it is said to cause hiṃsā ( injury ) . According to Jain text Sarvārthasiddhi , translates S.A. Jain , " that which causes pain and suffering to the living is not commendable , whether it refers to actual facts or not is immaterial " . 
 3 . Asteya ( Non @-@ thieving ) - According to Puruşārthasiddhyupāya : 
 Driven by passions , taking anything that has not been given be termed as theft and since theft causes injury , it is hiṃsā 
 4 . <unk> It means chastity for householders and celibacy in action , words & thoughts for ascetics . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) is copulation arising from sexual desire . There is all @-@ round injury to the living in copulation and , therefore , it is hiṃsā . 
 Just as a hot rod of iron inserted into a tube filled with sesame seeds burns them up , in the same way , many beings get killed during sexual intercourse 
 5 . Aparigraha ( Non @-@ possession ) - According to Jain texts , attachment to possessions ( parigraha ) is of two kinds : attachment to internal possessions ( <unk> parigraha ) , and attachment to external possessions ( <unk> parigraha ) . The fourteen internal possessions are : Wrong belief , the three sex @-@ passions ( male sex @-@ passion , female sex @-@ passion , and neuter sex @-@ passion ) , also the six defects ( laughter , liking , disliking , sorrow , fear , and disgust ) , and four passions ( anger , pride , deceitfulness , and greed ) . According to Jain texts , " internal possessions are proved to be hiṃsā as these are just another name for himsā " . External possessions are divided into two subclasses , the non @-@ living , and the living . " External possessions , due to the passion of attachment in them , result into himsā . " 
 = = = Ascetic practices for adherence to Ahimsa = = = 
 These five vows are called <unk> ( major vows ) when observed by an ascetic . Ahimsa is the first and foremost of all vows . Jain monks and nuns must rank among the most " nonviolent " people in the world . A Jain ascetic is expected to uphold the vow of Ahimsa to the highest standard , even at the cost of his own life . The other four major vows – truthfulness , non @-@ stealing , non @-@ possession and celibacy – are in fact extension of the first vow of complete nonviolence . 
 The ascetic practices of total renunciation of worldly affairs and possessions , refusal to stay in a single place for a long time , continuous practice of austerities like fasting etc. are geared towards observance of Ahimsa . The Jain mendicants abide by a rigorous set of rules of conduct , where they must eat , sleep and even walk with full diligence and with an awareness that even walking kills several hundreds of minute beings . Jain ascetics sweep the ground before them to avoid injuring the most minuscule forms of life . They generally brush the ground clear of insects before they tread . Digambara monks do not wear any clothes and eat food only when it is not prepared for themselves . Ascetics of the Śvētāmbara tradition wear a small mask to avoid taking in tiny insects . The observation of three <unk> or the controls of mind , speech and body and five <unk> are designed to help the monks in observing the vow of Ahimsa faultlessly . A monk is required to cultivate the habit of carefulness ( <unk> ) , in respect of the following five particulars : - 
 walking , so as not to injure any living being ; 
 speech , so as not to cause pain to any one by offensive , disagreeable language , or by a careless use of words having a tendency to incite others to violent deeds ; 
 eating , so as not to cause injury to any living being ; 
 handling things — the water gourd , books and the feather whisk , with which there is a great danger of injury to small insects ; and 
 evacuation and disposal of faeces , urine , and the like . 
 Entire day of a Jain monk is spent in ensuring that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind , body and speech faultlessly . This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action , no matter however subtle , has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation , especially those that result in hiṃsā ( injury ) . 
 = = = Householders adherence to the vow = = = 
 A Jain layman , on account of his household and occupational compulsions , is unable to adhere to the five major vows of ascetic . Hence he observes <unk> or minor vows which although are similar to the major vows of the ascetics are observed with a lesser severity . It is difficult to avoid some violence by a lay person to single @-@ sensed immobile beings in the process of occupation , cooking , self @-@ defense etc . That is why he vows not to kill without a necessary purpose and determined intention , a moving sentient being , when it is innocent . Tying up , injuring , mutilating , burdening with heavy load and depriving from food and drinks any animal or human being with a mind polluted by anger and other passions are the five <unk> or transgressions of the vow of ahimsa . However , it is to be understood that ultimately , there is limited spiritual progress and no emancipation unless the major vows are adhered to . 
 Jainism is perhaps the only religion in the world that requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet . Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots , bulbs , multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains . The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains . For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings . No furs , plumes or silk are worn . Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals . Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable , since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night . The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed ; even with this precaution , liquids are always strained before use . Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury , and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking , commerce and other mercantile trades . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Jain text list down five transgressions of the vow of ahimsa : 
 Tying up animals too tightly , 
 Beating them mercilessly , 
 Cutting their limbs , 
 <unk> them , 
 Neglecting to feed them properly . 
 A king who fights in defending his empire , however , does not violate the vow of ahimsa , for his motive is to protect his subjects . The same is the case with the judge who punishes to maintain law and order . 
 = = Philosophical overview = = 
 = = = Important constituents = = = 
 While Jainism enjoins observance of total nonviolence by the ascetics , it is often argued that the man is constantly obliged to engage in destructive activities of eating , drinking , breathing and surviving in order to support his body . According to Jainism , life is omnipresent with infinite beings including microorganisms pervading each and every part of universe . Hence it may still be possible to avoid killing of gross animals , but it is impossible to avoid killing of subtle microorganisms in air and water , plant life and various types of insects that may be crushed by walking . 
 However , the Jain conception of ahimsa is quite different from what is commonly understood by violence . The violence is defined more by the motives and the consequences to the self rather than by the act itself . Furthermore , according to Jain Scriptures , destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser karmas than destruction of developed animals and karmas generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately . Hence , it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge , even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 According to Jainism , a monk who is careless in his activities is guilty of violence irrespective of whether a living being remains alive or dies ; on the other hand , the person who is ever vigilant and careful in observing the samitis experiences no karmic bondage simply because some violence may have taken place in connection with his activities . <unk> came to be seen as a defence for the monks against violence in Jainism . Tattvārthasūtra defines hiṃsā or violence simply as removal of life by careless activity of mind , body and speech . Thus action in Jainism came to be regarded as truly violent only when accompanied by carelessness . 
 = = = = Mental states and intention = = = = 
 Ahimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence , but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence . This Jain ideal of ahimsa profoundly influenced Mahatma Gandhi ; through his friendship with the Jain scholar <unk> <unk> , it formed a basis of his satyagraha ( truth struggle ) against colonial rule and caused him to rethink many aspects of contemporary Hindu practices . Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages . Ahimsa being central to the Jain philosophy , Jain <unk> have produced , through ages , quite elaborate and detailed doctrinal materials concerning its various aspects . Paul Dundas quotes Ācārya <unk> ( 7th century ) , who shows that the omnipresence of life @-@ forms in the universe need not totally inhibit normal behaviour of the ascetics : 
 It is the intention that ultimately matters . From the real point of view , a man does not become a killer only because he has killed or because the world is crowded with souls , or remain innocent only because he has not killed physically . Even if a person does not actually kill , he becomes a killer if he has the intention to kill ; while a doctor has to cause pain but is still non @-@ violent and innocent because his intention is pure , for it is the intention which is the deciding factor , not the external act which is inconclusive . 
 Thus pure intention along with carefulness was considered necessary to practice Ahimsa as Jains admitted that even if intention may be pure , careless activities often resulted in violence unknowingly . 
 = = = = Knowledge = = = = 
 The Jains also considered right knowledge as a prerequisite for practising Ahimsa . It is necessary to know what is living and what is non @-@ living to practice Ahimsa faultlessly . A person who is confused between Living and non @-@ living can never observe non @-@ violence . <unk> Sūtra declared : 
 First knowledge , then compassion . Thus does one remain in full control . How can an ignorant person be compassionate , when he cannot distinguish between the good and the evil ? 
 It further declares : 
 Knowledge of living and non @-@ living alone will enable one to become compassionate towards all living creatures . Knowing this all aspirants , proceed from knowledge to eternal virtues . What can an ignorant do ? How does he know what is noble and what is evil ? 
 The knowledge is also considered necessary to destroy Karmas . <unk> <unk> declared : 
 The ignorant cannot destroy their Karmas by their actions while the wise can do it by their inaction i.e. by controlling their activities because they are free from greed and lustful passions and do not commit any sin as they remain contented 
 = = = Anekantavada = = = 
 Anekantavada is the principle of relativity of truth or the doctrine of multiple aspects . Jains hold that truth is multifaceted and has multiple sides that cannot be completely comprehended by anyone . Anekantavada describes the world as a multifaceted , ever @-@ changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints relative to the time , place , nature and state of one who is the viewer and that which is viewed . What is true from one point of view is open to question from another . Absolute truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone , because absolute truth is the sum total of all different viewpoints that make up the universe . Because it is rooted in these doctrines , Jainism cannot exclusively uphold the views of any individual , community , nation , or species . It recognises inherently that other views are valid for other peoples , and for other life @-@ forms . This perception leads to the doctrine of <unk> or sevenfold predication stating the truth from different viewpoints . Anekantvada is the doctrine and <unk> is its expression . According to Jaina philosophers all important philosophical statements should be expressed in this sevenfold way in order to remove the danger of dogmatism ( <unk> ) in philosophy . 
 The concept of <unk> allows the Jains to accept the truth in other philosophies from their perspectives , thus inculcating a tolerance for other viewpoints . Anekantvada is non @-@ absolutist and stands firmly against all <unk> , even including any assertion that only Jainism is the right religious path . It is thus an intellectual Ahimsa or Ahimsa of mind . In Anekantvada , there is no " battle of ideas " , because this is considered to be a form of intellectual himsa or damage , leading quite logically to physical violence and war . In today 's world , the limitations of the adversarial , " either with us or against us " form of argument are increasingly apparent leading to political , religious and social conflicts . 
 = = = Various aspects and consequences of violence = = = 
 Ācārya Amṛtacandra has described as to how the consequences of violence ( karmas attracted ) differ from person to persons for similar and different types of acts . A small violence may bring serious consequences to one person , while to another person grievous violence may bring about lesser consequences . For instance , a person hunting and killing only one small animal suffers severe consequences while a person who is building a temple or hospital suffers milder karmic consequences even though its construction kills many animals . Even when violence is jointly committed by two persons , the same act may result in severe consequence for one person and mild consequence for another person . This may happen in the case where the leader and planner of violence binds severe karmas , while a follower binds much lesser karmas . One who actually does not commit violence may be responsible for hiṃsā while one who actually commits violence is not responsible for hiṃsā . For instance , a burglar who fails in his robbery is still a felon but a diligent surgeon who is trying to save a patient is not responsible for violence even if a patient dies during the surgery . Persons who have not committed violence may become responsible for violence committed by others . This may happen when a violence which is carried out by someone is approved and instigated by someone else . Ahimsa often gives result of himsa to one and himsa may sometimes give result of ahimsa to another . For instance , one person saves another from oppression by use of violence and hence enjoys consequences of ahimsa although resorting to violence , while another does not act to save someone wishing that the other person is not saved and thus suffers the consequences of violence although he may have not actually done anything . 
 = = = <unk> hiṃsā and bhāva hiṃsā = = = 
 = = = Types of violence = = = 
 While the Jain ascetics observe absolute nonviolence , so far as a Jain householder is concerned , the violence is categorised as follows : 
 <unk> hiṃsā or intentional violence – Intentional violence knowingly done is the worst form of violence and is a transgression of the layperson 's vow of nonviolence . Examples of sankalpinī hiṃsā are killing for hunting , amusement or decoration , or butchering for food or sacrifice or killing or hurting out of enmity , malice or <unk> sankalpinī hiṃsā has to be totally renounced by a householder . 
 <unk> hiṃsā or Self @-@ defence – One is allowed to practice self @-@ defense against a robber , murderer , or any other criminal . This self @-@ defense is necessary when evil attacks . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) hiṃsā or domestic or household violence – This violence is unavoidably committed in the course of preparing food , household cleanliness , washing , construction of houses , wells , etc . 
 <unk> hiṃsā or Occupational Violence – This violence is connected to occupational undertakings like agriculture , building and operating industries , etc . 
 While sankalpinī hiṃsā has to be avoided at all costs , the other three types of hiṃsā , although unavoidable in some cases , should not exceed the strict requirements of fulfilling the duties of a householder . Furthermore , they should not be influenced by passions such as anger , greed , pride and deceit or they take the character of <unk> hiṃsā . 
 = = = Ways of committing violence = = = 
 It would be wrong , however , to conclude that Ahimsa only prohibits physical violence . An early Jain text says : " With the three means of punishment – thoughts , words , deeds – ye shall not injure living beings . " In fact , violence can be committed by combination of the following four factors : 
 1 . The instrumentality of our actions . We can commit violence through 
 a. body i.e. physical action , 
 b. speech i.e. verbal action , or 
 c. mind i.e. mental actions 
 2 . The process of committing violence . This includes whether 
 a. we only decide or plan to act , 
 b. we make preparations for the act e.g. like collecting necessary materials or weapons , or 
 c. we actually begin the action 
 3 . The modality of our action , whether 
 a. we ourselves commit violence , 
 b. we instigate others to carry out the violence , or 
 c. we give our silent approval for the violence 
 4 . The motivation for action . This includes which of the following negative emotions motivate the violence . 
 a . Anger 
 b . Greed 
 c . Pride 
 d . Manipulation or deceit 
 In Jainism , " non @-@ manifestation of passions like attachment is non @-@ injury ( Ahimsa ) , and manifestation of such passions is injury ( himsa ) . " This is termed as the essence of the Jaina Scriptures . 
 = = The rationale of nonviolence = = 
 According to Jainism , the purpose of nonviolence is not because it is a commandment of a God or any other supreme being . Its purpose is also not simply because its observance is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community . While it is true that in Jainism , the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts , their adherence is just not to please a God , but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to <unk> 's own welfare , helping him to reach spiritual victory . Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non @-@ violence , so can anyone who follows this path . 
 Another aspect that provides a rationale to the avoidance of hiṃsā is that , any acts of himsā results in himsā to self . Any act of violence though outwardly is seen to harm others , harms the soul of the person indulging in the act . Thus by an act of violence , a soul may or may not injure the material vitalities known as dravya praṇa of someone else , but always causes injury to its own bhāva praṇa or the psychic vitalities by binding the soul with karmas . It would be entirely wrong to see Ahimsa in Jainism in any sentimental light . The Jain doctrine of non @-@ injury is based on rational consciousness , not emotional compassion ; on responsibility to self , not on a social fellow feeling . The motive of Ahimsa is totally self @-@ centered and for the benefit of the individual . And yet , though the emphasis is on personal liberation , the Jain ethics makes that goal attainable only through consideration for others . 
 Furthermore , according to the Jain karmic theory , each and every soul , including self , has reincarnated as an animal , plant or microorganism innumerable number of times besides re @-@ incarnated as humans . The concept of Ahimsa is more meaningful when understood in conjunction with the concept of karmas . As the doctrine of transmigration of souls includes rebirth in animal as well as human form , it creates a humanitarian sentiment of kinship amongst all life forms . The motto of Jainism – <unk> <unk> , translated as : all life is inter @-@ related and it is the duty of souls to assist each <unk> also provides a rational approach of Jains towards Ahimsa . 
 In conclusion , the insistence of ahimsa is not so much about non @-@ injury to others as it is about non @-@ injury and spiritual welfare of the self . The ultimate rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally is about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake . 
 = = Ahimsa and vegetarianism = = 
 Jain vegetarian diet is practised by the followers of Jain culture and philosophy . It is considered one of the most rigorous forms of a spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond . The Jain cuisine is completely vegetarian , and it also excludes potatoes , onions and garlic , like the <unk> @-@ <unk> cuisine of Japan . 
 According to Amṛtacandra <unk> : 
 " Those who wish to renounce hiṃsā must , first of all , make effort to give up the consumption of wine , flesh , honey , and the five <unk> fruits ( the five <unk> trees are <unk> , <unk> , Banyan , <unk> , and <unk> , all belonging to the fig class ) . 
 The strictest forms of Jain diet are practised by the monastic ascetics . It also excludes potatoes and other root vegetables . The scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities , and especially to food , shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity . For Jains , lacto @-@ vegetarianism ( generally known simply as vegetarianism in India ) is mandatory . Food which contains even small particles of the bodies of dead animals or eggs is absolutely unacceptable . Some Jain scholars and activists support veganism , as the production of dairy products is perceived to involve violence against cows . Strict Jains don 't eat root vegetables such as potatoes , onions , roots and tubers . This is so because tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb is seen as a living being , as it is able to sprout . Also , consumption of most root vegetables involves uprooting and killing the entire plant , in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables , upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables ( or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway ) . Mushrooms , <unk> and Yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites , grow in non @-@ hygienic environments , and may harbour other life forms . Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2 , which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from . Honey is forbidden , as its collection would amount to violence against the bees . Jains are also not supposed to consume food left overnight because of contamination by microbes . Most Jain recipes substitute for potato with plantain . 
 = = Misconceptions = = 
 The Jain scriptures discuss various misconceptions that are harboured in case of Ahimsa . They often oppose the Vedic beliefs in sacrifices and other practices that justified violence in various ways . Ācārya <unk> 's <unk> discuss these wrong beliefs at length to alert the Jain laity to them . These misconceptions are as follows . 
 = = = Animal sacrifices = = = 
 The belief that animals were created for yajna ( sacrifice ) and hence it was not considered a slaughter , as it elevated not only the person making the sacrifice , but also the animals was also denounced by the Jains . Ācārya Amṛtacandra of <unk> condemned this practice by stating that it is a misconception to hold that Gods are pleased at sacrifices of living beings and there is no wrong in committing hiṃsā for the sake of religion . 
 Ācārya Amṛtacandra says that animals should not be killed for guests or persons deserving respect as often advocated in certain scriptures . It is also a wrong belief that wild animals that kill many other animals should be killed . This is often justified in the name of hunting of ferocious animals like tigers for sport . Another wrong belief forwarded to justify killing of ferocious animals is that , these kill many lives and accumulate grave sins and hence killing them is an act of mercy . According to Jainism , killing can never be an act of mercy . It is also a misconception to believe that it is advisable to kill those who are suffering so that they may get relief from agony . These sorts of arguments are forwarded to justify killing of those animals that may have become old or injured and hence have become commercially useless . 
 = = = Other wrong beliefs = = = 
 Other wrong beliefs are killing those who are in state of happiness or those who are in meditation under wrong belief that the mental state at the time of death will be perpetuated in future lives . It is also a wrong belief that killing of self and others is justified as the soul that is imprisoned in the body will be permanently released and achieve salvation . 
 = = Fruits of nonviolence = = 
 According to Jain texts , the fruits of himsā ( violence ) depends upon the severity of passions at the time of commencement of such an act . One may be responsible for the sinful act of himsā without actually causing injury ; the other , while having caused injury , may not be responsible for the act . Also , when two persons commit the act of himsā jointly , its consequences on fruition ( of karma ) , may be grave for one person and mild for the other . 
 According to Jains , the consequences of karma are inevitable . The consequences may take some time to take effect but the karma is never fruitless . The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise . A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects , as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions . However , those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately . It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions — like proper time , place , and environment — to arise for it to manifest and produce effects . If the supportive conditions do not arise , the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul . These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas , intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time , place , surroundings . There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas , according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred .

 Ahimsa , an important tenet of all the religions originating in India , is now considered as an article of faith by the adherents of the Indian religions . 
 The Jain ideal of Ahimsa profoundly influenced Mahatma Gandhi ; through his friendship with the Jain scholar <unk> <unk> . It formed a basis of his satyagraha ( truth struggle ) against colonial rule and caused him to rethink many aspects of contemporary Hindu practices . Mahatma Gandhi was of the view : 
 No religion in the World has explained the principle of Ahimsa so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism . As and when the benevolent principle of Ahimsa or non @-@ violence will be ascribed for practice by the people of the world to achieve their end of life in this world and beyond . Jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and Lord Mahavira is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on Ahimsa . 
 Bal Gangadhar Tilak has credited Jainism with cessation of slaughter of animals in the <unk> religion . Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor , the <unk> . According to Thomas <unk> , a noted Indologist , certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals , providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism . This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner . Consequently , these animals would be protected from harm .

 = Chacma baboon = 
 The chacma baboon ( Papio ursinus ) , also known as the Cape baboon , is , like all other baboons , from the Old World monkey family . It is one of the largest of all monkeys . 
 Located primarily in southern Africa , the chacma baboon has a wide variety of social behaviors , including a dominance hierarchy , collective foraging , adoption of young by females , and friendship pairings . These behaviors form parts of a complex evolutionary ecology . 
 In general the species is not threatened , but human population pressure has increased contact between humans and baboons . Hunting , accidents and trapping kill or remove many baboons from the wild . This has reduced baboon numbers and disrupted their social structure . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Due to hybridization between different baboon ( Papio ) populations across Africa , authors have occasionally grouped the entire radiation as a single species , the hamadryas baboon , Papio hamadryas . Arbitrary boundaries were then used to separate the populations into subspecies . Other authors considered the chacma baboon a subspecies of the yellow baboon , Papio cynocephalus , though it is now recognised as a separate species , Papio ursinus . The chacma baboon has two or three subspecies , depending on which classification is followed . Grubb et al . ( 2003 ) listed two subspecies , while Groves ( 2005 ) in Mammal Species of the World listed three . This article follows Groves ( 2005 ) and describes three distinct subspecies . In the Grubb et al . ( 2003 ) paper , P. u. <unk> was believed to be synonymous with P. u. ursinus .

 = = Physical description = = 
 The chacma baboon is perhaps the longest species of monkey , with a male body length of 50 – 115 cm ( 20 – 45 in ) and tail length of 45 – 84 cm ( 18 – 33 in ) . It also one of the heaviest ; the male weighs from 21 to 45 kg ( 46 to 99 lb ) . <unk> are sexually dimorphic , and females are considerably smaller than males . The female chacma weighs from 12 to 25 kg ( 26 to 55 lb ) . It is similar in size to the olive baboon and of similar weight to the more compact mandrill , which is usually crowned the largest of all monkeys . The chacma baboon is generally dark brown to gray in color , with a patch of rough hair on the nape of its neck . Unlike the males of northern baboon species ( the Guinea , hamadryas , and olive baboons ) , chacma males do not have a mane . Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this baboon is its long , downward @-@ sloping face . The canine teeth of male chacma baboons have a mean length of 3 @.@ 86 ± 0 @.@ 30 cm at the time they emigrate from their natal troop . This is the time of greatest tooth length as the teeth tend to wear or be broken thereafter . 
 The three subspecies are differentiated by size and color . The Cape chacma is a large , heavy , dark @-@ brown , and has black feet . The gray @-@ footed chacma is slightly smaller than the Cape chacma , lighter in color and build , and has gray feet . The Ruacana chacma generally appears to be a smaller , less darkly colored version of the Cape chacma . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Habitat and distribution = = = 
 The chacma baboon inhabits a wide array of habitats including woodland , savanna , steppes , and <unk> , from the grassy alpine slopes of the Drakensberg to the Kalahari desert . During the night the chacma baboon needs hills , cliffs , or large trees in which to sleep . During the day water availability may limit its range in arid areas . It is found in southern Africa , ranging from South Africa north to Angola , Zambia , and Mozambique . The subspecies are divided across this range . The Cape chacma is found in southern South Africa ; the gray @-@ footed chacma , is present from northern South Africa , through the Okavango Delta in Botswana , Zimbabwe , Mozambique ( south of the Zambezi ) , to southwest Zambia ; and the Ruacana chacma is found in northern Namibia and southern Angola . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The chacma baboon is omnivorous with a preference for fruits , while also eating insects , seeds , grass , smaller vertebrate animals , and fungi ( the desert truffle <unk> <unk> ; at the Cape of Good Hope in particular , it is also known for taking shellfish and other marine invertebrates . It is generally a scavenger when it comes to game meat , and rarely engages in hunting large animals . One incident of a chacma baboon killing a human infant has been reported , but the event is so rare , the locals believed it was due to witchcraft . Normally , chacma baboons will flee at the approach of humans , though this is changing due to the easy availability of food near human dwellings . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Social organization = = = 
 The chacma baboon usually lives in social groups , called troops , which are composed of multiple adult males , adult females , and their offspring . Occasionally , however , very small groups form that consist of only a single adult male and several adult females . Chacma troops are characterized by a dominance hierarchy . Female ranking within the troop is inherited through the mother and remains relatively fixed , while male ranking is often in flux , especially when the dominant male is replaced . <unk> are unusual among baboons in that neither males nor females form strong relationships with members of the same sex . Instead , the strongest social bonds are often between unrelated adult males and females . Infanticide is also common compared to other baboon species , as newly dominant males will often attempt to kill young baboons sired by the previously dominant male . Baboon troops possess a complex group behavior and communicate by means of body attitudes , facial expressions , vocalizations and touch . 
 = = = Morning dispersal patterns = = = 
 The chacma baboon often sleeps in large groups on cliffs or in trees at night to avoid predators . The morning dispersal from the sleeping site is synchronized , with all members leaving at the same time . In most cases , dispersal is initiated by a single individual , and the other members of the group decide whether or not to follow . At least five followers must be recruited for a successful dispersal initiation , and not all initiation attempts are successful . Surprisingly , the initiator 's dominance status shows little correlation with successful initiation of departure ; more @-@ dominant individuals are no more likely to lead a successful departure than subordinate individuals . One study has shown that while the success rate of dispersal initiation attempts is relatively constant across all sexes , male are more likely to attempt initiation than females , and lactating females are less likely to attempt initiation than females without dependent offspring . A separate study has achieved slightly different results . While dominance hierarchy does not play a significant role in initiating the morning dispersal , social affiliation does . Chacma baboons that play a more central role in the group ( as measured by grooming behavior and time spent with other members ) are more likely to be followed during the morning dispersal . This study concluded that group members are more likely to follow the behavior of individuals with which they are closely affiliated . 
 = = = Foraging behavior = = = 
 Dominance does play a role in group foraging decisions . A dominant individual ( usually the alpha male ) leads the group to easily monopolized resources . The group usually follows , even though many subordinate members cannot gain access to that particular resource . As in morning dispersal , the inclination of group members to follow the leader is positively associated with social interactions with that dominant individual . 
 Collective foraging behavior , with many individuals taking advantage of the same resource at once , has also been observed . However , this behavior can be chiefly attributed to shared dietary needs rather than social affiliation . Pregnant females , who share similar dietary needs , are more likely to synchronize their behavior than fertile females . Foraging synchronization decreases in areas with lower food density . 
 = = = Adoption = = = 
 Adoption behavior has been observed in chacma baboons . Orphaned baboons whose mothers have disappeared or died are often too small to care for themselves . In one study of nine natural orphans and three introduced orphans , all but one orphan were adopted by another member of the group . The individual that was not adopted was 16 months old , four months older than the next oldest orphan , and was old enough to survive on its own . Adoption behavior includes sleeping close to the orphaned infant , grooming and carrying the orphan , and protecting it from harassment by other members of the troop . Both males and females care for infants , and care does not depend on the infant 's sex . Additionally , all caregivers are <unk> , only four or five years of age . The two major theories explaining this behavior are kin selection , in which caregivers take care of potentially related orphans , and parental practice , in which young caregivers increase their own fitness by using an orphan to practice their own parental skills . 
 = = = Friendship = = = 
 Males and female chacma baboons often form relationships referred to as " friendships " . These cooperative relationships generally occur between lactating females and adult males . The females are believed to seek out male friendships to gain protection from infanticide . In many baboon species , immigrant alpha males often practice infanticide upon arrival in a new troop . By killing unrelated infants , the new male shortens the time until he can mate with the females of the troop . A female with dependent offspring generally does not become sexually receptive until she <unk> her offspring at around 12 months of age . However , a mother usually becomes sexually receptive shortly after the death of her offspring . 
 This protection hypothesis is supported by studies of stress hormones in female baboons during changes in the male hierarchy . When an immigrant male ascends to the top of the male dominance hierarchy , stress hormones in lactating and pregnant females increases , while stress hormones in females not at risk of infanticide stay the same . Additionally , females in friendships with males exhibit a smaller rise in stress hormones than do females without male friends . 
 The benefits of friendship to males are less clear . A male is more likely to enter into friendships with females with which he has mated , which indicates males might enter into friendships to protect their own offspring and not just to protect that female 's future reproductive success . These friendships may play a role in the mating system of chacma baboons . A female will often mate with several males , which increases the number of potential fathers for her offspring and increases the chances she will be able to find at least one friend to protect her infants . 
 Female chacma baboons have been observed to compete with each other for male friends . This may be the result of one male having a high probability of paternity with multiple females . These competitions are heavily influenced by the female dominance hierarchy , with dominant females displacing subordinate females in friendships with males . Generally , when a more @-@ dominant female attempts to make friends with an individual which is already the friend of a subordinate female , the subordinate female reduces grooming and spatial proximity to that male , potentially leaving her offspring at higher risk of infanticide . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 The chacma baboon is widespread and does not rank among threatened animal species . However , in some confined locations , such as South Africa 's Southern Cape Peninsula , local populations are dwindling due to habitat loss and predation from other protected species , such as leopards and lions . Some troops have become a suburban menace , overturning trash cans and entering houses in their search for food . These troops can be aggressive and dangerous , and such negative encounters have resulted in hunting by frustrated local residents . This isolated population is thought to face extinction within 10 years . 
 The chacma is listed under Appendix II of CITES as it occurs in many protected areas across its range . The only area in South Africa where they are monitored is in the Cape Peninsula , where they are protected . 
 Observations by those working hands @-@ on in South Africa 's rehabilitation centers have found this species is damaged by human intervention ; troop structures are influenced , and over the years a significant loss in numbers has occurred . Because they live near human habitats , baboons are shot , poisoned , electrocuted , run over , and captured for the pet industry , research laboratories and <unk> ( medicine ) . Despite this , assessors working for the IUCN believe there are no major threats that could result in a range @-@ wide decline of the species . 
 = = = In popular culture = = = 
 In 2011 , the British Television Channel ITV1 aired an eight @-@ episode miniseries , hosted by popular British comedian Bill Bailey . The series followed the lives of three different family groups of chacma baboons in South Africa . The series focuses on the baboons ' abilities to adapt to human settlement and their complex social lives . It is generally structured within a narrative , with each adult baboon having a name and being treated as an ' actor ' in the story . The three families of baboons have each developed their own ways of life ; the ' <unk> ' group spends most its time trying to rob food from tourists along a coastal highway , the ' Tokai ' group has remained in a more natural forest area , and the ' Da Gama ' group lives on the rooftops of an apartment complex . The program is the second attempt by Bailey to produce a <unk> nature documentary , and it received generally favourable reviews . 
 = California State Route 190 = 
 State Route 190 ( SR 190 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that is split into two parts by the Sierra Nevada . The western portion of begins at Tipton at a junction with State Route 99 and heads east towards Porterville before ending at Quaking Aspen in the Sequoia National Forest . The eastern portion begins at US 395 at Olancha , heads east through Death Valley National Park , and ends at State Route 127 at Death Valley Junction . The 43 @.@ 0 @-@ mile ( 69 @.@ 2 km ) portion over the Sierra Nevada remains unconstructed , and the California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) has no plans to build it through the wilderness areas . 
 The route east of State Route 136 near Keeler is on the California Freeway and Expressway System , but is a two @-@ lane road . Except west of State Route 65 in Porterville , SR 190 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System ; the part within Death Valley National Park , known as the Death Valley Scenic Byway , has been added to the system and is a National Scenic Byway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 State Route 190 begins at State Route 99 just south of downtown Tipton in Tulare County and heads straight east along the flat San Joaquin Valley on Avenue 144 . There is a short expressway segment in Porterville , including a cloverleaf interchange at State Route 65 and a partial interchange at Main Street , after which the highway begins to curve alongside the Tule River , passing the south side of Lake Success , as the terrain becomes more rugged . Following the river , it meets the south end of County Route <unk> , an access road to Balch Park in the Mountain Home State Forest , at the forks of the river near the community of Springville . SR 190 continues east near the Middle Fork and South Fork Middle Fork Tule River to near Camp Nelson , where it begins rising into the foothills , going around many hairpin curves in order to rise to Quaking Aspen , the source of the South Fork Middle Fork and the end of the western segment of SR 190 . The county @-@ maintained Western Divide Highway continues south to a point west of Johnsondale , where traffic can turn east to reach US 395 via Sherman Pass and County Route <unk> . 
 From Quaking Aspen across the Sierra Nevada to Olancha , Caltrans has adopted a proposed alignment , but is unlikely to build it , in part due to two protected wilderness areas — the Golden Trout Wilderness and South Sierra Wilderness — along the route . The unconstructed routing heads northeast from Quaking Aspen , cresting a small summit before following Freeman Creek easterly past the Freeman Creek Grove , crossing the Kern River near its forks , and then using the path of Rattlesnake Creek and Beach Creek to the Beach Meadows area . Crossing several ridges to the northeast , SR 190 would make its way to the South Fork Kern River near <unk> Mountain , then heading southeast along that waterway to the vicinity of Haiwee Pass . That pass , elevation about 8200 feet ( 2500 m ) above sea level , would take the highway over the Sierra crest into Inyo County , dropping for 12 @.@ 0 miles ( 19 @.@ 3 km ) in a north @-@ northeasterly direction to US 395 at Olancha ( elevation <unk> feet / 1100 m ) . 
 The eastern section of SR 190 begins at Olancha in the Owens Valley , at the intersection with US 395 . The route heads northeast along the southeast side of Owens Lake to the junction with SR 136 southeast of Keeler , where it turns southeast and east around the south side of the Inyo Mountains . After passing the turnoff to Darwin , SR 190 enters Death Valley National Park and becomes curvier as it heads down into the Panamint Valley . The highway crosses the valley and then turns northeast over Towne Pass and into the northern part of Death Valley at Stovepipe Wells . Within the valley , at the intersection with North Highway , which leads to Scotty 's Castle and Beatty , Nevada , SR 190 turns southeast through Death Valley , which it remains inside until the turnoff to Badwater Basin , the lowest point in North America , near the settlement of Furnace Creek . It leaves the valley to the southeast alongside Furnace Creek Wash , where the highway is usually closed at least once a year by flash floods . SR 190 turns east away from the wash at the turnoff to Dante 's View , and soon leaves the park , after which it follows a mostly straight alignment to its end at State Route 127 at Death Valley Junction . 
 = = History = = 
 The path of SR 190 east of the Panamint Range in Death Valley National Park was followed in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death Valley ' 49ers , a group of ' 49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise , Utah to look for a shortcut to Walker Pass . The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows , following the general route of present SR 190 from Death Valley Junction into Death Valley , which they left to the west into Panamint Valley and then turned south towards present State Route 178 . After ore was discovered in Death Valley , the route became a primitive road , though most travel into the valley , such as the twenty mule team borax route , was from the south . 
 The second boom in Death Valley was tourism , started in the 1920s by Herman <unk> . After several failures in getting a toll road approved from Lida , Nevada or over Towne Pass , he scaled back plans to include only the part of the latter route between southeast of Darwin and his resort at Stovepipe Wells . The new <unk> Toll Road was certified complete on May 4 , 1926 , and toll rates were set : $ 2 per motor vehicle and 50 ¢ per person . In 1933 , the state legislature added many roads to the state highway system , including a new ( unsigned ) Route 127 , connecting Tipton with Baker via Lone Pine and Death Valley Junction . The Death Valley National Monument was created on February 11 , 1933 , and in December 1934 the Division of Highways paid $ 25 @,@ 000 for the 30 @.@ 35 @-@ mile ( 48 @.@ 84 km ) road , giving the 17 miles ( 27 km ) east of the park boundary at the pass to the National Park Service . The state Division of Highways and National Park Service soon paved the route from Lone Pine ( on US 395 ) through Towne Pass and Death Valley to Baker ( on US 91 ) . The work was completed in October 1937 , including the 17 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 18 km ) Darwin cutoff that bypassed Darwin and the old toll road west of Panamint Springs . The National Park Service , using Civilian Conservation Corps labor , maintained the road through the park until August 1942 , when an 11 @-@ mile ( 18 km ) stretch east of the valley was washed out by a storm . At that time , maintenance was given back to the state , which rebuilt the destroyed segment . 
 When the state sign route system was created in 1934 , Sign Route 190 was assigned to the portion of Route 127 west of Death Valley Junction , while the remainder to Baker became part of Sign Route 127 . However , the highway was not continuous , with the roadway from Tipton ( which had been built by Tulare County ) ending at Quaking Aspen ( east of Camp Nelson ) and that from Death Valley ending southwest of Lone Pine . In 1923 , Tulare County businessmen had begun to push for a new trans @-@ Sierra highway connecting Porterville with Lone Pine , but were set back by a lack of state aid , as the road was not a state highway . The first piece , which would turn out to be the only one built , opened in early July 1931 to Quaking Aspen ( and became a state highway in 1933 ) . Grading of the 15 @-@ mile ( 24 km ) Western Divide Highway , a county road that was supposed to continue south to State Route 155 at Greenhorn Summit , was completed from Quaking Aspen south to near Johnsondale in July 1962 . A new road from Johnsondale across Sherman Pass , maintained by the U.S. Forest Service and Tulare and Inyo Counties ( the latter as County Route <unk> ) , was completed in 1976 , allowing traffic on the western segment of SR 190 to reach US 395 , though via a longer route than the proposed SR 190 . 
 In March 1959 , Tulare County approved a change in location of the proposed highway to Olancha Pass ( Haiwee Pass , just to the south , was soon considered for a possible alternate location ) , and the legislature moved the main line of Route 127 south to that location , crossing US 395 at Olancha , later that year . The old route from southeast of Keeler to Lone Pine remained as a branch , and was still signed as SR 190 . Also in 1959 , the original routing from Lone Pine through Death Valley to Baker was added to the proposed California Freeway and Expressway System , though no parts have been upgraded as such . The east – west piece between Tipton and Death Valley Junction legislatively received the State Route 190 designation in the 1964 renumbering , and the north – south part became State Route 127 , which it had been signed as ; the branch to Lone Pine became a new State Route 136 . By the mid @-@ 1970s , the environmental movement had essentially killed the planned connection , and the designation of the Golden Trout Wilderness in 1978 and South Sierra Wilderness in 1984 were the final blow , though Caltrans still has an officially adopted alignment designated over Haiwee Pass .
