 Brave Fencer Musashi was originally released in Japan on July 16 , 1998 . It was re @-@ released on June 29 , 2000 as part of Square 's Millennium Collection along with merchandise including postcards , a combination camera and cellphone strap , a handy strap , and keychain fobs . Another Japanese re @-@ release was for the PlayStation Network on July 9 , 2008 . In the North American market , it was packaged on October 31 , 1998 with the PlayStation 1998 Collector 's CD Vol.2 , which contained a demo of Final Fantasy VIII . 
 A simplified Japan @-@ exclusive mobile phone adaptation retitled Musashi : Mobile Samurai was released in 2005 . After the release of the game , plans were made for a sequel , but were then delayed for years . A PlayStation 2 sequel , titled Musashi : Samurai Legend , was developed by Square Enix and was released worldwide in 2005 .

 Brave Fencer Musashi sold approximately 648 @,@ 803 copies in Japan during 1998 , making it the 17th best @-@ selling game of the year in that region . The game was given a 32 out of 40 by Famitsu magazine . 
 The game received positive reviews from critics , with Metacritic giving it a 81 out of 100 . GameSpot reviewer James Mielke praised the graphics , calling them " very well done " and superior to other Square RPGs of the time . IGN and GamePro 's reviews by Randy Nelson and Air Hendrix , respectively , similarly praised the game 's " excellent visual design " . GameSpot and GamePro reviews also praised the voice acting quality , while Nelson noted the " stellar soundtrack " but found the voice acting to be annoying . 
 The gameplay was also positively received ; for example , Hendrix from GamePro shared his opinion that the game did well with management of the games time . Nelson and Hendrix from IGN and GamePro both emphasized their enjoyment of the games action elements . GameSpot , while feeling that the action elements were the primary focus of the game , still liked the wide variety of role @-@ playing elements present . Nelson from IGN , however , wished that the role @-@ playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game . All three reviewers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda , such as Mielke from GameSpot who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series . Both GameSpot and IGN felt that the comparison was invalid , as Musashi focused much more on action than role @-@ playing , resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all . 
 = Mise of Lewes = 
 The Mise of Lewes was a settlement made on 14 May 1264 between King Henry III of England and his rebellious barons , led by Simon de Montfort . The settlement was made on the day of the Battle of Lewes , one of the two major battles of the Second Barons ' War . The conflict between king and magnates was caused by dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court and Henry 's high level and new methods of taxation . In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford , which essentially left royal government in the hands of a council of magnates , but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements . In 1263 , as the country was on the brink of civil war , the two parties agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by the French king Louis IX . Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative , and decided clearly in favour of Henry . The outcome was unacceptable for the rebellious barons , and war between the two parties broke out almost immediately . 
 The Mise of Lewes was signed on the day of Montfort 's victory at the Battle of Lewes , though it is not known whether it happened during or after the battle . Neither are the terms of the document known , though it seems clear that they involved conditions for further negotiations . These efforts at a permanent settlement fell through , however , and the support for Montfort 's government gradually eroded . Henry 's oldest son , Edward – the later King Edward I – started a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265 , where Earl Simon was defeated and killed . Parts of the baronial resistance still held out , but by the end of 1266 the final besieged garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered . The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth .

 By 1264 , the reign of Henry III was deeply troubled by disputes between the king and his nobility . The conflict was caused by several factors : the influence of foreigners at court , a wasteful war over the crown of Sicily , and a personal dispute between King Henry and Simon de Montfort , Earl of Leicester . In 1258 , Henry was forced to accept the so @-@ called Provisions of Oxford , whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates . In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the Provisions of Westminster . The provisions remained in effect for three years ; it was not until 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition . Receiving the papal annulment of the provisions his emissaries had campaigned for , he re @-@ assumed control of government . Over the next two years , however , discontent re @-@ emerged over Henry 's style of government . He failed to be reconciled with Montfort , and he also alienated Gloucester 's son and heir Gilbert . In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France , and reignited the reform movement . On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London , and once more forced to accept the conditions of the provisions . Prince Edward – the later King Edward I – now took control of the situation . In October Edward took Windsor Castle , and the baronial alliance started to break up . 
 Cornered , Montfort had to accept a truce and agree to submit the issue to arbitration by the French king Louis IX . By the Mise of Amiens , Louis decided entirely in favour of Henry , and repudiated the provisions . The settlement did not present a solution to the conflict , but rather a recipe for further problems . The one @-@ sided decision for the king and against the barons left Montfort with little choice but armed rebellion . Hostilities started already in February , when Montfort 's sons , Henry and another Simon , attacked the possessions of Roger Mortimer in the Marches . Henry summoned the feudal army , and the royal forces won an important victory at Northampton , where the younger Simon was captured . Montfort was still in control of London , as Henry regained control over Kent and Sussex . Montfort marched out of London to negotiate , but the terms – involving maintaining the provisions – were rejected by the king . The only option remaining was to fight , and the two forces met at Lewes on 14 May 1264 . In spite of inferior numbers , the baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort won the battle . Edward , commanding the right wing , quickly defeated the London forces . When he set out in pursuit of the fleeing soldiers , however , he left the rest of the royal army exposed . The baronial forces took advantage of the situation , and soon won the day .

 Since no documents exist to confirm the content of the Mise of Lewes , there has been much debate among historians over its content , and the circumstances under which it was written . Noël Denholm @-@ Young , in an article published in 1933 , made a conjecture on what the main points of the agreement were . The first point , according to Denholm @-@ Young , was that Prince Edward and his cousin , Henry of Almain , should be given over to the barons as hostages . Secondly , those of the baronial party who had been taken hostage at Northampton were to be released . Thirdly , those who had taken hostages from the royalist party at the Battle of Lewes were to receive ransom . Finally , it was agreed that a committee of French clergy and nobles should arbitrate over a permanent settlement . This interpretation has been largely followed by later historians . 
 One contentious point in Denholm @-@ Young 's article was his assertion that there was no mention of the Provisions of Oxford in the Mise of Lewes . This was an idea that John Maddicott strongly contested in an 1983 article . According to Maddicott , the provisions had been at the centre of Montfort 's opposition over the last six years , and it was unlikely that he would give them up so easily . Nevertheless , Montfort showed willingness to negotiate the terms of the provisions . As such , the Mise of Lewes was a moderate document ; Montfort wanted to avoid a repetition of the situation after the Mise of Amiens . Rather it was external circumstances outside of Montfort 's control that led to the eventual failure of the negotiations between the royalists and the barons . 
 This interpretation was challenged by David Carpenter two years later , in 1985 . Montfort had no intention to compromise with the royalists at all , according to Carpenter . In Carpenter 's version of events , the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing , not after the battle was over , as previously assumed . This put Montfort in a situation where concessions were necessary , in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible . Once the battle was over and government in Montfort 's hands , he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists , and that was why hostilities continued . This dating of the document , however , has later been disputed by D. W. Burton , who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The government led by Montfort soon ran into problems ; he faced poor finances , general disorder , and the threat of invasion from exiled royalists in France . It was decided – since the French arbitration committee had come to nothing – to set up a provisional administration , consisting of Montfort , the young Earl of Gloucester , and the Bishop of Chichester . These three were to elect a council of nine , to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached . By the Peace of Canterbury in August , Henry and Edward were forced to accept even stricter terms than those of the Mise of Lewes . According to this new agreement , the current form of government was to remain in force throughout the reign of King Henry , and into that of Edward . To keep the borders safe , Montfort had been forced to release Roger Mortimer and other royalist Marcher lords after the Battle of Lewes . In December , Montfort forced Mortimer , Roger de Clifford and Roger de Leybourne to promise to leave the country for Ireland . Then , in January , he summoned a parliament at Leicester which became known as Montfort 's Parliament , including representatives from the shires and boroughs ; an innovation in English government . Here Montfort secured the support of the community of the realm for his continued reign . 
 Montfort 's success was illusory , however . The terms of the Peace of Canterbury were rejected by a papal legate in negotiations at Boulogne . Meanwhile , the Marcher lords did not leave the country , and remained a thorn in the side of the regime . The triumvirate at the head of government broke up when the Earl of Gloucester defected to the royalist side . In May , Edward was able to escape captivity , with Gloucester 's help . Edward started on a campaign of re @-@ conquest , while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches . He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn , and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon . Edward , however , routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle . On 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham , forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals . The battle soon turned into a massacre ; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field . Even with Montfort dead resistance remained , particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle . In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons , and by the end of the year the garrison surrendered . 
 = Maine @-@ class battleship = 
 The three Maine @-@ class battleships — Maine , Missouri , and Ohio — were built at the turn of the 20th century for the United States Navy . Based on the preceding Illinois class , they incorporated several significant technological advances over the earlier ships . They were the first American battleships to incorporate Krupp cemented armor , which was stronger than Harvey armor , smokeless powder , which allowed for higher @-@ velocity guns and water @-@ tube boilers , which were more efficient and lighter . The Maines were armed with four 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) guns and sixteen 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) guns , and they could steam at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) , a significant increase over the Illinois class . 
 The three Maine @-@ class battleships served in a variety of roles throughout their careers . Maine and Missouri remained in the Atlantic Fleet for their careers , though Ohio initially served with the Asiatic Fleet from 1904 to 1907 . All three ships took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907 – 1909 , though Maine 's excessive coal consumption forced her to proceed independently for most of the voyage . Missouri was used as a training ship for much of the rest of her career , and Ohio took part in the American intervention in the Mexican Revolution in 1914 . All three ships were employed as training ships during World War I. After the war , all three ships were withdrawn from service between 1919 and 1920 before being sold for scrap in 1922 and 1923 and broken up . 
 = = Design = = 
 By 1897 , the US Navy had five battleships under construction , and no plans to request additional units for 1898 . With the destruction of the armored cruiser Maine in Havana harbor and the subsequent declaration of war on Spain on 25 April 1898 , however , a large naval expansion program was passed through Congress . The program called for three new battleships , the first one which would be named for the destroyed Maine . Design work began immediately , though the broad parameters for the new battleships proved to be contentious . The Board on Construction advocated a design based on Iowa , to be armed with 13- , 8- , and 6 @-@ inch ( 330 , 203 , and 152 mm ) guns , though others on the board argued that repeating the Illinois class , which was armed with 12 in ( 300 mm ) and 6 in guns and had a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , would save construction time . Additionally , they pointed out that 8 in guns could not be incorporated within the displacement limit . 
 Several important technological advances had become available by this time , however , which necessitated several changes to the design . The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities ; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) 40 @-@ caliber high @-@ velocity gun . In addition , Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany ; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process . Since the steel was stronger , thinner armor plating could achieve the same level of protection and more importantly , significant savings in weight . Water @-@ tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships . These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire @-@ tube boilers . 
 Shortly after the three ships had been authorized , the Navy learned that the Russian battleship Retvizan , recently ordered from William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia , would be capable of steaming at 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) , a margin of 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) over the Maine design . The Navy requested that the shipyards submitting designs for the contract increase the speed of their proposed ships to match the Russian vessel . Cramp & Sons responded by lengthening the hull by 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) to increase its fineness ( and thus reduce drag ) and incorporate new Niclausse boilers , while the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company lengthened the hull by 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) and increased the horsepower of the propulsion system by sixty percent , to 16 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) . Ultimately , the Newport design was chosen for the new ships . 
 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 The ships of the Maine class were 388 feet ( 118 m ) long at the waterline and 393 ft 11 in ( 120 @.@ 07 m ) long overall . They had a beam of 72 ft 3 in ( 22 @.@ 02 m ) and a draft of 23 ft 9 in ( 7 @.@ 24 m ) to 24 ft 4 in ( 7 @.@ 42 m ) . They displaced 12 @,@ 362 to 12 @,@ 846 long tons ( 12 @,@ 560 to 13 @,@ 052 t ) as designed and up to 13 @,@ 700 long tons ( 13 @,@ 900 t ) at full load . The ships had a metacentric height of 2 @.@ 36 ft ( 0 @.@ 72 m ) . They had a forecastle deck that extended to the main mast . As built , they were fitted with heavy military masts with fighting tops , but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909 . They had a crew of 40 officers and 521 enlisted men , which increased to 779 – 813 officers and men . 
 The ships were powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion steam engines rated at 16 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) . Steam was provided by twelve coal @-@ fired Thornycroft boilers for Missouri and Ohio , and twenty @-@ four Niclausse boilers for Maine , which were trunked into three tall funnels amidships . The ships ' engines generated a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) , though Ohio only made 17 @.@ 82 knots ( 33 @.@ 00 km / h ; 20 @.@ 51 mph ) on her speed trials . Normal coal capacity was 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) , though Maine could carry up to 1 @,@ 867 long tons ( 1 @,@ 897 t ) , Missouri had capacity for 1 @,@ 837 long tons ( 1 @,@ 866 t ) , and Ohio could store 2 @,@ 150 long tons ( 2 @,@ 180 t ) of coal . At a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , the ships had a designed endurance of 4 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 100 km ; 5 @,@ 600 mi ) , though they could steam for 5 @,@ 660 nmi ( 10 @,@ 480 km ; 6 @,@ 510 mi ) at that speed . Ohio 's significantly greater coal capacity allowed her to cruise for 6 @,@ 560 nmi ( 12 @,@ 150 km ; 7 @,@ 550 mi ) at that speed . Steering was controlled by a single rudder , and the ships had a turning radius of 350 yards ( 320 m ) at 10 knots . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships were armed with a main battery of four 12 inch / 40 Mark 3 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . The guns fired a 870 @-@ pound ( 390 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 400 feet per second ( 730 m / s ) . The turrets were Mark IV mounts , which required the guns to be horizontal to be reloaded . These mounts could elevate to 15 degrees and depress to -5 degrees , and they were electrically operated , and the guns could be operated independently . 
 The secondary battery consisted of sixteen 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) / 45 Mark 6 guns , which were placed in casemates in the hull . Ten were mounted in a battery on the upper deck , four more were located in another battery directly above on the forecastle deck , and the last two were placed in sponsoned casemates in the bow . They fired a 105 lb ( 48 kg ) shell at 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ( 850 m / s ) . For close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats , they carried six 3 @-@ inch / 50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull , eight 3 @-@ pounder guns , and six 1 @-@ pounder guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , the Maine @-@ class battleships carried two 18 in ( 457 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . They were initially equipped with the Mark II Whitehead design , which carried a 140 @-@ pound ( 64 kg ) warhead and had a range of 800 yards ( 730 m ) at a speed of 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) .

 The ships ' armor consisted of both Krupp cemented and Harvey steel . Their main armored belt was 11 in ( 279 mm ) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and tapered down to 5 @.@ 5 in ( 140 mm ) on the lower edge . The belt was 8 in ( 203 mm ) elsewhere and reduced to 4 in ( 102 mm ) on the bottom edge . The belt extended from 3 ft 3 in ( 0 @.@ 99 m ) above the waterline to 4 ft 3 in ( 1 @.@ 30 m ) below . The main deck was 2 @.@ 5 in ( 64 mm ) thick and was increased slightly to 2 @.@ 75 in ( 70 mm ) on the sloped sides that connected it to the belt . The deck was increased to 4 in at the stern . The main battery gun turrets had 12 in thick faces , and the supporting barbettes had the same thickness of armor plating on their exposed sides . 9 in ( 229 mm ) thick bulkheads connected the belt with the barbettes ; behind these , the barbettes were protected with 8 in of steel . Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery . The conning tower had 10 in ( 254 mm ) thick sides with a 2 in ( 51 mm ) thick roof .

 After Maine and Missouri entered service , they were assigned to the North Atlantic Fleet , while Ohio , built on the West Coast of the United States , was instead sent to serve as the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet based in the Philippines . In April 1904 , a turret fire killed 36 men aboard Missouri , but the quick action of three men prevented the fire from reaching the magazines and destroying the ship , for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor . In 1907 , Ohio returned from the western Pacific and joined her sisters in what was now the Atlantic Fleet . During this period , Maine served as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet until she was relieved in April 1907 . 
 In December 1907 , the three ships and the other battleships in the Atlantic Fleet steamed out of Hampton Roads , Virginia , at the start of the cruise of the Great White Fleet . The fleet steamed south , around South America and back north to the US west coast . Maine was detached owing to her excessive use of coal along with the battleship Alabama ; the two ships continued the journey independently and on a greatly shortened itinerary . The rest of the ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia , the Philippines , and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean . They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic , arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 for a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt . 
 Over the following six years , the ships had fairly uneventful careers . Missouri spent most of the time out of active service , only recommissioning for summer training cruises with midshipmen from the US Naval Academy . In 1914 , Ohio was sent to Mexican waters to protect American interests in the country during the Mexican Revolution . After the United States entered World War I by declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917 , all three ships were used to train naval recruits for the expanding wartime fleet . Following the German surrender in November 1918 , Missouri was used to ferry American soldiers back from France , though the other two vessels were not so employed , since their short range and lack of sufficient accommodations would have made them inefficient transports . The three ships remained in active service only very briefly after the war . Ohio was decommissioned in January 1919 and Missouri and Maine followed in September 1919 and May 1920 , respectively . All three ships were sold for scrap , with Maine and Missouri going to the breakers ' yard in January 1922 and Ohio joining them in March 1923 .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide .

The race was sponsored by Beefeater Gin . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races .

 = Kola Peninsula = 
 The Kola Peninsula ( from Kildin Sami : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; Northern Sami : <unk> , Russian : <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> , Kolsky <unk> , ) is a peninsula in the far northwest of Russia . Constituting the bulk of the territory of Murmansk Oblast , it lies almost completely inside the Arctic Circle and is bordered by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the east and southeast . The city of Murmansk is the most populous human settlement on the peninsula , with a population of over 300 @,@ 000 as of the 2010 Census . 
 Despite the peninsula 's northerly location , its proximity to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter , but also results in high winds due to the temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea . Summers are rather chilly , with the average July temperature of only 11 ° C ( 52 ° F ) . The peninsula is covered by taiga in the south and tundra in the north , where permafrost limits the growth of the trees resulting in landscape dominated by shrubs and grasses . The peninsula supports a small variety of mammals , and its rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon . The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve , established to protect the population of common eider , is located in the Kandalaksha Gulf . 
 While the north of the peninsula was already settled in the 7th – 5th millennium BCE , the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE , when various peoples started to arrive from the south . However , by the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained . This changed in the 12th century , when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula 's game and fish riches . Soon after , the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic , and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands . No permanent settlements , however , were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century . 
 The Novgorod Republic lost control of the peninsula to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1471 , but the Russian migration did not stop . Several new settlements were established during the 16th century , and the Sami and <unk> people were forced into serfdom . In the second half of the 16th century , the peninsula became a subject of dispute between the Tsardom of Russia and the Kingdom of Denmark – Norway , which resulted in the strengthening of the Russian position . By the end of the 19th century , the indigenous Sami population had been mostly forced north by the Russians as well as by newly arriving <unk> Komi and <unk> Nenets ( so @-@ called <unk> people ) , who migrated here to escape a reindeer disease epidemics in their home lands in the Southeast of the White Sea . The original administrative and economic center of the area was the town of Kola , situated at the estuary of the Kola River into the Kola Bay . However , in 1916 , Romanov @-@ na @-@ <unk> ( now Murmansk ) was founded and quickly became the largest city and port on the peninsula . 
 The Soviet period saw a rapid increase of the population , although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads . The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization , including forced relocation to the town of Lovozero and other centralized settlements , and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized , largely due to its strategic position and the discovery of the vast apatite deposits in the 1920s . As a result , the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage , including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting . 
 After the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease . Between 1989 and 2002 , Murmansk Oblast lost almost a quarter of its population ; and almost 100 @,@ 000 more between 2002 and 2010 . Nevertheless , the economy rebounded somewhat in the first decade of the 2000s and the peninsula remains the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia . 
 = = Geography = = 
 = = = Location and overview = = = 
 The peninsula is located in the far northwest of Russia , almost completely inside the Arctic Circle and is washed by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the east and southeast . Geologically , the peninsula occupies the northeastern edge of the Baltic Shield . The western border of the peninsula stretches along the meridian from the Kola Bay through the valley of the Kola River , Lake Imandra , and the Niva River to the Kandalaksha Gulf , although some sources push it all the way west to Russia 's border with Finland . Under a more restrictive definition , the peninsula covers an area of about 100 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 39 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . The northern coast is steep and high , while the southern coast is flat . The western part of the peninsula is covered by two mountain ranges : the Khibiny Mountains and the Lovozero Massif ; the former contains the highest point of the peninsula — Mount <unk> , the height of which is 1 @,@ 191 meters ( 3 @,@ 907 ft ) . The <unk> drainage divide lies in the central part . The mountainous reliefs of the Murman and Kandalaksha Coasts stretch from southeast to northwest , mirroring the peninsula 's main orographic features . 
 Administratively , the territory of the peninsula consists of <unk> and Tersky Districts , parts of <unk> and Kolsky Districts , as well as the territories subordinated to the cities and towns of Murmansk , <unk> , Severomorsk , Kirovsk , and parts of the territories subordinated to Apatity , Olenegorsk , and <unk> Zori .

 Because the last ice age removed the top sediment layer of the soil , the Kola Peninsula is on the surface extremely rich in various ores and minerals , including <unk> and <unk> ; copper , nickel , and iron ores ; mica ; <unk> ; ceramic materials , as well as rare earth elements and non @-@ ferrous ores . Deposits of construction materials such as granite , quartzite , and limestone are also abundant . <unk> earth deposits are common near lakes and are used to produce insulation . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Proximity of the peninsula to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter , resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds . Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons , while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones . Monsoon winds are common in most areas , with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer . Strong storm winds blow for 80 – 120 days a year . The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice @-@ free even in winter . 
 Precipitation levels on the peninsula are rather high : 1 @,@ 000 millimeters ( 39 in ) in the mountains , 600 – 700 millimeters ( 24 – 28 in ) on the Murman Coast , and 500 – 600 millimeters ( 20 – 24 in ) in other areas . The wettest months are August through October , while March and April are the driest . 
 The average temperature in January is about − 10 ° C ( 14 ° F ) , with lower temperatures typical in the central parts of the peninsula . The average temperature in July is about + 11 ° C ( 52 ° F ) . Record lows reach − 50 ° C ( − 58 ° F ) in the central parts and − 35 to − 40 ° C ( − 31 to − 40 ° F ) on the coasts . Record highs exceed + 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) almost on all the territory of the peninsula . First frosts occur as early as August and may last through May and even June . 
 = = = Flora and fauna = = = 
 The peninsula is covered by taiga in the south and tundra in the north . In the tundra , cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth of the trees , resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses , wildflowers , and shrubs such as dwarf birch and <unk> . In northern coastal areas , stony and shrub lichens are common . The taiga in the southern areas is composed mostly of pine trees and firs . 
 Reindeer herds visit the grasslands in summer . Other animals include red and Arctic foxes , wolverines , moose , otters , and lynx in the southern areas . American minks , which were released near the <unk> River in 1935 – 1936 , are now common throughout the peninsula and are commercially hunted . Beavers , which became endangered by 1880 , were re @-@ introduced in 1934 – 1957 . All in all , thirty @-@ two species of mammals and up to two hundred bird species inhabit the peninsula . 
 Beluga whales are the only cetacean being common around the peninsula . Other dolphins , including Atlantic white @-@ sided dolphins , white @-@ beaked dolphins , and harbor porpoises , as well as large whales , such as bowhead , humpback , blue , and finback , also visit the area . 
 The coasts of the Kandalaksha Gulf and the Barents Sea are important breeding grounds for bearded seals and ringed seals . Gray seals are rare and endemic to the Barents Sea . Greenland seals , or harp seals , also can be seen from time to time . 
 Twenty @-@ nine species of fresh water fish are recognized on the territory of peninsula , including trout , stickleback , northern pike , and European perch . The rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon , which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water . As a result of this , a recreational fishery has been developed , with a number of remote lodges and camps available to host sport @-@ fishermen . The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve , established in 1932 to protect the population of common eider , is organized in thirteen clusters located in the Kandalaksha Gulf of the Kola Peninsula and along the coasts of the Barents Sea . 
 = = = Hydrology = = = 
 The Kola Peninsula has many small but fast @-@ moving rivers with rapids . The most important of them are the <unk> , the <unk> , the Umba , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> . Most rivers originate from lakes and swamps and collect their waters from melting snow . The rivers become icebound during the winter , although the areas with strong rapids freeze later or not at all . 
 Major lakes include Imandra , <unk> , and Lovozero . There are no lakes with an area smaller than 0 @.@ 01 square kilometers ( 0 @.@ 0039 sq mi ) . Recreational fishery is developed in the region . 
 = = = Ecology = = = 
 The Kola Peninsula as a whole suffered major ecological damage , mostly as a result of pollution from the military ( particularly naval ) production , industrial mining of apatite , and military nuclear waste . About 137 active and 140 decommissioned or idle naval nuclear reactors , produced by the Soviet military , remain on the peninsula . For thirty years , nuclear waste had been dumped into the sea by the Northern Fleet and Murmansk Shipping Company . There is also evidence of contamination from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster , with contaminants being found in the flesh of reindeer and other animals , and from the 1972 and 1984 controlled nuclear explosions 21 kilometers ( 13 mi ) northwest of Kirovsk . Additionally , several nuclear weapons test ranges and radioactive waste storage facilities exist on the peninsula . 
 The main industrial pollution source is Norilsk Nickel in <unk> — the large smelters responsible for over 80 % of the sulfur dioxide emissions and for nearly all nickel and copper emissions . Other polluters of note include the thermal power stations in Apatity and Murmansk .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 The <unk> Peninsula in the north of the Kola Peninsula was already settled in the 7th – 5th millennium BCE . In the 3rd – 2nd millennium BCE , the peninsula was settled by the peoples who arrived there from the south ( the territory of modern Karelia ) . By the end of the 1st millennium CE , the peninsula was settled only by the Sami people , who did not have their own state , lived in clans ruled by elders , and were engaged mostly in reindeer herding and fishing . In the 12th century , Russian Pomors from the shores of the Onega Bay and in the lower reaches of the Northern Dvina River discovered the peninsula and its game and fish riches . The Pomors organized regular hunting and fishing visits and started barter trade with the Sami . They also called the White Sea coast of the peninsula Tersky Coast ( <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> ) or <unk> Land ( <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ ) . 
 By the end of the 12th century , the Pomors explored all northern coast of the peninsula and reached Finnmark ( an area in the north of Norway ) , necessitating the Norwegians to support a naval guard in that area . The name given by the Pomors to the northern coast was " Murman " — a distorted form of " Norman " . 
 = = = Novgorodians = = = 
 Pomors were soon followed by tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic , and the Kola Peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands . A 1265 treaty of Yaroslav Yaroslavich with Novgorod mentions Tre Volost ( <unk> <unk> ) , which is later also mentioned in other documents dated as late as 1471 . In addition to Tre , Novgorodian documents of the 13th – 15th centuries also mention Kolo Volost , which bordered Tre approximately along the line between Kildin Island and <unk> Headland of the <unk> Peninsula . Kolo Volost lay to the west of that line , while Tre was situated to the east of it . 
 By the 13th century , a need to formalize the border between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian countries became evident . The Novgorodians , along with the Karelians who came from the south , reached the coast of what now is <unk> District and the portion of the coast of <unk> near the <unk> River , which now is a part of Norway . The Sami population was forced to pay tribute . The Norwegians , however , were also attempting to take control of these lands , resulting in armed conflicts . In 1251 , a conflict between the Karelians , Novgorodians and the servants of the king of Norway lead to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in Norway . Also in 1251 , the first treaty with Norway was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of tribute collections , making the Sami people pay tribute to both Novgorod and Norway . By the terms of the treaty , Novgorodians could collect tribute from the Sami as far as Lyngen fjord in the west , while Norwegians could collect tribute on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except in the eastern part of Tersky Coast . No state borders were established by the 1251 treaty . 
 The treaty lead to a short period of peace , but the armed conflicts resumed soon thereafter . Chronicles document attacks by the Novgorodians and the Karelians on Finnmark and northern Norway as early as 1271 , and continuing well into the 14th century . The official border between the Novgorod lands and the lands of Sweden and Norway was established by the Treaty of <unk> on August 12 , 1323 . The treaty primarily focused on the Karelian Isthmus border and the border north of Lake Ladoga . 
 Another treaty dealing the matters of the northern borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326 , which ended the decades of the Norwegian @-@ Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark . Per the terms of this treaty , Norway relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula . However , the treaty did not address the situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod , and the practice continued until 1602 . While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail , it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation , which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years , until 1920 . 
 In the 15th century , Novgorodians started to establish permanent settlements on the peninsula . Umba and <unk> , the first documented permanent settlements of the Novgorodians , date back to 1466 . Over time , all coastal areas to the west of the <unk> River had been settled , creating a territory where the population was mostly Novgorodian . Administratively , this territory was divided into <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which were governed by a <unk> from the area of the Northern Dvina . The Novgorod Republic lost control of both of these volosts to the Grand Duchy of Moscow after the Battle of <unk> in 1471 , and the republic itself ceased to exist in 1478 when Ivan III took the city of Novgorod . All Novgorod territories , including those on the Kola Peninsula , became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow . 
 = = = Russian settlement = = = 
 Russian migration to the peninsula continued into the 16th century , when new settlements such as Kandalaksha and <unk> @-@ Guba were established . Kola was first mentioned in 1565 . In the end of the 15th century , the Pomors and the Sami people were forced into serfdom , mostly by the monasteries . Monastery <unk> greatly expanded during the 17th century , but were abolished in 1764 , when all of the Kola Peninsula peasants became state peasants . 
 In the second half of the 16th century , King Frederick II of Denmark – Norway demanded that the Tsardom of Russia cede the peninsula . Russia declined , and in order to organize adequate defenses established the position of a <unk> . The <unk> sat in Kola , which became the administrative center of the region . Prior to that , the administrative duties were performed by the tax collectors from Kandalaksha . Newly established Kolsky Uyezd covered most of the territory of the peninsula ( with the exception of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which were a part of <unk> Uyezd ) , as well as the northern part of Karelia all the way to <unk> . 
 Despite the economic activity , permanent settlement of the peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s and even then it remained sporadic until 1917 . The population of Kola in 1880 , for example , was only around 500 inhabitants living in 80 households , compared to 1 @,@ 900 inhabitants in 300 households living there in 1582 . Transportation facilities were virtually non @-@ existent and the communication with the rest of Russia irregular . 1887 saw an influx of <unk> Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them , resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands , a conflict between the Komi and the Sami , and in marginalization of the local Sami population . By the end of the 19th century , the Sami population had mostly been forced north , with ethnic Russians settling in the south of the peninsula . 
 In 1894 , the peninsula was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance , who became convinced of the region 's economic potential . Consequently , in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola , improving the communication with the mainland . A possibility of building a railway was also considered , but no action was taken at the time . Also in 1896 , Alexandrovsk ( now Polyarny ) was founded , and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899 ; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion . 
 During World War I , the still poorly developed peninsula suddenly found itself in a strategic position , as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice @-@ free harbors of the Murman Coast remained the only means of sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front . In March 1915 , the construction of the railroad was rushed , and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916 , even though it was only partially completed and poorly built . In 1916 , Romanov @-@ na @-@ <unk> ( modern Murmansk ) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad ; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula . 
 = = = Soviet and modern periods = = = 
 Soviet power was established on the territory of the peninsula on November 9 [ O.S. October 26 ] , 1917 , but the territory was occupied by the Triple Entente forces in March 1918 – March 1920 . Alexandrovsky Uyezd was transformed into Murmansk Governorate by the Soviet government in June 1921 . On August 1 , 1927 , the All @-@ Russian Central Executive Committee ( <unk> ) issued two Resolutions : " On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast " and " On the Borders and Composition of the <unk> of Leningrad Oblast " , according to which Murmansk Governorate was transformed into Murmansk Okrug ( which was divided into six districts ) and included into Leningrad Oblast . This arrangement existed until May 28 , 1938 , when the <unk> was separated from Leningrad Oblast , merged with <unk> District of the Karelian ASSR , and transformed into modern Murmansk Oblast . 
 All in all , the Soviet period saw a significant increase in population ( 799 @,@ 000 in 1970 vs. 15 @,@ 000 in 1913 ) , although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the railroads and the sea coast . Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the urbanized areas were used for deer herding . In 1920 – 1940 , the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula . 
 The Sami peoples were subject to forced collectivization , with more than half of their reindeer herds collectivized in 1928 – 1930 . In addition , the traditional Sami herding practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach , which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding . Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices , this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge . Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero , which became the cultural center of the Sami people in Russia . Those Sami resisting the collectivization were subject to forced labor or death . Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin 's death in 1953 . In the 1990s , 40 % of the Sami lived in urbanized areas , although some herd reindeer across much of the region . 
 The Sami were not the only people subject to repressions . Thousands of people were sent to Kola in the 1930s – 1950s , and in 2007 over two thousand people — descendants of those forcibly sent here — still live on the peninsula . A significant portion of the people deported to Kola were peasants from southern Russia subjected to <unk> . Prisoner labor was often used when building new factories and for manning those which were operational : in 1940 , for example , the whole <unk> Metallurgy Mining Complex was turned over to the NKVD system .

 Historically , due to its northern location , the peninsula 's population had been sparse : in 1913 , for example , only about 13 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 people lived there ; mostly along the shores . However , the discovery of the vast natural resource deposits and industrialization efforts led to an explosive population growth during the Soviet times .

 During the 15th – 16th centuries , the main occupations of the Tersky Coast population were Atlantic salmon fishing , seal hunting , and the extraction of salt from the sea water . The salt extraction in Kandalaksha and Kola was mostly carried out by the monasteries in Pechenga and <unk> , and for a long time remained the only " industry " on the peninsula . 
 By the mid @-@ 16th century , Atlantic cod fishing developed on the Murman Coast in the north . The 1560s saw a rapid growth of international trade , with the Russian merchants from different regions of the country arriving to the peninsula to trade with the merchants from Western Europe . In 1585 , however , the trade was moved to Archangel , although the settlement of Kola was still permitted to trade locally produced goods . 
 During the 17th century , the salt extraction activities gradually went into decline as the locally produced salt was uncompetitive with cheap salt produced in the Kama River regions . Extensive poaching also lead to the significantly reduced outputs from pearl hunting . However , commercial deer herding became more popular , although its share in the economy remained negligible until the 19th century . By the end of the 17th century , the practice of seasonal fishing and hunting settlements in the north of the peninsula became very common . 
 Peter the Great , recognizing the political and economical importance of the peninsula , promoted its industries and commerce ; however , the region fell into neglect after St. Petersburg was founded in 1703 and most of the shipping trade shifted there . In 1732 , large deposits of silver in native form were discovered on <unk> Island in the Kandalaksha Gulf and copper , silver , and gold deposits were found in the lower reaches of the <unk> River . However , despite the efforts ongoing for the next two centuries , there was no commercial success . At the end of the 18th century , the local population learned the practice of peat production from the Norwegians and started using peat for heating . Timber cutting industry developed in the region at the end of the 19th century ; mostly in <unk> and Umba . 
 The Soviet era saw drastic industrialization and militarization of the peninsula . In 1925 – 1926 , significant deposits of apatite were discovered in the Khibiny Mountains , and the first apatite batch was shipped only a few years later , in 1929 . In 1930 , sulfide deposits were discovered in the <unk> area ; in 1932 – 1933 iron ore deposits were found near the upper streams of the Iona River ; and in 1935 , significant deposits of titanium ores were discovered in the area of modern <unk> . 
 The collectivization efforts in the 1930s lead to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes ( collective farms ) , which , in turn , were further consolidated into a few large @-@ scale state farms in the late 1950s – early 1970s . By the mid @-@ 1970s , the state farms were further consolidated into just two , based in Lovozero and <unk> . The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations , as well as by the need to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants . 
 Fishing , being the traditional industry of the region , was always considered important , even though the volumes of production remained insignificant until the beginning of the 20th century . In the 1920s – 1930s , the Murmansk Trawl Fleet was created and the fishing infrastructure started to develop intensively . By 1940 , fishing accounted for 40 % of the oblast 's and for 80 % of Murmansk 's economy . 
 During the Cold War , the peninsula served as the naval basing area for a large portion of the Soviet naval and air strategic forces , providing protection from and posing a threat to northern Norway . 
 = = = Modern economy = = = 
 After the economic slump of the 1990s , the economy of the oblast started to rebound during the first decade of the 2000s , although at a rate below the country 's average . Today the Kola Peninsula is the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia . The major port of the peninsula is Murmansk , which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast and does not freeze in winter . Although the strategic importance of the Kola Peninsula has diminished since the Cold War , the peninsula nevertheless still has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons , reactors , and facilities in Russia , with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other region of the world . 
 Mining is the basis of the oblast 's economy , and mining enterprises remain the principal employers in such <unk> as Apatity , Kirovsk , <unk> , Nikel , and <unk> . The Kola Mining and Metallurgical Company , a division of Norilsk Nickel , conducts <unk> , <unk> , and platinum @-@ group @-@ metals @-@ mining operations on the peninsula . Other large mining companies include OAO <unk> , which is the largest producer of phosphates in Europe ; OAO <unk> , one of the leading producers of iron ore concentrates in Russia ; and OAO <unk> <unk> , an ore @-@ mining and processing enterprise . 
 The fishing industry , although still operating significantly below the Soviet level of production , remains profitable , supplying 20 % of Russia 's fish in 2006 and with the volumes steadily growing in 2007 – 2010 . Murmansk is a key base for three fishing fleets , including Russia 's largest , the Murmansk Trawl Fleet . Fish breeding , especially of salmon and trout , is a growing industry . 
 The energy sector is represented by the Kola Nuclear Power Plant near <unk> Zori , which produces about half of all energy , and a network of seventeen hydroelectric and two thermal power stations , generating the other half . The energy surplus , accounting for about 20 % of the total generated energy , is transferred to the unified energy system of Russia , as well as exported to Norway and Finland via the <unk> system . 
 With the economy of the oblast being mostly export @-@ oriented , transportation plays an important role and accounts for 11 % of the Gross Regional Product . On the Kola Peninsula , the transportation network includes ship transport , air transport , automotive transport , electrified public transport , and access to the railways mostly passing through the rest of Murmansk Oblast . The city of Murmansk is an important port on the Northern Sea Route . The largest airports are the Murmansk Airport , which handles international flights to Scandinavian countries , and the joint military @-@ civilian Kirovsk @-@ Apatity Airport located 15 kilometers ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) southeast of Apatity .

 Kuching / <unk> / ( Jawi : <unk> , Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , officially the City of Kuching , is the capital and the most populous city in the state of Sarawak in Malaysia . It is also the capital of Kuching Division . The city is situated on the Sarawak River at the southwest tip of the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo and covers an area of 431 square kilometres ( 166 sq mi ) with a population about 165 @,@ 642 in the Kuching North administrative region and 159 @,@ 490 in the Kuching South administrative region — a total of 325 @,@ 132 people . 
 Kuching was the third capital of Sarawak in 1827 during the administration of the Bruneian Empire . In 1841 , Kuching become the capital of Sarawak after Sarawak was ceded to James Brooke for helping the Bruneian empire in crushing a rebellion . The town continued to receive attention and development during the rule of Charles Brooke such as the construction of sanitation system , hospital , prison , fort , and a bazaar . In 1941 , the Brooke administration had a Centenary Celebration in Kuching . During World War II , Kuching was occupied by Japanese forces from 1942 to 1945 . The Japanese government set up a Batu Lintang camp near Kuching to hold prisoners of war and civilian internees . After the war , the town survived intact . However , the last Rajah of Sarawak , Sir Charles Vyner Brooke decided to cede Sarawak as part of British Crown Colony in 1946 . Kuching remained as capital during the Crown Colony period . After the formation of Malaysia in 1963 , Kuching retained its status as state capital and was granted city status in 1988 . Since then , the Kuching city is divided into two administrative regions managed by two separate local authorities . The administrative centre of Sarawak state government is located at Wisma Bapa Malaysia , Kuching . 
 Kuching is a major food destination for tourists and the main gateway for travellers visiting Sarawak and Borneo . Kuching Wetlands National Park is located about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) from the city and there are many other tourist attractions in and around Kuching such as Bako National Park , Semenggoh Wildlife Centre , Rainforest World Music Festival ( RWMF ) , state assembly building , The Astana , Fort Margherita , Kuching Cat Museum , and Sarawak State Museum . The city has become one of the major industrial and commercial centres in East Malaysia . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name of " Kuching " was already in use for the city by the time Brooke arrived in 1839 . There are many theories as to the derivation of the word " Kuching " . It was perhaps derived from the Malay word for cat , " kucing " or from Cochin , an Indian trading port on the Malabar Coast and a generic term in China and British India for trading harbour . Some Hindu artefacts can be seen today at the Sarawak State Museum . However , another source reported that the Kuching city was previously known as " Sarawak " before the Brooke arrived . The settlement was renamed to " Sarawak proper " during the kingdom expansion . It was only in 1872 that Charles Brooke renamed the settlement to " Kuching " . 
 There was one unlikely theory based on a story on miscommunication . According to the story , James Brooke arrived in Kuching on his yacht " Royalist " . He then asked his local guide about the name of the town . The local guide thinking that James Brooke was pointing towards a cat , and said the word " Kuching " . However , ethnic Malays in Sarawak usually refer the name of a cat as " <unk> " instead of the Malay word " kucing " . 
 Some source also stated that it was derived from a fruit called " mata kucing " ( Euphoria <unk> ) , a fruit that grows widely in Malaysia and Indonesia . There was also a hill in the city that was named after the fruit , which is called Bukit Mata Kuching . While as been written by a British woman to her son in the 19th century , it was stated that the name was derived from a stream of a same name , called " Sungai Kuching " or Cat River in English . The river was situated at the foot of Bukit Mata Kuching and in front of the Tua Pek Kong Temple . In the 1950s , the river became very shallow because of silt deposits in the river . The river was later filled to make way for roads . 
 There is another theory that Kuching actually means " Ku " ( <unk> ） - Old and " Ching " （ <unk> ） - Well or " old well " ( <unk> ) in Chinese . During the Brooke administration , there was no water supply and water @-@ borne diseases were common . In 1888 , an epidemic broke out which later was known as " Great Cholera Epidemic " . A well situated in the present day China Street in Main Bazaar helped to combat the disease by providing clean water supply . Due to increased demand for a water supply , the role of the well was later replaced by water treatment plant on the Bau Road . 
 = = History = = 
 Sarawak was part of the Bruneian Empire since the reign of first Brunei sultanate , Sultan Muhammad Shah . Kuching was the third capital of Sarawak , founded in 1827 by the representative of the Sultan of Brunei , Pengiran <unk> Mahkota . Prior to the founding of Kuching , the two past capitals of Sarawak were Santubong , founded by Sultan Pengiran Tengah in 1599 , and <unk> Tanah , founded by Datu Patinggi Ali in the early 1820s . 
 Pengiran Raja Muda <unk> later ceded the territory to a British adventurer , James Brooke as a reward for helping him to counter a rebellion . The rebellion was crushed in November 1840 , and on 24 September 1841 , Brooke was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak with the title of Rajah . It was not announced until 18 August 1842 , following Sultan Omar Ali <unk> II 's ratifying the governorship , and requiring Brooke to pay an annual sum of $ 2 @,@ 500 to the Sultan . Since that time , Kuching became the seat of the Brooke government . 
 The administration was later continued by his nephew , Charles Brooke . As an administrative capital , it became the centre of attention and development . Improvements included a sanitation system . By 1874 , the city had completed several developments , including construction of a hospital , prison , Fort Margherita , and many other buildings . 
 Charles Brooke 's wife write his autobiography , ( My Life in Sarawak ) , including his descriptions of Kuching : 
 The little town looked so neat and fresh and prosperous under the careful jurisdiction of the Rajah and his officers , that it reminded me of a box of painted toys kept scrupulously clean by a child . The Bazaar runs for some distance along the banks of river , and this quarter of the town is inhabited almost entirely by Chinese traders , with the exception of one or two Hindoo shops .... <unk> of exotic kinds are laid out on tables near the pavement , from which the purchasers make their choice . At the Hindoo shops you can buy silks from India , sarongs from Java , tea from China and tiles and porcelain from all parts of the world , laid out in picturesque confusion , and overflowing into the street . 
 The Astana ( Palace ) , which is now the official residence of the Governor of Sarawak , was constructed next to Brooke 's first residence . He had it built in 1869 as a wedding gift to his wife . Kuching continued to prosper under Charles Vyner Brooke , who succeeded his father as the Third Rajah of Sarawak . In 1941 , Kuching was the site of the Brooke Government Centenary Celebration . A few months later , the Brooke administration came to a close when the Japanese occupied Sarawak . 
 During the Second World War , six platoons of infantry from 2 / 15 Punjab Regiment were stationed at Kuching in April 1941 . The Regiment defended Kuching and Bukit <unk> airfield from being the destroyed by the Japanese . Defence was mainly concentrated on Kuching and Miri . However , on 24 December 1941 , Kuching was conquered by the Japanese forces .

 = NSB El 9 = 
 NSB El 9 is a retired class of three electric locomotives built by Thune for the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) , with electrical equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri ( NEBB ) and Per Kure . The locomotives were delivered in 1947 after a three @-@ year delay caused by wartime sabotage in response to the German occupation of Norway . They were used nearly exclusively on the Flåm Line and Hardanger Line , two steep branch lines . The units were used on the Flåm Line until 1983 , when they were replaced by El 11 . They were then used as shunters until being retired in 1988 . Two of the locomotives have been preserved . 
 The class was custom @-@ made for steep hills and slow speeds ; it featured a low 48 tonnes ( 47 long tons ; 53 short tons ) weight which , with a Bo 'Bo ' wheel arrangement , allows for a 12 @-@ tonne ( 12 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 13 @-@ short @-@ ton ) axle load . This made the locomotives only 10 @.@ 2 meters ( 33 ft ) long . They had a power output of 712 kilowatts ( 955 hp ) , a tractive effort of 108 kilonewtons ( 24 @,@ 000 lbf ) and a maximum speed of 60 kilometres per hour ( 37 mph ) . They were given road numbers 2062 though 2064 . 
 = = History = = 
 With the construction of the Bergen Line , which was completed in 1909 , it was decided that there would be built branch lines to two fjords , the Hardanger Line to Hardangerfjord and the Flåm Line to Sognefjord . Both branches were steep and curvy , which set high demands on the locomotives . The Hardanger Line was 27 @.@ 45 kilometers ( 17 @.@ 06 mi ) long , had a maximum gradient of 4 @.@ 5 percent , a minimum curve radius of 180 meters ( 590 ft ) , and a maximum speed of 40 km / h ( 25 mph ) . The Flåm Line is 20 @.@ 20 kilometers ( 12 @.@ 55 mi ) long , had a maximum gradient of 5 @.@ 5 @.@ percent , a minimum curve radius of 130 meters ( 430 ft ) and a maximum speed of 40 km / h ( 25 mph ) uphill and 30 km / h ( 19 mph ) downhill . Both lines had a maximum permitted axle load of 12 tonnes ( 12 long tons ; 13 short tons ) , standard gauge and a 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC electrification system . The Hardanger Line opened in 1935 and the Flåm Line in 1940 , although the latter did not receive electric traction until 1944 . 
 Originally , the Hardanger Line used Class 64 electric multiple units . On 28 March 1940 , NSB sent an invitation to tender for two multiple units which would be similar to Class 64 . The company asked both for aluminum and steel bids . However , NSB abandoned the plans and instead signed an agreement on 4 October 1940 for delivery of three electric locomotives . The units were intended to be delivered in 1942 . The mechanical components and assembly was done by Thune , and electrical parts were delivered by NEBB , except the transformer and electric controllers , which were built by Per Kure . 
 By 1944 , by which time Norway was occupied by Germany as part of the Second World War , overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line . The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed , except for the transformers , which were at Per Kure . This was during the height of resistance sabotage , and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald . Because of the Allied bombing of Germany , Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines . Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944 , the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged . Reconstruction of them took considerable time , in part because of the general lack of materials , and in part because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944 . In 1945 , all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished . 
 The locomotives received transformers in 1947 , which were installed in Oslo , and 2064 was delivered on 24 May . The cost of the three locomotives was 1 @,@ 297 @,@ 905 million Norwegian krone . At first , only one unit was transferred to Flåm . The other two remained in Eastern Norway ; one was stationed as a shunter at Oslo West Station , the other in Skien . The units operating in Oslo and Skien had problems with the rheostatic brake operating differently depending on the direction the train was running , something which was not observed in Flåm . The issue was fixed by marginally changing the excitation voltage . The unit stationed in Flåm was periodically sent for service in Oslo , and when this happened , a new unit would be stationed in Flåm . From 21 January 1949 , 2064 was returned to Flåm without the other unit being sent back . From 17 February 1955 , all three were stationed in Flåm . During the late 1950s , one of the units was stationed as Voss Station for shunting duty . Starting in the late 1950s , the class was also used on the Hardanger Line . 
 In the 1970s , NSB started to consider replacement of the class . In 1971 and 1973 , El 11 and El 13 were test @-@ run on the line , and it was concluded that El 11 would be suitable with minor adjustments . However , the 1960s replacement of steam locomotives had caused a shortage of electric locomotives . Not until 1980 did NSB start the upgrade process of two El 11s . From 1980s , only a single El 9 was stationed on the Flåm Line during winter , and the other two were used for local trains on the Bergen Line in Hallingdal . If the unit stationed in Flåm was out of order , it was replaced by a Class 64 unit . Lack of spare parts and limited reliability accelerated the need to replace the units in scheduled trains . The first unit was taken into use on the Flåm Line in 1983 and the second in 1984 . Two El 9s were transferred to Ål Station and Voss Station where they hauled work trains . Unit 2062 was taken out of service in 1983 . The other two remained in regular service until 1988 . Unit 2063 has been painted green and is on display at Flåm Station , while 2064 has retained the red color scheme and is stored at Tinnoset Station , belonging to the Norwegian Railway Museum .

The main transformer is capable of feeding each motor with 765 kilovolt @-@ ampere ( kVA ) , 115 kVA to heating and 40 kVA for axillary equipment . The power output is regulated with through 28 steps in the voltage regulator which is integrated with the main transformer . The locomotives have a maximum speed of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) and a tractive effort of 108 kilonewtons ( 24 @,@ 000 lbf ) . Because of the limited roof space , only one pantograph was installed . 
 The limit on axle load makes the locomotives small and compact . They weigh 48 tonnes ( 47 long tons ; 53 short tons ) , and the total train weight is limited to 85 tonnes ( 84 long tons ; 94 short tons ) . This also gives the trains a short length of 10 @.@ 2 meters ( 33 ft ) . The trains had a Bo 'Bo ' wheel arrangement . In addition to air brakes for the whole train , the locomotives are equipped with rheostatic brakes which is sufficiently powerful to allow for the 5 @.@ 5 percent gradient . When braking , three of the motors are connected to the air @-@ cooled resistance on the roof , while the last motor is connected to deliver magnetization current to the other three motors . The braking is regulated with 22 steps . As a backup , the units are equipped with a carborundum track brake on each side of the bogies . 
 = The Boat Race 1961 = 
 The 107th Boat Race took place on 1 April 1961 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . The race which was delayed , the lead changed hands several times and an Oxford rower slumped and nearly fell out of the boat . It was won by Cambridge by four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths in a time of 19 minutes 22 seconds . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1960 race by one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths , while Cambridge led overall with 58 victories to Oxford 's 47 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . Cambridge had not lost three consecutive races since the 1913 race . 
 Cambridge 's coaches included J. R. F. Best , James Crowden ( who rowed for the Light Blues in the 1951 and 1952 races ) , Derek Mays @-@ Smith ( who rowed in the 1955 and 1956 races ) , J. R. Owen ( 1959 and 1960 races ) and J. J. Vernon ( who rowed in the 1955 race ) . Oxford 's coaching team comprised Jumbo Edwards ( who rowed for Oxford in 1926 and 1930 ) , J. L. Fage ( an Oxford Blue in 1958 and 1959 ) and L. A. F. Stokes ( who rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1951 and 1952 races ) . Oxford opted to row with 13 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) long oars , 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) longer than Cambridge 's . Cambridge arrived at Putney with a reputation for speed over short distances and " potentially dangerous challengers " . Meanwhile Oxford were anticipated to be " exceptionally strong " yet on occasion their rowing appeared to be " laborious " , with some commentators blaming the longer oars . 
 The race was umpired by George Douglas " Jock " Clapperton who had coxed Oxford in the 1923 and 1924 races as well as umpiring in the 1959 boat race . He was accompanied in the umpire 's boat by Antony Armstrong @-@ Jones , husband of Princess Margaret , who had coxed Cambridge to victory in the 1950 race . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 12 lb ( 81 @.@ 4 kg ) , 1 pound ( 0 @.@ 5 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge 's crew contained two former Blues , cox Roger Weston and rower John Beveridge who was making his third appearance in the event . Oxford saw five members of the previous year 's race return . There were three non @-@ British participants registered in the race : Oxford 's number three , John Sewell and Cambridge 's Mike Christian and Mark Hoffman were all from the United States . The latter pair had both captained the boat club at Harvard University .

 Oxford , the pre @-@ race favourites , won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge . The race commenced at <unk> , delayed by more than 20 minutes as a result of a drifting stake boat , with Cambridge taking an early but brief lead . After the first minute , Oxford led by a few feet and increased their advantage to half a length by Craven Steps . At Craven Cottage , Cambridge spurted and retook the lead , but Oxford counterattacked and edged ahead . With the advantage of the bend in the river , Cambridge drew level by the Mile Post . The Dark Blues once again took the lead , and by Hammersmith Bridge were four seconds ahead and held a clear water advantage . Rowing into a headwind , Oxford began to lose their shape and by Chiswick Eyot , Cambridge had reduced the deficit enough to overlap the Dark Blue boat , although Oxford still led by a length at Chiswick Steps . 
 Twelve minutes into the race , the Oxford number six , Graham Cooper , " turned pale and slumped " , disrupting the Oxford rhythm . Although he appeared to recover , " the cohesion had gone " . Cambridge overtook the Dark Blue boat and were three lengths ahead by Barnes Bridge , and passed the finishing post with a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half length advantage in a time of 19 minutes 22 seconds , the slowest since the 1954 race . It was Cambridge 's first victory in three years and their largest winning margin since the 1955 race . 
 The rowing correspondent for The Times suggested that " for Oxford it was a sad day , and for Cooper a tragedy " , while for Cambridge it was " a splendid victory " . Cambridge 's stroke Hoffman said " it was a tough race ... but when I saw that one of the Oxford crew was in distress , I knew we could not help winning . " It was the third time since the war that Oxford had lost the event as a result of a crew member collapsing mid @-@ race . Oxford 's bow Richard Bate confessed that he " didn 't even know anything had been wrong until after the race . I only knew we were not at our best . " 
 = Age of Empires ( video game ) = 
 Age of Empires ( <unk> ) is a history @-@ based real @-@ time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft . The game uses the Genie , a 2D sprite @-@ based game engine . The game allows the user to act as the leader of an ancient civilization by advancing it through four ages ( the Stone , Tool , Bronze , and Iron Ages ) , gaining access to new and improved units with each advance . It was later ported to Pocket PCs with Windows , resulting in a version very similar to the PC game . 
 Originally touted as Civilization meets Warcraft , some reviewers felt that the game failed to live up to these expectations when it was released . Despite this , it received generally good reviews , and an expansion pack , titled The Rise of Rome , was released in 1998 . Both the original Age of Empires and the expansion pack were later released as " The Gold Edition " . A sequel , Age of Empires II , was released in 1999 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Age of Empires requires the player to develop a civilization from a handful of hunter @-@ gatherers to an expansive Iron Age Empire . To assure victory , the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units , buildings and more advanced technology . Resources must also be preserved , as no new resources become available as the game progresses , for example , trees that are cut down will not grow back . 
 Twelve civilizations are available . Each with individual sets of attributes , including a varying number of available technologies and units . Each civilization has technologies unique to them , so that no civilization possesses all the technologies possible within the game . 
 A major component of the game is the advancement through four ages . These are the Stone Age ( Mesolithic / Nomad / Paleolithic ) , the Tool Age ( Neolithic / Chalcolithic ) , the Bronze Age and the Iron Age . Advancement between ages is researched at the Town Center , and each advancement brings the player new technologies , weapons , and units . 
 = = = Modes = = = 
 The game features four single @-@ player campaigns in which the player is required to complete specific objectives . Campaigns are a collection of scenarios which are completed in a linear fashion . The campaigns follow the history of the Egyptian , Greek , Babylonian and Yamato civilizations ; there 's also a complete campaign specially made for the demo version that takes place in the Hittite Empire . Aside from the campaigns , there is a game mode called " random map " , in which a different map is generated for each new game . Variations of random map , such as the resource @-@ heavy " death match " , are also available . 
 Age of Empires also facilitated online and network play with up to 8 people simultaneously . Because the network play is less sophisticated than that of modern games , lag and disconnections often occur . Until June 19 , 2006 , multiplayer gameplay was supported by Microsoft Gaming Zone . At that point , the Zone abandoned support of most CD @-@ ROM games , including Age of Empires and Age of Empires II : The Age of Kings . 
 The creation of user @-@ made scenarios or series of scenarios ( campaigns ) for the game was made possible using the Scenario Builder . This tool is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games , but it has fewer capabilities as a result . Ensemble Studios used the Scenario Builder to make the single @-@ player campaigns which shipped with the retail game . Various unofficial sites exist where custom scenarios can be submitted and downloaded . In late 2005 , it was discovered that by modifying various data files , units present in the beta versions of the game could be made available in the editor . Some obscure units include a spaceship and a hero that changes ownership when units move near it . Through data editing , the rules of unit placement can also be modified . This allows units to be placed on any terrain and on top of other units , which creates new possibilities for design . Other significant discoveries include new terrain templates , a mode to triple each unit 's <unk> and a tool to edit map sizes . 
 = = = Civilizations = = = 
 Players choose to play as one of 12 civilizations . The civilizations are sorted into four distinct architectural styles , based on East Asian , Mesopotamian , Egyptian and Greek architecture , which determine their in @-@ game appearance . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 Technology is researched at specific buildings , to which they are generally related ; for example , religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the storage pit . Technological advances come in many categories , such as military upgrades ( better arms and armor for units ) , economic upgrades ( increasing the efficiency of resource gathering ) , religious upgrades ( faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests ) and infrastructure upgrades ( stronger fortifications and more resilient buildings ) . As basic technology research is completed , more advanced technologies may become available . Some technologies are not available to certain civilizations . 
 Technology plays a very important role in the strategy of the game . As a civilization progresses through the ages , technology becomes more and more expensive , which makes collecting the necessary resources to research them difficult . As a consequence , balancing the workforce of villagers across the various resources can make the difference between victory and defeat . 
 = = = = Units = = = = 
 Players control a variety of Civilian and Military units . Most units can be upgraded through research ( e.g. faster gathering for villagers , stronger armor for military units , and longer range for archers ) . 
 Land @-@ based units are the most prevalent in gameplay . Villagers are the most basic units in Age of Empires . Their primary function is to collect resources , cutting down trees for wood , mining for stone and gold , and hunting , foraging , farming , or fishing to acquire food . Villagers can also construct buildings and repair both buildings and naval vessels , and are capable of engaging in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat when necessary . Priests are non @-@ combat units which can heal allied units or " convert " enemy units ( in which case the target unit changes allegiance ) . Infantry units , such as clubmen , swordsmen , and hoplites use melee combat to attack at short range . Mounted units include chariots , cavalry , and war elephants . Archers , mounted or on foot , attack at range . Siege units are of two types : catapults and ballista . Catapults hurl stones which generate blast damage , affecting all units in a small area , and are especially effective against buildings and groups of units . The ballista is less damaging against buildings and units , but it fires faster and is cheaper than the catapult . 
 Nautical units often play a secondary role , but can be essential to victory . Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish . Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player 's dock , with the amount of gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks . Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another . As well as attacking enemy ships , warships can be very effective in attacking land @-@ based units close to the shoreline ( because melee units cannot fight back ) . Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders ( very effective against buildings near the shoreline ) . 
 Unit types are identical , regardless of civilization ( though certain civilizations may have improved variations of these units ) . So , for example , a Korean <unk> broad swordsman is identical to a Persian or Phoenician one , as are bowmen , axemen , short swordsmen , cavalry , and so forth . Some armors and clothes are historically inaccurate , with the long swordsman bearing more resemblance to a Roman praetorian . Some units were also available in the game to civilizations that never , historically , had them ; hoplites can be trained by every civilization except Persia , and some middle @-@ Asian civilizations can train Legions and Centurions , while Japanese Yamato can build triremes . 
 = = = = Buildings = = = = 
 The Town Center is one of the most important buildings in the game . Here villagers are created , and age advancement is researched . Most scenarios have each player begin with a single Town Center ; the ability to build multiple Town Centers is unlocked by the construction of the Government Center during the Bronze Age . The Town Center provides population support for four units . In order to build more units , houses must be constructed . Each house supports four units , and although any number of houses can be built ( a concept which was not maintained in later games like Age of Mythology ) , they can only support a maximum of fifty units . 
 Military units are produced at specific buildings relevant to their area . All sea units are created at the docks . Walls and towers are defensive fortifications ( Age of Empires was one of the first real @-@ time strategy games to include walls strong enough to form a feasible means of defense ) . Farms are used to produce food . Granaries , storage pits , and the Town Center are used to store resources deposited by the villagers . 
 Wonders are enormous monuments representing the architectural achievements of the time , such as the Egyptian Pyramids . They require huge amounts of resources to build and are constructed very slowly . Wonders can neither produce units nor conduct research . In scenarios with Standard Victory conditions , a player can win by constructing a wonder and keeping it from being destroyed for 2 @,@ 000 years ( about 10 minutes in the real world ) . Building a wonder also greatly increases a player 's score , which is beneficial in " score " games . Players typically make it their top priority to destroy enemy wonders , especially under Standard Victory conditions . For this reason and because a wonder is relatively easy to destroy , a wonder must be well @-@ guarded at all times . 
 = = Development = = 
 Age of Empires ( under the working title Dawn of Man ) was the first game developed by Ensemble Studios . Its historical setting was chosen to be more plausible and accessible , particularly to casual gamers , than existing games . At the time , other real @-@ time strategy games had science fiction and fantasy settings , so the historical setting of Age of Empires enabled it to stand out . The designers received much of their inspiration from the game Civilization , with its proven historical setting ; this was noted among reviewers as something positive . Age of Empires was designed by Bruce Shelley , Tony Goodman ( in charge of the game 's artwork ) , and Dave Pottinger ( in charge of the game 's artificial intelligence ) . Stephen Rippy was the music director ( a role he kept through the series ) , with occasional help from his brother , David Rippy , as well as Kevin McMullan . He created the original music in Age of Empires using sounds from actual instruments from the periods in the game , as well as their digital samples . The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures , styles , and instruments used . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Although not as acclaimed as the later games in the series , the first Age of Empires was generally well received by critics , and scored highly on review aggregator websites including an 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 on Metacritic , an 87 % on Game Rankings , an 85 out of 100 on MobyGames . 
 Game Informer ranked it the 81st best game ever made in its 100th issue in 2001 . They called it a cross between Warcraft and SimCity and praised its multi @-@ player and its popularity among gamers . Game Revolution categorized the game as " a cross between Civilization II and Warcraft II : Tides of Darkness " , while GameSpot lamented that it was " a simple combat game rather than a glorious empire @-@ builder " , describing it as " Warcraft with a hint of Civilization . " While Computer Gaming World 's Elliott Chin compared the game extensively to WarCraft II , he said that it has " great depth , and when compared to its real @-@ time brethren , it has to be the most sophisticated of the bunch " . GameVortex wanted less of a combat @-@ oriented gameplay , but praised the modes of play , commenting that " the random map generation [ ... ] really keeps the game spiced up . " GameSpot decried the level of micromanagement necessary to control the game ( which was due to absence of production queues and low AI of the player 's units ) calling it " a poor idea " , which " seriously diminishes AOE 's enjoyability . " GameVortex echoed this criticism , while PC Gameworld pointed out the subsequently released patches improving some of the faulty AI programming . Elliott Chin criticized the game 's population limit , which he thought to be its " most serious grievance " . 
 While noting the similarities with Warcraft II , PC Gameworld praised the uniqueness of each playable civilization , and noted that the " graphics are extremely detailed and have a hand @-@ painted feel to them . It 's rare to see a game this beautiful with such detailed unit movements . " Game Revolution was impressed by the amount of different units of the game , and noted that the developers " obviously did [ their ] research here , and the result is a well rounded , historically accurate product ( at least for a game ) " . The soundscape of the game was also criticized , with GameVortex stating that " the oral clues just aren 't enough to let you differentiate just what 's going on . " With a view to the future of the game , Game @-@ Revolution emphasized the scenario editor , which " allows you total control in the design of scenarios and campaigns " , a " tool at your disposal to create a scenario exactly to your liking . " 
 The game won numerous awards , including <unk> 's 1997 Game of the Year and the 1998 AIAS Computer Strategy Game of the Year award . 
 = Hepatic encephalopathy = 
 Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) is the occurrence of confusion , altered level of consciousness , and coma as a result of liver failure . In the advanced stages it is called hepatic coma or coma <unk> . It may ultimately lead to death . 
 It is caused by accumulation in the bloodstream of toxic substances that are normally removed by the liver . The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy requires the presence of impaired liver function and the exclusion of an alternative explanation for the symptoms . Blood tests ( ammonia levels ) may assist in the diagnosis . Attacks are often caused by another problem , such as infection or constipation . 
 Hepatic encephalopathy is reversible with treatment . This relies on suppressing the production of the toxic substances in the intestine and is most commonly done with the laxative lactulose or with non @-@ absorbable antibiotics . In addition , the treatment of any underlying condition may improve the symptoms . In particular settings , such as acute liver failure , the onset of encephalopathy may indicate the need for a liver transplant . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The mildest form of hepatic encephalopathy is difficult to detect clinically , but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing . It is experienced as forgetfulness , mild confusion , and irritability . The first stage of hepatic encephalopathy is characterised by an inverted sleep @-@ wake pattern ( sleeping by day , being awake at night ) . The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes . The third stage is marked by worsened confusion . The fourth stage is marked by a progression to coma . 
 More severe forms of hepatic encephalopathy lead to a worsening level of consciousness , from lethargy to somnolence and eventually coma . In the intermediate stages , a characteristic jerking movement of the limbs is observed ( <unk> , " liver flap " due to its flapping character ) ; this disappears as the somnolence worsens . There is disorientation and amnesia , and uninhibited behaviour may occur . In the third stage , neurological examination may reveal clonus and positive Babinski sign . Coma and seizures represent the most advanced stage ; cerebral oedema ( swelling of the brain tissue ) leads to death . 
 Encephalopathy often occurs together with other symptoms and signs of liver failure . These may include jaundice ( yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes ) , ascites ( fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity ) , and peripheral edema ( swelling of the legs due to fluid build @-@ up in the skin ) . The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated , and the plantar reflex may be abnormal , namely extending rather than flexing ( Babinski 's sign ) in severe encephalopathy . A particular smell ( <unk> hepaticus ) may be detected . 
 = = Causes = = 
 In a small proportion of cases , the encephalopathy is caused directly by liver failure ; this is more likely in acute liver failure . More commonly , especially in chronic liver disease , hepatic encephalopathy is caused or aggravated by an additional cause , and identifying these causes can be important to treat the episode effectively . 
 Hepatic encephalopathy may also occur after the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPSS ) . This is used in the treatment of refractory ascites , bleeding from oesophageal varices and hepatorenal syndrome . TIPSS @-@ related encephalopathy occurs in about 30 % of cases , with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy , higher age , female sex and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol . 
 = = Pathogenesis = = 
 There are various explanations why liver dysfunction or portosystemic shunting might lead to encephalopathy . In healthy subjects , nitrogen @-@ containing compounds from the intestine , generated by gut bacteria from food , are transported by the portal vein to the liver , where 80 – 90 % are metabolised through the urea cycle and / or excreted immediately . This process is impaired in all subtypes of hepatic encephalopathy , either because the hepatocytes ( liver cells ) are incapable of metabolising the waste products or because portal venous blood bypasses the liver through collateral circulation or a medically constructed shunt . Nitrogenous waste products accumulate in the systemic circulation ( hence the older term " portosystemic encephalopathy " ) . The most important waste product is ammonia ( NH3 ) . This small molecule crosses the blood – brain barrier and is absorbed and metabolised by the astrocytes , a population of cells in the brain that constitutes 30 % of the cerebral cortex . Astrocytes use ammonia when synthesising glutamine from glutamate . The increased levels of glutamine lead to an increase in osmotic pressure in the astrocytes , which become swollen . There is increased activity of the inhibitory γ @-@ aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) system , and the energy supply to other brain cells is decreased . This can be thought of as an example of brain oedema of the " cytotoxic " type . 
 Despite numerous studies demonstrating the central role of ammonia , ammonia levels don 't always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy ; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low . Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include <unk> ( substances containing a thiol group ) , short @-@ chain fatty acids and phenol . 
 Numerous other abnormalities have been described in hepatic encephalopathy , although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain . Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression ( especially <unk> 2 ) has been attributed to acute liver failure . Benzodiazepine @-@ like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system . An imbalance between aromatic amino acids ( phenylalanine , tryptophan and tyrosine ) and branched @-@ chain amino acids ( leucine , isoleucine and valine ) has been described ; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters ( such octopamine and 2 @-@ <unk> ) . <unk> of the serotonin system , too , has been reported . Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role . Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 = = = Investigations = = = 
 The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy can only be made in the presence of confirmed liver disease ( types A and C ) or a portosystemic shunt ( type B ) , as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies . To make the distinction , abnormal liver function tests and / or ultrasound suggesting liver disease are required , and ideally liver biopsy . The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy may also arise from other conditions , such as cerebral haemorrhage and seizures ( both of which are more common in chronic liver disease ) . A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage , and if seizure activity is suspected an <unk> ( EEG ) study may be performed . Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are meningitis , encephalitis , Wernicke 's encephalopathy and Wilson 's disease ; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations . 
 The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical one , once other causes for confusion or coma have been excluded ; no test fully diagnoses or excludes it . Serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90 % of patients , but not all <unk> ( high ammonia levels ) is associated with encephalopathy . A CT scan of the brain usually shows no abnormality except in stage IV encephalopathy , when cerebral oedema may be visible . Other neuroimaging modalities , such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , are not currently regarded as useful , although they may show abnormalities . Electroencephalography shows no clear abnormalities in stage 0 , even if minimal HE is present ; in stages I , II and III there are <unk> waves over the frontal lobes that oscillate at 5 Hz , and in stage IV there is slow delta wave activity . However , the changes in EEG are not typical enough to be useful in distinguishing hepatic encephalopathy from other conditions . 
 Once the diagnosis of encephalopathy has been made , efforts are made to exclude underlying causes ( such as listed above in " causes " ) . This requires blood tests ( urea and electrolytes , full blood count , liver function tests ) , usually a chest X @-@ ray , and urinalysis . If there is ascites , diagnostic paracentesis ( removal of a fluid sample with a needle ) may be required to identify spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 = = = = West Haven criteria = = = = 
 The severity of hepatic encephalopathy is graded with the West Haven Criteria ; this is based on the level of impairment of autonomy , changes in consciousness , intellectual function , behavior , and the dependence on therapy . 
 Grade 1 - Trivial lack of awareness ; euphoria or anxiety ; shortened attention span ; impaired performance of addition or subtraction 
 Grade 2 - Lethargy or apathy ; minimal disorientation for time or place ; subtle personality change ; inappropriate behaviour 
 Grade 3 - <unk> to <unk> , but responsive to verbal stimuli ; confusion ; gross disorientation 
 Grade 4 - Coma 
 = = = = Types = = = = 
 A classification of hepatic encephalopathy was introduced at the World Congress of Gastroenterology 1998 in Vienna . According to this classification , hepatic encephalopathy is subdivided in type A , B and C depending on the underlying cause . 
 Type A ( = acute ) describes hepatic encephalopathy associated with acute liver failure , typically associated with cerebral oedema 
 Type B ( = bypass ) is caused by portal @-@ systemic shunting without associated intrinsic liver disease 
 Type C ( = cirrhosis ) occurs in patients with cirrhosis - this type is subdivided in episodic , persistent and minimal encephalopathy 
 The term minimal encephalopathy ( <unk> ) is defined as encephalopathy that does not lead to clinically overt cognitive dysfunction , but can be demonstrated with neuropsychological studies . This is still an important finding , as minimal encephalopathy has been demonstrated to impair quality of life and increase the risk of involvement in road traffic accidents . 
 = = = = Minimal HE = = = = 
 The diagnosis of minimal hepatic encephalopathy requires neuropsychological testing by definition . Older tests include the " numbers connecting test " A and B ( measuring the speed at which one could connect randomly dispersed numbers 1 – 20 ) , the " block design test " and the " digit @-@ symbol test " . In 2009 an expert panel concluded that neuropsychological test batteries aimed at measuring multiple domains of cognitive function are generally more reliable than single tests , and tend to be more strongly correlated with functional status . Both the <unk> Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status ( <unk> ) and PSE @-@ <unk> @-@ Test may be used for this purpose . The PSE @-@ <unk> @-@ Test , developed in Germany and validated in several other European countries , incorporates older assessment tools such as the number connection test . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Those with severe encephalopathy ( stages 3 and 4 ) are at risk of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex . This can lead to respiratory arrest . Transferring the patient to a higher level of nursing care , such as an intensive care unit , is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life @-@ threatening complications ( e.g. , aspiration or respiratory failure ) . Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication . 
 The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy depends on the suspected underlying cause ( types A , B or C ) and the presence or absence of underlying causes . If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure ( type A ) , even in a mild form ( grade 1 – 2 ) , it indicates that a liver transplant may be required , and transfer to a specialist centre is advised . Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPSS procedure ; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below , but in a small proportion of about 5 % , occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms . 
 In hepatic encephalopathy type C , the identification and treatment of alternative or underlying causes is central to the initial management . Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause , antibiotics are often administered empirically ( without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection ) . Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated , a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 In the past , it was thought that consumption of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy . This has been shown to be incorrect . Furthermore , many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight . A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended . 
 Dietary supplementation with Branched @-@ chain amino acids has shown improvement of encephalopathy and other complications of cirrhosis . Some studies have shown benefit of administration of probiotics ( " healthy bacteria " ) . 
 = = = Lactulose / lactitol = = = 
 Lactulose and lactitol are disaccharides that are not absorbed from the digestive tract . They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria , render the ammonia <unk> by converting it to ammonium ( NH4 + ) ions , and increase transit of bowel content through the gut . Doses of 15 @-@ 30 ml are administered three times a day ; the result is aimed to be 3 – 5 soft stools a day , or ( in some settings ) a stool pH of < 6 @.@ 0 . Lactulose may also be given by enema , especially if encephalopathy is severe . More commonly , phosphate enemas are used . This may relieve constipation , one of the causes of encephalopathy , and increase bowel transit . 
 A 2004 review by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether lactulose and lactitol are of benefit for hepatic encephalopathy , but it remains the first @-@ line treatment for type C hepatic encephalopathy . In acute liver failure , it is unclear whether lactulose is beneficial . Furthermore , it may lead to bloating and as such interfere with a liver transplant procedure if required . 
 = = = Antibiotics = = = 
 The antibiotic rifaximin is typically recommended . It is a <unk> antibiotic from the <unk> class . This is thought to work in a similar way to other antibiotics , but without the complications attached to neomycin and metronidazole . The use of rifaximin is supported by better evidence than lactulose . Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use , rifaximin is only used as a second @-@ line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective . When rifaximin is added to lactulose , the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately . <unk> is more expensive than lactulose , but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy . 
 The antibiotics neomycin and metronidazole were previously used as a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy . The rationale of their use was the fact that ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by intestinal bacteria , and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products . <unk> was chosen because of its low intestinal absorption , as neomycin and similar <unk> antibiotics may cause hearing loss and renal failure if used parenterally . Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed <unk> , with resultant complications . <unk> , similarly , was abandoned because prolonged use could cause peripheral neuropathy ( nerve damage ) , in addition to gastrointestinal side effects .

 A preparation of L @-@ ornithine and L @-@ aspartate ( LOLA ) is used to increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle , a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea . It may be combined with lactulose and / or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms . 
 = = Epidemiology and prognosis = = 
 In those with cirrhosis , the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy is 20 % per year , and at any time about 30 – 45 % of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy . The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60 – 80 % ; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future . Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed , the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure , such as the levels of albumin ( a protein produced by the liver ) , the prothrombin time ( a test of coagulation , which relies on proteins produced in the liver ) , the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin ( a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver ) . Together with the severity of encephalopathy , these markers have been incorporated into the Child @-@ Pugh score ; this score determines the one- and two @-@ year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation . 
 In acute liver failure , the development of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short @-@ term mortality , and is almost as important as the nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis . Historically , widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation , such as King 's College Criteria , are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria . The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with Wilson 's disease ( hereditary copper accumulation ) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a liver transplant . 
 = = History = = 
 The occurrence of disturbed behaviour in people with jaundice may have been described in antiquity by Hippocrates of Cos ( ca . 460 – 370 BCE ) . Celsus and Galen ( first and third century respectively ) both recognised the condition . Many modern descriptions of the link between liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms were made in the eighteenth and nineteenth century ; for instance , Giovanni Battista Morgagni ( 1682 – 1771 ) reported in 1761 that it was a progressive condition . 
 In the 1950s , several reports enumerated the numerous abnormalities reported previously , and confirmed the previously enunciated theory that metabolic impairment and portosystemic shunting are the underlying mechanism behind hepatic encephalopathy , and that the nitrogen @-@ rich compounds originate from the intestine . Many of these studies were done by Professor Dame Sheila Sherlock ( 1918 – 2001 ) , then at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London and subsequently at the Royal Free Hospital . The same group investigated protein restriction and neomycin . 
 The West Haven classification was formulated by Prof Harold Conn ( 1925 – 2011 ) and colleagues at Yale University while investigating the therapeutic efficacy of lactulose . 
 = Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleship = 
 Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships were a class of pre – World War I , pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the German Kaiserliche Marine . The class was made up of five ships , all of which were named for German emperors . The Kaiser Friedrich III class saw the introduction of the traditional armament layout for German battleships — four large @-@ caliber guns , but of comparatively smaller caliber compared to contemporary battleships , in two gun turrets — prior to the advent of the dreadnought type of battleship in the early 1900s . They also standardized the use of three screws for battleships . 
 Kaiser Friedrich III was laid down at Wilhelmshaven Navy Dockyard in March , 1895 , followed by Kaiser Wilhelm II in October , 1896 , also in Wilhelmshaven . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was laid down at Germania , Kiel in January , 1898 , followed by Kaiser Barbarossa at Schichau , Danzig in August of that year , and Kaiser Karl der Grosse , a month later in September , at Blohm & Voss , Hamburg . Work on all five vessels was completed by 1901 . 
 The five Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships were assigned to the I Squadron of the Home Fleet ( Heimatflotte ) after commissioning . Here they conducted extensive annual training maneuvers with the rest of the fleet . After ten years of fleet service , they were replaced with newer ships . They were transferred to the III Squadron of the fleet , which had by then been reorganized as the High Seas Fleet , and placed in reserve . The ships were recalled to active service at the outbreak of World War I , but saw limited duty during the war . They initially served in V Squadron , until 1915 , when the ships were relegated to auxiliary roles , primarily as prison ships . After the war , all five of the ships were sold and scrapped by 1922 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Design work on the class began in 1892 and lasted until 1894 . The ships of the Kaiser Friedrich III class marked a significant departure from the previous Brandenburg @-@ class battleships . Influenced by the Japanese cruisers ' victory over a heavier @-@ armed Chinese fleet at the Battle of Yalu , heavy @-@ caliber guns designed to penetrate armor were abandoned and replaced with smaller quick @-@ firing guns . These guns were intended to raze the superstructure of enemy battleships and demoralize the crew . The propulsion system was improved and reorganized to incorporate a third propeller shaft . The armor system , however , remained similar to that employed on the Brandenburgs .

 The Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class ships were 120 @.@ 9 meters ( 396 ft 8 in ) long at the waterline and 125 @.@ 3 m ( 411 ft 1 in ) overall . They had a beam of 20 @.@ 4 m ( 66 ft 11 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 89 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 25 m ( 27 ft 1 in ) aft . The ships displaced 11 @,@ 785 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 599 long tons ) at full load . Transverse and longitudinal steel frames were used to build the hulls for the Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class ships . Steel hull plates were riveted to the frame . The hull contained twelve watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 70 percent of the hull . 
 The German navy regarded them as excellent sea vessels . They had a tight turning circle and were very responsive . The ships rolled up to 15 ° and had a roll period of 12 seconds . They suffered only minor speed loss in heavy seas , but up to 40 percent with the rudder hard over . Their metacentric height was between .917 to 1 @.@ 18 m ( 3 ft 0 @.@ 1 in to 3 ft 10 @.@ 5 in ) . The ships carried a number of smaller boats , including two picket boats , two launches , one pinnace , two cutters , two yawls , and two dinghies . The crew numbered 39 officers and 612 enlisted men . When serving as a squadron flagship , a ship had its crew augmented by another 12 officers and between 51 to 63 enlisted men . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 The Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships were powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws . Kaiser Friedrich III , Kaiser Barbarossa , and Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse were equipped with three 3 @-@ bladed screws that were 4 @.@ 5 m ( 14 ft 9 in ) in diameter . Kaiser Karl der Grosse and Kaiser Wilhelm II were equipped with two of the 3 @-@ bladed screws on the outer shafts and a four @-@ bladed screw that was 4 @.@ 2 m ( 13 ft 9 in ) in diameter on the center shaft . Kaiser Friedrich III had four Thornycroft and eight cylindrical boilers ; Kaiser Wilhelm II had a similar arrangement , except the Thornycroft boilers were replaced by Marine @-@ type boilers . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was equipped with four Marine and six cylindrical boilers , while Kaiser Barbarossa had four Thornycroft and six cylindrical boilers . Kaiser Karl der Grosse had two Marine boilers , two Marine double boilers , and six cylindrical boilers . 
 The powerplants were rated at 13 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 12 @,@ 822 ihp ; 9 @,@ 561 kW ) , but on trials could produce up to 13 @,@ 950 PS ( 13 @,@ 760 ihp ; 10 @,@ 260 kW ) . This generated a top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . The ships carried 650 metric tons ( 640 long tons ; 720 short tons ) of coal , although the use of additional spaces within the ships increased fuel capacity to 1 @,@ 070 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 050 long tons ; 1 @,@ 180 short tons ) . This provided a maximum range of 3 @,@ 420 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 330 km ; 3 @,@ 940 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Electrical power was supplied by five 320 kW 74 Volt generators in Kaiser Friedrich III and Kaiser Wilhelm II , and four 240 kW 74 V generators in the other three ships . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships ' armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . The guns were mounted in Drh.L. C / 98 turrets , which allowed elevation to 30 ° and depression to − 5 ° . At maximum elevation , the guns could hit targets out to 16 @,@ 900 meters ( 18 @,@ 500 yd ) . The guns fired 140 @-@ kilogram ( 310 lb ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 690 m / s ( 2 @,@ 263 ft / s ) . They had a rate of fire of three to four shots per minute . Each gun was supplied with 75 shells , for a total of 300 . 
 Secondary armament included eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns ; six were emplaced in single turrets amidships and twelve were mounted in MPL casemates . These guns fired armor @-@ piercing shells at a rate of 4 – 5 per minute . The ships carried 120 shells per gun , for a total of 2 @,@ 160 rounds total . The guns could depress to − 7 degrees and elevate to 20 degrees , for a maximum range of 13 @,@ 700 m ( 14 @,@ 990 yd ) . They were manually elevated and trained . 
 The ships also carried twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns , also mounted in casemates . These guns were supplied with between 170 and 250 shells per gun . These guns fired 13 @.@ 8 kg ( 30 @.@ 4 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of 590 m / s ( 1 @,@ 936 ft / s ) . Their rate of fire was approximately 15 shells per minute ; the guns could engage targets out to 10 @,@ 500 m ( 11 @,@ 480 yd ) . The gun mounts were manually operated . The ships ' gun armament was rounded out by twelve machine guns . 
 The ships were also armed with six 45 cm torpedo tubes , all in above @-@ water swivel mounts . Four tubes were mounted on the sides of the ship , another in the bow , and the last in the stern . These weapons were 5 @.@ 1 m ( 16 ft 9 in ) long and carried an 87 @.@ 5 kg ( 193 lb ) TNT warhead . They could be set at two speeds for different ranges . At 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , the torpedoes had a range of 800 m ( 870 yd ) . At an increased speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , the range was reduced to 500 m ( 550 <unk> ) . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class ships were armored with steel produced by Krupp . They had an armor belt that was 300 millimeters ( 12 in ) thick in the central portion of the hull at the waterline . It tapered to 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in the forward section and 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) in the rear , although the belt did not extend fully aft . The lower portion of the belt ranged in thickness from 100 to 180 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 1 in ) . The entire belt was backed with 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of teak . The armored deck was 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) thick . 
 The conning tower was protected by armored sides that were 250 mm thick and a roof that was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . Each main @-@ battery turret had a 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick roof and 250 mm thick sides . The 15 cm guns mounted in turrets were protected by 150 mm thick sides and 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick gun shields . Those in the casemates also had 150 mm worth of armor protection .

 Kaiser Friedrich III , the first ship of the class , was ordered from the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven as Ersatz Preussen . She was intended to replace the old armored frigate Preussen . She was laid down in 1895 under construction number 22 . She was launched on 1 July 1896 , after which fitting out commenced ; this included the installation of the ship 's armament and the completion of the superstructure . The ship was completed and commissioned into the German fleet on 7 October 1898 . Kaiser Wilhelm II 's keel was laid in Wilhelmshaven in 1896 , also at the Kaiserliche Werft , under construction number 24 . She was ordered under the contract name Ersatz Friedrich der Grosse , to replace the armored frigate Friedrich der Grosse . Kaiser Wilhelm II was launched on 14 September 1897 and commissioned on 13 February 1900 . 
 Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was ordered under the contract name Ersatz König Wilhelm as a replacement for the obsolete König Wilhelm . Her keel was laid at the Germaniawerft dockyard under construction number 79 in 1898 . The ship was launched on 1 June 1899 and commissioned into the fleet on 5 May 1901 . The keel for Kaiser Barbarossa — ordered as " B " , an addition to the fleet — was laid down at the Schichau @-@ Werke in Danzig in 1898 . Her construction number was 640 . She was launched on 21 April 1900 and commissioned into the German navy on 10 June 1901 . Also in 1898 , Kaiser Karl der Grosse was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 136 . She was ordered as an addition to the fleet , and so was assigned the contract name " A " . The last ship of the class to be completed , Kaiser Karl der Grosse was launched on 18 October 1899 and commissioned into the fleet on 4 February 1902 .

 When Kaiser Wilhelm II was commissioned into the fleet , she assumed the position of fleet flagship ; she held this position until 1906 . The other four ships joined her in the I Squadron of the Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) , where they remained for ten years . The five ships took part in extensive training maneuvers in September 1902 with the rest of the fleet . Throughout the maneuvers the Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class ships operated as the opposing force , with the exception of Kaiser Wilhelm II . As the fleet flagship , Kaiser Wilhelm II hosted Wilhelm II during several of the mock engagements and served as the observation point for the senior staff . 
 Between 1907 and 1910 , the ships of the class were heavily rebuilt , with the exception of Kaiser Karl der Grosse . During the modernization , the ships had their superstructures cut down . Four 15 cm guns and one torpedo tube were also removed . The ships ' 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were repositioned to the upper decks where the 15 cm guns had been located . Also , the smoke stacks were lengthened . 
 By 1911 , the fleet was reorganized as the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) , and new dreadnought battleships were beginning to enter service . As a result , the Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class ships were transferred to the III Squadron and then placed into reserve . In 1914 , with the outbreak of World War I , the five ships were recalled to active duty and placed in the V Squadron of the fleet . In February 1915 , the ships were withdrawn from active service for a second time . The ships were disarmed by 1916 and transferred to secondary roles . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse became a torpedo training ship and Kaiser Wilhelm II became the headquarters ship for the commander of the High Seas Fleet in Wilhelmshaven . The other three ships were used as floating prisons . In 1917 , Kaiser Friedrich III was transferred to barracks ship duties in Flensburg . All of the ships , with the exception of Kaiser Wilhelm II , were stricken from the navy register on 6 December 1919 and sold for scrapping . Kaiser Wilhelm II followed on 17 March 1921 . By 1922 , all five ships had been broken up for scrap metal . The bow ornaments from Kaiser Friedrich III and Kaiser Wilhelm II are preserved at the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden . 
 = 1955 MacArthur Airport United Airlines crash = 
 On April 4 , 1955 , a United Airlines Douglas DC @-@ 6 named Mainliner Idaho crashed shortly after taking off from Long Island MacArthur Airport , in Ronkonkoma , Islip , New York , United States . 
 The flight was operated for the purpose of maintaining the currency of the instrument rating of two of the airline 's pilots . Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through 150 feet ( 46 m ) , the plane began banking to the right . It continued to roll through 90 degrees ; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground . All three members of the flight crew were killed upon impact . 
 A subsequent investigation found a simulated engine failure procedure was being conducted , which involved a member of the crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off . Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far , it would cause the propeller to reverse — a feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing . Once the landing gear was raised , the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position , since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised . The Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine , thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank . Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised , that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine , causing the DC @-@ 6 to spiral out of control . Since the plane was so close to the ground , the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact . 
 In the aftermath of the accident , the Civil Aeronautics Administration ( CAA ) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC @-@ 6 and DC @-@ 6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the propeller blades . United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC @-@ 6 aircraft , which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed . 
 = = History = = 
 On April 4 , 1955 , a United Airlines check captain , Stanley C. Hoyt , age 45 , was carrying out instrument rating checks on two of the airline 's pilots . Hoyt had been employed by United Airlines since 1937 , and had 9 @,@ 763 flying hours experience , 549 of which were in a DC @-@ 6 . He was training the two pilots , Henry M. Dozier , age 40 , and <unk> H. Webb , age 35 , so they would be able to retain an instrument rating qualification , allowing them to fly under instrument flight rules . The aircraft was a Douglas DC @-@ 6 , registration <unk> , serial number <unk> . The airframe had flown 22 @,@ 068 flying hours , and had undergone an inspection 105 hours before the accident . The aircraft was powered by four Pratt & Whitney <unk> @-@ <unk> engines , fitted with Hamilton Standard <unk> @-@ 317 propellers . 
 The weather on the day of the accident was clear , although there was a strong wind of about 20 knots ( 37 km / h ) hitting the airfield from the southwest , with occasional gusts of wind as fast as 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) . The aircraft made several circuits , taking off and landing again , before eyewitnesses observed the aircraft standing at the end of the runway and then taking off at about 15 : 50 Eastern Standard Time . Loaded with around 61 @,@ 000 pounds ( 28 @,@ 000 kg ) , the aircraft was far below its maximum permissible weight and the center of gravity was within the prescribed limits for the model of aircraft . 
 Between 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) and 1 @,@ 800 feet ( 550 m ) down the runway , the aircraft reached take @-@ off speed , lifted off the ground , and began climbing normally as the crew retracted the landing gear . Upon climbing through 50 feet ( 15 m ) , the aircraft began banking to the right . The climbing bank continued to increase at a rate which alarmed witnesses , and soon after the aircraft rolled through 90 ° ( at which point the wings were vertical to the ground ) . At a height of around 150 feet ( 46 m ) , with all four engines producing take @-@ off thrust , the nose began to fall . Moments later the right wing and nose impacted the ground , causing the fuselage to cartwheel over , before the aircraft came to rest , with the correct side up . It was immediately engulfed in flames . All three members of the flight crew were instantly killed . Although emergency services at Long Island MacArthur promptly responded to the crash , the aircraft was destroyed by the post @-@ crash fire .

 = = = Wreckage examination = = = 
 The Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) , charged with investigating the accident , examined the wreckage at Long Island MacArthur Airport . Reports from witnesses of the crash indicated the aircraft appeared to have made a normal takeoff and began climbing normally . But , moments later it began banking sharply to the right . Investigators examined the four charred engines and concluded all were producing power at the point of impact . They could not conclusively determine the amount of power being produced , but stated there was no evidence found in the wreckage that suggested the engines might have suffered an operational failure . 
 They were also able to determine all of the flight control surfaces , including the elevators , ailerons and rudder , were functioning properly at the point of the crash , and there were no faults in the flight control system . The flaps were extended to between 15 ° and 20 ° , the standard setting for take @-@ off . The propeller blades of No. 4 engine — on the far right side of the aircraft — were reversed — minus 8 ° , while the blades of Nos. 1 , 2 and 3 engines were at 34 ° positive pitch ( also standard for take @-@ off ) . 
 = = = Reversed thrust = = = 
 The propellers of a DC @-@ 6 are designed to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down . The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust . Should the pilot need to perform a go @-@ around , he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust , enabling the pilot to execute a go @-@ around maneuver . 
 The Douglas Aircraft Company designed a system that would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in @-@ flight . During development of the DC @-@ 6 , the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air . When there was enough weight on the landing gear ( which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground ) , a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closed — meaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed . When the switch was closed , a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft , warning the crew that the blades could be reversed . Should the switch fail to close upon landing , the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored . When the aircraft took off , electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed , and the red flag swung out of sight . Reverse thrust warning lamps , which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed , were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho . 
 = = = Flight tests = = = 
 The CAB carried out flight tests using a DC @-@ 6 . They found that if the propellers were reversed prior to take @-@ off they would not , if the flag was not raised , be rotated automatically again in the air to produce forward thrust if full power was applied . Tests performed by United Airlines showed that , if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines , then the aircraft would spiral into a dive . If <unk> ( maximum except take @-@ off ) power was applied to Nos. 1 , 2 and 3 engines , and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4 , then the aircraft would become uncontrollable . 
 If full left aileron was applied , the aircraft could be recovered for a short period of time , but a violent turn to the right would continue , and the competing forces would cause the aircraft to stall , and violently roll and pitch down . Flight tests , investigators said , accurately reproduced what happened to Mainliner Idaho during the accident sequence . The tests performed by United and by the investigators showed that if , after the aircraft became airborne , full power was applied to an engine whose propellers were reversed , the propellers would produce not positive thrust , but increased reverse thrust . One aviation author wrote of the crash , 
 " The flight tests showed conclusively that , at take @-@ off configuration , a DC @-@ 6 becomes uncontrollable with an outboard engine at full power with its propeller in reverse pitch . Control is lost so quickly that there is little the crew can do at low altitude . In the case of this accident , it was doubtful if there would have been time for forward thrust to be restored before control was lost . " 
 = = = Conclusions = = = 
 While the wreckage was being examined , investigators found that all four engines were producing thrust at the time of impact . There were only two ways that the propeller could be reversed during the take @-@ off sequence . Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since , after detailed examination of the engine hub , there was no evidence found of this happening . Therefore , it was concluded that the only way the propeller could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action . Although there was no formal evidence that a simulated engine failure was being performed , statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case . United Airlines procedure calls for No. 4 engine to be shut down in a simulated engine failure — the same engine which was found at the crash site with its propellers reversed . 
 The investigation concluded the accident sequence began when the check pilot , while the aircraft was on the ground , retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past the idle position , and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine . Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right , it would have been a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine , thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered . However , since the metal flag was not raised , there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanisms — and increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust . 
 The final accident report concluded there wasn 't sufficient time for the crew to react , since the dive began suddenly while the plane was so close to the ground . " Control will be lost so quickly that there is little , if anything , that the pilot can do if it occurs at low altitude , " the report stated . " He must recognize what is occurring , analyze it , and take action to <unk> in a very limited amount of time . It is doubtful that <unk> could have been accomplished in this instance before control was lost . " 
 On October 4 , 1955 , the CAB released the final accident report , which concluded the reversal of the propellers and subsequent increase in power of the No. 4 engine had caused the accident . 
 " The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was unintentional movement of No. 4 throttle into the reverse range just before breaking ground , with the other three engines operating at high power output , which resulted in the aircraft very quickly becoming uncontrollable once airborne . "

 = = = Technological advances = = = 
 Following the accident , the Civil Aeronautics Administration ( CAA ) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC @-@ 6 and DC @-@ 6B aircraft to be fitted with a sequence gate latch , known as a Martin bar . The device is a metal bar which a crew would manually swing in front of the thrust levers over the idle line , physically preventing the thrust levers from being retarded into the reverse position . According to the CAB report , a United Airlines engineer told investigators the Martin bar should make propeller reversal " a more reliable and safer device [ than the system fitted to Mainliner Idaho ] ... with its numerous switches , relays , and automatic operation . " 
 United Airlines issued a statement saying it had begun installing the device on its fleet of DC @-@ 6 and DC @-@ 6B aircraft one week before the accident , having used it successfully in service on their fleet of Douglas DC @-@ 7 aircraft . A Martin bar had not yet been fitted on Mainliner Idaho . United Airlines also said a program had begun to install reverse thrust indicator lights on all their DC @-@ 6 and DC @-@ 6B aircraft . The signals , fitted in the cockpit of the aircraft , would have warned the flight crew that the thrust lever had been pulled back too far , and the propellers had been reversed .

 Since the crash , there have been several other accidents involving reverse thrust . A Douglas DC @-@ 8 operating United Airlines Flight 859 crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the landing roll . The left engines remained in forward thrust , while the right engines went into reverse , causing the aircraft to veer rapidly to the right and collide with airport construction vehicles , killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground . Japan Airlines Flight 350 , a DC @-@ 8 , crashed in 1982 short of the runway in Tokyo , after the mentally ill captain attempted suicide during the final approach phase of the flight , by putting the inboard engines into reverse thrust . Of the 174 people aboard , 24 died . In 1991 , Lauda Air Flight 004 , operated by a Boeing 767 , crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed in @-@ flight for reasons that could not be determined . The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine . The aircraft rolled to the right and crashed in a populated area of São Paulo , Brazil .

 The 2015 Tour of Flanders ( in Dutch , Ronde van Vlaanderen ) was the 99th edition of the Tour of Flanders one @-@ day cycling race . It took place on 5 April and was the eighth race of the 2015 UCI World Tour . The race is one of the cobbled classics and is the second of the cycling monuments on the 2015 calendar . The 2014 champion was Fabian Cancellara ; he was not able to defend his title after breaking two vertebrae in a crash at E3 Harelbeke . 
 The race was initially dominated by a breakaway group of up to seven riders before the favourites in the chasing group started to attack on the climb of the Taaienberg , 36 km ( 22 mi ) from the finish . Eventually , Alexander Kristoff and Niki Terpstra broke free and contested the victory in a two @-@ man sprint , won by Kristoff , who became the first Norwegian to win the race .

 The route of the 2015 edition of the race was only slightly adjusted from that of the 2014 edition , with two climbs added to the route in the first 100 km ( 62 mi ) , the Tiegemberg and the Berendries . It was 264 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 164 @.@ 6 mi ) in length , 5 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 6 mi ) longer than in the previous year and featured 19 small climbs , some of them cobbled . The race started in the Belgian city of Bruges , in the Grote Markt , with a 9 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 7 mi ) neutral zone . The racing began after the riders passed through <unk> , on the outskirts of Brugge . The first part of the route was a 43 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 27 @.@ 1 mi ) route south to the city of Kortrijk , passing through <unk> , Ardooie and <unk> . This part of the route was almost entirely flat . After Kortrijk , the route turned east towards the region known as the Flemish Ardennes . The final 150 km ( 93 mi ) were kept from the 2014 edition , with the toughest part of the race starting at the steep Koppenberg . In the last 45 km ( 28 mi ) , five climbs were set to prove decisive : the <unk> ( at 39 km ( 24 mi ) remaining ) , the Taaienberg ( 37 km ( 23 mi ) ) , the Kruisberg ( 28 km ( 17 mi ) ) , the Oude Kwaremont ( 17 km ( 11 mi ) ) and finally the Paterberg ( 13 km ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) ) . Several climbs needed to be tackled more than once , as the route took two laps of a circuit . These included the Oude Kwaremont , which was ridden three times , first after 112 km ( 70 mi ) as the second climb of the day and the Paterberg , which was featured twice .

 The field of the race was marked by the absence of defending champion Fabian Cancellara ( Trek Factory Racing ) and former winner Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , both ruled out by crashes earlier in the season . Several riders were named as potential favourites for the victory , among them Geraint Thomas ( Team Sky ) , who came into the race after a victory at the E3 Harelbeke and a third @-@ place finish at Gent – Wevelgem just a few days before . In the absence of Cancellara , Trek Factory Racing 's squad was led by Stijn Devolder , the only former winner in the peloton , although he was not considered to have the best chances . Etixx – Quick @-@ Step 's squad featured Niki Terpstra , Zdeněk Štybar , and Stijn Vandenbergh , all of which were considered serious contenders . Team Katusha was led by Alexander Kristoff and Luca Paolini , the latter of which had proven his good form by winning Gent – Wevelgem earlier in the week , but had declared to work for Kristoff for this race . Other possible contenders included Milan – San Remo winner John Degenkolb ( Giant – Alpecin ) and Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , although the Slovaks form had been called into question prior to the race . In addition , commentators named Greg van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) , Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Lars Boom ( Astana ) , Filippo Pozzato ( Lampre – Merida ) , Jürgen Roelandts , Jens Debusschere ( both Lotto – Soudal ) , and Sylvain Chavanel ( IAM Cycling ) among the high number of possible contenders . Barry Ryan on <unk> declared the race " wide open and [ ... ] a nightmare to predict " .

 The race started with a small delay caused by a farmers ' strike . When racing got under way , five riders broke free of the pack after 20 km ( 12 mi ) : Jesse Sergent ( Trek Factory Racing ) , Damien Gaudin ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Ralf <unk> ( Bora – Argon 18 ) , Matthew Brammeier ( MTN – Qhubeka ) , and Dylan Groenewegen ( Team Roompot ) , while Clément Venturini ( Cofidis ) was briefly in the front group as well before dropping back . At Sint @-@ <unk> @-@ Winkel , there was a bonus sprint , in which Brammeier won his body weight of 73 kg ( 161 lb ) in local beer . Lars Bak ( Lotto – Soudal ) and Marco <unk> ( Androni Giocattoli ) were able to bridge the gap to the leaders , creating a group of seven at the front . After 60 km ( 37 mi ) of racing , the leaders were about seven minutes clear of the peloton , but the gap started to come down once the riders reached the first climbs . 
 There were several attacks from the main group when it navigated the area around Oudenaarde , with André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) featuring in all of them , to no avail . Just before the cobble section of the Haaghoek , a neutral car by supplier Shimano tried to overtake the leading group and hit Sergent , who fell and had to retire with a broken collarbone , which later required surgery . With the lead group now down to six riders , they led the main field by three minutes , with Team Sky leading the chase , after their rider Bradley Wiggins had recovered from an earlier crash . Another incident involving a car by Shimano occurred a little later when it crashed into the back of a FDJ team car , which in turn brought down rider Sébastien Chavanel , forcing him to abandon as well . 
 On the <unk> , the tenth climb , Bak and Gaudin were able to break free from their group . On the second ascent of the Oude Kwaremont , Greipel again unsuccessfully attacked , before the main field reached the breakaway at the top of the climb . On the Koppenberg , Greipel again attacked and an increase in tempo caused Bradley Wiggins and other riders to lose contact . At the front , Geraint Thomas and Stijn Devolder ( Trek Factory Racing ) led the chase to bring back Greipel . Once they reached him , Alexey Lutsenko ( Astana ) was on the attack after the climb , leading at a maximum of half a minute . 
 At the climb of the Taaienberg , 36 km ( 22 mi ) from the finish , the favourites came into play . Niki Terpstra was the first to move , with Greg van Avermaet following after crossing the top , soon followed by a larger group . On the third and final lap of the course , Lutsenko attacked the 26 @-@ rider strong group again , joined by van Avermaet and Nelson Oliveira ( Lampre – Merida ) . They were caught before the Kruisberg , soon followed by an attack by Terpstra and Kristoff . The two created a thirty @-@ second lead and held it to the finish , even with a counter @-@ attack from van Avermaet and Peter Sagan late on . Terpstra did not contribute to the pace making over the last kilometre , trying to use Kristoff 's slipstream to win a sprint . This proved unsuccessful however , as Kristoff took the second monuments victory of his career , outsprinting Terpstra to the line . He became the first Norwegian to win the race .

 Kristoff was delighted with his win , saying : " I 'm really happy to win , it 's a really good feeling [ ... ] My family is here today , and it was a big dream and my big goal this season and I managed to do it . " On his run @-@ in to the finish line with Terpstra , he commented : " At the end , I came with Niki , and he didn 't really want to work with me , but I understand that . In the end I could still beat him . " Geraint Thomas was disappointed with his performance , tweeting after the race that he " just lacked the legs of last weekend " , referring to his E3 Harelbeke victory . 
 The magazine Cycling Weekly commented on the race by criticising the route as " more attritional [ ... ] than it is tactical " , citing the lack of attacks and the teams ' reluctance to send riders into break @-@ aways . Reporter Stephen <unk> also criticised Niki Terpstra for not attacking Kristoff before the finish , writing : " Did Terpstra really believe he had any hope of winning the two @-@ man sprint against one of the quickest finishers in the world ?

 Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles , California . Before the current group was established , the original four members , Adam Levine ( lead vocals , lead guitar ) , Jesse Carmichael ( rhythm guitar , backing vocals ) Mickey Madden ( bass guitar ) and Ryan Dusick ( drums ) , formed a band known as Kara 's Flowers in 1994 , while they were still in high school . The band , which self @-@ released an album called We Like Digging ? , then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997 . After the album garnered a tepid response , the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college . 
 In 2001 , the band changed its image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a new direction under the name Maroon 5 . At this point , Carmichael switched to playing keyboards , which has since become his main instrument in the band . After these changes , Maroon 5 signed with a subsidiary of J Records , Octone Records , and released their debut album , Songs About Jane , in June 2002 . The album 's lead single , " Harder to Breathe " , received heavy airplay , which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart . In 2004 , the album went platinum and has been dubbed " the sleeper hit of the millennium " . The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005 . For the next few years , Maroon 5 toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings : 2004 's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005 's Live – Friday the 13th . In 2006 , Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn . The band then recorded their second album , It Won 't Be Soon Before Long and released it in May 2007 . The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single , " Makes Me Wonder " , became the band 's first number @-@ one single on the Billboard Hot 100 . 
 In September 2010 , Maroon 5 released their third studio album Hands All Over , which was re @-@ released in 2011 to include the single " Moves like Jagger " featuring Christina Aguilera . While the original version of the album received mixed reviews , " Moves like Jagger " reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 . The band released their fourth album , Overexposed , on June 26 , 2012 . All four singles of the album were highly successful on the Billboard Hot 100 , including second single " One More Night " , which reached number one for 4 weeks straight . Keyboardist PJ Morton became an official member of the band in 2012 , after gaining little success with his previous albums as an R & B vocalist . The addition of PJ Morton meant that for the first time , Maroon 5 had six official members . The same year , the bass player of Phantom Planet , Sam Farrar , became an official touring member , playing many different instruments ( including guitars , percussion and additional keyboards ) , singing backing vocals and also providing samples on other popular bands . In 2014 , the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album , V. Maroon 5 has sold more than 20 million albums and 70 million singles worldwide . 
 In June 25 , 2016 , Maroon 5 was recognized as # <unk> to celebrate the release of the band 's debut studio album , Songs About Jane , and support children in need of health care with UNICEF .

 = = = 1994 – 2002 : Kara 's Flowers and the formation of Maroon 5 = = = 
 Adam Levine was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist , Adam Salzman . Levine was 15 years old and Dusick was 16 . Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12 . The four original members of the band met while attending Brentwood EMH School in Los Angeles . While attending Brentwood EMH School , Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined up with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form Kara 's Flowers , a rock band . The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a " collective crush " on . In 1997 , when the band was playing at a beach party in Malibu , independent producer Tommy Allen heard them play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner , songwriter John DeNicola , who is known for his work on Dirty Dancing – including " ( I 've Had ) The Time of My Life " . Producer Rob Cavallo 's management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced , which eventually led Cavallo to offer them a deal with Reprise Records . However , after the release of The Fourth World , during Levine and Madden 's senior year of high school in 1997 , it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s Britpop . Despite high expectations from the band and record company , the album failed to catch on and their lead single , " Soap Disco " , was a failure . According to Levine , the failure of the album was " a huge disappointment " that nearly led them to break up in 1998 . The album sold around 5 @,@ 000 copies and the band was dropped after one month . 
 Dusick and Madden attended college locally at UCLA , while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to attend Five Towns College , in Dix Hills , Long Island , New York . While Levine and Carmichael were in New York , they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote . 
 The band returned to the music industry again in 2000 . Producer Tim Sommer signed them to a demo deal with MCA Records and produced three tracks with them in Los Angeles in the middle of 2000 with Mark Dearnley engineering . Against Sommer 's advice , MCA declined to pick up the band , and these tracks were never released . The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels , before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener , Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum . While looking for talent for the new Octone label , Berkman was given a bunch of demos by the brother of a former colleague at Columbia Records and the song that caught his attention was " ' Sunday Morning ' " which he referred it as a " genius song " . Berkman was surprised the song was credited to Kara 's Flowers because the band sounded completely different from the one he had heard while at Warner Brothers . 
 Berkman encouraged Diener and Boxenbaum to fly out to Los Angeles to watch a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four @-@ piece Kara 's Flowers . After watching Levine onstage , they were convinced . Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a " fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer , so he could be the star I perceived him to be . " Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past . Also , the label began looking for a full @-@ time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman . James Valentine ( from the L.A. band Square ) was recruited for the job . On his joining the band , Valentine commented : " I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together , it was very much like I was cheating on my band , we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them . "

 James Valentine attended Berklee College of Music with John Mayer in 1996 , where they developed a rapport . In 2002 , the two reconnected at a Mayer radio appearance . After Mayer heard their album , he was so impressed ( particularly by " This Love " , which became the most successful release off the album and propelled the band to superstardom ) that he invited them to open for him during his early 2003 tour . The first single , " Harder to Breathe " , slowly started to pick up airplay which helped spur sales of the album . By March 2004 , Songs About Jane had reached the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and " Harder to Breathe " had made the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts . The album peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 in September 2004 , 26 months after its release ; this was the longest period between an album 's release and its initial Top 10 appearance since SoundScan results were included in the Billboard 200 in 1991 . The album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide . This had all happened after the band " abandoned its post @-@ grunge roots for a radio @-@ friendly pop @-@ soul sound , even while dabbling in hard rock . " Mayer invited the band to open for him again in 2004 . Over the next three years , the band toured virtually non @-@ stop , including visits to seventeen countries . During this time , the band toured with Michelle Branch , Graham Colton , and the Rolling Stones . Other acts the band toured alongside with included Gavin DeGraw , Matchbox Twenty , Sugar Ray , Counting Crows , Phantom Planet , the Hives , Dashboard Confessional , Simon Dawes , the Thrills , Thirsty Merc , Marc Broussard , the Donnas , the <unk> , Michael <unk> , and Guster . 
 Sam Farrar says the Aaliyah song " Are You That Somebody ? " affected the band and influenced the song " Not Coming Home . " 
 Songs About Jane eventually reached No. 1 on the Australian albums ( ARIA ) , while " Harder to Breathe " made the Top 20 singles charts in the US and UK , and Top 40 in Australia and New Zealand . The album also eventually climbed to No. 1 in the UK . The second single , " This Love " , reached No. 5 in the US , No. 3 in the UK , and No. 8 in Australia . The third single , " She Will Be Loved , " reached the Top 5 in both the US and the UK , and went to No. 1 in Australia . The fourth single , " Sunday Morning , " reached the Top 40 in the US , UK , and Australia . Maroon 5 also played Live 8 , in Philadelphia in 2005 . Their set included a cover of Neil Young 's " Rockin ' In The Free World " and frontman Levine performed with one of his heroes , and the closing act , Stevie Wonder . On May 13 , 2005 , in Santa Barbara , California , the band wrapped up the Honda Civic Tour , which it headlined . On June 9 , 2005 , the band performed at the American Film Institute 's tribute to filmmaker George Lucas . Lucas himself had selected Maroon 5 for the event , as it was his children 's favorite band at the time . Over the years of touring with the band their drummer , percussionist and backing vocalist Ryan Dusick had been suffering from the touring life . The strains of non @-@ stop touring aggravated an old sports injury . After several absences from the tour with Ryland Steen and Josh Day taking his place , Dusick officially left Maroon 5 in September 2006 . Matt Flynn , the former drummer of Gavin DeGraw and the B @-@ 52 's , joined the band as Dusick 's replacement .

 After recording for 8 months in 2006 , Maroon 5 's second album , It Won 't Be Soon Before Long , was released worldwide in May 2007 by A & M Octone Records . According to Levine , the follow @-@ up to Songs About Jane is " sexier and stronger " , gaining inspiration from iconic 80s artists such as Prince , Shabba Ranks , Michael Jackson and Talking Heads . Ann Powers writing for Los Angeles Times said It Won 't Be Soon Long is " An icy @-@ hot blend of electro @-@ funk and blue @-@ eyed soul that works its cruel streak with the confidence of Daniel Craig 's James Bond " . Before its release , " Makes Me Wonder " was the No. 1 selling single and video on iTunes . It was also the No. 1 selling album , with more than 50 @,@ 000 digital pre @-@ sales . After its release , the album broke iTunes sales records its week of release , selling over 101 @,@ 000 albums . The first single , " Makes Me Wonder , " was released to radio March 27 , 2007 .

 Levine stated that he believed the band was reaching its peak and may make one more album before disbanding . He explained , " Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I don ’ t know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond , like the Rolling Stones " . 
 The band 's third studio album was recorded in 2009 in Switzerland , where the band was joined by record producer Robert John " Mutt " Lange . The album , titled Hands All Over , was released on September 21 , 2010 . On the Billboard 200 , the album debuted at number two behind Zac Brown Band 's album You Get What You Give . Despite the high placement on the Billboard 200 only 142 @,@ 000 copies were sold , which was relatively weak compared to their previous album It Won 't Be Soon Before Long , which debuted at number one with 429 @,@ 000 copies . The album received mixed reviews from music critics , though many of them praised it for its production .

I just think people would be surprised to know that we ’ re a self @-@ contained unit . We ’ re a band that does their own thing . There ’ s no puppet master . " However , in an article about the songwriter and producer Benny Blanco , it is revealed that at least some of the band 's songs , such as " Moves like Jagger , " are the product of efforts by , or collaborations with , professional songwriters and producers . In the same article , Levine says , " It 's almost as if [ Benny Blanco ] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment . He 's about the collaboration . And he 's so good at nailing down who does everything best . " 
 The band has cited Elita 5 , Michael Jackson , The Police , the Bee Gees , Justin Timberlake , Stevie Wonder , Tonic , Prince , Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as influences . Adam Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an influence . Furthermore , guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny , Bill Frisell and John Scofield , as well as the rock band Queens of the Stone Age . The band 's songs tend to be very guitar @-@ heavy , often accompanied by piano or synthesizer . The theme in most of their songs is love , frequently lost love ; songs like " This Love " , " Makes Me Wonder " and " Misery " have a very cynical tone , often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship , while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as " She Will Be Loved " and " Never Gonna Leave This Bed " express a longing for a romantic relationship . " Makes Me Wonder " has a secondary theme , in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War . 
 The band 's style changes from album to album . Songs About Jane consists of songs about Levine 's ex @-@ girlfriend Jane . On It Won 't Be Soon Before Long , however , the songs are less personal and are more electric with more use of synthesizers , creating a retro feel . Hands All Over continues the band 's lost love theme , along with songs about infatuation and was re @-@ released in 2011 , with the hit single " Moves like Jagger " , an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band 's sound , with more of a dance feel to it . " It was one of those songs that was definitely a risk , " Levine said . " It 's a bold statement . We 've never really released a song like that . But it 's exciting to do something different , do something new . I 'm just glad that everyone likes it . " James Valentine called Overexposed " our most ' pop ' record ever and we weren ’ t shy about really going for it . " They also have experimented with new wave and disco sounds on several albums .

 = Florence Nagle = 
 Florence Nagle ( 26 October 1894 – 30 October 1988 ) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses , a breeder of pedigree dogs , and an active feminist . Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913 , and went on to own or breed twenty @-@ one United Kingdom Champions . Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman , who was bred , owned and exhibited by Nagle . She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters , from the 1920s until the mid @-@ 1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions . The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle 's Irish Setters . 
 Described as " the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing " , Nagle trained her first racehorse in 1920 , the Irish @-@ bred colt Fernley . At that time women were forced to employ men to hold a Jockey Club trainers licence on their behalf , or to have licences in their husbands ' names . Nagle worked peacefully to redress such injustices to her sex . She successfully challenged the well @-@ established leading gentlemen 's clubs of the racing and canine worlds over their gender inequality , and in 1966 became one of the first two women in the United Kingdom licensed to train racehorses . The first racehorse officially trained in Nagle 's name was Mahwa , registered as being owned by her friend Miss Newton Deakin , with whom she jointly owned some of her dogs . 
 Dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for women jockeys , Nagle sponsored the Florence Nagle Girl Apprentices ' Handicap first run in 1986 at Kempton Park . She died at her home in West Chiltington , Sussex , two years later at the age of 94 , leaving funds in her will for the continuation of the race . 
 = = Background and early life = = 
 Born in Fallowfield , Manchester , Nagle was the daughter of Sir William George Watson , 1st Baronet of Sulhamstead ( 1861 – 1930 ) and his second wife Bessie ( née Atkinson ) ; she was also the elder sister of art connoisseur Peter Watson . Nagle was educated at Wycombe Abbey before studying domestic economy at Evendine Court , from which she was expelled after visiting Worcester Cathedral without permission . Accompanied by the daughter of a canon , Nagle had hired a car for the excursion – she was one of the first women in Berkshire to hold a driving licence , gaining it when she was fifteen years old . Her education was completed at a finishing school after which she spent some time in Paris , where she became friends with Megan Lloyd George . 
 Sulhamstead Abbots , Nagle 's family home in Berkshire , was used as a hospital during the First World War . There she met James Nagle , a native of Ireland who had emigrated to Canada but returned to serve with the King 's Royal Rifle Corps and then had been sent to Sulhamstead Abbots to recuperate . Against her parents ' wishes the couple were married on 1 July 1916 , resulting in them threatening to disinherit her . The early days of Nagle 's marriage were hard ; she was used to a wealthy lifestyle – her family money came from her father 's successful business , Maypole Dairies – but her parents offered the couple no financial assistance . Nagle always worked hard and subsidised their income by making cream teas , cleaning windows and scrubbing toilets . The couple had two children , a son , David , and a daughter , Patricia . The marriage was not a success , and her husband ran off with one of the kennel maids . Obtaining a divorce was not easy in the 1920s ; when asked in court for the reason James left , Nagle answered " He must have got bored with me . " The divorce took place in 1928 , five years before her husband 's death . At the time of the divorce she was living on a smallholding near Headley , but returned to Sulhamstead in 1932 after inheriting land and money from Sir William . Ten years later , in 1942 , she purchased Westerlands , a farm in Petworth , so she could personally oversee the stables . 
 Working in Folkestone during the Second World War , Nagle managed a canteen for the ARP . She also donated the full cost of £ 5 @,@ 000 to purchase a Spitfire named Sulhamstead for the Royal Air Force . 
 = = Dog breeding = = 
 As a child , Nagle had a Pomeranian and a Bulldog , but was promised she could have a larger dog once her schooling was completed . In 1913 her dream came to fruition with the purchase of her first Irish Wolfhound , <unk> Michael , for £ 5 . James Nagle subsequently registered the dog with the Kennel Club , before it was transferred to the ownership of Mr and Mrs Nagle , and its name changed to Sir Michael of Sheppey in May 1917 . Food shortages during the First World War resulted in an official prohibition on dog breeding , but Nagle ignored it and bred her first litter from a bitch called Lady Alma of Sheppey . 
 During her marriage , while residing in <unk> , Sulhamstead , near Reading , she began breeding dogs and served as a judge of Irish Wolfhounds and Setters ; Great Danes and Deerhounds were other breeds she judged at championship show level . Her dogs were exhibited at shows by her husband , who was also a judge of Wolfhounds , and they were entered in his name until the couple divorced . 
 A bitch puppy , the runt of the litter , was purchased for £ 48 in 1923 and she became Nagle 's first dog to gain the title of Champion . Named Sulhamstead Thelma , she was declared the best Irish Wolfhound bitch and awarded the Challenge Certificate at three consecutive Crufts , in 1925 , 1926 and 1927 . Her next Champion was Sulhamstead Conncara , a male dog , born in 1925 . Conncara was blind , possibly owing to an accident as a young puppy , but Nagle kept that secret until three years after his death , believing that his qualities would have been overlooked by other breeders if they had known . According to Nagle 's biographer , <unk> Somerfield , this dog was " one of the great sires of all time in the breed " and an " outstanding show dog " . A prepotent sire , he produced several Champions and other top @-@ class show specimens . 
 Nagle owned or bred forty @-@ five Wolfhounds who were awarded Challenge Certificates , twenty @-@ one of them Champions . She believed dogs should be capable of carrying out the work the breed was developed to do , and she promoted coursing . 
 Irish Wolfhounds bred by Nagle were also successful in America ; she began exporting dogs there in 1933 . Best of breed awards at the Irish Wolfhound Club of America speciality shows were secured by Champion Sulhamstead Matador of <unk> in 1960 and by Sulhamstead Mars of <unk> in 1963 . She also judged the national speciality there twice and judged Irish Setters and Irish Wolfhounds at Westminster in 1937 . Other countries she exported Wolfhounds to included Sweden , Italy and Uruguay . As late as 1960 , Sulhamstead Merman , a 150 @-@ pound Irish Wolfhound bred , owned and shown by Nagle at " London 's big dog show " , Crufts , won the Hound Group and went on to be declared Best in Show or " supreme champion " ; the judges were H. S. Lloyd and Fred Cross . She judged the breed twice at Crufts : in 1961 , the only time in a nine @-@ year period her dogs were not best of breed there ; and in 1970 . 
 Nagle acquired her first Irish Setter , whom she named Sulhamstead D 'Or , in 1924 to keep a wolfhound puppy company . In April 1930 she entered him into the All @-@ Aged Stakes at the Kennel Club field trials . In August 1932 she entered a dog named Sulhamstead Token D 'Or into the Scottish Field Trials in the same category . At the Kennel Club field trials of April 1933 , Nagle entered Sulhamstead Bob D 'Or into the All @-@ Aged Stakes and the judge awarded her the prize presented by the Irish Setter Association of England . In September 1934 , she entered her Irish Setter Sulhamstead Snip D 'Or into the Novice Stake of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society 's 12th working trials at <unk> , near Exeter . 
 In July 1935 Nagle entered the field trials of the Irish Setter Association near Ruabon in North Wales , competing in the Open Stake for Irish Setters and the Puppy Stake for Irish Setters , for puppies which were born the previous year . At the 35th International Gun Dog League trials held at Douglas Castle in August 1935 , she was awarded a diploma in the Champion Stakes for Pointers and Setters . The following month , Nagle took the silver perpetual challenge trophy in the Open Stake of the field trials of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society at Newlyn , near Newquay , competing with her Irish Setter Sulhamstead <unk> D 'Or . At the Kennel Club field trials for pointers and setters in April 1936 , she entered Sulhamstead Bluff D 'Or into the All @-@ Aged Stake and was awarded the <unk> Challenge Cup by Captain N. R. Colville for the " best <unk> dog or bitch , displaying the greatest game @-@ finding ability " . At the 18th annual Scottish Field Trial Association 's field trials for pointers and setters at Yester estate in Gifford , East Lothian , Scotland in August 1936 , Nagle won first prize in the Brace Stake with Sulhamstead Bluff D 'Or . The Kennel Club own a pastel painting by Cecil Aldin of two of Nagle 's Irish Setters , the Field Trial Champions Sulhamstead <unk> D 'Or and Sulhamstead Valla D 'Or . Field trials saw a general downturn in popularity of Irish Setters competing in the 1930s ; during the following decade the breed was principally represented by Nagle 's dogs . Nagle had eighteen Irish Setter field trial champions during the period she was active in the breed from the 1920s to the mid @-@ 1960s . The male dog Harlequin of <unk> was pivotal in the revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed in the 1970s ; he was a descendant of Nagle 's Irish Setter Sulhamstead Natty D 'Or , so the Sulhamstead bloodline is behind most modern day red and whites . Nagle withdrew from the field @-@ trial scene in the mid @-@ 1960s following the retirement of her handler , George Abbott . 
 Other breeds she owned included Golden Retrievers and Pointers . Nagle 's activities were not confined to dogs and horses . A Berkshire boar named <unk> Ugly Duckling was champion at the Royal Show in 1921 . Later he was exported to Argentina , after the purchaser paid what at the time was a record price of £ 750 . During the 1930s she owned Prince Everett of <unk> , a prize @-@ winning Aberdeen Angus . 
 = = Racehorse training and breeding = = 
 According to the Encyclopedia of British Horseracing , Nagle trained her first racehorse in 1920 , the Irish @-@ bred colt Fernley . Her fascination with the sport stemmed from a much earlier time pre @-@ dating her decision to concentrate on breeding dogs but it was particularly the breeding aspect of racehorses she was drawn to . Nagle owned the winner of the Newport Nursery Handicap in 1932 , a horse named Solano , and a reporter recorded that " While Solano is not Mrs Nagle 's first winner , it is some years since the ' rifle green , red cross @-@ belts ' caught the judge 's eye " . On 5 July 1935 , she entered her racehorse Comanche at Newmarket . 
 Nagle entered the Epsom Derby in 1937 ; that horse , Sandsprite , ridden by John Crouch at odds of 100 – 1 , finished second to Mid @-@ day Sun , owned by Mrs Lettice Miller , the first woman owner ever to win the Derby . This was the first horse Nagle bred herself and reactions from commentators were mixed . One report described the horse as a " commanding individual " , whereas another reporter 's opposing opinion was revealed by Nagle when after Sandsprite 's success at Epsom she stated " Not bad for a horse which one newspaper said was only good enough to give rides at the seaside " . Sandsprite 's dam was Wood Nymph , a mare purchased by Nagle for 240 guineas . She wanted to have her mated by the stallion Sansovino but had to settle for using his son , Sandwich , as she could not afford his stud fee . Sandsprite had several other outings in which he gained second or third placings , but was put down at the onset of his stud career after breaking a leg . 
 One of Nagle 's early equine purchases was 15 @-@ year @-@ old Rose of England , the winner of the 1930 Oaks , for 3 @,@ 500 guineas . The mare had already produced the 1937 St. Leger winner , <unk> , and the 1939 top winning two @-@ year @-@ old , British Empire . In Nagle 's ownership she foaled Westerlands Rose , by the stallion Colombo who produced several winners . These included Westerlands Chalice , by <unk> , who won three races in 1957 ; and Game Rose , by Big Game , another winner during the 1950s . Other winning progeny from Westerlands Rose were Westerlands Champagne , Westerlands Prince and Westerlands Rosebud . These five horses accounted for ten race wins between them . 
 At the December Newmarket sales in 1944 Nagle bought the two @-@ year old Carpatica , by the Epsom Derby winner , Hyperion out of Campanula , the 1 @,@ 000 Guineas Stakes winner , for a record 15 @,@ 000 guineas with the intention of looking after the filly 's training at her stables in Petworth . She also bought a five @-@ year @-@ old mare in foal , Hay Harvest , for 5 @,@ 500 guineas . When bred to Sayajirao , Carpatica produced the 1950s winner , <unk> . 
 One of the main winners in the Nagle stables in the early 1960s was Gelert , trained by Nagle and owned by Miss Newton Deakin . Sired by Owen Tudor out of Westerlands Rosebud , he won a race at Ascot . His dam had been successfully raced in the early 1950s and then proved herself as a useful brood . 
 In the first half of the 20th century women trainers were not unknown – Norah Wilmot was training horses for The Queen . But women trained in an unofficial capacity , and were forced to employ men to hold the training licence on their behalf , or to have licences in their husbands ' names . Thus , beginning in 1932 , the divorced Nagle employed Alfred Stickley , a licensed trainer , to work at her stables in the capacity of head lad . Mahwa , by Match III out of Media , was owned by Newton Deakin and was the first winning horse to be officially listed as trained by Nagle . As late as 1975 , she trained twelve horses and recommended feeding them some seaweed to provide iodine . She was also a great believer in the beneficial effects of fresh air , insisting that her horses ' top stable doors were permanently left open . She was vehemently opposed to the vaccination of horses against equine influenza , and challenged a Jockey Club decision to make vaccination compulsory . She thought the hardest part of animal breeding was " to breed for ' guts ' . You can produce lovely looking animals that go well – till they are on a race course with a stiff race to win . " 
 = = Activism = = 
 For twenty years Nagle worked to end the Jockey Club 's ban on licensing women as race horse trainers , which she saw as an injustice : eventually , frustrated by the Jockey Club 's persistent refusal to grant training licences to women , Nagle sought legal redress . It has been suggested that the club used its considerable influence within the Establishment to have her claim blocked twice . Her fight finally reached the Court of Appeal in 1966 . Following her third appearance in court , Nagle emerged victorious . The verdict of the three presiding judges , Lord Denning , Lord Justice <unk> and Lord Justice Salmon , was , in the words of Lord Denning , that " If she is to carry on her trade without stooping to subterfuge she has to have a licence . " Lord Denning went on to describe the refusal to grant Nagle a training licence as " arbitrary and capricious " , and Lord Justice Danckwerts called it " restrictive and nonsensical " . Of the Jockey Club itself , Lord Justice Danckwerts went on to pronounce that " The courts have the right to protect the right of a person to work when it is being prevented by the dictatorial powers of a body which holds a monopoly . " All three judges also referred to the Sex Disqualification ( Removal ) Act 1919 . Faced with the court 's damning and embarrassing decision , the Jockey Club capitulated , and on 3 August 1966 Florence Nagle and Norah Wilmot became the first women in Britain to receive licences to train racehorses . 
 Nagle credited herself with " dragging the Jockey Club into the twentieth century " . She said : " This was a matter of principle . I am a feminist . I believe in equal rights for women . Things should be decided by ability , not sex " . At odds with Nagle 's view , in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that " No doubt there are occupations , such as boxing , which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women " , and Lord Denning had gone on to say that " It is not as if the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for a woman , like that of a jockey or speedway @-@ rider " ; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972 . When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s if she thought women could ever match men on the racecourse , Nagle replied : " My dear man , it used to be said women couldn 't stand up to three @-@ day @-@ eventing . Now they 're beating the men regularly – and the same will happen in racing . Give them time . " Her endeavours led to her being described as " the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing " in Stud & Stable Magazine and " Racing 's Emily Pankhurst " . 
 At the age of 83 Nagle was still pursuing gender equality , accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male @-@ only membership and taking them to court over the matter . After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted , Nagle was proposed as a member of the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977 ; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club 's constitution restricted membership to men only . Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later . She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee , a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy , but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions . Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee . Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case , but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated . Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision . Leonard <unk> was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time , and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press , Dog World and Our Dogs , on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club 's General Committee was recommending that the club 's constitution be changed to allow women members . The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978 . The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979 . The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80 ; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle .

 In the 1980s , still dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for women jockeys , Nagle sponsored a race at Kempton Park , The Florence Nagle Girl Apprentices ' Handicap . The first event took place in 1986 ; after the race John Oaksey wrote in the Daily Telegraph that Nagle was no doubt looking down from her celestial cloud with approval . She subsequently wrote to inform him that she was still alive , but that when the time came she expected to end up in a hotter place – " and there to meet most of her racing friends " . Nagle left a bequest in her will to ensure the race 's survival . 
 Nagle died at her home , Little Mayfield in West Chiltington , Sussex , at the age of 94 . 
 = West Pennard Court Barn = 
 West Pennard Court Barn ( which is also known as the Court Barn , West Bradley ) is a late 14th or early 15th century tithe barn which was built for Glastonbury Abbey . The Grade I listed building is between West Pennard and West Bradley in the English county of Somerset . 
 The barn was restored by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in the 1930s following the collapse of the roof and then given to the National Trust . At 50 feet ( 15 m ) long and 20 feet 6 inches ( 6 @.@ 25 m ) wide it is the smallest of the barns associated with the abbey . It has a cruck braced timber framed roof and is supported by two @-@ stage buttresses . 
 = = History = = 
 The barn which was originally known as Parson 's Barn , was built on the orders of the <unk> of Glastonbury Abbey in the late 14th or early 15th century . There is no written record of the exact date and there is some debate about the likely age of the building based on the architectural features . Along with several others barns it was used to collect the tithes or dues to the abbey , often one tenth of a farm 's produce . It fell within the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides which was named after the hides who gave food rent to Glastonbury Abbey . The West <unk> Court Barn is the smallest of those which survive . 
 A survey in 1932 found that the roof was cracked and it eventually collapsed in 1935 . In 1936 the roof structure was straightened , preserving the medieval trusses where possible , and covered with clay tiles . The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings , with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £ 5 . It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938 . Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961 . A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The rectangular five bay barn is 50 feet ( 15 m ) long and 20 feet 6 inches ( 6 @.@ 25 m ) wide , although it was previously larger . The middle bay is slightly longer than the others because of the central porches . The barn is built of local Blue Lias stone with some better quality oolitic ashlar used for the quoins on the corners and the porches which provided cover for <unk> being loaded and unloaded at the doors . It is supported by two @-@ stage buttresses reaching to three quarters of the height of the walls . Each of the side walls has ventilation slits , or breathers , with those in the end walls being in the shape of a cross <unk> . The barn originally had an attached dovecote on the western end , and still has niches for birds inside the barn and on the east gable wall . The dovecote was adapted into a calf shed . 
 The roof was originally thatched but now is tiled , and is supported by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal trusses . The design of the roof is similar to that in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton , Manor Farm , Doulting and Glastonbury itself , which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum . The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof . 
 = Helmut Wick = 
 Major Helmut Paul Emil Wick ( 5 August 1915 – 28 November 1940 ) was a German Luftwaffe ace and the fourth recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves . The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade , the Oak Leaves , was awarded by the Third Reich to recognise extreme bravery in battle or successful military leadership . It was Germany 's highest military decoration at the time of its presentation to Helmut Wick . 
 Born in Mannheim , Wick joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 and was trained as a fighter pilot . He was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 2 " Richthofen " ( JG 2 — 2nd Fighter Wing ) , and saw combat in the Battles of France and Britain . Promoted to Major in October 1940 , he was given the position of Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of JG 2 — the youngest in the Luftwaffe to hold this rank and position . He was shot down in the vicinity of the Isle of Wight on 28 November 1940 , very likely by the British ace John Dundas , who was subsequently shot down by Wick 's wingman . Helmut Wick was posted as missing in action , presumed dead . By then he had been credited with destroying 56 enemy aircraft in aerial combat , making him the leading German fighter pilot at the time . Flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 , he claimed all of his victories against the Western Allies .

 Helmut Paul Emil Wick was born on 5 August 1915 in Mannheim , Germany , the youngest of three children of a civil engineer , Karl Wick and Berta Wick , née Schenck . Helmut 's eldest brother Walter was born in Swakopmund , at the time in the German protectorate in South @-@ West Africa . The outbreak of World War I forced the family to return to Germany and Helmut 's sister , Doris , was born in Rohrbach , near Heidelberg . Owing to the demand for his father 's skills and expertise building roads and bridges , Helmut spent most of his childhood traveling throughout the German Reich . The Wick family moved to Hanover in 1919 ; Helmut 's mother died there in February 1922 . His father then took the family to Oliva , near Danzig and Königsberg in East Prussia , finally settling in Berlin in 1935 . 
 Upon graduating from Gymnasium ( high school ) in 1935 , Wick , who initially considered a career as a forester , applied to the officer candidate course of the new German Air Force . Scoring well on the suitability tests , he was accepted into the German military on 6 April 1936 at the Luftwaffe officer candidate school in Dresden , after completing compulsory Reichsarbeitsdienst ( Reich Labour Service ) . He swore the oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler on 16 April . After passing officer training courses , Wick was assessed as " well suited to become an officer " on 13 July . He then started flight training and shortly later soloed in a Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 44 " Stieglitz " . Wick was considered an average pilot and had difficulties with his theoretical training , especially those topics that were of little or no interest to him . In early May 1937 , he was briefly transferred to the 6 . Staffel ( 6th squadron ) of Kampfgeschwader 254 ( 254th Bomber Wing ) . A month later he returned to Dresden to complete his officer training . 
 Wick failed to pass the third course of his training but was given a second chance and on 1 April 1938 reported to the officer candidate school at the Luftkriegsschule III ( 3rd air war school ) , <unk> @-@ West near Werder . He successfully completed the course and in mid @-@ 1938 started special pilot training at the Fighter Training facility at Werneuchen . Upon graduation , he was assigned to <unk> Jagdgeschwader 135 ( 135th Fighter Wing ) which on 1 November 1938 became Jagdgeschwader 333 ( 333rd Fighter Wing ) under Oberstleutnant ( Lieutenant Colonel ) Max Ibel at <unk> , flying obsolete Arado Ar 68 biplane fighters . On 8 November 1938 , Oberfähnrich ( senior ensign ) Wick was promoted to Leutnant ( second lieutenant ) and on 1 January 1939 was transferred to 1 . Staffel of Jagdgeschwader 133 ( 133rd Fighter Wing ) , which was later renamed Jagdgeschwader 53 ( JG 53 — 53rd Fighter Wing ) . It was there that Wick began flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 monoplane fighter under the tutelage of Werner Mölders , a Spanish Civil War flying ace credited with 14 aerial victories . Under Mölders ' guidance , Wick became a Schwarmführer ( flight leader ) .

 On 31 August 1939 Wick was given orders to transfer to " Jagdgeschwader Richthofen Nr. I " . At the time there was no such unit ; the intention was to send him to Jagdgeschwader 1 ( JG 1 − 1st Fighter Wing ) , based in Döberitz , near Berlin . During World War I the " Richthofen Geschwader " name had been attached to the World War I era Jagdgeschwader 1 . The " Richthofen " name had been incorrectly put on Wick 's order . Only Wick noticed the mistake , realizing that he could now choose between JG 1 or the famous Jagdgeschwader 2 ( JG 2 — 2nd Fighter Wing ) which currently bore the " Richthofen " name . He chose the Richthofen Geschwader , commanded by Oberst ( Colonel ) Gerd von <unk> , the unit was equipped with the Bf 109 E @-@ 3 and used the tactical code Yellow 3 . On 1 September , Wick joined its 3 . Staffel , serving in the air defence of Berlin during the Polish Campaign . Following the German victory in Poland , JG 2 was transferred to Frankfurt @-@ <unk> and tasked with protection of Germany 's Western border during the Phoney War — the phase between Britain and France 's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939 , and the Battle of France in May 1940 . Flying his sixth combat mission , Leutnant Wick claimed his first , and the Geschwader 's second victory on 22 November 1939 . Near Nancy , he shot down a French Curtiss Hawk 75 fighter piloted by Sergent Saillard of the Groupe de Chasse II / 4 Armée de l ’ Air , who was killed . For this feat , Wick received the Iron Cross 2nd Class ( Eisernes Kreuz 2 . Klasse ) . Wick was allowed to take home leave from his Geschwader and spent Christmas with his wife Ursel , his baby son Walter , and his parents , before returning to his Gruppe at Frankfurt @-@ <unk> . From 10 to 17 February 1940 , Wick and six other members from JG 2 spent a week in the Black Forest on the Feldberg , skiing and relaxing . 
 On 10 May 1940 , German forces launched an offensive in Western Europe , but Wick remained on the ground while his aircraft , Bf 109 Yellow 2 , underwent an engine change . Seven days later , he was back in the air , recording three victories over French LeO 45 bombers in one mission . By 6 June , Wick had 10 confirmed and two unconfirmed victories , including four French Bloch 151 / 152 fighters that he shot down on 5 June to record his fifth through eighth victories . The two unconfirmed victories were Royal Navy Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers claimed on 19 May and for which he had no witnesses . On 6 June , Wick became the first pilot of the I. Gruppe to complete 100 combat missions , claiming his ninth and tenth victory the same day . For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class ( Eisernes Kreuz 1 . Klasse ) by Oberstleutnant Harry von Bülow @-@ Bothkamp . By the end of the French Campaign , Wick 's total stood at 14 confirmed victories , trailing only Hauptmann ( Captain ) Mölders of JG 53 with 25 victories and Hauptmann Wilhelm Balthasar of JG 27 with 23 victories as the Luftwaffe 's top scorer . At the end of the French campaign , 3 . Staffel headquarters moved into the house of Louis Aston Knight , an artist who had fled a few days before the Germans arrived . 
 = = = Battle of Britain = = = 
 During the Battle of Britain against the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in mid @-@ 1940 , Wick rose quickly in rank and in profile , both in the battle zone and as a public figure back in Germany . On 21 July 1940 , the just promoted Oberleutnant ( first lieutenant ) also became leader of 3 . Staffel , succeeding Major Henning <unk> . Although the fighting in the air grew increasingly difficult , Wick kept adding victories to his tally . He recorded his 20th victory on 24 August and added two more fighters a day later . This achievement earned Wick a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht ( his first of five in total ) , an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht . To be singled out individually in the Wehrmachtbericht was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations ' section of a soldier 's Service Record Book . Twenty aerial victories also made Wick eligible for the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) , a higher grade of the Iron Cross . Wick was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 August 1940 at Karinhall by Reichsmarschall ( Empire 's Marshal ) Hermann Göring . He was also interviewed by an Adler ( Eagle — the Luftwaffe weekly magazine ) journalist prior to the presentation . Several articles about Wick appeared at the time . Wick was granted four days of leave , which he spent with his family in Berlin . 
 Upon his return to France Wick was promoted to Hauptmann and on 9 September was named Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of I. Gruppe JG 2 . During September he continued adding to his score , and on 5 October gained his 41st combat victory on his way to overtake his two closest rivals , Major Adolf Galland and Oberstleutnant Mölders . The 41st victory earned him his second reference in the Wehrmachtbericht on 6 October 1940 . He also became the fourth member of the armed forces to receive the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) directly from Hitler at Berghof in Bavaria on 8 September 1940 . 
 Wick received orders in the late afternoon of 6 October to report to Reichsmarschall Göring in Berlin by 3 p.m. the following day . Due to bad weather , he chose to drive from Normandy to Berlin by car . Together with his wingman and friend , Rudolf Pflanz , Wick travelled all night and arrived at the Reich Air Ministry right on time to meet with Göring , Generalfeldmarschall ( Field Marshal ) Erhard Milch , Generaloberst ( Colonel General ) Ernst Udet , General der Flieger ( General of the Flyers ) Kurt Student and General der Flieger Karl <unk> . After the meeting in Berlin , Wick and Göring drove to Berchtesgaden in the Reichsmarschall 's personal train , where they arrived at 5 p.m. on 8 October for the official Oak Leaves presentation . Wick was then exposed by Otto Dietrich , the Third Reich 's Press Chief , to the international public at a press conference and presented as a " hero " . His performance left a predominantly negative impression , since Wick presented himself as a " busybody " ( Life Magazine ) , and made fun of his victims . 
 On 19 October 1940 , Wick was promoted to Major and appointed Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of Jagdgeschwader 27 ( JG 27 — 27th Fighter Wing ) . He had no ambition to leave his Gruppe in JG 2 " Richthofen " and , after giving the matter some thought , asked Göring to let him remain with his Gruppe instead . The next day Göring revoked his decision and gave Wick command of JG 2 " Richthofen " . At 25 years of age , he thus became the youngest Major and Geschwaderkommodore in the Luftwaffe . Major Wolfgang <unk> , who had commanded JG 2 since the beginning of September 1940 , was placed in command of JG 27 instead of Wick . 
 JG 2 " Richthofen " claimed its 500th aerial victory on 16 November 1940 , earning Wick another reference in the Wehrmachtbericht . To celebrate the 500th victory , Wick , the Gruppenkommandeure , all of the headquarters personnel , and the Staffelkapitäne went to Paris on 22 November — exactly one year after JG 2 's first aerial victory . They visited the show at " Casino de Paris " and dined at the " Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild " .

 Helmut Wick , accompanied by his Stabsschwarm — including Oberleutnant Rudolf Pflanz , Leutnant Franz <unk> and Oberleutnant Erich Leie — claimed his 55th aerial victory when he shot down a Spitfire on the afternoon of 28 November 1940 . His opponent could have been No. 602 Squadron 's Pilot Officer Archibald Lyall , who was reported killed in the engagement . This made Wick the highest @-@ scoring fighter pilot in the Luftwaffe , surpassing Mölders , whose score at the time stood at 54 victories . Returning from this mission to <unk> <unk> , Wick ordered the aircraft refueled and re @-@ armed . Together with Erich Leie as his wingman , Wick took off at 4 : 10 p.m. and returned to the vicinity of the Isle of Wight . Spotting a flight of Spitfires he climbed to intercept from a more favourable attack position . In a diving attack Wick shot down and killed Pilot Officer Paul A. Baillon , of No. 609 Squadron , flying Spitfire <unk> . 
 Shortly afterwards , around 5 p.m. , Wick 's Bf 109 E @-@ 4 ( Werknummer <unk> — factory number ) was shot down , probably by twelve – victory ace Flight Lieutenant John Dundas of No. 609 Squadron , though it is also possible that Wick fell victim to Pilot Officer Eric Marrs ; Polish pilot Zygmunt Klein of 234 Squadron may have also scored hits on Wick 's aircraft ; he was also shot down and killed during the battle . 
 Rudolf Pflanz saw a Spitfire shoot down a Bf 109 , whose pilot bailed out . Pflanz then shot down the Spitfire , which he observed to crash in the sea with its pilot still inside . 
 Only later did Pflanz find out that it was Wick he saw bailing out . Göring had ordered Kriegsmarine torpedo boats on a night @-@ long search @-@ and @-@ rescue mission for Wick . The next day , other naval vessels and the <unk> ( air @-@ sea rescue ) service , escorted by fighters of JG 2 , continued in vain to search for him . He was never found , however , and the Luftwaffe declared him missing in action , presumed dead , on 4 December 1940 , earning him his last reference in the daily Wehrmachtbericht . Wick , on his 168th combat mission , was the first Oak Leaves recipient to lose his life in combat . 
 = = Family = = 
 On 5 August 1939 , Wick married Ursel Rolfs ( 1916 – 1968 ) in Berlin . The marriage produced two children , Walter ( born in October 1939 ) and a girl , Sabine , born after Wick 's death , in February 1941 . On 23 January 1941 , Wick 's father received a telephone call from Karl <unk> at the Führer Headquarters that Helmut Wick had been rescued and taken prisoner of war . Apparently an official Reuters report had indicated that a 25 @-@ year @-@ old Luftwaffe Major , credited with 56 aerial victories , had been interned in a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp in Canada . Both Hitler and Göring initiated steps to get confirmation of the report . On 5 February 1941 , a telegram from Ottawa informed Ursel that Wick was not interned in Canada . Ursel married the military doctor , <unk> ( equivalent to captain ) Dr. Gerhard <unk> , later in the war .

 = Torreón massacre = 
 The Torreón massacre was a racially motivated massacre that took place on 13 – 15 May 1911 in the Mexican city of Torreón , Coahuila . Over 300 Chinese residents were killed by the revolutionary forces of Francisco I. Madero . A large number of Chinese homes and establishments were looted and destroyed . 
 Torreón was the last major city to be taken by the Maderistas during the Mexican Revolution . When the government forces withdrew , the rebels entered the city in the early morning and began a ten @-@ hour massacre of the Chinese community . The event touched off a diplomatic crisis between China and Mexico , with the former demanding 30 million pesos in reparation . At one point it was rumored that China had even dispatched a warship to Mexican waters ( the cruiser Hai Chi , which was anchored in Cuba at the time ) . An investigation into the massacre concluded that it was an unprovoked act of racial hatred . 
 = = Background = = 
 Chinese immigration to Mexico began as early as the 17th century , with a number settling in Mexico City . Immigration increased when Mexican president Porfirio Díaz attempted to encourage foreign investment and tourism to boost the country 's economy . The two countries signed a Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1899 ; over time , the Chinese expatriates began to establish profitable businesses such as wholesale and retail groceries . By 1910 , there were 13 @,@ 200 Chinese immigrants in the country , many living in Baja California , Chihuahua , Coahuila , Sinaloa , Sonora , and Yucatán . 
 Torreón was an attractive destination for immigrants at the turn of the nineteenth century . It was located at the intersection of two major railroads ( the Mexican Central Railway and the Mexican International Railroad ) and was proximate to the Nazas River , which irrigated the surrounding area , making it a suitable location for growing cotton . Chinese probably began to arrive in Torreón during the 1880s or 1890s , at the same time that other immigrants were first recorded as coming to the city . By about 1900 , 500 of the city 's 14 @,@ 000 residents were Chinese . The Chinese community was easily the largest and most notable group of immigrants in the city . By 1903 , it had formed the largest branch of the <unk> ( Protect the Emperor Society ) in Mexico . 
 Mexico was one of the countries visited by Kang Youwei after his exile from China . He had recently founded the China Reform Association to restore the Guangxu Emperor to power , and was visiting Chinese colonies worldwide to fund the Association . He arrived in 1906 , and purchased a few blocks of real estate in Torreón for 1 @,@ 700 pesos , later reselling it to Chinese immigrants for a profit of 3 @,@ 400 pesos . This investment spurred Kang to have the Association establish a bank in Torreón , which began selling stock and real estate to Chinese businessmen . The bank also built the city 's first tram line . Kang visited Torreón again in 1907 . It has been suggested that the city served as a test case for Chinese immigration to Mexico and Brazil , which Kang believed might solve overpopulation problems in the Chinese Pearl River Delta . Soon there were 600 Chinese living in the city . 
 In 1907 , a number of Mexican businessman gathered to form a chamber of commerce to protect their businesses from the foreigners . Instead of targeting Chinese specifically , they wrote : 
 We cannot compete against the foreigners in commercial ventures . The sad and lamentable fact is that the prostration of our national commerce has created a situation in which Mexicans are replaced by foreign individuals and companies , which monopolize our commerce and behave in the manner of conquerors in a conquered land . 
 Tensions and resentment of the Chinese ran high among the Mexican populace of Torreón , stemming from the immigrants ' prosperity and monopoly over the grocery trade . Nationwide resentment of the Chinese has also , conversely , been attributed to the fact that the Chinese represented a source of cheap @-@ labor which was central to the <unk> economic program . Therefore , opposing the Chinese was an indirect way to oppose the dictatorship . 
 Anti @-@ Chinese sentiments were apparent in the Independence Day speeches and demonstrations of 16 September 1910 . Over the next several weeks a number of Chinese establishments were vandalized .

 On 5 May 1911 ( Cinco de Mayo ) , a revolutionary leader , a bricklayer or stonemason named Jesús C. Flores , made a public speech in nearby Gómez Palacio , Durango , in which he claimed that the Chinese were putting Mexican women out of jobs , had monopolized the gardening and grocery businesses , were accumulating vast amounts of money to send back to China , and were " vying for the affection and companionship of local women . " He concluded by demanding that all people of Chinese origin be expelled from Mexico . One witness recalled him stating " that , therefore , it was necessary ... even a patriotic duty , to finish with them . " 
 The branch of the reform association in Torreón heard of Flores speech , and on 12 May the society 's secretary , Woo Lam Po ( also the manager of the bank ) circulated a letter in Chinese among the leaders of the community warning that there could be violence : 
 Brothers , attention ! Attention ! This is serious . Many unjust acts have happened during the revolution . Notice have [ sic ] been received that before 10 o 'clock today the revolutionists will unite their forces and attack the city . It is very probable that during the battle a mob will spring up and sack the stores . For this reason , we advise all our people , when the crowds assemble , to close your door and hide yourself and under no circumstances open your places for business or go outside to see the fighting . And if any of your stores are broken into , offer no resistance but allow them to take what they please , since otherwise you might endanger your lives . THIS IS <unk> . After the trouble is over we will try to arrange a settlement . 
 = = = Siege of Torreón = = = 
 On the morning of Saturday , 13 May , the forces of the Mexican Revolution led by Francisco I. Madero 's brother Emilio Madero attacked the city . Its railroads made it a key strategic point necessary to seizing complete control of the surrounding region : it was also the last major city to be targeted by the rebels . Madero and 4 @,@ 500 Maderistas surrounded the city , hemming in General Emiliano Lojero and his 670 Federales . They overran the Chinese gardens surrounding the city , killing 112 of the people working there . Chinese houses were used as fortifications for the advancing rebels , and the people living there were forced to prepare them food . The fighting continued until the Federales began to run low on munitions on Sunday evening . Lojero ordered a retreat , and his forces abandoned the city under cover of darkness between two and four in the morning on Monday , 15 May , during a heavy rainstorm . The retreat was so sudden that some troops were left behind during the evacuation . Before the rebels entered the city , witnesses reported that xenophobic speeches had been made to incense the accompanying mob against foreigners . Jesús Flores was present , and made a speech calling the Chinese " dangerous competitors " and concluded " that it would be best to exterminate them . " 
 = = = Massacre = = = 
 The rebel forces entered the city at six o 'clock , accompanied by a mob of over 4 @,@ 000 men , women , and children from Gómez Palacio Municipality , Viesca Municipality , San Pedro Municipality , <unk> Municipality , and Matamoros Municipality . They were joined by citizens of Torreón and began the sacking of the business district . The mob released prisoners from jail , looted stores , and attacked people on the street . They soon moved to the Chinese district . Men on horses drove Chinese from the gardens back into town , dragging them by their queues and shooting or trampling those who fell . Men , women , and children were killed indiscriminately when they fell in the way of the mob , and their bodies were robbed and mutilated . It was reported that " [ i ] n one instance the head of a Chinaman was severed from his body and thrown from the window into the street . In another instance a soldier took a little boy by the heels and battered his brains out against a lamp post . In many instances ropes were tied to the bodies of the <unk> and they were dragged through the streets by men on horseback . In another instance a Chinaman was pulled to pieces in the street by horses hitched to his arms and legs . " The mob finally reached the bank , where they killed the employees and hurled their severed body parts into the streets . A contemporary newspaper reported that " heads of the murdered Chinese were rolled along the streets , and their bodies were tied to the tails of horses . " 
 A number of residents made attempts to save the Chinese from the mob . Seventy immigrants were saved by a tailor who stood atop the roof of a building where they were hiding and misdirected the mob that was hunting for them . Eleven were saved by <unk> <unk> , the daughter of a <unk> leader , who told soldiers who wanted to take them from her home " that they could only enter the house over her dead body . " Another eight were saved by a second tailor , who stood in the rain in front of the laundry they worked at and lied to the rebels about their presence . 
 Ten hours after the massacre had begun , at around four o 'clock , Emilio Madero arrived in Torreón on horseback and issued a proclamation decreeing the death penalty for anyone who killed a Chinese . This ended the massacre . 
 = = = After the massacre = = = 
 Madero collected the surviving Chinese in a building and posted a hand @-@ picked group of soldiers to protect them . Dead Mexicans were buried in the city 's cemetery , but the bodies of the slain Chinese were stripped naked and buried together in a trench . 
 The same day as the massacre , Madero convened a military tribunal to hear testimony about the killings . The tribunal came to the conclusion that the Maderistas had " committed atrocities " , but the soldiers defended themselves by asserting that the Chinese had been armed and the massacre was an act of self @-@ defense . 
 Both the United States Consulate and the local Relief Committee began collecting donations from locals to support the Chinese . Between 17 May and 1 June , Dr. J. Lim and the Relief Committee collected over $ 6 @,@ 000 dollars which they distributed at a rate of $ 30 per day to provide food and shelter for the survivors .

 308 Asians were killed in the massacre ; 303 Chinese and 5 Japanese . According to the British Vice Consul in Gómez Palacio , the Japanese were killed " owing to the similarity of features " with the Chinese . It is estimated that the dead made up nearly one @-@ half of the Chinese population . 
 Among the dead were 50 employees of Sam Wah , both from his estate and his restaurant ; Wong Foon @-@ chuck lost 45 employees : 32 from his estate , nine from a railroad hotel that he operated , and four from his laundry ; and Ma Due lost 38 out of the 40 workers from his gardens . 25 employees of the bank were also killed . 
 Rebels , Federales , and bystanders were also killed ; according to contemporary reports , these included 25 Federales , 34 bystanders ( including 12 Spaniards and a German ) , and 26 Maderistas . Among the dead was Jesús Flores , apparently killed while attempting to free a machine gun abandoned by the government forces .

Almost 100 Chinese homes and businesses were destroyed in total . Also destroyed were a number of the Chinese @-@ owned gardens outside of town . In addition to businesses and commercial establishments , an unknown number of residential buildings were robbed and destroyed . An American consular agent named G. C. Carothers described the destruction in a June 7 report on the massacre : 
 Next we went to the Chinese Laundry were four had been killed , and the laundry practically demolished . Bombs had been thrown on the roof , the windows and doors either destroyed or stolen , the machinery broken to pieces and everything that could be carted away , stolen .... The Puerto de Shanghai building was next visited . All of the doors and windows of the building were destroyed . The Chinese Bank , which had been moved into this building a few months before , was demolished , safes blown open and contents taken , furniture destroyed , all papers and valuables stolen . 
 American , Arabian , German , Spanish , and Turkish establishments were also damaged and destroyed , but in contrast to the Chinese , U.S. properties were only dealt US $ 22 @,@ 000 ( $ 558 @,@ 721 today ) in damage . 
 Other properties destroyed included a casino , the city courthouse , the jail , the police headquarters , the Inferior Court , the Court of Letters , and the Municipal Treasury .

 A month afterward , the Chinese government hired American attorney Lebbeus <unk> to conduct an investigation into the massacre . <unk> owned a law firm in Mexico City , and had previously served as the United States Attorney General to the Philippines and as Judge of the United States Court in China . In June he dispatched his partner , Arthur Bassett , to carry out the investigation . 
 The same month , China demanded reparation from Mexico , seeking a payment 100 @,@ 000 pesos ( in 1911 money ) for each Chinese killed during the massacre , a total of over thirty million . The country also demanded an official apology from the Mexican government . 
 This was followed by a diplomatic crisis , when a rumor began to circulate that China had dispatched a gunboat carrying investigators to Mexican waters . The U.S. Ambassador to Mexico , Henry Lane Wilson , sent a telegram to Philander C. Knox , the Secretary of State , claiming that the Chinese gunboat Korea was en route for Mexico . Yuan Kwai , a Chinese diplomat in Washington , D.C. , sought the support of the United States Department of State . He was told that the U.S. would not approve the act , but would not make an attempt to halt it , either . Failing to get support from the U.S. , China announced that the rumor was false . Yuan Kwai stated that the cruiser Hai Chi might dock in Mexico after attending the coronation of George V in London . In the event , the Hai Chi docked in Cuba after visiting the United States and halted there while the diplomatic crisis played out , and did not go on to Mexico . 
 In July , U.S. consul George Carothers reported that a number of foreigners in Torreón had received letters telling them to leave the city . 
 Madero had ordered that the soldiers culpable for the killings be arrested and put on trial , and by 9 July 20 of the 35 under suspicion of connection with the massacre had been captured . 
 Arthur Bassett made his report to Chang Yin Tang , the Chinese Minister to Mexico , on 13 July , after conducting interviews with a number of Chinese and Mexican witnesses to the massacre . He concluded that the Maderistas ' claims ( that they had been fired on by the Chinese ) were false , citing the 12 May circular by the reform society . He also dismissed the claim that the immigrants had been armed by General Lojero and his retreating Federales , pointing out that the reason for the evacuation was a dearth of ammunition . Furthermore , no witnesses reported any form of resistance by the Chinese . In his report , he called the incident " an unprovoked massacre ... conceived in malice and race hatred " and concluded that it was a clear violation of the 1899 treaty between the two countries . 
 Bassett , in collaboration with <unk> King ( a representative for China ) and Antonio Ramos <unk> ( representing Mexican President Francisco León de la Barra ) , tendered a second report to Chang on 28 August , once again attempting to assess whether the Chinese themselves had prompted the massacre by resisting the <unk> troops . The editor of Diogenes , a local paper , stated that Lojero had " authorized him to deny all allegations " that he may have armed the Chinese . Upon further inquiry , the owners of local stores testified that they had not sold weapons to Chinese patrons before the massacre . The report concluded : 
 The contention that the Chinese offered resistance is pure fabrication , invented by the officers of the revolutionary army for the sole purpose of escaping the punishment which the commission of such a heinous crime would naturally entail upon them . 
 After failing to gain support from the United States , China reduced the demanded indemnity from thirty million to six million . However , it continued to demand an official apology , a guarantee of the safety of Chinese citizens in Mexico , and the punishment of the soldiers responsible for the massacre . 
 As the 1911 Mexican Independence Day approached , the foreign community in Torreón became restless , remembering the violence that had broken out at that time the previous year . To prevent another outbreak of violence , Francisco Madero sent 1 @,@ 000 troops to the city . 
 China and Mexico came to an agreement in November 1912 , and a treaty was signed wherein Mexico granted 3 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 pesos in damages to China and extended an official apology . The deadline for payment was later extended to 15 February 1913 . However , after the February 1913 assassination of Francisco Madero , Mexico entered a period of economic collapse . They proposed to pay China in bonds . The Dutch ambassador warned against it , believing that Mexico would be unable to obtain the foreign loans necessary for payment . 
 The Mexican Senate debated a number of ways to pay the indemnity through 1912 and 1913 , including considering payment in silver . However , the bonds were never approved , and reparation was never made .

 The massacre in Torreón was not the only instance of race violence against the Chinese during the revolution . In the first year alone , rebels and other Mexican citizens contributed to the deaths of some 324 Chinese . By 1919 , another 129 had been killed in Mexico City , and 373 in Piedras Negras . The persecution and violence against the Chinese in Mexico finally culminated in 1931 , with the expulsion of the remaining Chinese from Sonora .

 Lactarius blennius ( commonly known as the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap ) is a medium @-@ sized mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe , where it is mycorrhizal , favouring the European Beech ( though associations with other trees are known ) . It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries . Though its colour and size vary , it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk . It has been the subject of some chemical research , and it can be used to produce pigments and <unk> . <unk> , some of which have shown potential medical application , are derived from lactarane , a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius . The edibility of L. blennius is uncertain , with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible ( though not recommended ) , inedible or even poisonous .

 Lactarius blennius was first described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus blennius in 1815 , before being given its current binomial name by the same author in 1838 . Within the genus Lactarius , it is closely related to Lactarius cinereus , another Lactarius species that also favours beech . It has been suggested that the two species ( forming a group ) could have a coevolutionary pathway with beech . The specific epithet is derived from a Latin adjective blennius , meaning " slimy " . Lactarius mushrooms are commonly known as milkcaps , and L. blennius is known as the Slimy Milkcap or the Beech Milkcap . 
 Lactarius blennius is synonymous with Agaricus blennius ( the name under which Fries first described the species in 1815 ) and Agaricus viridis , a name given earlier by Heinrich Schrader , in 1794 . Galorrheus blennius ( a name proposed in 1871 by Paul Kummer ) , Lactarius viridis ( proposed in 1888 by Lucien Quélet ) and Lactifluus blennius ( proposed by Otto Kuntze in 1891 ) are also now recognised as synonyms . Lactarius <unk> was originally described as a form of L. blennius as Lactarius blennius f. <unk> by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1928 , before being classified as a separate species by J. Blum . Lange also described Lactarius blennius f. virescens , which is now recognised as nomen <unk> ( an invalid name ) . Lactarius <unk> is another species that has been included in L. blennius ; originally described in 1899 by Jean Louis Émile Boudier , in 1999 , German Joseph <unk> suggested that it is actually a variety of L. blennius , naming it Lactarius blennius var. <unk> . The situation with Lactarius viridis is similar ; first described as a separate species by Quélet in 1888 , A. Marchand proposed that it is in fact a variety of L. blennius , naming it Lactarius blennius var. viridis .
