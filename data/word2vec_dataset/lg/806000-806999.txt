 Cynicism is one of the most striking of all the Hellenistic philosophies . It offered people the possibility of happiness and freedom from suffering in an age of uncertainty . Although there was never an official Cynic doctrine , the fundamental principles of Cynicism can be summarised as follows : 
 The goal of life is <unk> and mental clarity or lucidity ( <unk> ) - freedom from smoke ( <unk> ) which signified ignorance , mindlessness , folly , and conceit . 
 <unk> is achieved by living in accord with Nature as understood by human reason . 
 Arrogance ( <unk> ) is caused by false judgments of value , which cause negative emotions , unnatural desires , and a vicious character . 
 <unk> , or human flourishing , depends on self @-@ sufficiency ( <unk> ) , equanimity , <unk> , love of humanity , <unk> and indifference to the vicissitudes of life ( <unk> ) . 
 One progresses towards flourishing and clarity through ascetic practices ( <unk> ) which help one become free from influences – such as wealth , fame , and power – that have no value in Nature . Examples include Diogenes ' practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter . 
 A Cynic practices shamelessness or impudence ( <unk> ) and defaces the <unk> of society ; the laws , customs , and social conventions which people take for granted . 
 Thus a Cynic has no property and rejects all conventional values of money , fame , power and reputation . A life lived according to nature requires only the bare necessities required for existence , and one can become free by <unk> oneself from any needs which are the result of convention . The Cynics adopted Heracles as their hero , as epitomizing the ideal Cynic . Heracles " was he who brought Cerberus , the hound of Hades , from the underworld , a point of special appeal to the dog @-@ man , Diogenes . " According to Lucian , " Cerberus and Cynic are surely related through the dog . " 
 The Cynic way of life required continuous training , not just in exercising judgments and mental impressions , but a physical training as well : 
 [ Diogenes ] used to say , that there were two kinds of exercise : that , namely , of the mind and that of the body ; and that the latter of these created in the mind such quick and agile impressions at the time of its performance , as very much facilitated the practice of virtue ; but that one was imperfect without the other , since the health and vigour necessary for the practice of what is good , depend equally on both mind and body . 
 None of this meant that a Cynic would retreat from society . Cynics were in fact to live in the full glare of the public 's gaze and be quite indifferent in the face of any insults which might result from their unconventional behaviour . The Cynics are said to have invented the idea of cosmopolitanism : when he was asked where he came from , Diogenes replied that he was " a citizen of the world , ( <unk> ) . " 
 The ideal Cynic would evangelise ; as the watchdog of humanity , they thought it their duty to hound people about the error of their ways . The example of the Cynic 's life ( and the use of the Cynic 's biting satire ) would dig up and expose the pretensions which lay at the root of everyday conventions . 
 Although Cynicism concentrated solely on ethics , Cynic philosophy had a major impact on the Hellenistic world , ultimately becoming an important influence for Stoicism . The Stoic Apollodorus writing in the 2nd century BC stated that " Cynicism is the short path to virtue . " 
 = = History of Cynicism = = 
 The classical Greek and Roman Cynics regarded virtue as the only necessity for happiness , and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it . Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness , thus , the title of Cynic , derived from the Greek word κύων ( meaning " dog " ) because they allegedly neglected society , hygiene , family , money , etc . , in a manner reminiscent of dogs . They sought to free themselves from conventions ; become self @-@ sufficient ; and live only in accordance with nature . They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money , power , and fame , to lead entirely virtuous , and thus happy , lives . 
 The ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values , and would criticise the types of behaviours , such as greed , which they viewed as causing suffering . Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , to the modern understanding of cynicism as " an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity , especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others . " This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy , which emphasized " virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire . " 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Various philosophers , such as the Pythagoreans , had advocated simple living in the centuries preceding the Cynics . In the early 6th century BC , <unk> , a Scythian sage , had combined plain living together with criticisms of Greek customs in a manner which would become standard among the Cynics . Perhaps of importance were tales of Indian philosophers , known to later Greeks as the gymnosophists , who had adopted a strict asceticism together with a disrespect for established laws and customs . By the 5th century BC , the sophists had begun a process of questioning many aspects of Greek society such as religion , law and ethics . However , the most immediate influence for the Cynic school was Socrates . Although he was not an ascetic , he did profess a love of virtue and an indifference to wealth , together with a disdain for general opinion . These aspects of Socrates ' thought , which formed only a minor part of Plato 's philosophy , became the central inspiration for another of Socrates ' pupils , Antisthenes . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Cynics were often recognized in the ancient world by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff . The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress , while the staff was to the club of Heracles . These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy . 
 In the social evolution from the archaic age to the classical , the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis . Originally it was expected that one carried a sword while in the city ; However , a transition to spears , and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom . Thus , the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself . According to modern theorists , the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user ’ s dissociation from physical labour , that is , as a display of conspicuous leisure , and at the same time it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing . Thus , it displays active and warlike qualities , rather than being a symbol of a weak man ’ s need to support himself . The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure , but , just as equivalent , was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher . 
 = = = Antisthenes = = = 
 The story of Cynicism traditionally begins with Antisthenes ( c . 445 – 365 BC ) , who was an older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates . At about 25 years his junior , Antisthenes was one of the most important of Socrates ' disciples . Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism , his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism . In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by Diogenes Laërtius , writings on language , dialogue and literature far outnumber those on ethics or politics , although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time . It is certainly true that Antisthenes preached a life of poverty : 
 I have enough to eat till my hunger is stayed , to drink till my thirst is sated ; to clothe myself as well ; and out of doors not [ even ] Callias there , with all his riches , is more safe than I from shivering ; and when I find myself indoors , what warmer shirting do I need than my bare walls ? 
 = = = Diogenes of Sinope = = = 
 Diogenes of Sinope ( c . 412 – 323 BC ) dominates the story of Cynicism like no other figure . He originally went to Athens , fleeing his home city , after he and his father , who was in charge of the mint at Sinope , got into trouble for falsifying the coinage . ( The phrase " defacing the currency " later became proverbial in describing Diogenes ' rejection of conventional values . ) Later tradition claimed that Diogenes became the disciple of Antisthenes , but it is by no means certain that they ever met . Diogenes did however adopt Antisthenes ' teachings and the ascetic way of life , pursuing a life of self @-@ sufficiency ( <unk> ) , austerity ( <unk> ) , and shamelessness ( <unk> ) . There are many anecdotes about his extreme asceticism ( sleeping in a tub ) , his shameless behaviour ( eating raw meat ) , and his criticism of conventional society ( " bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters " ) , and although it is impossible to tell which of these stories are true , they do illustrate the broad character of the man , including an ethical seriousness . 
 = = = Crates of Thebes = = = 
 Crates of Thebes ( c . 365 – c . 285 BC ) is the third figure who dominates Cynic history . He is notable because he renounced a large fortune to live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens . He is said to have been a pupil of Diogenes , but again this is uncertain . Crates married <unk> of Maroneia after she had fallen in love with him and together they lived like beggars on the streets of Athens , where Crates was treated with respect . Crates ' later fame ( apart from his unconventional lifestyle ) lies in the fact that he became the teacher of Zeno of Citium , the founder of Stoicism . The Cynic strain to be found in early Stoicism ( such as Zeno 's own radical views on sexual equality spelled out in his Republic ) can be ascribed to Crates ' influence . 
 = = = Other Cynics = = = 
 There were many other Cynics in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC , including Onesicritus ( who sailed with Alexander the Great to India ) , and the moral satirists Bion of <unk> and Menippus of <unk> . However , with the rise of Stoicism in the 3rd century BC , Cynicism as a serious philosophical activity underwent a decline , and it is not until the Roman era that Cynicism underwent a revival . 
 = = Cynicism in the Roman world = = 
 There is little record of Cynicism in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC ; Cicero ( c . 50 BC ) , who was much interested in Greek philosophy , had little to say about Cynicism , except that " it is to be shunned ; for it is opposed to modesty , without which there can be neither right nor honor . " However , by the 1st century AD , Cynicism reappeared with full force . The rise of Imperial Rome , like the Greek loss of independence under Philip and Alexander three centuries earlier , may have led to a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people , which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self @-@ sufficiency and inner @-@ happiness to flourish once again . Cynics could be found throughout the empire , standing on street corners , preaching about virtue . Lucian complained that " every city is filled with such upstarts , particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes , Antisthenes , and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog , " and Aelius Aristides observed that " they frequent the doorways , talking more to the <unk> than to the masters , making up for their lowly condition by using impudence . " The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century AD was Demetrius , whom Seneca praised as " a man of consummate wisdom , though he himself denied it , constant to the principles which he professed , of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects . " Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and the ideal of the thinker . In the 2nd century AD , Lucian , whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus , nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher , <unk> , in a dialogue . 
 Cynicism came to be seen as an idealised form of Stoicism , a view which led Epictetus to eulogise the ideal Cynic in a lengthy discourse . According to Epictetus , the ideal Cynic " must know that he is sent as a messenger from Zeus to people concerning good and bad things , to show them that they have wandered . " Unfortunately for Epictetus , many Cynics of the era did not live up to the ideal : " consider the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables , and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in breaking wind . " 
 Unlike Stoicism , which declined as an independent philosophy after the 2nd century AD , Cynicism seems to have thrived into the 4th century . The emperor , Julian ( ruled 361 – 363 ) , like Epictetus , praised the ideal Cynic and complained about the actual practitioners of Cynicism . 
 The final Cynic noted in classical history is Sallustius of Emesa in the late 5th century . A student of the Neoplatonic philosopher Isidore of Alexandria , he devoted himself to living a life of Cynic asceticism .

 Some historians have noted the similarities between the teachings of Jesus and those of the Cynics . Some scholars have argued that the Q document , a hypothetical common source for the gospels of Matthew and Luke , has strong similarities to the teachings of the Cynics . Scholars on the quest for the historical Jesus , such as Burton L. Mack and John Dominic Crossan of the Jesus Seminar , have argued that 1st century AD Galilee was a world in which Hellenistic ideas collided with Jewish thought and traditions . The city of <unk> , only a day 's walk from Nazareth , was particularly notable as a centre of Cynic philosophy , and Mack has described Jesus as a " rather normal Cynic @-@ type figure . " For Crossan , Jesus was more like a Cynic sage from a Hellenistic Jewish tradition than either a Christ who would die as a substitute for sinners or a messiah who wanted to establish an independent Jewish state of Israel . Other scholars doubt that Jesus was deeply influenced by the Cynics , and see the Jewish prophetic tradition as of much greater importance . 
 = = = Cynic influences on early Christianity = = = 
 Many of the ascetic practices of Cynicism may have been adopted by early Christians , and Christians often employed the same rhetorical methods as the cynics . Some cynics were martyred for speaking out against the authorities . One cynic , Peregrinus Proteus , lived for a time as a Christian before converting to cynicism , whereas in the 4th century , Maximus of Alexandria , although a Christian , was also called a Cynic because of his ascetic lifestyle . Christian writers would often praise Cynic poverty , although they scorned Cynic shamelessness : Augustine stating that they had , " in violation of the modest instincts of men , boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion , worthy indeed of dogs . " The ascetic orders of Christianity also had direct connection with the Cynics , as can be seen in the wandering mendicant monks of the early church who in outward appearance , and in many of their practices differed little from the Cynics of an earlier age . 
 = Underwater camouflage = 
 Underwater camouflage is the set of methods of achieving crypsis — avoidance of observation — that allows otherwise visible aquatic organisms to remain unnoticed by other organisms such as predators or prey . 
 Camouflage in large bodies of water differs markedly from camouflage on land . The environment is essentially the same on all sides . Light always falls from above , and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes . Three main camouflage methods predominate in water : transparency , reflection , and counter @-@ illumination . Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean ; counter @-@ illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres ; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres . 
 Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage , where additional methods are used by many animals . For example , self @-@ decoration is employed by decorator crabs ; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon ; countershading by many fish including sharks ; distraction with eyespots by many fish ; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder , and cephalopods including octopus , cuttlefish , and squid . 
 = = Context = = 
 The ability to camouflage oneself provides a survival advantage in the constant struggle between predators and prey . Natural selection has produced a wide variety of methods of survival in the oceans . 
 In Ancient Greece , Aristotle commented on the color @-@ changing abilities , both for camouflage and for signalling , of cephalopods including the octopus , in his Historia animalium : 
 The octopus ... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it ; it does so also when alarmed . 
 = = Methods = = 
 Three main camouflage methods predominate in the oceans : transparency , reflection , and counterillumination . Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean ; counterillumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres ; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres . Most animals of the open sea use at least one of these methods to camouflage themselves . Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage , where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups . These methods of camouflage are described in turn below . 
 = = = Transparency = = = 
 Transparency is common , even dominant , in animals of the open sea , especially those that live in relatively shallow waters . It is found in plankton of many species , as well as larger animals such as jellyfish , salps ( floating tunicates ) , and comb jellies . Many marine animals that float near the surface are highly transparent , giving them almost perfect camouflage . However , transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different refractive indices from seawater . Some marine animals such as jellyfish have gelatinous bodies , composed mainly of water ; their thick <unk> is acellular and highly transparent . This conveniently makes them buoyant , but it also makes them large for their muscle mass , so they cannot swim fast . Gelatinous planktonic animals are between 50 and 90 per cent transparent . A transparency of 50 per cent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as cod at a depth of 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) ; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water , where the light is brighter and predators can see better . For example , a cod can see prey that are 98 per cent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water . Therefore , transparency is most effective in deeper waters . 
 Some tissues such as muscles can be made transparent , provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light . Familiar examples of transparent body parts are the lens and cornea of the vertebrate eye . The lens is made of the protein crystallin ; the cornea is made of the protein collagen . Other structures cannot be made transparent , notably the retinas or equivalent light @-@ absorbing structures of eyes — they must absorb light to be able to function . The camera @-@ type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque . Finally , some structures are visible for a reason , such as to lure prey . For example , the nematocysts ( stinging cells ) of the transparent siphonophore <unk> <unk> resemble small copepods . Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of larvae , including <unk> , siphonophores , salps ( floating tunicates ) , gastropod molluscs , polychaete worms , many shrimplike crustaceans , and fish ; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented , resembling the seabed or shores where they live . Adult comb jellies and jellyfish are mainly transparent , like their watery background . The small Amazon river fish <unk> <unk> and the shrimps it associates with , <unk> <unk> , are so transparent as to be " almost invisible " ; further , these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled ( disruptively patterned ) according to the local background in the environment . 
 = = = Reflection = = = 
 Many fish are covered with highly reflective scales , giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass . Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea , especially those that live in the top 100 metres . Where transparency cannot be achieved , it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal 's body highly reflective . At medium depths at sea , light comes from above , so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side . Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering . 
 The marine hatchetfish is extremely flattened laterally ( side to side ) , leaving the body just millimetres thick , and the body is so silvery as to resemble aluminium foil . The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide structural coloration : stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection . In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in , only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected , so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage . 
 In fish such as the herring which live in shallower water , the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths , and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings . A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross @-@ section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin , as they would fail to reflect horizontally . The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors , all oriented vertically . Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish . The cephalopods , including squid , octopus and cuttlefish , have multi @-@ layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine . 
 = = = Counter @-@ illumination = = = 
 Counter @-@ illumination through bioluminescence on the underside ( ventral region ) of the body is found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres . The generated light increases an animal 's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface ; it is an effective form of active camouflage . It is notably used by some species of squid , such as the midwater squid , <unk> <unk> . These have light @-@ producing organs ( photophores ) scattered all over their undersides , creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below . Counter @-@ illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms , though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling . 
 = = = Countershading = = = 
 Top / bottom countershading is common in fish including sharks , marlin , and mackerel , and animals in other groups such as dolphins , turtles and penguins . These animals have dark upper sides to match the ocean depths , and light undersides to avoid appearing dark against the bright sea surface . 
 = = = Mimesis = = = 
 Mimesis is practised by animals such as the leafy sea dragon , <unk> eques , and the leaf scorpionfish , <unk> <unk> , which resemble parts of plants , and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current . In the fish species <unk> <unk> , the <unk> or dragon wrasse , there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles . A juvenile <unk> resembles a loose piece of sea weed . It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards , and behaves in a way that perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed : moving back and forth in the surge , as if it was inanimate . 
 = = = Self @-@ decoration = = = 
 Self @-@ decoration is employed by animals in different groups , including decorator crabs , which attach materials from their environment , as well as living organisms , to camouflage themselves . For example , the Japanese hermit crab , <unk> <unk> , has the hydroid <unk> <unk> growing all over the shell that it lives in . Another hermit crab , <unk> <unk> , has the aposematic orange sponge <unk> <unk> which is bitter @-@ tasting and not eaten by fish . 
 Similarly , sea urchins use their tube feet to pick up debris from the bottom and attach it to their upper surfaces . They use shells , rocks , algae and sometimes sea anemones . 
 = = = Distraction = = = 
 Many fish have eyespots near their tails to distract attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye . For example , Chaetodon capistratus has both a ( disruptive ) eyestripe to conceal the eye , and a large eyespot near its tail , giving the impression that the head is at the tail end of the body . 
 = = = Disruption of outlines = = = 
 Fish such as <unk> <unk> have bold disruptive patterns on their sides , breaking up their outlines with strong contrasts . Fish like <unk> <unk> have similar bands of colour that extend into fins projecting far from the body , distracting attention from the true shape of the fish . 
 Some fish which mimic seaweeds such as the <unk> <unk> marmoratus and <unk> <unk> have elaborate projections and spines which are combined with complex disruptive coloration . These have the effect of destroying the signature " fish " outline of these animals , as well as helping them to appear as pieces of algae . 
 = = = Adaptive coloration = = = 
 A variety of marine animals possess active camouflage through their ability to change colour rapidly . Several bottom @-@ living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds . Many cephalopods including octopus , cuttlefish , and squid similarly use colour change , in their case both for camouflage and signalling . For example , the big blue octopus , Octopus cyanea , hunts during the day , and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings , both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey . It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside . When necessary , in order to scare away a potential predator , it can display markings which resemble eyes . 
 Like all flounders , Peacock flounders , <unk> mancus , have excellent adaptive camouflage . They use cryptic coloration to avoid being detected by both prey and predators . Whenever possible rather than swim , they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background . In a study , some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds . They were able to match the pattern of <unk> that they were placed on . Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder 's vision and hormones . If one of the fish 's eyes is damaged , or covered by the sand , the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings . Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators , it buries itself into the sand , leaving only the eyes protruding . 
 = Sophiatown = 
 Sophiatown / <unk> / , also known as <unk> <unk> or <unk> , is a suburb of Johannesburg , South Africa . Sophiatown was a legendary black cultural hub that was destroyed under apartheid , rebuilt under the name of Triomf , and in 2006 officially returned to its original name . Sophiatown was one of the oldest black areas in Johannesburg and its destruction represents some of the excesses of South Africa under apartheid . Despite the violence and poverty , it was the epicentre of politics , jazz and blues during the 1940s and 1950s . It produced some of South Africa 's most famous writers , musicians , politicians and artists . 
 = = History = = 
 Sophiatown was originally part of the Waterfall farm . Over time it included the neighbouring areas of Martindale and <unk> . It was purchased by a speculator , Hermann <unk> , in 1897 . He acquired 237 acres four miles or so west of the centre of Johannesburg . The private leasehold township was surveyed in 1903 and divided into almost 1700 small stands . The township was named after <unk> 's wife , Sophia , and some of the streets were named after his children Toby , Gerty , Bertha and Victoria . Before the enactment of the Natives Land Act , 1913 , black South Africans had freehold rights , and they bought properties in the suburb . The distance from the city centre was seen as disadvantageous and after the City of Johannesburg built a sewage plant nearby , the area seemed even less attractive . Because of these and other reasons most of the whites had moved out by 1920 , leaving behind a vibrant multi @-@ racial community . By the late 1940s Sophiatown had a population of nearly 54 000 Black Africans , 3 000 Coloureds , 1 500 Indians and 686 Chinese . 
 = = = Forced removals = = = 
 As neighbouring white working @-@ class areas , such as Westdene and Newlands , developed adjacent to Sophiatown , the perception arose that the suburb was too close to white suburbia . From 1944 onwards , the Johannesburg City Council planned to move the black population out of the Western Areas , including Sophiatown . After the election victory of the National Party in 1948 , relocation plans were debated at the level of national politics . Under the Immorality Amendment Act , No 21 of 1950 , people of mixed races could not reside together , which made it possible for the government to segregate the different races . 
 When the removals scheme was promulgated , Sophiatown residents united to protest against the forced removals , creating the slogan " Ons <unk> nie , ons <unk> hier " ( we won 't move ) . Father Trevor Huddleston , Nelson Mandela , Helen Joseph and Ruth First played an important role by becoming involved in the resistance . On 9 February 1955 , 2 000 policemen , armed with handguns , rifles and clubs known as <unk> , forcefully moved the black families of Sophiatown to Meadowlands , Soweto . Other ethnic groups were also moved : Coloured people moved to Eldorado Park in the south of Johannesburg ; the Indian community moved to <unk> ; and the Chinese people moved to central Johannesburg . Over the next eight years Sophiatown was flattened and removed from the maps of Johannesburg . 
 = = = Triomf = = = 
 After the forced removals and demolition , carried out under the Natives Resettlement Act of 1954 , the area was rezoned for whites only and renamed ' Triomf — Afrikaans for Triumph — by the government . The social engineers of apartheid tried to create a suburb for the white working class . In the end it turned out that Triomf became a suburb mainly for poor white Afrikaners . This just showed how apartheid failed even those it was ideologically designed to benefit .

 The Johannesburg City Council took the decision in 1997 to re @-@ instate the old name Sophiatown for the suburb . On Saturday , 11 February 2006 , the process finally came to fruition when Mayor Amos <unk> reverted the name of Triomf back to Sophiatown . 
 = = Geography and geology = = 
 Sophiatown is located on one of Johannesburg 's ridges called Melville Koppies . Melville Koppies lies on the <unk> craton , which dates from three billion years ago . The Koppies lie at the base of lithified sediments in the form of conglomerate , quartzite , shale , and siltstone . It represents the first sea shores and shallow beds of an ancient sea . It also forms part of the lowest level of one of the world 's most well known geological features , the Witwatersrand Supergroup . Several fairly narrow layers of gravel , deposited quite late in the sequence , and bearing heavy elements , made the Witwatersrand Supergroup famous . These are the gold @-@ bearing conglomerates of the main reefs . Melville Koppies represents in microcosm most of the features of the Witwatersrand Supergroup . What it does not have is gold @-@ bearing rock . The gold occurs millions of years later , and several kilometres higher up , in the sequence . 
 The Melville Koppies Nature Reserve is a Johannesburg City Heritage Site . In the last 1 000 years , Iron Age immigrants arrived and remains of their kraal walls can be found in the area . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Early life in Sophiatown = = = 
 Sophiatown , unlike other townships in South Africa , was a freehold township , which meant that it was one of the rare places in South African urban areas where blacks were allowed to own land . This was land that never belonged to the Johannesburg municipality , and so it never developed the form of municipal " matchbox " houses , built row upon row , with the same uniformity and lack of character . The houses were built according to people 's ability to pay , tastes , and cultural background . Some houses were built of brick and had four or more rooms ; some were much smaller . Others were built like homes in the rural areas ; others still were single room shacks put together with corrugated iron and scrap sheet metal . The majority of the families living in Sophiatown were tenants and sub @-@ tenants . Eight or nine people lived in a single room and the houses hid backyards full of shanties built of cardboard and flattened kerosene cans , since many Black property owners in Sophiatown were poor . In order to pay back the mortgages on their properties , they had to take in paying tenants . 
 Sophiatown residents had a determination to construct a respectable lifestyle in the shadow of a state that was actively hostile to such ambitions . A respectable lifestyle rested on the three pillars of religious devotion , reverence for formal education and a desire for law and order . 
 People struggled to survive together , and a rich culture based on shebeens ( informal and mostly illegal pubs ) , <unk> music and beer @-@ brewing developed . The shebeens were one of the main forms of entertainment . People came to the shebeens not only for <unk> or <unk> ( illegally self @-@ made alcoholic beverages ) , but to talk about their daily worries , their political ideas and their fears and hopes . In these shebeens the politicians tried to influence others and get them to conform to their form of thinking . If one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a police informer . 
 These two conflicting images of Sophiatown stand side by side - the romantic vision of a unique community juxtaposed with a seedy and violent township with dangers lurking at every corner . 
 = = = Arts and literature = = = 
 The cultural process was somehow intensified in Sophiatown , as in Soho , the Greenwich Village , the Quartier Latin or Kreuzberg . It was akin to what Harlem was to New York in the 1920s Harlem Renaissance and is sometimes referred to as the Sophiatown renaissance . 
 The musical King Kong , sponsored by the Union of South African Artists , is described as the ultimate achievement and final flowering of Sophiatown multi @-@ racial cultural exploits in the 1950s . King Kong was a Sophiatown legend who gained popularity as a famous boxer , notorious extrovert , a bum and a brawler . The King Kong musical depicted the street life , the illicit shebeens , the violence , and something approximating the music of the township : jazz , penny whistles and the work songs of the black miners . When King Kong premiered in Johannesburg , Miriam Makeba the vocalist of the Manhattan Brothers , played in the female lead role . The musical later went to London 's West End for two years . 
 One of the boys , Hugh Masekela at St Peter 's School , told Father Huddleston of his discovery of the music of Louis Armstrong . Huddleston found a trumpet for him and as the interest in making music caught on among the other boys , the Huddleston Jazz Band was formed . Hugh Masekela did not stay very long in Sophiatown . He was in the orchestra of King Kong and then made his own international reputation . 
 Images of Sophiatown were initially built up in literature by a generation of South African writers : Can Themba , Bloke Modisane , Es <unk> <unk> , Arthur Maimane , Todd <unk> , Nat <unk> , Casey <unk> and Lewis Nkosi who all lived in Sophiatown at various stages during the 1950s . They all shared certain elements of a common experience : education at St Peter 's School and Fort Hare University , living in Sophiatown , working for Drum magazine , exile , banning under the Suppression of Communism Act and for many the writing of an autobiography . 
 Later , images of Sophiatown could be found in Nadine Gordimer 's novels , Miriam Makeba 's ghostwritten autobiography and Trevor Huddleston 's <unk> for your comfort . 
 Marlene van Niekerk 's novel Triomf focuses on the suburb Triomf and recounts the monotonous daily lives of a family of poor white Afrikaners . The book has been turned into a movie also called " Triomf " , which won the Best South African Movie award in 2008 . 
 = = = Crime and gangsterism = = = 
 Crime and violence were a reality of urban life and culture in Sophiatown . The poverty , misery , violence and lawlessness of the city led to the growth of many gangs . Sections of society frowned on gangsterism as anti @-@ social behaviour and gangsters like <unk> and Don Mattera were despised by many as " anti social " . 
 After the Second World War , there was a large increase in the number of gangs in Sophiatown . Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20 000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs . Township youths were unable to find jobs easily . Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience , and many of them were not able to read or write . They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak . 
 In Johannesburg in the 1950s , crime was a day @-@ to @-@ day reality , and Sophiatown was the nucleus of all reef crimes . Gangsters were city @-@ bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English , known as <unk> . Some of the more well @-@ known gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians , the Americans , the Gestapo , the Berliners and the Vultures . The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler , whom they saw as some kind of hero , for taking on the whites of Europe . The best known gang from this period , and also best studied , was the Russians . They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together in the absence of any effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state . The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the <unk> and from other gangs of migrant workers , and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women , jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment . 
 One of the more successful community campaigns emerged in the early 1950s when informal policing initiatives known as the Civic Guards were mobilized to combat rising crime . This attempt to restore law and order attracted widespread support prior to a series of bloody clashes with the migrant criminal society from the poorer enclave of <unk> . This provided the state with an excuse to ban the Guard groups which they eyed with suspicion because of their ANC and Communist Party connections . These supposed arbiters of law and order engaged in a series of brutal street battles with members of the " Russians " gang in the early 1950s . 
 The representation of gangsters in the literature ( Drum magazine ) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s . The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks . The second is almost a complete turn @-@ around from the first , as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors who are able to achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks . The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the <unk> culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown . 
 = = Landmarks = = 
 = = = The Church of Christ the King = = = 
 One of the few tangible reminders of the old Sophiatown is the Anglican Church of Christ the King in Ray Street . The architect was Frank Flemming , who designed 85 churches throughout South Africa . The church was constructed in 1933 . The bell tower was added in 1936 . So little money was made available for the construction that the architect called it a " Holy Barn " . The church 's distinctive feature was a mural that is no longer visible . It was painted between 1939 and 1941 by Sister Margaret . The church was an icon of the liberation struggle in South Africa . In 1940 Trevor Huddleston was appointed Rector . He was an outspoken opponent of apartheid . In 1955 during the forced removals , Huddleston was recalled to England . His ashes reside next to his former church . On the north @-@ eastern side of the church there is a mural depicting Huddleston walking the dusty streets of Sophiatown . This mural was painted by 12 apprentice students under patronage of the Gerard <unk> Foundation . It shows two children tugging at his cassock as well as <unk> 's famous yellow houses . The entire Sophiatown community was removed by the end of 1963 ; the church was deconsecrated in 1964 and sold to the Department of Community Development in 1967 . In the 1970s it was bought by the <unk> Hervormde Kerk , which used it for Sunday School . The church changed hands again and the <unk> <unk> Kerk bought the building and altered it significantly . The nave was enclosed , a large font was built and wooden panelling and false organ pipes changed the look of the interior . In 1997 the Anglicans bought the church back and it was reconsecrated ; the changes were reversed and the building was largely restored to its former self . However , the hall and gallery the <unk> <unk> Kerk had built were retained . 
 = = = Dr A.B. Xuma 's house = = = 
 Dr A.B. Xuma was a medical doctor who had trained in the United States and the United Kingdom . He was a local celebrity , President of the African National Congress and Chairperson of the Western Areas Anti @-@ <unk> and Proper Housing Committee . His house was a landmark in Sophiatown ( 73 Toby Street ) and was declared a National Heritage Monument on 11 February 2006 . Currently the house is the location of the Sophiatown Heritage and Cultural Centre . This is one of two houses to escape the destruction of Sophiatown by the government in the late 1950s . It was built in 1935 and named <unk> . Xuma and his second wife <unk> Hall Xuma lived there until 1959 . The writer , actor and journalist Bloke Modisane , reminisces that among all those modest rundown buildings , could stand the palatial home of Dr A.B. Xuma with its two garages . Modisane remembers how he and his widowed mother , who ran a <unk> , had looked to Xuma and his house for a model of the good life , i.e. separate bedrooms , a room for sitting , another for eating , and a room to be alone , for reading or thinking , to shut out South Africa and not be black . 
 = = = Good Street = = = 
 Good Street was significant in the life of Sophiatown . It was described as a " Street of <unk> " . The writer Can Themba 's house , called the House of Truth , was on Good Street , as well as Fatty Phyllis Peterson 's 39 Steps . To get to the 39 Steps , one had to walk up a flight of steps , which looked by all accounts very dingy . One was then met by Fatty who sold about every type of drink : whisky , brandy , gin , beer , wine , etc . Sometimes she even supplied cigars . Good Street was also renowned for its Indian , Chinese and Jewish shops , and for being a street of criminals and gangsters . 
 = = = St Joseph 's Home for Children = = = 
 The Home opened its doors in 1923 . It was built as a diocesan memorial to the Coloured men who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country . It was run by the Anglican Nuns , the Order of St Margaret , East Grinstead who remained in charge until 1978 when they left South Africa in protest against apartheid . The Main Block , Boys ' House and Priests ' House were designed by the diocesan architect <unk> Flemming . The Church successfully opposed removal of the Home because the property was on farm land and not part of a proclaimed township . 
 = = = The Odin Cinema = = = 
 There were two cinemas in Sophiatown . The larger was the Odin which at the time was also the largest in Africa and could seat 1 200 people . The other cinema , <unk> 's , was the lower class , rougher movie @-@ house while the Odin Cinema was more up @-@ market . The Odin was the pride of Sophiatown . It was owned by a white couple , the <unk> , who were known as Mr and Mrs Odin . Not only did they provide much loved entertainment , but also made the Odin available for political meetings , parties and stage performances . Some international acts played to multi @-@ racial audiences at the Odin . It was also the site of a series of " Jazz at the Odin " jam sessions featuring white and black musicians . Also at a meeting at the Odin , the ultimately unsuccessful resistance to the destruction of Sophiatown began to coalesce . 
 = = = Freedom Square = = = 
 Freedom Square was located on the corner of Victoria and Morris Streets . It was famous in the 1950s for the political meetings held there . It was utilised by the African National Congress ( ANC ) and the Transvaal Congress Party . Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston . Freedom Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties . Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime . Freedom Square in Sophiatown should not be confused with Freedom Square in <unk> , Soweto , where the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC in 1955 . It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change . This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of the ANC . Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside the Christ the King Church . 
 = = = St Cyprian 's Missions School = = = 
 This primary school was the site of religious and educational significance in Sophiatown . It was an Anglican Mission school located in Meyer Street and was established in 1928 . St Cyprian 's was the largest primary school in Sophiatown . Oliver Tambo and Trevor Huddleston taught here , as both were passionate about education . It was also the St Cyprian 's School boys who a dug out the pool behind the house of the Community of the Resurrection in order to have a swimming pool . The school boys of St Cyprian 's later went to Father Ross or Father Raynes or Father Huddleston who tried to get them bursaries to go to St Peter 's School , then Fort Hare University and later even the University of the Witwatersrand . The idea was that they should come back as doctors .

 The tree gained a sinister reputation as the " Hanging Tree " when two people hanged themselves from its branches , both due to being subjected to the forced removals .

 " Show Me the Monkey " was co @-@ written by John Enbom and Robert Hull and directed by Nick Marck , marking Enbom 's thirteenth writing credit and Hull 's first writing credit for the show . As a joke in the episode 's script , Enbom and Hull added the name of the lab worker who stole the monkey as " Gil Thomas Pardy " , although his name is not mentioned directly in the episode . A condensed version of this name , Gil T. Pardy , is an intentional pun on " guilty party " . The character of rock star Ed Argent was initially supposed to be a cameo appearance from musician Ted Nugent , but when he did not appear on the show due to scheduling conflicts , the writers changed the character 's name in order to make it a reference to the band Argent , best known for their song " Hold Your Head Up " . 
 The stolen capuchin monkey named Oscar is played by live animal actor Katie , best known for playing Marcel , Ross Geller 's pet monkey , on the sitcom Friends . Near the time of the episode 's airing , she had also appeared in Bruce Almighty and an episode of 30 Rock . When the episode 's editor first received one take of the scene in which Veronica and Mac sarcastically dance in response to accusations of doing a poor job on a school project , the editor called the writing staff into the editing room ; they proceeded to view the scene fifteen times because of its humorous nature . They immediately included the take in the final cut of the episode .

 In its original United States broadcast , " Show Me the Monkey " received 3 @.@ 23 million viewers , marking a decrease in viewers from " Spit & Eggs " and ranking 92nd of 103 in the weekly rankings . 
 The episode received positive reviews from television critics . Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 @.@ 2 out of 10 , indicating that it was " great " . Writing that it was entertaining and developed the plot well , he also lauded Mac 's reappearance and her new love interest , opining that it created some interesting character moments for Mac . He was also pleased that the episode " ultimately ended on an optimistic note for Mac and her potential new guy . " However , he thought that the episode , as well as the show in general , could not handle controversial issues such as animal testing delicately . Keith McDuffee of AOL TV gave mixed opinions on the development of the show 's romantic relationships in the episode ; he commented , " And as for Piz trying to woo Veronica a bit , I actually found myself saying " thank God " when [ Veronica ] was at Logan 's door later in the episode . " He compared Piz negatively to Logan at the beginning of the first season , and stated that " alas , Piz will have his chance again soon . " Television Without Pity graded the episode an " A " . 
 Rowan Kaiser , writing for The A.V. Club , praised the episode , arguing that " this is one of the few episodes so far that is both satisfying on its own and uses the higher education setting as a strength , instead of fighting it as a weakness . " He praised the episode 's treatment of the animal rights group as well as Mac 's prominent role . He also lauded Keith 's investigation into the dean 's death , particularly the scene in which he encounters Veronica 's criminology professor in a bar , which Kaiser described as " Keith discovering someone who may well be a match for him intellectually . " Reviewer Alan Sepinwall , on his blog What 's Alan Watching ? , enjoyed the episode , calling the main plot the " Best Mystery of the Week in quite some time . " In addition , he enjoyed the contrast between Veronica and Keith 's methods of undercover work , writing that Veronica is less subtle in this area . In addition , he praised the more humorous aspects of the episode , particularly the performances in this regard by Bell and Majorino .

 " Duets " is the fourth episode of the second season of the American television series Glee , and the twenty @-@ sixth episode overall . It was written by series creator Ian Brennan , directed by Eric Stoltz , and premiered on Fox on October 12 , 2010 . The episode featured seven cover versions , including a mash @-@ up of " Happy Days Are Here Again " and " Get Happy " by Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland , respectively . 
 In the episode , transfer student Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) joins the glee club . Director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) assigns the members to perform a duet with another classmate , and offers a prize for the best performance . The students form their duos and begin practicing , testing several relationships and initiating others ; after first being recruited by Kurt Hummel ( Chris Colfer ) , Sam ultimately finds himself partnered with Quinn Fabray ( Dianna Agron ) . 
 " Duets " received generally positive reviews from critics , and many praised the show for its character development and varied song choices . The episode also featured a neck @-@ <unk> between Santana ( Naya Rivera ) and Brittany ( Heather Morris ) , which was a subject of interest to many critics and led Christie Keith of AfterEllen.com to refer to the episode as " queerest episode of any series that 's ever been on television " . In its original broadcast , " Duets " was watched by 11 @.@ 36 million American viewers . It was the top @-@ rated program of the night in the 18 – 49 demographic , attaining a 4 @.@ 7 / 13 Nielsen rating / share . Both viewership and ratings rose from the previous episode , " Grilled Cheesus " .

 Glee club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) announces a duets assignment and competition ; the prize for the winning duo is dinner at Breadstix . He tells them that club member Puck ( Mark Salling ) has been sent to juvenile detention for stealing an ATM , and introduces a new member , Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) . Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) suspects that Sam is gay and asks him to be his duet partner ; Sam agrees . Club co @-@ captain Finn Hudson ( Cory Monteith ) separately attempts to convince them not to be partners , as he fears that Sam will be bullied to the point of quitting if he sings a duet with another guy , but Sam insists on honoring his given word to Kurt , and Kurt is still angry at Finn for some homophobic comments he made when they were roommates . After his father Burt ( Mike O 'Malley ) points out that just as Kurt had a crush on Finn the year before , he may now be taking advantage of Sam , Kurt releases Sam from their partnership , and as his competition entry sings " Le Jazz Hot ! " from Victor Victoria in a " duet " with himself . Kurt comes away from this feeling lonelier than ever and wonders if he will ever truly be accepted for who he is by his peers and family . 
 Cheerleaders Santana ( Naya Rivera ) and Brittany ( Heather Morris ) make out , but when Brittany suggests they sing Melissa Etheridge 's " Come to My Window " together , Santana refuses and trivializes their relationship . Santana believes her best chance of winning is by partnering with Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) , and together they sing " River Deep – Mountain High " . Brittany pairs up with Artie ( Kevin McHale ) , and they start dating . Artie loses his virginity to Brittany , but before they compete Santana tells him that Brittany only wanted him for his voice so she could win the competition . He is deeply upset that his first sexual experience was the consequence of such petty motivations , so he breaks up with Brittany and dissolves their partnership . Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) and her boyfriend Mike ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) argue about whether they should duet at all , but he ultimately agrees to join her on " Sing ! " from A Chorus Line , his first solo performance for glee club ; their duet draws praise from Will . 
 Finn and his girlfriend Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) initially practice singing " Don 't Go Breaking My Heart " , but Rachel suggests they should throw the competition so Sam can win , to make him more likely to stay in the glee club . When Sam has a <unk> thrown in his face by bullies , Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) helps him to clean up . They subsequently become duet partners , and during a rehearsal he attempts to kiss her . Quinn is upset and tells him they cannot sing together , but she is later convinced to reconsider by Rachel . Rachel and Finn , dressed as a schoolgirl and a priest in an intentionally offensive move to damage their chances of victory , perform " With You I 'm Born Again " by Billy Preston and Syreeta Wright . Sam and Quinn sing " Lucky " by Jason Mraz and Colbie Caillat . The club members all vote for themselves except Finn and Rachel , who vote for the winners , Sam and Quinn . Over the victory dinner at Breadstix they form a bond , and Quinn tells Sam that she considers the meal their first date . 
 Noticing that Kurt is lonely , Rachel tells him how much the club members value him and asks him to duet with her for fun now that the competition is over in an act of solidarity . The episode ends with them singing the Judy Garland / Barbra Streisand mash @-@ up of " Happy Days Are Here Again " and " Get Happy " for the glee club .

 In " Duets " , Brittany and Santana are shown together in bed . A physical relationship between the two was first alluded to in the season one episode " Sectionals " . Rivera sought clarification on the nature of their relationship from " Sectionals " director Brad Falchuk , who informed her that the two characters had been intimate in the past . Series creator Ryan Murphy told Morris that as Glee is a primetime series , he did not want to show them making out . Interviewed by Brett Berk of Vanity Fair in May 2010 , Morris stated that Brittany and Santana were simply best friends , and the show would not be taking them in a " friends with benefits " direction . However , at the Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour in August 2010 , Murphy stated that the characters would in fact kiss on screen in an upcoming episode . Falchuk later explained that the Brittany / Santana storyline had begun " almost as a goof at first " , however " then we realised this show is so inclusive , and then there were people we weren 't representative of . This whole lesbian @-@ bisexual female community . We 're fortunate the network wasn 't resistant of it and let us try it out , then it became something much deeper . " In " Duets " , Brittany also had a brief relationship with Artie . Morris told Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post that she is a fan of McHale 's , and had been pressing Murphy to give their characters a storyline together since the beginning of the season . 
 Series regular Mark Salling did not appear in " Duets " , which prompted media speculation that he would not return to the show due to a breach of contract . However , his absence was for creative reasons , as it allowed Sam to establish himself within the glee club and begin a relationship with Puck 's ex @-@ girlfriend Quinn . Overstreet stated that Sam was initially created as a romantic interest for Kurt , but his storyline was adjusted to pair him with Quinn as a result of the chemistry the producers detected between himself and Agron . 
 The episode featured cover versions of seven songs : Ike & Tina Turner 's " River Deep – Mountain High " , Jason Mraz and Colbie Caillat 's " Lucky " , Elton John and Kiki Dee 's " Don 't Go Breaking My Heart " , " Le Jazz Hot ! " from Victor Victoria , " Sing ! " from A Chorus Line — which was Shum , Jr . ' s first lead vocal performance on the series , Billy Preston and Syreeta Wright 's " With You I 'm Born Again " , and a mash @-@ up of " Happy Days Are Here Again " and " Get Happy " as performed by Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand . Colfer and Michele 's costumes and positions in the latter number matched those in the Garland and Streisand original . Although it was not performed , Melissa Etheridge 's " Come to My Window " was suggested as a performance piece by Brittany ; five months prior to the episode 's broadcast , Etheridge had jested that her songs were not " gay enough " for use on Glee . All of the songs except " With You I 'm Born Again " were released as singles , available for download . " River Deep – Mountain High " and " Lucky " were also featured on the fifth soundtrack album of the series , Glee : The Music , Volume 4 , while " Don 't Go Breaking My Heart " was included on the fourth extended play , Glee : The Music , Love Songs .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 " Duets " was generally well received by critics , many of whom contrasted it favorably with the preceding season two episodes . The New York Times 's Rebecca Milzoff called it the best of the season to that point " in terms of old @-@ school Glee " , and indeed , both Lisa Respers France of CNN and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post found it a reminder of why they originally loved the show . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summarized : " This was a return to that honeymoon feeling , when Glee first surprised , scandalized and satisfied you . " TV Guide 's Damian Holbrook and the Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson appreciated the lack of gimmicks ; the former explained " No Britney numbers . No forced guest stars . No reasons to check out . It 's amazing how satisfying a show can be when the characters we invested in a year ago get to do something more than set @-@ dress a stunt . " James Poniewozik of Time labelled it " easily the strongest character episode so far this season " . While The Atlantic 's Kevin Fallon opined that the series finally achieved the correct " tonal balance of comedy and drama " , his colleague Meghan Brown provided one of few dissenting reviews ; she called it a lazy , nonsensical episode which contributed to a building " sophomore slump " . MTV 's Aly Semigran found it lackluster after " Grilled Cheesus " , and although Anthony Benigno of the Daily News deemed it an improvement on the previous episode , he concluded that it was not one of the season 's best . 
 Several themes ran through the reviews , one of which was the lack of focus on adult characters . IGN 's Robert Canning — who rated " Duets " 8 @.@ 5 / 10 , signifying a great episode — felt that this contributed to its success , as it " allowed for small but interesting character development to take place , even with some of the minor characters . " Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was surprised that he did not miss the presence of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester , but Hankinson , Semigran and Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman all lamented her absence . The gay @-@ centered storylines also attracted much commentary . Christie Keith of lesbian and bisexual media website AfterEllen.com suggested that " Duets " was " the queerest episode of any series that 's ever been on television " . Entertainment Weekly 's Tim Stack wrote that Kurt " stole the show in terms of pure emotional power " and called him " the most important character on television right now " . USA Today 's Ann Oldenburg questioned whether Glee had gone " too far " by depicting a physical relationship between Santana and Brittany . Several reviewers appreciated the resultant development of Brittany 's character : Poniewozik enjoyed the exploration of her " basic loneliness " , E ! Online 's Jenna Mullins was pleased to see more than her usual " <unk> and one @-@ liners " , and Wieselman called it a " wonderful moment " when she and Artie broke up , which led to the depiction of " real feelings " in Brittany for the first time . Canning found Brittany and Artie 's coupling " uneven " and preferred her with Santana , as their development made them " uniquely interesting and a blast to watch . " VanDerWerff conversely deemed Brittany 's pairing with Artie " one of the most resonant things the show 's ever done " . 
 The storylines that involved Rachel received mixed commentary . Both Poniewozik and Stack appreciated the pairing of Rachel and Kurt : the former called them " probably the strongest pairing " of the episode due to similarities in their characterization , and the latter lauded Rachel 's line " I know you 're lonely ... but you 're not alone " as " an incredibly powerful statement coming in the midst of all these gay youth suicides [ , which ] further illuminates the relevance and importance of a show like Glee . " Fallon said that the episode " added some flavor " to the relationship between Rachel and Finn , which was " in danger of going stale " , and Berk noted that " Duets " was the first time he had ever been " marginally compelled " by a storyline which involved the pair . Benigno was far less favorable : he called Rachel a lunatic , and a " self @-@ absorbed crazy woman who will do anything short of black @-@ ops assassination to secure the [ Nationals ] trophy . " 
 Sam and Quinn 's burgeoning relationship met with a fairly positive response . Canning would have preferred for them to become friends first , and Benigno deemed their sexual tension unrealistic , based on Sam 's success at charming Quinn in Na 'vi , the fictional language of Avatar . However , while Berk declared himself " fully exhausted with the flimsy cheerleader / quarterback paradigm " , Sam 's Na 'vi and Matthew McConaughey impression led him to concede that they are " cute together " . Stack and Mullins shared this sentiment , and VanDerWerff called their flirtation " exceptionally well @-@ handled " . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The episode 's musical performances — deemed " among the most varied and terrific in the show 's history " by VanDerWerff — were also generally well received . Futterman found it refreshing for the main characters to receive equal performance time . Although Poniewozik opined that some numbers were included based on iTunes sales potential rather than how well they served the plot , Holbrook was pleased that the songs " drove the story instead of drowning out the characters " , and both Hankinson and Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times welcomed the contextually appropriate song selection . Opinions were divided over the best performance . Both Futterman and VanDerWerff felt that Mercedes and Santana should have won the duet competition with their performance of " River Deep – Mountain High " . The former called it " one of the series ' best " duets , and the latter further praised it as potentially " the best musical number the show 's ever done from a pure performance standpoint . " Wieselman wrote that it was the best song of the episode , and that he " didn 't want it to ever end " . However , Hankinson highlighted its lack of " emotional punch " , and Semigran deemed it her least favorite performance . She and Benigno named " Sing ! " as their favorite routine , though Benigno gave it only a " B " grade , as its appeal hinged on Mike 's dancing , rather than his vocal performance . Berk gave it four stars out of five , his highest rating of the episode , tied with " River Deep – Mountain High " . Though Flandez and Hankinson also commented positively on the song , the former thought that Tina 's sung interjections became annoying and the latter called it " far from the best of the evening " . 
 Burns chose " Lucky " as " the most impressive number of the evening " , and Respers France called it the most adorable . Semigran and the Los Angeles Times 's Amy Reiter agreed that it was cute , and Flandez praised its " charm and simplicity " . Stack and Benigno gave it an " A " ; Stack eagerly anticipated more duets between Quinn and Sam , and Benigno called it " absolutely fantastic " , with particular praise for Agron , who he opined is often overlooked . Though Futterman also noted its charm , she did not think it was a worthy winner of the duets competition . Berk gave it just two stars out of five , as he found it " kind of boring " . The mash @-@ up of " Happy Days Are Here Again " and " Get Happy " was widely acclaimed . Respers France , Reiter and Hankinson named it the musical highlight of the episode ; Fallon and Stack went further and hailed it as a highlight of the entire series . Poniewozik commented that the number was " so appropriate that , had it not existed , Glee probably would have had to invent it " . Wieselman suggested that Colfer and Michele " redefined show @-@ stopper " with their performance , and Itzkoff lauded it as " a powerful reminder of why it 's worth sticking with Glee through what has quickly proved a polarizing season . " 
 Of the remaining songs , Rachel and Finn 's performance of " Don 't Go Breaking My Heart " attracted praise for Monteith 's vocals , which Stack and Yahr commented " sounded better than ever " . " Le Jazz Hot ! " received a split response . Burns wrote that Kurt " pulled it off flawlessly " , and Fallon called the performance " far more moving and rousing " than any of the songs in " Grilled Cheesus " . Stack and Benigno both graded it " B + " ; the latter deemed it " very good " but " not transcendent " . Reiter felt that the costumes and choreography overpowered the emotion of the piece , and Futterman found the number " too self @-@ indulgent and reminiscent of previous performances like ' Rose 's Turn ' . " Berk rated it two stars out of five , and commented , " I get the idea , and the execution is commendable , but it still kind of sucked . " Rachel and Finn 's deliberately offensive version of " With You I 'm Born Again " received a " C " and " C + " from Benigno and Stack respectively . Both conceded that it was acceptable vocally , but as Stack acknowledged , " the point of this song was to hate it , and I gotta say , Glee : you played me like a fiddle . " In December 2012 , TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee 's worst performances . Regardless of being a send @-@ up , Respers France found the number " oddly endearing " .

 = Ancient Egypt = 
 Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa , concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt . It is one of six civilizations to arise independently . Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC ( according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer ( commonly referred to as Menes ) . The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms , separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods : the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age . 
 Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom , during the Ramesside period , where it rivalled the Hittite Empire , Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire , after which it entered a period of slow decline . Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers , such as the Canaanites / Hyksos , Libyans , the Nubians , the Assyrians , Babylonians , the Achaemenid Persians , and the Macedonians in the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Period of Egypt . In the aftermath of Alexander the Great 's death , one of his generals , Ptolemy Soter , established himself as the new ruler of Egypt . This Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled Egypt until 30 BC , when , under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province . 
 The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture . The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops , which supported a more dense population , and social development and culture . With resources to spare , the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions , the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects , trade with surrounding regions , and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance . Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders , and administrators under the control of a pharaoh , who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs . 
 The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying , surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques , the first known planked boats , Egyptian faience and glass technology , new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty , made with the Hittites . Egypt left a lasting legacy . Its art and architecture were widely copied , and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world . Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries . A new @-@ found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy . 
 = = History = = 
 The Nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history . The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated , centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization . Nomadic modern human hunter @-@ gatherers began living in the Nile valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120 @,@ 000 years ago . By the late Paleolithic period , the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry , forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region . 
 = = = Predynastic period = = = 
 In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times , the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today . Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates . Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl . Hunting would have been common for Egyptians , and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated . 
 By about 5500 BC , small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry , and identifiable by their pottery and personal items , such as combs , bracelets , and beads . The largest of these early cultures in upper ( Southern ) Egypt was the Badari , which probably originated in the Western Desert ; it was known for its high quality ceramics , stone tools , and its use of copper . 
 The Badari was followed by the <unk> ( Naqada I ) and <unk> ( Naqada II ) cultures , which brought a number of technological improvements . As early as the Naqada I Period , predynastic Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia , used to shape blades and other objects from flakes . In Naqada II times , early evidence exists of contact with the Near East , particularly Canaan and the Byblos coast . Over a period of about 1 @,@ 000 years , the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley . Establishing a power center at Hierakonpolis , and later at Abydos , Naqada III leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the Nile . They also traded with Nubia to the south , the oases of the western desert to the west , and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East to the east . Royal Nubian burials at <unk> produced artifacts bearing the oldest @-@ known examples of Egyptian dynastic symbols , such as the white crown of Egypt and falcon . 
 The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods , reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite , as well as societal personal @-@ use items , which included combs , small statuary , painted pottery , high quality decorative stone vases , cosmetic palettes , and jewelry made of gold , lapis , and ivory . They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience , which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups , amulets , and figurines . During the last predynastic phase , the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language . 
 = = = Early Dynastic Period ( c . 3050 – 2686 BC ) = = = 
 The Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the early Sumerian @-@ Akkadian civilisation of Mesopotamia and of ancient Elam . The third @-@ century BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long line of pharaohs from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties , a system still used today . He chose to begin his official history with the king named " <unk> " ( or Menes in Greek ) who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt ( around 3100 BC ) . 
 The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented , and there is no contemporary record of Menes . Some scholars now believe , however , that the mythical Menes may have been the pharaoh Narmer , who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette , in a symbolic act of unification . In the Early Dynastic Period about 3150 BC , the first of the Dynastic pharaohs solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis , from which he could control the labour force and agriculture of the fertile delta region , as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the Levant . The increasing power and wealth of the pharaohs during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos , which were used to celebrate the deified pharaoh after his death . The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land , labour , and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization . 
 = = = Old Kingdom ( 2686 – 2181 BC ) = = = 
 Major advances in architecture , art , and technology were made during the Old Kingdom , fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population , made possible by a well @-@ developed central administration . Some of ancient Egypt 's crowning achievements , the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx , were constructed during the Old Kingdom . Under the direction of the vizier , state officials collected taxes , coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield , drafted peasants to work on construction projects , and established a justice system to maintain peace and order . 
 Along with the rising importance of a central administration arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services . Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples , to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death . Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh , and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration . As the power of the pharaoh diminished , regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh . This , coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC , is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140 @-@ year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period . 
 = = = First Intermediate Period ( 2181 – 1991 BC ) = = = 
 After Egypt 's central government collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom , the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country 's economy . Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis , and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small @-@ scale civil wars . Yet despite difficult problems , local leaders , owing no tribute to the pharaoh , used their new @-@ found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces . Once in control of their own resources , the provinces became economically richer — which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes . In bursts of creativity , provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom , and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period . 
 Free from their loyalties to the pharaoh , local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power . By 2160 BC , rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north , while a rival clan based in Thebes , the Intef family , took control of Upper Egypt in the south . As the <unk> grew in power and expanded their control northward , a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable . Around 2055 BC the northern Theban forces under <unk> Mentuhotep II finally defeated the <unk> rulers , reuniting the Two Lands . They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom . 
 = = = Middle Kingdom ( 2134 – 1690 BC ) = = = 
 The pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom restored the country 's prosperity and stability , thereby stimulating a resurgence of art , literature , and monumental building projects . Mentuhotep II and his Eleventh Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes , but the vizier Amenemhat I , upon assuming kingship at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty around 1985 BC , shifted the nation 's capital to the city of Itjtawy , located in Faiyum . From Itjtawy , the pharaohs of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far @-@ sighted land reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region . Moreover , the military reconquered territory in Nubia that was rich in quarries and gold mines , while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta , called the " Walls @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Ruler " , to defend against foreign attack . 
 With the pharaohs ' having secured military and political security and vast agricultural and mineral wealth , the nation 's population , arts , and religion flourished . In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods , the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in expressions of personal piety and what could be called a democratization of the afterlife , in which all people possessed a soul and could be welcomed into the company of the gods after death . Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident , eloquent style . The relief and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle , individual details that reached new heights of technical perfection . 
 The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom , Amenemhat III , allowed Semitic @-@ speaking Canaanite settlers from the Near East into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns . These ambitious building and mining activities , however , combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign , strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties . During this decline , the Canaanite settlers began to seize control of the delta region , eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos . 
 = = = Second Intermediate Period ( 1674 – 1549 BC ) and the Hyksos = = = 
 Around 1785 BC , as the power of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened , a Western Asian people called the Hyksos had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris , seized control of Egypt , and forced the central government to retreat to Thebes . The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute . The Hyksos ( " foreign rulers " ) retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs , thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture . They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt , most notably the composite bow and the horse @-@ drawn chariot . 
 After their retreat , the native Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos ' Nubian allies , the Kushites , to the south of Egypt . After years of vassalage , Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years , until 1555 BC . The pharaohs Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt , but failed to defeat the Hyksos . That task fell to Kamose 's successor , Ahmose I , who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos ' presence in Egypt . He established a new dynasty . In the New Kingdom that followed , the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt 's borders and attempting to gain mastery of the Near East . 
 = = = New Kingdom ( 1549 – 1069 BC ) = = = 
 The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours , including the Mitanni Empire , Assyria , and Canaan . Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen . Between their reigns , Hatshepsut generally promoted peace and restored trade routes lost during the Hyksos occupation , as well as expanding to new regions . When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC , Egypt had an empire extending from <unk> in north west Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia , cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood . 
 The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large @-@ scale building campaign to promote the god Amun , whose growing cult was based in Karnak . They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements , both real and imagined . The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built . The pharaoh Hatshepsut used such hyperbole and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty @-@ two years . Her reign was very successful , marked by an extended period of peace and wealth @-@ building , trading expeditions to Punt , restoration of foreign trade networks , and great building projects , including an elegant mortuary temple that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later , a colossal pair of obelisks , and a chapel at Karnak . Despite her achievements , Amenhotep II , the heir to Hatshepsut 's nephew @-@ stepson Tuthmosis III , sought to erase her legacy near the end of his father 's reign and throughout his , touting many of her accomplishments as his . He also tried to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries , which some suggest was a futile attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom . 
 Around 1350 BC , the stability of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms . Changing his name to Akhenaten , he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity , suppressed the worship of most other deities , and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes , whom he saw as corrupt . Moving the capital to the new city of <unk> ( modern @-@ day Amarna ) , Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the Near East ( where the Hittites , Mitanni , and Assyrians were vying for control ) . He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style . After his death , the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned , the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes . Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun , Ay , and Horemheb worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten 's heresy , now known as the Amarna Period . 
 Around 1279 BC , Ramesses II , also known as Ramesses the Great , ascended the throne , and went on to build more temples , erect more statues and obelisks , and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history . A bold military leader , Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh ( in modern Syria ) and , after fighting to a stalemate , finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty , around 1258 BC . With both the Egyptians and Hittite Empire proving unable to gain the upper hand over one another , and both powers also fearful of the expanding Middle Assyrian Empire , Egypt withdrew from much of the Near East . The Hittites were thus left to compete unsuccessfully with the powerful Assyrians and the newly arrived Phrygians . 
 Egypt 's wealth , however , made it a tempting target for invasion , particularly by the Libyan Berbers to the west , and the Sea Peoples , a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea . Initially , the military was able to repel these invasions , but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern <unk> , much of it falling to the Assyrians . The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption , tomb robbery , and civil unrest . After regaining their power , the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth , and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period . 
 = = = Third Intermediate Period ( 1069 – 653 BC ) = = = 
 Following the death of Ramesses XI in 1078 BC , <unk> assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt , ruling from the city of Tanis . The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes , who recognized <unk> in name only . During this time , Berber tribes from what was later to be called Libya had been settling in the western delta , and the chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy . Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945 BC , founding the Libyan Berber , or <unk> , dynasty that ruled for some 200 years . Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions . 
 In the mid @-@ ninth century BC , Egypt made a failed attempt to once more gain a foothold in Western Asia . Osorkon II of Egypt , along with a large alliance of nations and peoples , including Persia , Israel , <unk> , Phoenicia / <unk> , the Arabs , Arameans , and neo Hittites among others , engaged in the Battle of Karkar against the powerful Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in 853 BC . However , this coalition of powers failed and the Neo Assyrian Empire continued to dominate Western Asia . 
 Libyan Berber control began to erode as a rival native dynasty in the delta arose under Leontopolis . Also , the Nubians of the Kushites threatened Egypt from the lands to the south . 
 Drawing on millennia of interaction ( trade , acculturation , occupation , assimilation , and war ) with Egypt , the Kushite king Piye left his Nubian capital of <unk> and invaded Egypt around 727 BC . Piye easily seized control of Thebes and eventually the Nile Delta . He recorded the episode on his stela of victory . Piye set the stage for subsequent Twenty @-@ fifth dynasty pharaohs , such as Taharqa , to reunite the " Two lands " of Northern and Southern Egypt . The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom . 
 The Twenty @-@ fifth dynasty ushered in a renaissance period for ancient Egypt . Religion , the arts , and architecture were restored to their glorious Old , Middle , and New Kingdom forms . Pharaohs , such as Taharqa , built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley , including at Memphis , Karnak , Kawa , Jebel <unk> , etc . It was during the Twenty @-@ fifth dynasty that there was the first widespread construction of pyramids ( many in modern Sudan ) in the Nile Valley since the Middle Kingdom . 
 Piye made various unsuccessful attempts to extend Egyptian influence in the Near East , then controlled by Assyria . In 720 BC , he sent an army in support of a rebellion against Assyria , which was taking place in Philistia and Gaza . However , Piye was defeated by Sargon II and the rebellion failed . In 711 BC , Piye again supported a revolt against Assyria by the Israelites of Ashdod and was once again defeated by the Assyrian king Sargon II . Subsequently , Piye was forced from the Near East . 
 From the 10th century BC onwards , Assyria fought for control of the southern Levant . Frequently , cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aid in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army . Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a foothold in the Near East . Taharqa aided the Judean King Hezekiah when Hezekiah and Jerusalem was besieged by the Assyrian king , Sennacherib . Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria 's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem . Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian / Kushite army to divine intervention to surrender to disease . Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite / Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib 's life ( 20 years ) . Some argue that disease was the primary reason for failing to actually take the city ; however , <unk> 's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless . 
 Sennacherib had been murdered by his own sons for destroying the rebellious city of Babylon , a city sacred to all Mesopotamians , the Assyrians included . In 674 BC Esarhaddon launched a preliminary incursion into Egypt ; however , this attempt was repelled by Taharqa . However , in 671 BC , Esarhaddon launched a full @-@ scale invasion . Part of his army stayed behind to deal with rebellions in Phoenicia , and Israel . The remainder went south to <unk> , then crossed the Sinai , and entered Egypt . Esarhaddon decisively defeated Taharqa , took Memphis , Thebes and all the major cities of Egypt , and Taharqa was chased back to his Nubian homeland . Esarhaddon now called himself " king of Egypt , <unk> , and Kush " , and returned with rich booty from the cities of the delta ; he erected a victory stele at this time , and paraded the captive Prince <unk> , the son of Taharqa in Nineveh . Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how " All Ethiopians ( read Nubians / Kushites ) I deported from Egypt , leaving not one left to do homage to me " . He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf . The conquest by Esarhaddon effectively marked the end of the short lived Kushite Empire . 
 However , the native Egyptian rulers installed by Esarhaddon were unable to retain full control of the whole country for long . Two years later , Taharqa returned from Nubia and seized control of a section of southern Egypt as far north as Memphis . Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa ; however , he fell ill and died in his capital , Nineveh , before he left Assyria . His successor , Ashurbanipal , sent an Assyrian general named Sha @-@ Nabu @-@ shu with a small , but well trained army , which conclusively defeated Taharqa at Memphis and once more drove him from Egypt . Taharqa died in Nubia two years later . 
 His successor , <unk> , also made a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia . He successfully defeated Necho , the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal , taking Thebes in the process . The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards . <unk> ( <unk> ) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia . The Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered . A native ruler , <unk> I was placed on the throne , as a vassal of Ashurbanipal , and the Nubians were never again to pose a threat to either Assyria or Egypt . 
 = = = Late Period ( 672 – 332 BC ) = = = 
 With no permanent plans for conquest , the Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the Twenty @-@ sixth Dynasty . By 653 BC , the Saite king Psamtik I ( taking advantage of the fact that Assyria was involved in a fierce war conquering Elam and that few Assyrian troops were stationed in Egypt ) was able to free Egypt relatively peacefully from Assyrian vassalage with the help of Lydian and Greek mercenaries , the latter of whom were recruited to form Egypt 's first navy . Psamtik and his successors however were careful to maintain peaceful relations with Assyria . Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of <unk> became the home of Greeks in the delta . 
 In 609 BC Necho II went to war with Babylonia , the Chaldeans , the Medians and the Scythians in an attempt to save Assyria , which after a brutal civil war was being overrun by this coalition of powers . However , the attempt to save Egypt 's former masters failed . The Egyptians delayed intervening too long , and Nineveh had already fallen and King Sin @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> was dead by the time Necho II sent his armies northwards . However , Necho easily brushed aside the Israelite army under King Josiah but he and the Assyrians then lost a battle at Harran to the Babylonians , Medes and Scythians . Necho II and Ashur @-@ <unk> II of Assyria were finally defeated at Carchemish in <unk> ( modern Syria ) in 605 BC . The Egyptians remained in the area for some decades , struggling with the Babylonian kings <unk> and Nebuchadnezzar II for control of portions of the former Assyrian Empire in The Levant . However , they were eventually driven back into Egypt , and Nebuchadnezzar II even briefly invaded Egypt itself in 567 BC . The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture , but in 525 BC , the powerful Persians , led by Cambyses II , began their conquest of Egypt , eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium . Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh , but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia ( modern Iran ) , leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy . A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC , but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians . 
 Following its annexation by Persia , Egypt was joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia ( modern Lebanon ) in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire . This first period of Persian rule over Egypt , also known as the Twenty @-@ seventh dynasty , ended after more than one @-@ hundred years in 402 BC , and from 380 – 343 BC the Thirtieth Dynasty ruled as the last native royal house of dynastic Egypt , which ended with the kingship of Nectanebo II . A brief restoration of Persian rule , sometimes known as the Thirty @-@ first Dynasty , began in 343 BC , but shortly after , in 332 BC , the Persian ruler <unk> handed Egypt over to the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great without a fight . 
 = = = Ptolemaic Period = = = 
 In 332 BC , Alexander the Great conquered Egypt with little resistance from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer . The administration established by Alexander 's successors , the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom , was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria . The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule , and became a seat of learning and culture , centered at the famous Library of Alexandria . The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city — as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue @-@ generating enterprises , such as papyrus manufacturing , their top priority . 
 Hellenistic culture did not supplant native Egyptian culture , as the Ptolemies supported time @-@ honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace . They built new temples in Egyptian style , supported traditional cults , and portrayed themselves as pharaohs . Some traditions merged , as Greek and Egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities , such as Serapis , and classical Greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs . Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians , the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion , bitter family rivalries , and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of Ptolemy IV . In addition , as Rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt , the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country . Continued Egyptian revolts , ambitious politicians , and powerful Syriac opponents from the Near East made this situation unstable , leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire . 
 = = = Roman Period = = = 
 Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire in 30 BC , following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian ( later Emperor Augustus ) in the Battle of Actium . The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt , and the Roman army , under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor , quelled rebellions , strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes , and prevented attacks by bandits , which had become a notorious problem during the period . Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient , as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome . 
 Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians , some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued . The art of mummy portraiture flourished , and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs , though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had . The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship . Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians . 
 From the mid @-@ first century AD , Christianity took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted . However , it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from Egyptian Religion and Greco @-@ Roman religion and threatened popular religious traditions . This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity , culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303 , but eventually Christianity won out . In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples . Alexandria became the scene of great anti @-@ pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed . As a consequence , Egypt 's native religious culture was continually in decline . While the native population certainly continued to speak their language , the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished . The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert . 
 = = Government and economy = = 
 = = = Administration and commerce = = = 
 The pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and , at least in theory , wielded complete control of the land and its resources . The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government , who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs . In charge of the administration was his second in command , the vizier , who acted as the king 's representative and coordinated land surveys , the treasury , building projects , the legal system , and the archives . At a regional level , the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch , who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction . The temples formed the backbone of the economy . Not only were they houses of worship , but were also responsible for collecting and storing the nation 's wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers , who redistributed grain and goods . 
 Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled . Although the ancient Egyptians did not use coinage until the Late period , they did use a type of money @-@ barter system , with standard sacks of grain and the deben , a weight of roughly 91 grams ( 3 oz ) of copper or silver , forming a common denominator . Workers were paid in grain ; a simple laborer might earn 5 ½ sacks ( 200 kg or 400 lb ) of grain per month , while a foreman might earn 7 ½ sacks ( 250 kg or 550 lb ) . Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading ; for example a shirt cost five copper deben , while a cow cost 140 deben . Grain could be traded for other goods , according to the fixed price list . During the fifth century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad . At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of precious metal rather than true money , but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage . 
 = = = Social status = = = 
 Egyptian society was highly stratified , and social status was expressly displayed . Farmers made up the bulk of the population , but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state , temple , or noble family that owned the land . Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corvée system . Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers , but they were also under state control , working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury . Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt , known as the " white kilt class " in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank . The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature . Below the nobility were the priests , physicians , and engineers with specialized training in their field . Slavery was known in ancient Egypt , but the extent and prevalence of its practice are unclear . 
 The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women , including people from all social classes except slaves , as essentially equal under the law , and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress . Although , slaves were mostly used as indentured servants . They were able to buy and sell , or work their way to freedom or nobility , and usually were treated by doctors in the workplace . Both men and women had the right to own and sell property , make contracts , marry and divorce , receive inheritance , and pursue legal disputes in court . Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts , which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end . Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece , Rome , and even more modern places around the world , ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices and opportunities for achievement . Women such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra VI even became pharaohs , while others wielded power as Divine Wives of Amun . Despite these freedoms , ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration , served only secondary roles in the temples , and were not as likely to be as educated as men . 
 = = = Legal system = = = 
 The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh , who was responsible for enacting laws , delivering justice , and maintaining law and order , a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma 'at . Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive , court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common @-@ sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes . Local councils of elders , known as <unk> in the New Kingdom , were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes . More serious cases involving murder , major land transactions , and tomb robbery were referred to the Great <unk> , over which the vizier or pharaoh presided . Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth . In some cases , the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge , and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co @-@ conspirators . Whether the charges were trivial or serious , court scribes documented the complaint , testimony , and verdict of the case for future reference . 
 Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines , beatings , facial mutilation , or exile , depending on the severity of the offense . Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution , carried out by decapitation , drowning , or impaling the criminal on a stake . Punishment could also be extended to the criminal 's family . Beginning in the New Kingdom , oracles played a major role in the legal system , dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases . The procedure was to ask the god a " yes " or " no " question concerning the right or wrong of an issue . The god , carried by a number of priests , rendered judgment by choosing one or the other , moving forward or backward , or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon . 
 = = = Agriculture = = = 
 A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture , the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River . The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food , allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural , technological , and artistic pursuits . Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned . 
 Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River . The Egyptians recognized three seasons : Akhet ( flooding ) , <unk> ( planting ) , and Shemu ( harvesting ) . The flooding season lasted from June to September , depositing on the river 's banks a layer of mineral @-@ rich silt ideal for growing crops . After the floodwaters had receded , the growing season lasted from October to February . Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields , which were irrigated with ditches and canals . Egypt received little rainfall , so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops . From March to May , farmers used sickles to harvest their crops , which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain . <unk> removed the chaff from the grain , and the grain was then ground into flour , brewed to make beer , or stored for later use . 
 The ancient Egyptians cultivated emmer and barley , and several other cereal grains , all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer . Flax plants , uprooted before they started flowering , were grown for the fibers of their stems . These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread , which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing . Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper . Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots , close to habitations and on higher ground , and had to be watered by hand . Vegetables included leeks , garlic , melons , squashes , pulses , lettuce , and other crops , in addition to grapes that were made into wine . 
 = = = = Animals = = = = 
 The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order ; thus humans , animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole . Animals , both domesticated and wild , were therefore a critical source of spirituality , companionship , and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians . Cattle were the most important livestock ; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses , and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them . In addition to cattle , the ancient Egyptians kept sheep , goats , and pigs . Poultry such as ducks , geese , and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms , where they were force @-@ fed with dough to fatten them . The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish . Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom , and they provided both honey and wax . 
 The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden , and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil . The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual . Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period , and the camel , although known from the New Kingdom , was not used as a beast of burden until the Late Period . There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period , but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land . Dogs , cats and monkeys were common family pets , while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa , such as lions , were reserved for royalty . Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses . During the Predynastic and Late periods , the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular , such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth , and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice . 
 = = = Natural resources = = = 
 Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone , copper and lead ores , gold , and semiprecious stones . These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments , sculpt statues , make tools , and fashion jewelry . <unk> used salts from the Wadi <unk> for mummification , which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster . Ore @-@ bearing rock formations were found in distant , inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai , requiring large , state @-@ controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there . There were extensive gold mines in Nubia , and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region . The Wadi <unk> was a notable source of granite , greywacke , and gold . Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools , and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley . <unk> of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose . Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances . 
 The Egyptians worked deposits of the lead ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers , plumb bobs , and small figurines . Copper was the most important metal for <unk> in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai . Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits , or by the more labor @-@ intensive process of grinding and washing gold @-@ bearing quartzite . Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period . High @-@ quality building stones were abundant in Egypt ; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley , granite from Aswan , and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert . Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry , greywacke , alabaster , and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty . In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods , miners worked deposits of emeralds in Wadi <unk> and amethyst in Wadi el @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = Trade = = = 
 The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare , exotic goods not found in Egypt . In the Predynastic Period , they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense . They also established trade with Palestine , as evidenced by Palestinian @-@ style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs . An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty . Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt . 
 By the Second Dynasty at latest , ancient Egyptian trade with Byblos yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt . By the Fifth Dynasty , trade with Punt provided gold , aromatic resins , ebony , ivory , and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons . Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper , both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze . The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli , which had to be imported from far @-@ away Afghanistan . Egypt 's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete , which provided , among other goods , supplies of olive oil . In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials , Egypt mainly exported grain , gold , linen , and papyrus , in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects . 
 = = Language = = 
 = = = Historical development = = = 
 The Egyptian language is a northern Afro @-@ Asiatic language closely related to the Berber and Semitic languages . It has the second longest history of any language ( after Sumerian ) , having been written from c . 3200 BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer . The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian , Middle Egyptian ( Classical Egyptian ) , Late Egyptian , Demotic and Coptic . Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic , but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes . 
 Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language , but it became more analytic later on . Late Egyptian develops <unk> definite and indefinite articles , which replace the older inflectional suffixes . There is a change from the older verb – subject – object word order to subject – verb – object . The Egyptian hieroglyphic , hieratic , and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet . Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church , and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic . 
 = = = Sounds and grammar = = = 
 Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro @-@ Asiatic languages . These include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants , voiced and voiceless stops , voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates . It has three long and three short vowels , which expanded in Later Egyptian to about nine . The basic word in Egyptian , similar to Semitic and Berber , is a <unk> or <unk> root of consonants and <unk> . Suffixes are added to form words . The verb conjugation corresponds to the person . For example , the triconsonantal skeleton S @-@ <unk> @-@ M is the semantic core of the word ' hear ' ; its basic conjugation is <unk> , ' he hears ' . If the subject is a noun , suffixes are not added to the verb : <unk> <unk> , ' the woman hears ' . 
 Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call <unk> because of its similarity with Arabic . The word order is predicate – subject in verbal and adjectival sentences , and subject – predicate in nominal and adverbial sentences . The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a <unk> pronoun . Verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n , but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences . Stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable , which can be open ( CV ) or closed ( CVC ) . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Hieroglyphic writing dates from c . 3000 BC , and is composed of hundreds of symbols . A hieroglyph can represent a word , a sound , or a silent determinative ; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts . Hieroglyphs were a formal script , used on stone monuments and in tombs , that could be as detailed as individual works of art . In day @-@ to @-@ day writing , scribes used a cursive form of writing , called hieratic , which was quicker and easier . While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction ( though typically written from right to left ) , hieratic was always written from right to left , usually in horizontal rows . A new form of writing , Demotic , became the prevalent writing style , and it is this form of writing — along with formal hieroglyphs — that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone . 
 Around the first century AD , the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script . Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet with the addition of some Demotic signs . Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century , towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them . As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded , knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost . Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt , but only in 1822 , after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean @-@ François Champollion , were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs . It was primarily an occupation of the scribes , who worked out of the Per Ankh institution or the House of Life . The latter comprised offices , libraries ( called House of Books ) , laboratories and observatories . Some of the best @-@ known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature , such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts , were written in Classical Egyptian , which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300 BC . Later Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents , love poetry and tales , as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts . During this period , the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography , such as those of <unk> and <unk> . The genre known as <unk> ( " instructions " ) was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles ; the Ipuwer papyrus , a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval , is a famous example . 
 The Story of Sinuhe , written in Middle Egyptian , might be the classic of Egyptian literature . Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus , a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests . The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of near @-@ eastern literature . Towards the end of the New Kingdom , the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any . The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt . From about 700 BC , narrative stories and instructions , such as the popular Instructions of <unk> , as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian . Many stories written in demotic during the Greco @-@ Roman period were set in previous historical eras , when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Daily life = = = 
 Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land . Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members , and were constructed of mud @-@ brick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day . Each home had a kitchen with an open roof , which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread . Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings . Floors were covered with reed mats , while wooden stools , beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture . 
 The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance . Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk . Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness ; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin . Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white , and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs , jewelry , and cosmetics . Children went without clothing until maturity , at about age 12 , and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved . Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children , while the father provided the family 's income . 
 Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them . Early instruments included flutes and harps , while instruments similar to trumpets , oboes , and pipes developed later and became popular . In the New Kingdom , the Egyptians played on bells , cymbals , tambourines , drums , and imported lutes and lyres from Asia . The <unk> was a rattle @-@ like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies . 
 The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities , including games and music . Senet , a board game where pieces moved according to random chance , was particularly popular from the earliest times ; another similar game was <unk> , which had a circular gaming board . Juggling and ball games were popular with children , and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Beni Hasan . The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting and boating as well . 
 The excavation of the workers ' village of Deir el @-@ Madinah has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years . There is no comparable site in which the organisation , social interactions , working and living conditions of a community were studied in such detail . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time ; indeed , the cuisine of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients . The staple diet consisted of bread and beer , supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic , and fruit such as dates and figs . Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis . Fish , meat , and fowl could be salted or dried , and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world : the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes . Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes , but also to reinforce the power of the pharaoh . The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders ; using simple but effective tools and sighting instruments , architects could build large stone structures with accuracy and precision . 
 The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mud bricks and wood , and have not survived . Peasants lived in simple homes , while the palaces of the elite were more elaborate structures . A few surviving New Kingdom palaces , such as those in <unk> and Amarna , show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people , birds , water pools , deities and geometric designs . Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of bricks . The architectural elements used in the world 's first large @-@ scale stone building , Djoser 's mortuary complex , include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif . 
 The earliest preserved ancient Egyptian temples , such as those at Giza , consist of single , enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns . In the New Kingdom , architects added the pylon , the open courtyard , and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temple 's sanctuary , a style that was standard until the Greco @-@ Roman period . The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba , a flat @-@ roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber . The step pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other . Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms , but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock @-@ cut tombs . The Twenty @-@ fifth dynasty was a notable exception , as all Twenty @-@ fifth dynasty pharaohs constructed pyramids . 
 = = = Art = = = 
 The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes . For over 3500 years , artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom , following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change . These artistic standards — simple lines , shapes , and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth — created a sense of order and balance within a composition . Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls , coffins , stelae , and even statues . The Narmer Palette , for example , displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs . Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance , ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity . 
 Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone to carve statues and fine reliefs , but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute . Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores ( red and yellow ochres ) , copper ores ( blue and green ) , soot or charcoal ( black ) , and limestone ( white ) . Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes , which could be moistened with water when needed . 
 Pharaohs used reliefs to record victories in battle , royal decrees , and religious scenes . Common citizens had access to pieces of funerary art , such as shabti statues and books of the dead , which they believed would protect them in the afterlife . During the Middle Kingdom , wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb . In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife , these models show laborers , houses , boats , and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife . 
 Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art , the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes . After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period , Minoan @-@ style frescoes were found in Avaris . The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period , where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenaten 's revolutionary religious ideas . This style , known as Amarna art , was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten 's death and replaced by the traditional forms . 
 = = = Religious beliefs = = = 
 Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception ; pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings . The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection . However , the gods were not always viewed as benevolent , and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers . The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy , but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system . These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality . 
 Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the king 's behalf . At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine . Temples were not places of public worship or congregation , and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship . Normally , the god 's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials . Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes , and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos . After the New Kingdom , the pharaoh 's role as a spiritual intermediary was de @-@ emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods . As a result , priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people . 
 The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or aspects . In addition to the body , each person had a <unk> ( shadow ) , a ba ( personality or soul ) , a ka ( life @-@ force ) , and a name . The heart , rather than the brain , was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions . After death , the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will , but they required the physical remains ( or a substitute , such as a statue ) as a permanent home . The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the " blessed dead " , living on as an akh , or " effective one " . For this to happen , the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial , in which the heart was weighed against a " feather of truth " . If deemed worthy , the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form . 
 = = = Burial customs = = = 
 The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death . These customs involved preserving the body by mummification , performing burial ceremonies , and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife . Before the Old Kingdom , bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation . The arid , desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor , who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite . Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification , which involved removing the internal organs , wrapping the body in linen , and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin . Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty , some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars . 
 By the New Kingdom , the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification ; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs , removing the brain through the nose , and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron . The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin . Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted <unk> mummy cases . Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras , while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy , which was decorated . 
 Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items , but all burials , regardless of social status , included goods for the deceased . Beginning in the New Kingdom , books of the dead were included in the grave , along with shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife . Rituals in which the deceased was magically re @-@ animated accompanied burials . After burial , living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased . 
 = = Military = = 
 The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion , and for maintaining Egypt 's domination in the ancient Near East . The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods . The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes , such as those found at the city of Buhen on the way to Nubia . Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases , such as the fortress at Sile , which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant . In the New Kingdom , a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer Kush and parts of the Levant . 
 Typical military equipment included bows and arrows , spears , and round @-@ topped shields made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame . In the New Kingdom , the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders . Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze : shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle , spears were tipped with a bronze point , and the <unk> was adopted from Asiatic soldiers . The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army ; it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs , such as Seqenenre Tao II and his sons , did do so . However , it has also been argued that " kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders , fighting alongside their troops . " Soldiers were recruited from the general population , but during , and especially after , the New Kingdom , mercenaries from Nubia , Kush , and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt .

 In technology , medicine and mathematics , ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication . Traditional empiricism , as evidenced by the Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri ( c . 1600 BC ) , is first credited to Egypt . The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system . 
 = = = Faience and glass = = = 
 Even before the Old Kingdom , the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience , which they treated as a type of artificial semi @-@ precious stone . Faience is a non @-@ clay ceramic made of silica , small amounts of lime and soda , and a colorant , typically copper . The material was used to make beads , tiles , figurines , and small wares . Several methods can be used to create faience , but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core , which was then fired . By a related technique , the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue , also called blue frit , which is produced by fusing ( or sintering ) silica , copper , lime , and an alkali such as natron . The product can be ground up and used as a pigment . 
 The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill , but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently . It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre @-@ made ingots , which they melted and finished . However , they did have technical expertise in making objects , as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass . A range of colors could be produced , including yellow , red , green , blue , purple , and white , and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque . 
 = = = Medicine = = = 
 The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment . Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites , which caused liver and intestinal damage . Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat . The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints , and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body . The grit and sand from stone @-@ ground flour abraded teeth , leaving them susceptible to abscesses ( though caries were rare ) . 
 The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars , which promoted periodontal disease . Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls , the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence . Adult life expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women , but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one @-@ third of the population died in infancy . 
 Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills , and some , such as Imhotep , remained famous long after their deaths . Herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians , with some treating only the head or the stomach , while others were eye @-@ doctors and dentists . Training of physicians took place at the Per Ankh or " House of Life " institution , most notably those headquartered in Per @-@ Bastet during the New Kingdom and at Abydos and <unk> in the Late period . Medical papyri show empirical knowledge of anatomy , injuries , and practical treatments . 
 Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat , white linen , sutures , nets , pads , and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection , while opium thyme and <unk> were used to relieve pain . The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies . Prayers were made to the goddess Isis . Moldy bread , honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns . Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms . Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds , set broken bones , and amputated diseased limbs , but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred .

 Early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull and had mastered advanced forms of shipbuilding as early as 3000 BC . The Archaeological Institute of America reports that the oldest planked ships known are the Abydos boats . A group of 14 discovered ships in Abydos were constructed of wooden planks " sewn " together . Discovered by Egyptologist David O 'Connor of New York University , woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together , and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams . Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh Khasekhemwy , originally they were all thought to have belonged to him , but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC , and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating . The ship dating to 3000 BC was 75 feet ( 23 m ) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh . According to professor O 'Connor , the 5 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old ship may have even belonged to Pharaoh Aha . 
 Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together , using pitch for caulking the seams . The " Khufu ship " , a 43 @.@ 6 @-@ metre ( 143 ft ) vessel sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC , is a full @-@ size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a solar barque . Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints . 
 Large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean , especially Byblos ( on the coast of modern @-@ day Lebanon ) , and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the Land of Punt . In fact one of the earliest Egyptian words for a seagoing ship is a " Byblos Ship " , which originally defined a class of Egyptian seagoing ships used on the Byblos run ; however , by the end of the Old Kingdom , the term had come to include large seagoing ships , whatever their destination . 
 In 2011 archaeologists from Italy , the United States , and Egypt excavating a dried @-@ up lagoon known as Mersa <unk> have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut 's Punt expedition onto the open ocean . Some of the site 's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians ' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes , made from papyrus , coiled in huge bundles . And in 2013 a team of Franco @-@ Egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the world 's oldest port , dating back about 4500 years , from the time of King Cheops on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el @-@ <unk> ( about 110 miles south of Suez ) . 
 In 1977 , an ancient north @-@ south canal dating to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt was discovered extending from Lake Timsah to the Ballah Lakes . It was dated to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course . 
 = = = Mathematics = = = 
 The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic Naqada period , and show a fully developed numeral system . The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land , labor , and grain . Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations — addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division — use fractions , compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids , and calculate the surface areas of rectangles , triangles , and circles . They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry , and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations . 
 Mathematical notation was decimal , and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million . Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number ; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred , the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively . Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one , they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions . For example , they resolved the fraction two @-@ fifths into the sum of one @-@ third + one @-@ fifteenth . Standard tables of values facilitated this . Some common fractions , however , were written with a special glyph — the equivalent of the modern two @-@ thirds is shown on the right . 
 Ancient Egyptian mathematicians had a grasp of the principles underlying the Pythagorean theorem , knowing , for example , that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a 3 – 4 – 5 ratio . They were able to estimate the area of a circle by subtracting one @-@ ninth from its diameter and squaring the result : 
 Area ≈ [ ( 8 ⁄ 9 ) D ] 2 = ( 256 ⁄ 81 ) r 2 ≈ <unk> 2 @,@ 
 a reasonable approximation of the formula <unk> 2 . 
 The golden ratio seems to be reflected in many Egyptian constructions , including the pyramids , but its use may have been an unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony .

 The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world . The cult of the goddess Isis , for example , became popular in the Roman Empire , as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome . The Romans also imported building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian @-@ style structures . Early historians such as Herodotus , Strabo , and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land , which Romans came to view as a place of mystery . 
 During the Middle Ages and The Renaissance , Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam , but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as Dhul @-@ Nun al @-@ Misri and al @-@ Maqrizi . In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys , leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe . This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt , who took , purchased , or were given many important antiquities . 
 Although the European colonial occupation of Egypt destroyed a significant portion of the country 's historical legacy , some foreigners left more positive marks . Napoleon , for example , arranged the first studies in Egyptology when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt 's natural history , which was published in the Description de l 'Égypte . 
 In the 20th century , the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations . The Supreme Council of Antiquities now approves and oversees all excavations , which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure . The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt . 
 = Æthelberht of Kent = 
 Æthelberht ( also Æthelbert , Aethelberht , <unk> , or Ethelbert , Old English <unk> / <unk> / ) / English pronunciation : / <unk> / / ( c . 560 – 24 February 616 ) was King of Kent from about 589 until his death . The eighth @-@ century monk Bede , in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People , lists him as the third king to hold imperium over other Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms . In the late ninth century Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle he is referred to as a bretwalda , or " Britain @-@ ruler " . He was the first English king to convert to Christianity . 
 Æthelberht was the son of Eormenric , succeeding him as king , according to the Chronicle . He married Bertha , the Christian daughter of Charibert , king of the Franks , thus building an alliance with the most powerful state in contemporary Western Europe ; the marriage probably took place before he came to the throne . Bertha 's influence may have led to Pope Gregory I 's decision to send Augustine as a missionary from Rome . Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet in east Kent in 597 . Shortly thereafter , Æthelberht converted to Christianity , churches were established , and wider @-@ scale conversion to Christianity began in the kingdom . He provided the new church with land in Canterbury , thus establishing one of the foundation stones of what ultimately became the Anglican Communion . 
 Æthelberht 's law for Kent , the earliest written code in any Germanic language , instituted a complex system of fines ; the law code is preserved in the Textus Roffensis . Kent was rich , with strong trade ties to the continent , and he may have instituted royal control over trade . Coinage probably began circulating in Kent during his reign for the first time since the Anglo @-@ Saxon invasion . He later came to be regarded as a saint for his role in establishing Christianity among the Anglo @-@ Saxons . His feast day was originally 24 February , but was changed to 25 February . 
 = = Historical context = = 
 In the fifth century , raids on Britain by continental peoples had developed into full @-@ scale migrations . The newcomers are known to have included Angles , Saxons , Jutes , and Frisians , and there is evidence of other groups as well . These groups captured territory in the east and south of England , but at about the end of the fifth century , a British victory at the battle of Mount Badon ( Mons Badonicus ) halted the Anglo @-@ Saxon advance for fifty years . From about 550 , however , the British began to lose ground once more , and within twenty @-@ five years it appears that control of almost all of southern England was in the hands of the invaders . 
 Anglo @-@ Saxons probably conquered Kent before Mons Badonicus . There is both documentary and archaeological evidence that Kent was primarily colonized by Jutes , from the southern part of the Jutland peninsula . According to legend , the brothers Hengist and Horsa landed in 449 as mercenaries for a British king , <unk> . After a rebellion over pay and Horsa 's death in battle , Hengist established the Kingdom of Kent . Some historians now think the underlying story of a rebelling mercenary force may be accurate ; most now date the founding of the kingdom of Kent to the middle of the fifth @-@ century , which is consistent with the legend . This early date , only a few decades after the departure of the Romans , also suggests that more of Roman civilization may have survived into Anglo @-@ Saxon rule in Kent than in other areas . 
 Overlordship was a central feature of Anglo @-@ Saxon politics which began before Æthelberht 's time ; kings were described as overlords as late as the ninth century . The Anglo @-@ Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders , with a leader who had authority over many different groups ; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader . Once the new states began to form , conflicts among them began . Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth . A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state . 
 Sources for this period in Kentish history include the Ecclesiastical History of the English People , written in 731 by Bede , a Northumbrian monk . Bede was interested primarily in England 's Christianization . Since Æthelberht was the first Anglo @-@ Saxon king to convert to Christianity , Bede provides more substantial information about him than about any earlier king . One of Bede 's correspondents was Albinus , abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul ( subsequently renamed St. Augustine 's ) in Canterbury . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , a collection of annals assembled c . 890 in the kingdom of Wessex , mentions several events in Kent during Æthelberht 's reign . Further mention of events in Kent occurs in the late sixth century history of the Franks by Gregory of Tours . This is the earliest surviving source to mention any Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdom . Some of Pope Gregory the Great 's letters concern the mission of St. Augustine to Kent in 597 ; these letters also mention the state of Kent and its relationships with neighbours . Other sources include regnal lists of the kings of Kent and early charters ( land grants by kings to their followers or to the church ) . Although no originals survive from Æthelberht 's reign , later copies exist . A law code from Æthelberht 's reign also survives . 
 = = Ancestry , accession and chronology = = 
 According to Bede , Æthelberht was descended directly from Hengist . Bede gives the line of descent as follows : " Ethelbert was son of <unk> , son of Octa , and after his grandfather Oeric , surnamed Oisc , the kings of the Kentish folk are commonly known as <unk> . The father of Oeric was Hengist . " An alternative form of this genealogy , found in the Historia Brittonum among other places , reverses the position of Octa and Oisc in the lineage . The first of these names that can be placed historically with reasonable confidence is Æthelberht 's father , whose name now usually is spelled Eormenric . The only direct written reference to Eormenric is in Kentish genealogies , but Gregory of Tours does mention that Æthelberht 's father was the king of Kent , though Gregory gives no date . Eormenric 's name provides a hint of connections to the kingdom of the Franks , across the English channel ; the element " <unk> " was rare in names of the Anglo @-@ Saxon aristocracy , but much more common among Frankish nobles . One other member of Æthelberht 's family is known : his sister , <unk> , who is recorded by both Bede and the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle as the mother of Sæberht , king of the East Saxons ( i.e. Essex ) . 
 The dates of Æthelberht 's birth and accession to the throne of Kent are both matters of debate . Bede , the earliest source to give dates , is thought to have drawn his information from correspondence with Albinus . Bede states that when Æthelberht died in 616 he had reigned for fifty @-@ six years , placing his accession in 560 . Bede also says that Æthelberht died twenty @-@ one years after his baptism . Augustine ’ s mission from Rome is known to have arrived in 597 , and according to Bede , it was this mission that converted Æthelberht . Hence Bede ’ s dates are inconsistent . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , an important source for early dates , is inconsistent with Bede and also has inconsistencies among different manuscript versions . Putting together the different dates in the Chronicle for birth , death , and length of reign , it appears that Æthelberht 's reign was thought to have been either 560 – 616 , or 565 – 618 , but that the surviving sources have confused the two traditions . 
 It is possible that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine 's arrival . Æthelberht 's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her , to attend her at court , so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent . It also is possible that Bede had the date of Æthelberht 's death wrong ; if , in fact , Æthelberht died in 618 , this would be consistent with his baptism in 597 , which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival . 
 Gregory of Tours , in his Historia Francorum , writes that Bertha , daughter of Charibert , king of the Franks , married the son of the king of Kent . Bede says that Æthelberht received Bertha " from her parents " . If Bede is interpreted literally , the marriage would have had to take place before 567 , when Charibert died . The traditions for Æthelberht 's reign , then , would imply that Æthelberht married Bertha before either 560 or 565 . 
 The extreme length of Æthelberht 's reign also has been regarded with skepticism by historians ; it has been suggested that he died in the fifty @-@ sixth year of his life , rather than the fifty @-@ sixth year of his reign . This would place the year of his birth approximately at 560 , and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid <unk> . According to Gregory of Tours , Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg , Bertha 's mother , which places that marriage no earlier than 561 . It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580 . These later dates for Bertha and Æthelberht also solve another possible problem : Æthelberht 's daughter , Æthelburh , seems likely to have been Bertha 's child , but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at Æthelburh 's likely birthdate using the early dates . 
 Gregory , however , also says that he thinks that Ingoberg was seventy years old in 589 ; and this would make her about forty when she married Charibert . This is possible , but seems unlikely , especially as Charibert seems to have had a preference for younger women , again according to Gregory 's account . This would imply an earlier birth date for Bertha . On the other hand , Gregory refers to Æthelberht at the time of his marriage to Bertha simply as " a man of Kent " , and in the 589 passage concerning Ingoberg 's death , which was written in about 590 or 591 , he refers to Æthelberht as " the son of the king of Kent " . If this does not simply reflect Gregory 's ignorance of Kentish affairs , which seems unlikely given the close ties between Kent and the Franks , then some assert that Æthelberht 's reign cannot have begun before 589 . 
 While all of the contradictions above cannot be reconciled , the most probable dates that may be drawn from available data place Æthelberht 's birth at approximately 560 and , perhaps , his marriage to Bertha at 580 . His reign is most likely to have begun in 589 or 590 . 
 = = Kingship of Kent = = 
 The later history of Kent shows clear evidence of a system of joint kingship , with the kingdom being divided into east Kent and west Kent , although it appears that there generally was a dominant king . This evidence is less clear for the earlier period , but there are early charters , known to be forged , which nevertheless imply that Æthelberht ruled as joint king with his son , Eadbald . It may be that Æthelberht was king of east Kent and Eadbald became king of west Kent ; the east Kent king seems generally to have been the dominant ruler later in Kentish history . Whether or not Eadbald became a joint king with Æthelberht , there is no question that Æthelberht had authority throughout the kingdom . 
 The division into two kingdoms is most likely to date back to the sixth century ; east Kent may have conquered west Kent and preserved the institutions of kingship as a subkingdom . This was a common pattern in Anglo @-@ Saxon England , as the more powerful kingdoms absorbed their weaker neighbours . An unusual feature of the Kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne , although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession . 
 The main towns of the two kingdoms were Rochester , for west Kent , and Canterbury , for east Kent . Bede does not state that Æthelberht had a palace in Canterbury , but he does refer to Canterbury as Æthelberht 's " metropolis " , and it is clear that it is Æthelberht 's seat . 
 = = Relations with the Franks = = 
 There are many indications of close relations between Kent and the Franks . Æthelberht 's marriage to Bertha certainly connected the two courts , although not as equals : the Franks would have thought of Æthelberht as an under @-@ king . There is no record that Æthelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and , as a result , historians are divided on the true nature of the relationship . Evidence for an explicit Frankish overlordship of Kent comes from a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great to Theuderic , king of Orléans , and Theudebert , king of Metz . The letter concerned Augustine 's mission to Kent in 597 , and in it Gregory says that he believes " that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which you , their kings and lords , stand " . It may be that this is a papal compliment , rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms . It also has been suggested that Liudhard , Bertha 's chaplain , was intended as a representative of the Frankish church in Kent , which also could be interpreted as evidence of overlordship . 
 A possible reason for the willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king , <unk> I , is recorded as having conquered a people known as the <unk> during the mid @-@ sixth century . If , as seems likely from the name , these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent , then it may be that the marriage was intended as a unifying political move , reconnecting different branches of the same people . Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed : it may be that Frankish support for him , acquired via the marriage , was instrumental in gaining the throne for him . 
 Regardless of the political relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks , there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel . There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks , and burial artefacts found include clothing , drink , and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence . The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods than those of the neighbouring Anglo @-@ Saxon regions , which is not surprising given Kent 's easier access to trade across the English Channel . In addition , the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves , implying that material wealth was derived from that trade . Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent . Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well , so it is not necessary to presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent . 
 = = Rise to dominance = = 
 = = = Bretwalda = = = 
 In his Ecclesiastical History , Bede includes his list of seven kings who held " imperium " over the other kingdoms south of the Humber . The usual translation for " imperium " is " overlordship " . Bede names Æthelberht as the third on the list , after Ælle of Sussex and Ceawlin of Wessex . The anonymous annalist who composed one of the versions of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle repeated Bede 's list of seven kings in a famous entry under the year 827 , with one additional king , Egbert of Wessex . The Chronicle also records that these kings held the title " bretwalda " , or " Britain @-@ ruler " . The exact meaning of bretwalda has been the subject of much debate ; it has been described as a term " of encomiastic poetry " , but there also is evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership . 
 The prior bretwalda , Ceawlin , is recorded by the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle as having fought Æthelberht in 568 . The entry states that Æthelberht lost the battle and was driven back to Kent . The dating of the entries concerning the West Saxons in this section of the Chronicle is thought to be unreliable and a recent analysis suggests that Ceawlin 's reign is more likely to have been approximately 581 – 588 , rather than the dates of 560 – 592 that are given in the Chronicle . The battle was at " Wibbandun " , which may be translated as <unk> 's Mount ; it is not known where this was . 
 At some point Ceawlin ceased to hold the title of bretwalda , perhaps after a battle at Stoke Lyne , in Oxfordshire , which the Chronicle dates to 584 , some eight years before he was deposed in 592 ( again using the Chronicle 's unreliable dating ) . Æthelberht certainly was a dominant ruler by 601 , when Gregory the Great wrote to him : Gregory urges Æthelberht to spread Christianity among those kings and peoples subject to him , implying some level of overlordship . If the battle of Wibbandun was fought c . 590 , as has been suggested , then Æthelberht must have gained his position as overlord at some time in the 590s . This dating for Wibbandun is slightly inconsistent with the proposed dates of 581 – 588 for Ceawlin 's reign , but those dates are not thought to be precise , merely the most plausible given the available data . 
 = = = Relationships with other kingdoms = = = 
 In addition to the evidence of the Chronicle that Æthelberht was accorded the title of bretwalda , there is evidence of his domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the Heptarchy . In Essex , Æthelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604 , when his intervention helped in the conversion of King Sæberht of Essex , his nephew , to Christianity . It was Æthelberht , and not Sæberht , who built and endowed St. Pauls in London , where St Paul 's Cathedral now stands . Further evidence is provided by Bede , who explicitly describes Æthelberht as Sæberht 's overlord . 
 Bede describes Æthelberht 's relationship with Rædwald , king of East Anglia , in a passage that is not completely clear in meaning . It seems to imply that Rædwald retained ducatus , or military command of his people , even while Æthelberht held imperium . This implies that being a bretwalda usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also that it was more than that , since Æthelberht is bretwalda despite Rædwald 's control of his own troops . Rædwald was converted to Christianity while in Kent but did not abandon his pagan beliefs ; this , together with the fact that he retained military independence , implies that Æthelberht 's overlordship of East Anglia was much weaker than his influence with the East Saxons . An alternative interpretation , however , is that the passage in Bede should be translated as " Rædwald , king of the East Angles , who while Æthelberht lived , even conceded to him the military leadership of his people " ; if this is Bede 's intent , then East Anglia firmly was under Æthelberht 's overlordship . 
 There is no evidence that Æthelberht 's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity , although this is partly due to the lack of sources — nothing is known of Sussex 's history , for example , for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries . Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley , on the northwestern borders of Wessex , however , and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west . No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia , but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria , so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship . 
 = = Augustine 's mission and early Christianization = = 
 The native Britons had converted to Christianity under Roman rule . The Anglo @-@ Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries , so the church in Rome had no presence or authority in Britain , and in fact , Rome knew so little about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs . However , Æthelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife , Bertha , who had brought a bishop , Liudhard , with her across the Channel , and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel , St Martin 's . 
 In 596 , Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine , prior of the monastery of St. Andrew in Rome , to England as a missionary , and in 597 , a group of nearly forty monks , led by Augustine , landed on the Isle of Thanet in Kent . According to Bede , Æthelberht was sufficiently distrustful of the newcomers to insist on meeting them under the open sky , to prevent them from performing sorcery . The monks impressed Æthelberht , but he was not converted immediately . He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach . 
 It is not known when Æthelberht became a Christian . It is possible , despite Bede 's account , that he already was a Christian before Augustine 's mission arrived . It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed Æthelberht to consider becoming a Christian before the arrival of the mission , and it is also likely that a condition of Æthelberht 's marriage to Bertha was that Æthelberht would consider conversion . Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship , however , so it is possible that Æthelberht 's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence , might have been an assertion of independence from Frankish control . It also has been argued that Augustine 's hesitation — he turned back to Rome , asking to be released from the mission — is an indication that Æthelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent . 
 At the latest , Æthelberht must have converted before 601 , since that year Gregory wrote to him as a Christian king . An old tradition records that Æthelberht converted on 1 June , in the summer of the year that Augustine arrived . Through Æthelberht 's influence Sæberht , king of Essex , also was converted , but there were limits to the effectiveness of the mission . The entire Kentish court did not convert : Eadbald , Æthelberht 's son and heir , was a pagan at his accession . Rædwald , king of East Anglia , was only partly converted ( apparently while at Æthelberht 's court ) and retained a pagan shrine next to the new Christian altar . Augustine also was unsuccessful in gaining the allegiance of the British clergy . 
 = = Law code = = 
 Some time after the arrival of Augustine 's mission , perhaps in 602 or 603 , Æthelberht issued a set of laws , in ninety sections . These laws are by far the earliest surviving code composed in any of the Germanic countries , and they were almost certainly among the first documents written down in Anglo @-@ Saxon , as literacy would have arrived in England with Augustine 's mission . The only surviving early manuscript , the Textus Roffensis , dates from the twelfth century , and it now resides in the Medway Studies Centre in Strood , Kent . Æthelberht 's code makes reference to the church in the very first item , which enumerates the compensation required for the property of a bishop , a deacon , a priest , and so on ; but overall , the laws seem remarkably uninfluenced by Christian principles . Bede asserted that they were composed " after the Roman manner " , but there is little discernible Roman influence either . In subject matter , the laws have been compared to the Lex Salica of the Franks , but it is not thought that Æthelberht based his new code on any specific previous model . 
 The laws are concerned with setting and enforcing the penalties for transgressions at all levels of society ; the severity of the fine depended on the social rank of the victim . The king had a financial interest in enforcement , for part of the fines would come to him in many cases , but the king also was responsible for law and order , and avoiding blood feuds by enforcing the rules on compensation for injury was part of the way the king maintained control . Æthelberht 's laws are mentioned by Alfred the Great , who compiled his own laws , making use of the prior codes created by Æthelberht , as well as those of Offa of Mercia and Ine of Wessex . 
 One of Æthelberht 's laws seems to preserve a trace of a very old custom : the third item in the code states that " If the king is drinking at a man 's home , and anyone commits any evil deed there , he is to pay twofold compensation . " This probably refers to the ancient custom of a king traveling the country , being hosted , and being provided for by his subjects wherever he went . The king 's servants retained these rights for centuries after Æthelberht 's time . 
 Items 77 – 81 in the code have been interpreted as a description of a woman 's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation . These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances , depending on whether she keeps custody of the children , for example . It has recently been suggested , however , that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed , rather than divorced . 
 = = Trade and coinage = = 
 There is little documentary evidence about the nature of trade in Æthelberht 's Kent . It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century , but it is not known how early this control began . There is archaeological evidence suggesting that the royal influence predates any of the written sources . It has been suggested that one of Æthelberht 's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly . The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo @-@ Saxon nations , and the revenue from trade was important in itself . 
 Kentish manufacture before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry . Kentish jewellers were highly skilled , and before the end of the sixth century they gained access to gold . Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire . It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth , although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade . It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht 's strength , although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn . 
 It may have been during Æthelberht 's reign that the first coins were minted in England since the departure of the Romans : none bear his name , but it is thought likely that the first coins predate the end of the sixth century . These early coins were gold , and probably were the shillings ( <unk> in Old English ) that are mentioned in Æthelberht 's laws . The coins are also known to numismatists as " <unk> " . 
 = = Death and succession = = 
 Æthelberht died on 24 February 616 and was succeeded by his son , Eadbald , who was not a Christian — Bede says he had been converted but went back to his pagan faith , although he ultimately did become a Christian king . Eadbald outraged the church by marrying his stepmother , which was contrary to Church law , and by refusing to accept baptism . Sæberht of the East Saxons also died at approximately this time , and he was succeeded by his three sons , none of whom were Christian . A subsequent revolt against Christianity and the expulsion of the missionaries from Kent may have been a reaction to Kentish overlordship after Æthelberht 's death as much as a pagan opposition to Christianity . 
 In addition to Eadbald , it is possible that Æthelberht had another son , Æthelwald . The evidence for this is a papal letter to Justus , archbishop of Canterbury from 619 to 625 , that refers to a king named Aduluald , who is apparently different from <unk> , which refers to Eadbald . There is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this : " Aduluald " might be intended as a representation of " Æthelwald " , and hence an indication of another king , perhaps a sub @-@ king of west Kent ; or it may be merely a scribal error which should be read as referring to Eadbald . 
 = = Liturgical celebration = = 
 Æthelberht was later regarded as a saint for his role in establishing Christianity among the Anglo @-@ Saxons . His feast day was originally 24 February but was changed to 25 February . In the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology , he is listed under his date of death , 24 February , with the citation : ' King of Kent , converted by St Augustine , bishop , the first leader of the English people to do so ' . The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark , which contains Kent , commemorates him on 25 February . He is honoured together with his wife Bertha on the liturgical calendar of The Episcopal Church on 27 May . 
 = SM UB @-@ 45 = 
 SM UB @-@ 45 was a Type UB II submarine or U @-@ boat built for and operated by the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. UB @-@ 45 operated in the Mediterranean and the Black Seas , and was sunk by a mine in November 1916 . 
 UB @-@ 45 was ordered in July 1915 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in September . UB @-@ 45 was about 37 metres ( 121 ft 5 in ) in length and displaced between 270 and 305 tonnes ( 266 and 300 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She was equipped to carry a complement of four torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and had an 5 @-@ centimeter ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun . As part of a group of six submarines selected for Mediterranean service , UB @-@ 45 was broken into railcar @-@ sized components and shipped to Pola where she was assembled and then launched and commissioned in May 1916 . 
 In five patrols in her six @-@ month career , UB @-@ 45 sank four ships of 15 @,@ 361 gross register tons ( GRT ) . In early November 1916 , UB @-@ 45 was departing from the base at Varna , Bulgaria , when the U @-@ boat struck a mine and sank rapidly . Fifteen of the twenty men on board were killed in the attack ; one of the five crewmen rescued from UB @-@ 45 later died from his injuries . UB @-@ 45 's wreck was located and raised by the Bulgarian Navy in the 1930s with an eye toward rebuilding the submarine . Engineers from AG Weser determined that restoration of the submarine was feasible , but this was never accomplished . Remains recovered from the wreck were buried in Varna after a funeral procession through town in November 1938 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The German UB II design improved upon the design of the UB I boats , which had been ordered in September 1914 . In service , the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow . A major problem was that , because they had a single propeller shaft / engine combo , if either component failed , the U @-@ boat became almost totally disabled . To rectify this flaw , the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines ( one shaft for each engine ) , which also increased the U @-@ boat 's top speed . The new design also included more powerful batteries , larger torpedo tubes , and a deck gun . As a UB II boat , U @-@ 45 could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts , and nearly ten times as much fuel . To contain all of these changes the hull was larger , and the surface and submerged displacement was more than double that of the UB I boats . 
 The German Imperial Navy ordered UB @-@ 45 from AG Weser on 31 July 1915 as one of a series of six UB II boats ( numbered from UB @-@ 42 to UB @-@ 47 ) . UB @-@ 45 was 36 @.@ 90 metres ( 121 ft 1 in ) long and 4 @.@ 37 metres ( 14 ft 4 in ) abeam . She had a single hull with saddle tanks and had a draught of 3 @.@ 68 metres ( 12 ft 1 in ) when surfaced . She displaced 305 tonnes ( 300 long tons ) while submerged but only 272 tonnes ( 268 long tons ) on the surface . 
 The submarine was equipped with twin Daimler diesel engines and twin Siemens @-@ Schuckert electric motors — for surfaced and submerged running , respectively . UB @-@ 45 had a surface speed of up to 8 @.@ 82 knots ( 16 @.@ 33 km / h ; 10 @.@ 15 mph ) and could go as fast as 6 @.@ 22 knots ( 11 @.@ 52 km / h ; 7 @.@ 16 mph ) while underwater . The U @-@ boat could carry up to 27 tonnes ( 27 long tons ) of diesel fuel , giving her a range of 6 @,@ 940 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 850 km ; 7 @,@ 990 mi ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) . Her electric motors and batteries provided a range of 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) while submerged . UB @-@ 45 was equipped with two 50 @-@ centimeter ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes . The U @-@ boat was also armed with one 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) Uk L / 30 deck gun . 
 UB @-@ 45 was laid down by AG Weser at its Bremen shipyard on 3 September 1915 . As one of six U @-@ boats selected for service in the Mediterranean while under construction , UB @-@ 45 was broken into railcar @-@ sized components and shipped overland to the Austro @-@ Hungarian port of Pola . Shipyard workers from Weser assembled the boat and her five sisters at Pola , where she was launched on 12 May 1916 . 
 = = Service career = = 
 SM UB @-@ 45 was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 26 May 1916 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Karl <unk> . UB @-@ 45 , <unk> ' second U @-@ boat command , was assigned to the Navy 's Pola Flotilla ( German : Deutsche U @-@ Halbflotille Pola ) . Although the flotilla was based in Pola , the site of the main Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy base , boats of the flotilla operated out of the Austro @-@ Hungarian base at Cattaro which was located farther south and closer to the Mediterranean . German U @-@ boats typically returned to Pola only for repairs . 
 In mid @-@ July , UB @-@ 45 's first success occurred when in three days she sank two steamers . The first , Virginia , was sunk on the 16th while carrying salt destined for Calcutta . Two men on board the 4 @,@ 279 @-@ ton British ship were lost when she went down 42 nautical miles ( 78 km ; 48 mi ) off Cape Matapan . Two days later , the French ship Ville de Rouen was sunk 120 nautical miles ( 220 km ; 140 mi ) southwest of Cape Matapan . The 4 @,@ 721 @-@ ton Ville de Rouen would be UB @-@ 45 's largest victim . 
 Germany 's conquest of Romania provided the German Imperial Navy with sufficient fuel oil for submarines to operate in the Black Sea . UB @-@ 45 and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and , en route , had to navigate through the Dardanelles , which had been heavily mined by the Allies in the middle of 1916 . UB @-@ 45 joined the Constantinople Flotilla ( German : U @-@ boote der Mittelmeerdivision in Konstantinopal ) on 12 August . 
 The German submarines in the Black Sea accomplished little , sinking only six ships between August and the end of the year ; UB @-@ 45 accounted for two of these while in the Black Sea . On 31 August , UB @-@ 45 sank the 2 @,@ 660 @-@ ton Italian steamer <unk> off Poti . <unk> had been requisitioned by the Imperial Russian Navy and was in use as a transport ship at the time . Two days later , the U @-@ boat torpedoed the 3 @,@ 701 @-@ ton Gioconda , another Russian transport , 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) off Trebizond . Gioconda was the last ship sunk by UB @-@ 45 . 
 At 14 : 30 on 6 November , UB @-@ 45 was departing Varna , Bulgaria , under escort by the Bulgarian torpedo boat <unk> that had cleared a path through Russian mines . At what was thought to be the edge of the minefield , UB @-@ 45 swung around <unk> 's port side directly into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before . A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB @-@ 45 's control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half . UB @-@ 45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck , all of whom were injured ; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack . One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day . 
 In 1932 , the Bulgarian Navy conceived a plan to search for the wreck of UB @-@ 45 with the intent of raising it for restoration as a training vessel , or , at the very least , to recover the sunken U @-@ boat 's 8 @.@ 8 @-@ centimeter ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) deck gun . An additional consideration was the recovery of the remains of UB @-@ 45 's crew . On 19 July 1934 , after a two @-@ year search , Bulgarian minesweepers discovered the location of the wreck , which was resting at position 43 ° 12 ′ N 28 ° 09 ′ E , near the then Bulgarian – Romanian border . UB @-@ 45 's wreck was raised in an operation that cost several times less than the cost of a new 8 @.@ 8 @-@ centimeter gun . The remains recovered were buried on 26 February 1936 in a Varna cemetery , after a procession through the town . 
 Engineers from AG Weser , UB @-@ 45 's German builder , inspected the hulk and determined that repair of the wreck was feasible . A restoration of the submarine to operating condition , as either a training vessel or a military , would cost 21 million leva ( about US $ 250 @,@ 000 in 1936 dollars ) , significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ( $ 680 @,@ 000 to $ 790 @,@ 000 ) that a comparable new submarine would cost . Ultimately , the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair UB @-@ 45 . UB @-@ 45 's deck gun was reused , however , and one of the U @-@ boat 's diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on the training ship Assen .

 Saraya @-@ Jade Bevis ( born 17 August 1992 ) is an English professional wrestler and actress currently signed to WWE under the ring name Paige , performing on the Raw brand . She is a two @-@ time Divas Champion and was the inaugural NXT Women 's Champion in WWE 's developmental branch , NXT . She is the only person to have held both championships concurrently , and as of July 2016 , her 308 @-@ day reign as the NXT Women 's Champion is the longest in the title 's history . 
 In 2005 , at the age of 13 , Bevis made her debut in the World Association of Wrestling , a promotion run by her family , under the ring name Britani Knight . She went on to hold several championships on independent circuits within Europe . In 2011 , she signed a contract with WWE and started wrestling within its developmental systems , eventually debuting on WWE 's main roster in April 2014 . In her debut match on the main roster , she won the Divas Championship , becoming the youngest champion in the title 's history at the age of 21 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bevis was born and raised in Norwich , Norfolk , the daughter of professional wrestlers Ian Bevis and Julia Hamer @-@ Bevis , who once unknowingly wrestled while she was seven months pregnant with Bevis . As a child , Bevis was scared of wrestling because of the injuries her family received and the concept that her parents fought other people for a living . She also intended to become a zoologist . When she was around 10 or 11 years old , her father started running a wrestling training school every month . She took this opportunity to occasionally enter the wrestling ring , where her brothers taught her about wrestling . She did this until she was 13 , when she officially made her debut as a wrestler . At the age of 15 , Bevis worked as a bouncer and bartender at her parents ' bar while they were away . She attended The Hewett School in Norwich , graduating in 2008 .

 Bevis made her debut in 2005 , at the age of 13 , when her father , who was running the show , asked her to replace a wrestler who failed to turn up . Her earliest recorded match was in April 2006 when she , using the ring name Britani Knight , teamed with her mother for a loss in a triple threat tag team match in World Association of Wrestling ( <unk> ) . Knight then allied with Melodi to form a tag team called the Norfolk Dolls ( based on the movie The California Dolls ) and they wrestled in multiple English promotions . The Norfolk Dolls won the new World Association of Women 's Wrestling ( WAWW ) Tag Team Title in June 2007 by defeating the Legion of Womb , but it became inactive due to no title defenses by the Norfolk Dolls . 
 At the age of 14 , Knight sent résumés to numerous wrestling promotions around Europe and earned a chance to wrestle in countries like Scotland , Wales , Belgium , France , Turkey , Denmark , Norway , and Germany , as well as the United States , managing to travel by herself at 14 . She began to compete for singles championships without much initial success . In Scotland , Knight competed for the World Wide Wrestling League ( <unk> ) Women 's Title , but lost to Sara in the tournament finals in September 2007 . In December 2007 , Knight took part in a tournament where the winner would become the first WAWW British Champion , but lost in the finals to Jetta . In 2008 , Knight challenged both Sara and Jetta for their respective titles , but failed in her title bids . 
 Knight went on to achieve more singles success from 2009 . In August 2009 , Knight defeated her mother Sweet Saraya in a two out of three falls match to capture the vacant Herts and Essex ( HEW ) Women 's Championship . Later that month , Knight once again defeated Saraya to capture the WAWW British Title . In November 2009 , Knight captured the Real Deal Wrestling ( <unk> ) Women 's Title from her mother in an elimination match also featuring <unk> Love and Stacey <unk> . In December 2009 , while in HEW , Knight won the RQW Women 's Championship by defeating Jetta in a champion vs. champion match with her HEW Women 's Title on the line . In May 2010 , Knight and her mother challenged Amazon and <unk> for the PWF Ladies Tag Team Championship , which they won . On 17 July 2010 , Knight lost the HEW Women 's Championship to her mother . 
 On 22 January 2011 , Knight captured the German Stampede Wrestling Ladies ' Title from Blue Nikita . Knight also competed at debut show of Turkish Power Wrestling in Ankara in January 2011 , with a losing effort against Shanna for the inaugural TPW Ladies Crown . On 11 March , she recaptured the HEW Women 's Championship from her mother . Knight returned to Pro Wrestling : EVE on 8 April to participate in a two @-@ night tournament to crown the first ever Pro @-@ Wrestling : EVE Champion . In the first night , Knight lost a four @-@ way match to Jenny Sjödin , won a Last Chance battle royal , then defeated Sjödin in the quarter @-@ final match . The next day , she defeated Jetta in the semi @-@ final match , and later in the finals defeated Nikki Storm to win the Pro Wrestling : EVE Championship . On 30 April , Knight won the SCW Ladies Title by defeating champion Amy Cooper . Also in 2011 , Knight won an elimination match to become WAWW Hardcore Champion .

 Bevis , again billed as Britani Knight , debuted for the American all @-@ female promotion Shimmer Women Athletes on 26 March 2011 at the tapings of Volume 37 in Berwyn , Illinois . Teaming with her mother Saraya Knight , as the Knight Dynasty , they were managed by Rebecca Knox and defeated Nikki Roxx and Ariel via disqualification after the other team used the Dynasty 's brass knuckles . This led to the Knight Dynasty receiving Shimmer Tag Team Championship match against the Seven Star Sisters ( Hiroyo Matsumoto and Misaki <unk> ) at Volume 38 , which the Knight Dynasty lost . 
 In October 2011 at Volume 42 , the Knight Dynasty lost another Shimmer Tag Team Championship match against champions Ayako Hamada and Ayumi Kurihara when Saraya refused to help Britani . Saraya then scolded Britani after the match . At Volume 43 , Britani lost to Jessie McKay , which was her third consecutive loss . This led to Saraya disowning ( in storyline ) and slapping Britani , before a brawl between the two ensued and had to be pulled apart . Britani subsequently challenged Saraya to a match , at Volume 44 , where Britani defeated Saraya under no disqualification rules , in what was her final Shimmer match .

 Bevis was first informed that there would be try @-@ outs for WWE when a talent scout came to a show in England . She was unsuccessful in her first try in November 2010 , but succeeded in April 2011 . In September 2011 , Bevis signed a contract with WWE and was assigned to its then @-@ developmental territory , Florida Championship Wrestling ( FCW ) . She made her debut for FCW at a house show on 5 January 2012 , using the ring name Saraya . Her ring name was then changed to Paige , as she made her televised debut in an appearance on the 26 February episode of FCW TV . From March 2012 , Paige formed an alliance with Sofia Cortez , dubbing themselves the " Anti @-@ Diva Army " . Paige made her televised in @-@ ring debut in a tag team match alongside Cortez on 19 March , where the duo lost to Audrey Marie and Kaitlyn . Paige and Cortez then formed a brief association with Rick Victor , winning a mixed tag team match against Audrey Marie and Aiden English . On 6 May , Paige pinned the FCW Divas Champion , Raquel Diaz in a non @-@ title triple threat match , which also involved Audrey Marie . This earned Paige a championship match against Diaz on the 27 May episode of FCW TV , where Diaz 's chicanery led to Paige being disqualified and Diaz retained her title . Dissension was teased within the Anti @-@ Diva Army as Paige moved on to feud with Audrey Marie . Paige lost to Marie on 11 June on FCW TV after Cortez interfered against her , signalling the end of the alliance . On the final episode of FCW TV on 15 July , Paige and Cortez ended their feud with Marie emerging victorious in a no disqualification match .

 WWE went on to rebrand its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling ( FCW ) , into WWE NXT . Paige 's NXT television debut took place on the third episode of the rebooted WWE NXT , taped at Full Sail University , in which she lost to Sofia Cortez . From September 2012 , after gaining a large surge in crowd support Paige went on a winning streak defeating the likes of Audrey Marie , Sasha Banks , Emma , Aksana , and multiple victories over Alicia Fox . 
 On 30 January 2013 , Paige was assaulted by ring announcer Summer Rae , due to Rae 's jealousy of Paige 's popularity and success . On the 13 February episode of NXT , Paige suffered a shoulder injury after brawling with Rae , which Rae exploited later that episode to end Paige 's undefeated streak . After Paige continued to confront Rae , Paige defeated Rae in a singles match , despite Rae 's pre @-@ match attack , on the 1 May episode of NXT . In June , Paige entered a tournament to determine the first NXT Women 's Champion . She defeated Tamina Snuka and Alicia Fox en route to the final , in which she defeated Emma to become the inaugural champion . 
 Paige made her first successful title defense on the 14 August episode of NXT , defeating Summer Rae . In the following months , Paige teamed up with Emma to feud with Summer Rae and Sasha Banks . Paige successfully defended her title against Natalya on 4 December , on NXT , and on 27 February 2014 , at NXT Arrival against Emma . On 24 April , Paige was forced to vacate her NXT Women 's Championship , ending her reign at 308 days , due to being elevated to the main roster and winning the WWE Divas Championship .

 Paige made her unannounced debut on the main roster on the 7 April 2014 episode of Raw the night after WrestleMania XXX , congratulating WWE Divas Champion AJ Lee on her successful title defense at the pay @-@ per @-@ view event . AJ slapped Paige , challenging her to an impromptu match for the championship , which Paige quickly won , making her the youngest WWE Divas Champion in history at the age of 21 , the first Diva to win the title in her debut match and the only woman to hold both WWE Divas and NXT Women 's Championships . Paige had her first successful title defense on 28 April episode of Raw in an impromptu match against Brie Bella , which went to a no contest due to Kane attacking Brie , as Paige escaped . In her first successful title defense on pay – per – view , Paige defeated Tamina Snuka on 4 May at Extreme Rules . 
 She suffered her first defeat on the main roster on the 19 May episode of Raw against Alicia Fox in a non – title match which led to a title match between the two at Payback , where Paige prevailed . In June , Paige started a feud with Cameron and defeated her in two non – title matches . However , Cameron 's tag team partner , Naomi , went on to defeat Paige in a non – title match and was granted a title match Money in the Bank , which Paige won . During this time , WWE was criticized for failing to develop Paige 's character despite being able to do so for Paige 's opponents and for portraying Paige as a vulnerable champion while she was proving herself in the storyline . 
 On the post – Money in the Bank episode of Raw , on 30 June , a role reversal occurred , when a returning AJ Lee quickly defeated Paige in a title match to regain the Divas Championship , in which Paige was initially reluctant to face AJ but agreed to the match per request of the live audience . Despite the championship loss , Paige acted as if she were best friends with AJ during tag matches in which they teamed together . At Battleground , Paige lost a rematch for the Divas Championship to AJ . On the post – Battleground episode of Raw on 21 July , after Paige and AJ won a tag match against Natalya and Emma , Paige turned heel after viciously assaulting Lee . This eventually set up another title match between the two , on 17 August , Paige 's 22nd birthday , at SummerSlam , which Paige won to capture her second Divas Championship . A month later at Night of Champions , Paige lost the title back to Lee in a triple – threat match which also involved Nikki Bella . Paige then formed an alliance with Alicia Fox while still feuding against AJ but after Fox failed to secure Paige a victory in another title match against AJ at Hell in a Cell , Paige dissolved their alliance by attacking Fox the following night on Raw . At Survivor Series , Paige participated in a 4 @-@ on @-@ 4 elimination tag team match where she was the last person from her team to be eliminated , courtesy of Naomi .

 On the 5 January 2015 episode of Raw , Paige became a fan favorite again as she rescued Natalya from a post – match assault by WWE Divas Champion Nikki Bella which led to a non – title match between the two , the following night on Main Event , which Paige won . This led to a tag team match between Paige and Natalya against The Bella Twins at the Royal Rumble , which The Bella Twins won . Following weeks of being tormented by The Bella Twins , Paige unsuccessfully challenged Nikki for the Divas Championship at Fastlane and on the 2 March episode of Raw , after which , the returning AJ Lee saved Paige from a post – match attack by The Bellas . This led to a tag team match , at Wrestlemania 31 , between Paige and AJ against The Bella Twins , which AJ and Paige won in Paige 's Wrestlemania début . On the 13 April episode of Raw , Paige won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Nikki Bella 's Divas Championship and was attacked after the match by Naomi , who injured her in the storyline and made her unable to compete . Paige returned on the 18 May episode of Raw , after a one @-@ month absence , saving Nikki Bella from an attack by Naomi and Tamina Snuka , before attacking Bella as well . This prompted a triple – threat match between Paige , Naomi and Nikki at Elimination Chamber , which Paige lost . In June , Paige went on to unsuccessfully challenge Nikki for the championship in two singles matches on Raw and Money in the Bank , after Nikki and Brie switched places and in a triple – threat match , on 4 July at The Beast in the East , which also involved Tamina . 
 On the 13 July episode of Raw , after weeks of being outnumbered by The Bella Twins and their ally Alicia Fox , Stephanie McMahon called for a " revolution " in the Divas division , introducing the <unk> Charlotte and Becky Lynch as Paige 's allies and NXT Women 's Champion Sasha Banks as an ally of Naomi and Tamina , which led to a brawl between the three teams . The trio of Paige , Charlotte and Lynch , originally dubbed as " Submission Sorority " , was renamed to " Team PCB " , after the first – name initials of each wrestler . The three teams would ultimately face off at SummerSlam in a three team elimination match , which PCB won , after Becky Lynch pinned Brie Bella . On the 31 August episode of Raw , all members of PCB competed in the first ever " Divas beat the clock challenge " , however , Charlotte was named number one contender for the WWE Divas Championship , as Paige fought Sasha Banks to a time limit draw . This led to two matches between Paige and Banks on the 7 and 14 September episodes of Raw , which Banks won , and on the 10 September episode of SmackDown , where the two fought to a no – contest . 
 Charlotte won the Divas Championship from Nikki Bella on 20 September at Night of Champions , and during her celebration the following night on Raw , Paige turned on her partners and cut a worked shoot promo , where she claimed Charlotte was only there because of her father and berated other members of the Divas Division , including Lynch and Natalya , showing signs of a heel turn . This also led to Paige having multiple confrontations with Natalya . Throughout October , Paige , working as a tweener , acted as if she wanted to <unk> with Lynch and Charlotte , only to attack them and solidify her heel turn . In November , Paige became the new number one contender for Charlotte 's Divas Championship , after winning a fatal four – way match , but was unsuccessful in regaining the title , on three different occasions : at Survivor Series , when she lost by submission , the following night on Raw , in a rematch , which ended in a double count – out , and at TLC , when she once again lost .

 Paige took some time off television after her rivalry with Charlotte due to injury , and returned on the 18 January 2016 episode of Raw , once again as a fan favorite , accompanying her former rival Natalya to her match against Brie Bella . Upon her return , Paige started competing in various singles and tag team matches , ending on both winning and losing sides . Paige then aligned herself with fellow Total Divas cast members Brie Bella , Natalya , Alicia Fox and Eva Marie , facing Lana , Naomi , Tamina , Summer Rae and Emma in a 10 @-@ Diva tag team match on the WrestleMania 32 kick @-@ off show , which Team Total Divas would win . After defeating WWE Women 's Champion Charlotte on two occasions , Paige was granted a title match on the 20 June episode of Raw , where she failed to capture the title , and would be attacked by Charlotte and her accomplice Dana Brooke post @-@ match , before being saved by Sasha Banks , this led to a tag team match the following week on the June 27 episode of Raw , where Paige and Banks scored the victory . On 19 July , at the 2016 WWE Draft , Paige was drafted to Raw .

 = Royal Grammar School , Guildford = 
 The Royal Grammar School , Guildford ( originally " The Free School " ) , commonly known as the RGS , is a selective English independent day school for boys in Guildford , Surrey . The school dates its founding to the death of Robert Beckingham in 1509 who left provision in his will to ' make a free <unk> at the Towne of <unk> ' ; in 1512 a governing body was set up to form the school . The school moved to the present site in the upper High Street after the granting of a royal charter from King Edward VI in 1552 . The school 's Old Building , constructed between 1557 and 1586 , is the home of a rare example of a chained library . It was established on the death of John Parkhurst , Bishop of Norwich , in 1575 . Although defined as a " free " school , the first statutes of governance , approved in 1608 , saw the introduction of school fees , at the rate of 4 shillings per annum , along with the school 's first admissions test . During the late 19th century the school ran into financial difficulty , which nearly resulted in the closure of the school . A number of rescue options were explored , including amalgamation with Archbishop Abbott 's School . Funds were eventually raised , however , which allowed the school to remain open , although boarding was no longer offered . 
 Fee paying continued until the school adopted voluntary controlled status under the Education Act 1944 ; thereafter tuition was free and the common entrance examination at 11 was introduced . Soon after , in 1958 , the school expanded with the construction of the New Building in the grounds of Allen House , a building used for a number of years as a boarding house and later as classrooms . Allen House was later demolished in 1964 just after the completion of the New Building . During December 1962 the historic Old Building caught fire , damaging a large part of it , including the two oldest rooms in the school . The damage was so great the reconstruction took over two years . The school became independent and fee paying in 1977 , when the parents and staff raised sufficient funds to purchase the school following concerns about the abolition of grammar school status with the introduction of comprehensive education . 
 The school initially educated 30 of the " poorest men 's sons " , though has since grown to have approximately 900 students , about 300 of whom are in the sixth form . The majority of pupils , approximately two thirds , enter at age 11 in the first form , a few ( 3 @-@ 5 pupils ) enter in the second form at the age of 12 , with the remainder entering at 13 in the third form . Admissions are based on an entrance examination set by the school , and an interview . The school performs well academically , and as such is placed high on published league tables . A number of students achieve places at either Oxford or Cambridge universities . The school partakes in a number of sporting activities , and has enjoyed some success , including finishing within the top two in the Daily Mail Cup twice . The school maintains a grammar school ethos , and as such runs a number of outreach programmes for students from local maintained schools , for which it won the Independent School Award 2010 for Outstanding Community / Public Benefit Initiative . The Headmaster is a member of the Headmasters ' and Headmistresses ' Conference . 
 = = History = = 
 The founding of the school dates to 1509 and the death of Robert Beckingham , a wealthy grocer , a member of the Worshipful Company of <unk> and a Freeman of the City of London . In his will he requested that the parishioners of St Olave 's Church , Southwark , should obtain a licence to endow a chantry priest to say masses for his soul . If they failed to do this within two years of his death , his executors had discretion either to use the property to ' make a free <unk> at the Towne of <unk> ' or to put the income to some other good charitable use . The licence was not obtained within the required time , and so in 1512 , Beckingham 's executors formally conveyed the lands in the bequest to a body of trustees consisting of the Mayor of Guildford and four ' sad and discrete men ' who had formerly been mayors . With the rents , they were to provide a free grammar school in Guildford with a ' sufficient schoolmaster ' , to teach thirty " of the poorest @-@ men 's sons " to read and write English and cast accounts perfectly , so that they would be fit to become apprentices . The school was built in 1520 in Castle Ditch ( now Castle Street ) with financial assistance from Guildford municipal corporation . 
 Over the coming years the school ran into financial difficulty and so " The Mayor and Approved Men " of Guildford petitioned Edward VI to grant them further endowments for maintenance . One of the King 's closest advisers , William Parr , had a particular affection for the town , having himself spent a large amount of time at the King 's manor house in Guildford , and it was he who advised the King to re @-@ appropriate some of the funds arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts to the school . Thus in January 1552 Edward VI ordered that there was to be " one Grammar School in Guildford called the Free Grammar School of King Edward VI for the education , institution and instruction of boys and youths in Grammar at all future times forever to endure " , along with a grant of 20 pounds per year ; the school acquired therewith the right to style itself a Royal Grammar School . The high street site was purchased in 1555 with the construction of the Grade I listed Tudor Old Building starting in 1557 . Construction was completed in 1586 . 
 The death of John Parkhurst , the Bishop of Norwich , in 1575 resulted in the founding of the school 's chained library . In his will he gave " the most parte of all my <unk> bookes whereof shall be made a catalogue as <unk> as I may God <unk> me <unk> " , although obtaining these books was not without its difficulties . Initially the executors of his will used " all the <unk> shifts and practices " to prevent the books from moving to the school . These continued to such an extent that the mayor was forced to complain to the Lord High Treasurer , William Cecil , who summoned the executors to London . Upon a hearing with the executors , the Lord Treasurer referred them to Sir Walter Mildmay who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time . He demanded that the executors give everything left in the Will to the school . Following the ruling , however , the books passed to Edmund Freke , the new Bishop of Norwich , who kept them for himself at his residence . This continued until the school obtained letters from Her Majesty 's Privy Council requiring the books be delivered . The books then finally arrived at the school several years late , although the Bishop kept a number of the best for himself . Since this date the library has been added to , most notably between 1600 and 1800 . The library is housed within the Gallery ( now the Headmaster 's Study ) in the Old Building , with the present bookcases dating from 1897 . The oldest book within the library was printed in Venice around 1480 , with the oldest English book printed in about 1500 bearing the imprint of Wynkyn de Worde . Today the library is one of the few remaining examples of a chained library located within a school . 
 After the granting of the charter , it took 50 years before the first set of statutes to govern the school were completed . The Bishop of Winchester approved the statutes on 16 September 1608 , and they constituted a major change in the way the school was run . Until this point the boys were instructed in English and accounting , but following the statutes lessons were in the subjects of Latin and Greek ; with students required to speak in Latin unless licensed by the master to do otherwise . Admissions following the charter also changed , with " none to be admitted scholar into the said school before he be brought to the schoolmaster of that school , and upon his examination shall be found to have learned the rudiments of grammar , called the Accidence . " All scholars from the town of Guildford were required to pay the master 5 shillings on admission to the school , and for those from outside the town the charge was 10s . The number of pupils at the school was capped at 100 , although this number was rarely reached . The statues also saw the introduction of school fees . Although defined as a " free " school , fees were still charged at the rate of <unk> per annum , paid as <unk> per quarter for the provision of " rods and brooms " , with an additional shilling due on the feast of St. Michael , which was used to pay for " clean , wax candles " . 
 On the death of Joseph Nettles ( an old boy of the school ) in 1691 the school 's first university scholarship was founded . Nettles left eleven acres of land in his will to his daughter Elizabeth Brindley , then following her death to Sir Richard Onslow and his heirs , with the rents from the land to be paid to the school for the maintenance of a scholar at Oxford or Cambridge . The scholar was to be a son of a freeman of the town of Guildford who " should have read some Greek author " and " be well instructed and knowing in the Latin tongue " . His fitness in these fields was tested by the master of the school , and the rectors of the parishes of Stoke next Guildford and St. Nicholas in Guildford . If admitted to any college within the universities , he would then receive the rents from the lands for six years . At the end of six years , upon the scholar 's death , or his removal from the university ( whichever the sooner ) , another scholar was selected . If no scholar was deemed suitable and a vacancy arose , then the next scholar selected would receive the standard yearly rate , along with any rents acquired during the vacancy . The rents arising from the lands were roughly £ 23 per year . The scholarship ceased to be awarded at some point after 1951 . 
 In 1866 the then headmaster Revd Henry G Merriman ( headmaster 1859 – 75 ) purchased Allen House , a large house set in extensive grounds which stood opposite the school . The house took its name from Anthony Allen , Master of Chancery and Mayor of Guildford in 1740 . This was initially used as a boarding house for the school between 1866 – 74 before later being purchased by Surrey County Council in 1921 and was used by the school until its demolition in 1964 . The grounds surrounding the house were purchased in 1914 by HA Powell and donated to the school as playing fields . 
 During the mid to late 19th century the school fell into disrepair and decay . Guildford Municipal Charities established a committee to report into the general condition of the school and the buildings . The committee reported in 1881 that the school had no funds available for repairs and that there were only nine boys " instead of the former ordinary number of 100 " . Various suggestions were made by the Charity Commission to raise funds for the school , including a reorganisation with Archbishop Abbot 's School . The Committee for Maintaining Higher Education in Guildford was established in March 1887 to oppose the Charity Commission 's draft scheme to amalgamate the RGS , Nettle 's Charity and Archbishop Abbot 's School . The committee raised £ 2 @,@ 238 15s . 4d . ( approximately £ 108 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) towards the restoration of the RGS , ensuring its survival . A new Charity Commission scheme came into effect in November 1888 which resulted in the Old Building being restored , and the school 's continuation as a day only school . Several years later under the Education Act 1944 the school adopted voluntary controlled status ; tuition was therefore free and entrance was to be by common examination at the age of eleven . 
 The construction of the New Building started in 1958 in the grounds of Allen House and initially consisted of a gymnasium , assembly hall , dining hall and kitchens , caretaker 's flat , staff common rooms , junior library , cloakrooms and changing rooms , eight classrooms , science lecture theatre , five science laboratories , geography and art rooms , and various offices , stores and smaller rooms arranged in a J shape . The construction of the initial building was finished in 1963 . 
 On the morning of Sunday 2 December 1962 , a fire broke out in the Old Building . It caused widespread damage to a large part of the structure , including the two oldest rooms in the school , School Room and Big School . The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged , either by fire or water from the fire brigade 's hoses . The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years , with the unusually cold winter of 1962 – 1963 delaying the restoration . Lessons , however , continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street . 
 The school became independent in 1977 when the parents and staff of the school , led by the Chairman of the Governors , John <unk> Brown , raised sufficient funds to purchase the school . The RGS then withdrew from the government maintained system , becoming independent and fee paying . This was followed in 1978 by the purchase of Lanesborough Preparatory School which became the junior school , preparing boys for entry to the RGS at either 11 or 13 . 
 More recently in 2003 construction finished on a new Sports Centre with Fitness Suite and All Weather Training Area with Shooting Range . Followed in 2006 with refurbishments to the Old Building site ; the old gymnasium was converted into a Sixth Form Centre and the Victorian science laboratories ( some of the earliest in the country ) converted into the Art School . 
 In 2009 / 2010 the school celebrated the <unk> anniversary of the founding of the school by Robert Beckingham ; numerous events were organised , including a new musical work based loosely on the school hymn " To be a Pilgrim " . This year also saw a visit from Princess Anne , The Princess Royal . 
 RGS Guildford is due to open a campus in Doha , Qatar as part of Qatar 's Outstanding Schools Program . RGS Guildford in Qatar will open initially to boys and girls ages three to seven years old ( pre @-@ school to year 2 ) in September , with the rest of the primary school slated to open in 2017 . According to Bob <unk> the school aims to open two separate single @-@ sex secondary schools - one for girls and one for boys - in Doha by September 2018 . 
 = = Academic = = 
 The school has a First Form ( Year 7 ) intake of four classes ; followed by another intake in the Third Form ( Year 9 ) of two classes , resulting in an average year size of 150 , and a sixth form of about 300 . The pupil teacher ratio is approximately 10 : 1 and is low by general school standards . Class sizes range from twenty to twenty @-@ five in the First Form through to GCSE , but are less than 16 by the final two years . 
 Pupils are required to take at least ten GCSE subjects during Fourth and Fifth forms , which must include Biology , Chemistry , Physics , Mathematics , English Literature , English Language , a Modern Foreign Language and a Humanity ( History , Religious Studies or Geography ) . In recent years the school has been offering the IGCSE in Maths , Biology , Chemistry , Physics , Modern Languages , History and Technology . Boys in the Sixth Form usually take four AS Levels and continue with three to A2 level . 
 It features highly in published A @-@ level and GCSE league tables for England and Wales . Pupils at the school are very successful at gaining places at both Oxford and Cambridge universities ; the school often features within the top 20 in the country with regards to number of places awarded . The school also sends pupils to other universities , including Durham , Imperial and UCL .

 = = = House system = = = 
 There are six houses at the RGS , named after various benefactors of the school : 
 Each pupil is assigned to one of the six houses upon joining the school , and a pupil 's house can be indicated to others by optional colour @-@ related clothing . If someone joins as the second in their direct family to do so , they are put in the same house as their relative . There are inter @-@ house competitions throughout the year ( including rugby , hockey , reading , and chess ) and then at the end of the year the points awarded in each event throughout the year are added up , and the house with most points is awarded the Cock House Cup , which is the traditional name given in British public schools for the in @-@ school competition cup .

 = = = Sport = = = 
 Sport is compulsory for all years during games periods and if selected for a team can require compulsory attendance on Saturdays . A once pupil at the school , John Derrick , is connected with the earliest mention of cricket in England when , in a 1598 court case about an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in Guildford , he gave witness that when he was a scholar at the " Free School at Guildford " , " hee and diverse of his fellows did <unk> and play [ on the common land ] at creckett and other plaies . " 
 In the Michaelmas term rugby union is the main sport , hockey is also played . 
 In the Lent term hockey is the main sport , rugby sevens is also played 
 In the Trinity term cricket is the main sport , athletics is an option . 
 The sports of badminton , cross country running , fencing , football , golf , judo , rowing , sailing , swimming and tennis are available , the list varies by year and term . Sixth form also have a " Spectrum " games option where boys are permitted to use any of the facilities at Guildford Spectrum during the games period . 
 The sport of target rifle shooting is an option among those in the 3rd year and above , but only available to members of the CCF . In the first and second years , before the CCF is an option , there is an air rifle club , which teaches basics before moving onto " rifles . The shooting team have had a lot of success , not only winning both major <unk> competitions , the <unk> and the Country Life , but also finishing an impressive second at <unk> in the Ashburton at the Annual Schools Meeting held at Bisley . 
 The school has enjoyed some success in rugby where it has had first and second places at various levels of the Daily Mail Cup . 
 On 6 February 2016 , Jack Clifford became the first Old <unk> to become a full England rugby international when he made his full debut as a replacement for Chris <unk> during the Calcutta Cup match on 6 February 2016 after 69 minutes . 
 Since 2003 the six Royal Grammar Schools ( Colchester , High Wycombe , Guildford , Lancaster , Newcastle , Worcester ) have held the " RGS Cricket Festival " , hosted by a different school each year . It is based on a round robin format and held over a period of five days towards the end of the Trinity term . 
 The school has no playing fields on the town centre site . A 20 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 ha ) ground called <unk> Brook , located a few miles away in the village of Chilworth , is the location of the rugby and cricket pitches . There is a single AstroTurf located at the main school for hockey and football . The majority of hockey takes place at Guildford Hockey Club , located at Broadwater School in Farncombe or Surrey Sports Park . Athletics and swimming both take place at Guildford Spectrum . 
 = = = Extra @-@ curricular activities = = = 
 Music 
 Music is part of the core curriculum for first to third forms . Pupils take lessons with peripatetic music staff within different disciplines . There is a symphony orchestra composed of students , along with several other smaller classical ensembles . In addition to classical music , there are also a number of jazz and rock bands within the school as well , and to recognise this in addition to the four main music prizes awarded each year , there is an additional contemporary music prize . 
 Drama 
 Drama is offered as an academic subject from the first form , but as well as this numerous plays are staged throughout the year for all year groups in association with local girls schools . The department has a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art auditorium which was converted from the old gymnasium as well as a studio called the Hansford Room sited in the North Building . 
 Period 8 
 Period 8 is a specific set of extra @-@ curricular activities which includes a Combined Cadet Force , outdoor pursuits , Scouts , lifesaving and community service . There are five field days in the year , on which these activities especially take place . Before the third form , pupils have the opportunity to decide between the CCF , outdoor pursuits and the scouts . The Duke of Edinburgh 's Award scheme is ' Hors Combat ' for choice , being available to all students , regardless of their other options , so no longer officially constitutes part of period 8 . 
 Clubs and societies 
 There are several dozen clubs and societies at the school , many of these are where pupils get together to discuss a topic of particular interest sometimes with a guest speaker . Past speakers include the ex @-@ government drug adviser Professor David Nutt . There are a wide variety of different societies ranging from the normal such as badminton and Amnesty International to the more obscure like " <unk> and Remnants " and the " <unk> Society " . 
 Publications 
 The Register ( originally Really Good Stuff ) is a termly newsletter documenting significant achievements at the school . 
 = = Admission and fees = = 
 Initially tuition at the school was free , funded by various endowments and rents obtained from lands the most significant arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts , and the re @-@ appropriation of funds to the school . In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free , however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school . School fees were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent . For the year 2013 / 2014 they are £ 14 @,@ 670 ( approximately € 17 @,@ 900 or US $ 24 @,@ 500 as of March 2014 ) per year excluding lunches . All those wishing to be admitted now take the schools own internal 11 + entrance examination which tests English , mathematics and verbal reasoning and attend an interview with two members of staff . If a place is awarded , entry can de deferred for two years so that boys who are at prep school may enter at thirteen . Those entering at thirteen must take the 13 + Common Entrance or the scholarship examination to confirm their place . 
 Numerous scholarships are available at both 11 + and 13 + for music , academic achievement , and one for art at thirteen . Music and academic scholarships range in value between 5 % – 20 % with one Kings Scholarship available for a 20 % reduction in fees . These scholarships are awarded based on performance in subject specific exams or performances , and an interview with the headmaster for academic or music scholarships , or the presentation of a portfolio of work for the art scholarship . Until the start of the 2009 / 2010 academic year , the value of scholarships was substantially higher with the King 's Scholarships worth 50 % of the fees and a range of lower scholarships between 10 – 30 % . 
 = = Charitable status and public benefit = = 
 The school is a registered charity and currently has three charities registered with the Charities Commission : King Edward VI 's Grammar School ( The Royal Grammar School ) , Guildford , The Royal Grammar School Guildford ( representing the governors ) , and The Royal Grammar School Guildford Foundation After the withdrawal of the Assisted Places Scheme in 1997 the social diversity of the school decreased , as a result the school began to offer bursaries to students whose parents could not afford the fees , with the first bursary offered in 2007 . 
 The school also runs numerous outreach programmes for children from maintained schools in the local area , including a series of master @-@ classes in science , mathematics , technology , languages and drama for local primary school children . Also for primary school children is the Tudor Experience Project where students can explore the Tudor past of the school through a number of activities . At the higher end of the school , numerous careers and university seminars are run for sixth form students from the local area , in addition to Oxbridge preparation classes and practice interviews for local sixth form students . The school also runs several more outreach programmes , and as a result of these initiatives was recently awarded the Independent School Award 2010 for Outstanding Community / Public Benefit Initiative . 
 = = Headmasters = = 
 The post of headmaster ( schoolmaster or just master as it was originally known ) was created following the grant of the Royal Charter in 1552 , with the first appointment made in 1554 . There have been 35 appointments since the creation of the position . Until the re @-@ organisation of the school in 1888 the post was almost exclusively filled by men from a religious background , with the first headmaster being Sir Lawson , a friar from the monastery in Guildford that was dissolved in 1538 . The most notable headmaster was Roger <unk> ( 1569 – 1575 ) , who was Provost of Kings College , Cambridge and three times Vice @-@ Chancellor of the University of Cambridge ; he was headmaster during the time when George Abbot ( Archbishop of Canterbury 1611 – 1633 ) was at the school .

 Former pupils of the school are referred to as " Old <unk> " and are often referred to as " OGs " in official school correspondence . Since the school 's founding , notable alumni have included the 75th Archbishop of Canterbury , Olympic athletes , the longest serving speaker of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom , several members of the parliament of the United Kingdom , a founding member of the East India Company and the 11th Premier of New Zealand .

 = Cyclone Orson = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Orson was the fourth most intense cyclone ever recorded in the Australian region . Forming out of a tropical low on 17 April 1989 , Orson gradually intensified as it tracked towards the west . After attaining Category 5 intensity on 20 April , the storm began to track southward and accelerated . The following day , the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph 10 @-@ minute sustained ) and a barometric pressure of 904 hPa ( mbar ) . Orson maintained this intensity for nearly two days before making landfall near Dampier . The cyclone rapidly weakened after landfall as it accelerated to the southeast . After moving into the Great Australian Bight on 24 April , the storm dissipated . 
 Despite Orson 's extreme intensity , damage was relatively minimal as it struck a sparsely populated region of Western Australia . Five people were killed offshore and damages amounted to A $ 20 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 8 million ) . The storm damaged a new gas platform that explored a possible oil field , believed to contain nearly 200 million barrels ( 32 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of oil . The damage delayed the project for nearly two weeks . The most severe impacts took place in Pannawonica , where 70 homes were damaged . Following the storm , cleanup costs reached A $ 5 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 1 million ) . Due to the severity of the storm , the name Orson was retired after the season .

 Cyclone Orson originated out of a tropical low , monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology , that formed northwest of Darwin , Australia on 17 April 1989 . The system tracked southwest throughout the day before turning due west and strengthening into a tropical cyclone , at which time it received the name Orson . At this time , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) also began monitoring the storm as Tropical Storm 28S . The forward motion of the storm gradually slowed as it intensified and on 19 April , Orson attained Category 3 status on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale , classifying Orson as a severe tropical cyclone . Later that day , as the storm attained Category 4 status , an eye developed . By this time , Orson began to turn towards the southwest and on 20 April , the storm intensified into a Category 5 cyclone with winds of 210 km / h ( 130 mph 10 @-@ minute sustained ) . 
 The JTWC also reported significant strengthening during the same period . They assessed Orson to have attained an intensity equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale on 22 April with winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph 1 @-@ minute sustained ) . Around this time , the storm tracked directly over the North Rankin gas platform . The platform was in the 40 km ( 25 mi ) wide eye of Orson for roughly 40 minutes . A weather station there recorded a barometric pressure of 904 hPa ( mbar ; 26 @.@ 69 inHg ) and wind gusts of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) before the station was damaged . This was , at the time , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the Australian region since records began . It was later surpassed by Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 when that storm attained a pressure of 900 hPa ( mbar ) . By this time , Cyclone Orson was roughly 555 km ( 345 mi ) in diameter . 
 Continuing on a southerly track , accelerating ahead of an approaching cold front , Cyclone Orson made landfall , near Dampier , around 4 : 45 am AWST on 23 April ( 2045 UTC 22 April ) . with winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph 10 @-@ minute sustained ) . The JTWC also reported that Orson had weakened , with winds at landfall estimated at 230 km / h ( 145 mph 1 @-@ minute sustained ) . Tracking at 28 km / h ( 17 mph ) , the weakening storm passed over Pannawonica . Less than 12 hours after landfall , the storm weakened below Category 3 status . By this time , the JTWC was no longer monitoring the system . Around 5 : 00 am AWST on 24 April ( 2100 UTC 23 April ) , Orson weakened to a tropical low while situated over southern Western Australia . Continuing to accelerate to nearly 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) , the remnants of the storm moved over the Great Australian Bight late on 24 April . Several hours after moving back over water , the storm dissipated . 
 The Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses 10 @-@ minute sustained winds , while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one @-@ minute sustained winds . The conversion factor between the two is 1 @.@ 14 . The Bureau of Meteorology 's peak intensity for Orson was 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) 10 @-@ minute sustained , or 290 km / h ( 180 mph ) one @-@ minute sustained . The JTWC 's peak intensity for Orson was 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) one @-@ minute sustained , or 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) 10 @-@ minute sustained . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 As Cyclone Orson approached the coast of Western Australia , residents were urged to prepare for the storm ; people proceeded to clean up litter , secure outdoor items and make sure their disaster kits were stocked . All 200 personnel from a A $ 1 @.@ 5 billion gas platform off the coast were evacuated ahead of the storm . Since Cyclone Orson made landfall in a sparsely populated region , its effects were relatively light compared to its intensity . More than 20 fishermen were reported missing during the storm . 
 On 23 April , a rescue mission with three aircraft recovered roughly 20 fisherman , while one was still missing . Offshore , the storm killed four Indonesian fishermen after their ships sank in swells up to 20 m ( 66 ft ) produced by the storm . The North Rankin gas platform sustained minor damage despite wind gusts reaching 270 km / h ( 165 mph ) and waves estimated at 21 m ( 69 ft ) . The large swells also delayed the find of a major oil field that contained more than 200 million barrels ( 32 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of oil . The waves knocked a drill rig used to find oil out of position ; it would take several days for the drill rig to be repositioned . After an assessment of damage , it was found that the drill rig snapped off and broke the chains of two anchors before drifting nearly 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from the platform . The repositioning and cleanup of the drill rig delayed the project by nearly two weeks . The damages from Cyclone Orson increased the total cost of the platform to roughly A $ 20 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 8 million ) . 
 Upon making landfall , Orson produced a storm surge of 3 @.@ 1 m ( 10 ft ) . This came during low tide , having a height of 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) . Severe erosion was recorded along coastal areas , some losing nearly 20 m ( 66 ft ) of rocks . Wind gusts in Dampier reached 183 km / h ( 114 mph ) and a station near where Orson made landfall recorded a wind gust of 211 km / h ( 131 mph ) . Harbour officials stated that several ships were knocked off their moorings and washed up onshore . In Karratha , the local weather radar sustained roughly A $ 900 @,@ 000 ( US $ 760 @,@ 000 ) in damages . A nearby airport was also damaged . The jetty at Point Samson was severely damaged and eventually removed . 
 The most severe damage took place in the mining town of Pannawonica , where 70 homes were damaged by the storm . Numerous trees and power lines were downed along the storm 's path . Before dissipating , the storm left one additional person missing after contact was lost with his yacht . Later reports confirmed that the missing person drowned during the storm . Twenty people were also injured during the storm , 60 were left homeless and about 1 @,@ 000 were affected . Total damages from the storm were estimated at A $ 20 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 8 million ) and repair costs reached A $ 5 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 1 million ) . Due to the severity of the storm , the name Orson was retired after the season . 
 = Common vampire bat = 
 The common vampire bat ( Desmodus rotundus ) is a small , leaf @-@ nosed bat native to the Americas . It is one of three extant species of vampire bat , the other two being the hairy @-@ legged and the white @-@ winged vampire bats . These species are the only known parasitic mammals . The common vampire bat mainly feeds on the blood of livestock , approaching its prey at night while they are sleeping . It uses its razor @-@ sharp teeth to cut open the skin of its hosts and laps up their blood with its long tongue . 
 The species is highly polygynous , and dominant adult males defend groups of females . It is one of the most social of bat species with a number of cooperative behaviors such as social grooming and food sharing . Because it feeds on livestock and is a carrier of rabies , the common vampire bat is considered a pest . Its conservation status is categorized as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) because of " its wide distribution , presumed large population tolerance of a degree of habitat modification , and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category . " 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The common vampire bat was first classified as <unk> rotundum by Étienne Geoffroy Saint @-@ Hilaire in 1810 . The species received several scientific names before being given its current one — Desmodus rotundus — by Oldfield Thomas in 1901 . It is classified under the subfamily <unk> along with two other species : the hairy @-@ legged vampire bat ( <unk> <unk> ) , and the white @-@ winged vampire bat ( <unk> youngi ) . These three species compose the " true " vampire bats , as opposed to the " false " vampires of the family <unk> and the spectral bat . All three species of <unk> specialize in feeding on the blood of warm @-@ blooded animals . However , the common vampire bat feeds on mammalian blood more than the other two species , which primarily feed on that of birds . The three species resemble each other , but the common vampire bat can be distinguished by its longer thumb . It is the only extant member of its genus , although other fossil species have been described . 
 = = Physical description = = 
 The common vampire bat is short @-@ haired , with silver @-@ gray fur on its undersides , demarcated from the darker fur on its back . It has a deeply grooved lower lip , and a flat , leaf @-@ shaped nose . A well @-@ developed , clawed thumb on each wing is used to climb onto prey and to assist the animal in take @-@ off . The bat averages about 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) long with a wingspan of 18 cm ( 7 in ) . It commonly weighs about 25 @-@ 40 grams ( 2 oz ) , but its weight can drastically increase after a single feeding . The braincase is relatively large , but the snout is reduced to accommodate large incisors and canines . It has the fewest teeth among bats . The upper incisors lack enamel , which keeps them razor @-@ sharp . 
 While most other bats have almost completely lost the ability to maneuver on land , vampire bats are an exception . They can run using a unique , bounding gait in which the forelimbs are used instead of the hindlimbs to propel forward , as the wings are much more powerful than the legs . This ability likely evolved independently within the bat lineage . Three pads under the thumb function like a sole . It is also capable of leaping in various directions , magnitudes and temporal sequences . When making a jump , the bat pushes up with its pectoral limbs . The hindlimbs keep the body over the pectoral limbs which are stabilized by the thumbs . 
 Common vampire bats have good eyesight . They are able to distinguish different optical patterns and may use vision for long @-@ range orientation . These bats also have well @-@ developed senses of smell and hearing : the cochlea is highly sensitive to low @-@ frequency acoustics , and the nasal passages are relatively large . They emit echolocation signals orally , and thus fly with their mouths open for navigation . They can identify a metal strip 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) wide at a distance of 50 centimetres ( 20 in ) , which is moderate compared to other bats . 
 = = Range and habitat = = 
 The common vampire bat is found in parts of Mexico , Central America , and South America . They can be found as far north as 280 kilometres ( 170 mi ) south of the Mexico – United States border . Fossils of this species have been found in Florida and states bordering Mexico . The common vampire is the most common bat species in southeastern Brazil . The southern extent of its range is Uruguay , northern Argentina , and central Chile . In the West Indies , the bat is only found on Trinidad . It prefers warm and humid climates , and uses tropical and subtropical woodlands and open grasslands for foraging . Bats roost in trees , caves , abandoned buildings , old wells , and mines . Vampire bats will roost with about 45 other bat species , and tend to be the most dominant at roosting sites . They occupy the darkest and highest places in the roosts ; when they leave , other bat species move in to take over these vacated spots . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The common vampire bat feeds primarily on mammalian blood , particularly that of livestock such as cattle and horses . Vampire bats feed on wild prey like the tapir , but seem to prefer domesticated animals , and favor horses over cattle when given the choice . Female animals , particularly those in estrus , are more often targeted than males . This could be because of the hormones . 
 Vampire bats hunt at night , using echolocation and olfaction to track down prey . They feed in a distance of 5 to 8 km ( 3 @.@ 1 to 5 @.@ 0 mi ) from their roosts . When a bat selects a target , it lands on it , or jumps up onto it from the ground , usually targeting the rump , flank , or neck of its prey ; heat sensors in the nose help it to detect blood vessels near the surface of the skin . It pierces the animal 's skin with its teeth , biting away a small flap , and laps up the blood with its tongue , which has lateral grooves adapted to this purpose . The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva . 
 They are protective of their host and will fend off other bats while feeding . It is uncommon for two or more bats to feed on the same host , with the exception of mothers and their offspring . 
 = = = Mating and reproduction = = = 
 A male and several females compose a group sometimes called a harem . A dominant male mates preferentially with the females of the roost and sires more of the offspring than other males . Male vampire bats guard roosting sites that attract females , but females often switch roosts 
 During estrus , a female releases one egg . Mating usually lasts three to four minutes ; the male bat mounts the female from the posterior end , grasps her back with his teeth , holds down her folded wings , and inseminates her . Vampire bats are reproductively active year around , although the number of conceptions and births peak in the rainy season . Females give birth to one offspring per pregnancy , following a gestation period of about seven months . The young are raised primarily by the females . Mothers leave their young to hunt , and call their young to feed upon returning . The young accompany their mothers to hunt at six months , but are not fully weaned until nine months . Female offspring usually remain in their natal groups into adulthood , unless their mothers die or move . The occasional movements of unrelated females between groups leads to the formation of multiple matrilines within groups . Male offspring tend to live in their natal groups until they are one to two years old , sometimes being forced out by the resident adult males . 
 = = = Cooperation = = = 
 <unk> food sharing in common vampire bats ( Desmodus rotundus ) has been studied in both the lab and field , and is predicted by kinship , association , and reciprocal help In a field study conducted in Costa Rica from 1978 to 1983 , vampire bats frequently switched between several roost trees and co @-@ roosted with kin and non @-@ kin . Mean genetic kinship within roosting groups was low ( r = 0 @.@ 03 − 0 @.@ 11 ) , but 95 % of food sharing observed in the wild occurred between close kin ( first cousins or higher ) . Most observed food sharing ( 70 % ) was mothers feeding their pups . The non @-@ maternal sharing events were kin @-@ biased suggesting that vampire bats prefer to help relatives . However , non @-@ maternal food sharing is even better explained by frequency of interaction , even after controlling for kinship . Food sharing was only observed when co @-@ roosting association was greater than 60 % . Food sharing appears to require social bonds that require development over long periods of time . Among familiar bats , the amount of food given from bat A to bat B is best predicted by the amount of food given from bat B to A. Reciprocal sharing is most obvious over longer time spans as found in primate cooperation . 
 Vampire bats also participate in mutual grooming ; two bats groom each other simultaneously to clean one another , and to strengthen social bonds . Bats that groom one another also share food . It was suggested that while grooming , a bat might assess the size of its partner 's abdomen to determine if it really needs to eat . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , most bats do not have rabies . For example , even among bats submitted for rabies testing because they could be captured , were obviously weak or sick , or had been captured by a cat , only about 6 % had rabies . However , of the few cases of rabies reported in the United States every year , most are caused by bat bites . 
 The highest occurrence of rabies in vampire bats occurs in the large populations found in South America . The danger is not so much to the human population , but rather to livestock . Dr. Joseph Lennox Pawan , a government bacteriologist in Trinidad , found the first infected vampire bat in March 1932 . He soon proved various species of bat , including the common vampire bat , are capable of transmitting rabies for an extended period of time without artificial infection or external symptoms . Fruit bats of the Artibeus genus were later shown to demonstrate the same abilities . During this asymptomatic stage , the bats continue to behave normally and breed . At first , Pawan 's finding that bats transmitted rabies to people and animals were thought fantastic and were ridiculed . 
 Although most bats do not have rabies , those that do may be clumsy , disoriented , and unable to fly , which makes them more likely to come into contact with humans . There is evidence that it is possible for the rabies virus to infect a host purely through airborne transmission , without direct physical contact of the victim with the bat . Although one should not have an unreasonable fear of bats , one should avoid handling them or having them in one 's living space , as with any wild animal . Medical attention should be given to any person who awakens to discover a vampire bat in their sleeping quarters . It is possible that young children may not fully awaken due to the presence of a bat ( or its bite ) . 
 The unique properties of the vampire bats ' saliva have found some positive use in medicine . A genetically engineered drug called <unk> , which uses the anticoagulant properties of the saliva of Desmodus rotundus , has been shown to increase blood flow in stroke patients . 
 = Augustine of Canterbury = 
 Augustine of Canterbury ( first third of the 6th century – probably 26 May 604 ) was a Benedictine monk who became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 597 . He is considered the " Apostle to the English " and a founder of the English Church . 
 Augustine was the prior of a monastery in Rome when Pope Gregory the Great chose him in 595 to lead a mission , usually known as the Gregorian mission , to Britain to Christianize King Æthelberht and his Kingdom of Kent from Anglo @-@ Saxon paganism . Kent was probably chosen because Æthelberht had married a Christian princess , Bertha , daughter of Charibert I the King of Paris , who was expected to exert some influence over her husband . Before reaching Kent , the missionaries had considered turning back , but Gregory urged them on , and in 597 , Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to Æthelberht 's main town of Canterbury . 
 King Æthelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely , giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls . Augustine was consecrated as a bishop and converted many of the king 's subjects , including thousands during a mass baptism on Christmas Day in 597 . Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601 , along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches , although attempts to persuade the native Celtic bishops to submit to Augustine 's authority failed . Roman bishops were established at London and Rochester in 604 , and a school was founded to train Anglo @-@ Saxon priests and missionaries . Augustine also arranged the consecration of his successor , Laurence of Canterbury . The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a saint . 
 = = Background to the mission = = 
 After the withdrawal of the Roman legions from their province of Britannia in 410 , the inhabitants were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the Saxons . Before the Roman withdrawal , Britannia had been converted to Christianity and produced the ascetic Pelagius . Britain sent three bishops to the Council of Arles in 314 , and a Gaulish bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters . Material remains testify to a growing presence of Christians , at least until around 360 . After the Roman legions departed , pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island while western Britain , beyond the Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms , remained Christian . This native British Church developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland and was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics . Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of Easter and the style of the tonsure haircut that clerics wore . Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of Saint Alban and the occurrence in place names of <unk> , derived from the Latin ecclesia , meaning " church " . There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo @-@ Saxons . The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman civilisation in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes , including the economic and religious structures . 
 It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission , often called the Gregorian mission , to convert the Anglo @-@ Saxons to Christianity in 595 . The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht , who married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588 , and perhaps earlier than 560 . Bertha was the daughter of Charibert I , one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks . As one of the conditions of her marriage , she brought a bishop named Liudhard with her to Kent . Together in Canterbury , they restored a church that dated to Roman times — possibly the current St Martin 's Church . Æthelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship . One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife 's influence , Æthelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries . The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen . Other historians , however , believe that Gregory initiated the mission , although the exact reasons remain unclear . Bede , an 8th @-@ century monk who wrote a history of the English church , recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair @-@ haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people . More practical matters , such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy , and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Æthelberht , were probably involved . The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards who , as pagans and Arian Christians , were not on good relations with the Catholic church in Rome . 
 Aside from Æthelberht 's granting of freedom of worship to his wife , the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors . Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain . Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592 , Æthelberht was the leading Anglo @-@ Saxon ruler ; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium ( overlordship ) south of the River Humber . Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht 's kingdom was well established , and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle , as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks . Lastly , Kent 's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area . There is some evidence , including Gregory 's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission , that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time . The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship , if Bertha 's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen . Frankish influence was not merely political ; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well . 
 In 595 , Gregory chose Augustine , who was the prior of the Abbey of St Andrew 's in Rome , to head the mission to Kent . The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters , of which some copies survive in Rome . He wrote to King Theuderic II of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia , as well as their grandmother <unk> , seeking aid for the mission . Gregory thanked King Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding Augustine . Besides hospitality , the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission . By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops , Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent , as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had the support of his wife 's relatives and people . Moreover , the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent . Chlothar , in particular , needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom 's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings . 
 Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission . Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine 's knowledge of the Bible , so Augustine was evidently well educated . Other qualifications included administrative ability , for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as well as being pope , which left the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the abbey to Augustine , the prior . 
 = = Arrival and first efforts = = 
 Augustine was accompanied by Laurence of Canterbury , his eventual successor to the archbishopric , and a group of about 40 companions , some of whom were monks . Soon after leaving Rome , the missionaries halted , daunted by the nature of the task before them . They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return . Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere . In 597 , Augustine and his companions landed in Kent . They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival : Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin 's for services . Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht 's conversion , but it probably took place in 597 . In the early medieval period , large @-@ scale conversions required the ruler 's conversion first , and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent . Also , by 601 , Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha , calling the king his son and referring to his baptism . A late medieval tradition , recorded by the 15th @-@ century chronicler Thomas Elmham , gives the date of the king 's conversion as Whit Sunday , or 2 June 597 ; there is no reason to doubt this date , although there is no other evidence for it . Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory 's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598 , which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine , but does not mention any baptism of the king . However , it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted . His baptism likely took place at Canterbury . 
 Augustine established his episcopal see at Canterbury . It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop . Bede , writing about a century later , states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop <unk> of Arles , Gaul ( France ) after the conversion of Æthelberht . Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory , however , refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England . A letter of Gregory 's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop , and one dated ten months later says Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory 's command by bishops of the German lands . The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated , and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England , but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place . 
 Soon after his arrival , Augustine founded the monastery of Saints Peter and Paul , which later became St Augustine 's Abbey , on land donated by the king . This foundation has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy , and that by founding it , Augustine introduced the Rule of St. Benedict into England , but there is no evidence the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation . In a letter Gregory wrote to the patriarch of Alexandria in 598 , he claimed that more than 10 @,@ 000 Christians had been baptised ; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place . However , there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived , remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire . Little literary traces remain of them , however . One other effect of the king 's conversion by Augustine 's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased . 
 After these conversions , Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success , along with questions about the mission . Bede records the letter and Gregory 's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ; this section of the History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum . Augustine asked for Gregory 's advice on a number of issues , including how to organise the church , the punishment for church robbers , guidance on who was allowed to marry whom , and the consecration of bishops . Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul , childbirth and baptism , and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass . 
 Further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601 . They brought a pallium for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels , vestments , relics , and books . The pallium was the symbol of metropolitan status , and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop unambiguously associated with the Holy See . Along with the pallium , a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain 12 suffragan bishops as soon as possible and to send a bishop to York . Gregory 's plan was that there would be two metropolitans , one at York and one at London , with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop . As part of this plan , Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury . The move from Canterbury to London never happened ; no contemporary sources give the reason , but it was probably because London was not part of Æthelberht 's domains . Instead , London was part of the kingdom of Essex , ruled by Æthelberht 's nephew Saebert of Essex , who converted to Christianity in 604 . The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London , and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Æthelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see . This theory contradicts Bede 's version of events , however . 
 = = Additional work = = 
 In 604 , Augustine founded two more bishoprics in Britain . Two men who had come to Britain with him in 601 were consecrated , Mellitus as Bishop of London and Justus as Bishop of Rochester . Bede relates that Augustine , with the help of the king , " recovered " a church built by Roman Christians in Canterbury . It is not clear if Bede meant that Augustine rebuilt the church or that Augustine merely reconsecrated a building that had been used for pagan worship . Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter interpretation ; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the Romano @-@ British period were uncovered just south of the present Canterbury Cathedral . The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the Libellus points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism , but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity . 
 Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia to the west . Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him , apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case . According to the narrative of Bede , the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty , and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine 's part . In 603 , Augustine and Æthelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn . These guests retired early to confer with their people , who , according to Bede , advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting . When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops , they refused to recognise him as their archbishop . There were , however , deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement . At issue were the tonsure , the observance of Easter , and practical and deep @-@ rooted differences in approach to asceticism , missionary endeavours , and how the church itself was organised . Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church , damaging his relations with their bishops . Also , there were political dimensions involved , as Augustine 's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king , and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west , into areas held by the Britons . 
 = = Further success = = 
 Gregory also instructed Augustine on other matters . Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use , and feasts , if possible , moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs . One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus , whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr 's life or death . They may have been native Christians , but Augustine did not treat them as such . When Gregory was informed , he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman St Sixtus . 
 Gregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy . He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa . Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries ' conduct . 
 The King 's School , Canterbury claims Augustine as its founder , which would make it the world 's oldest existing school , but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century . Augustine did establish a school , and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the East Anglian mission . Augustine received liturgical books from the pope , but their exact contents are unknown . They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time . The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown , but it would have been a form of the Latin language liturgy in use at Rome . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Before his death , Augustine consecrated Laurence of Canterbury as his successor to the archbishopric , probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office . Although at the time of Augustine 's death , 26 May 604 , the mission barely extended beyond Kent , his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles . Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales , no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders . Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders , and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles . Much of his success came about because of Augustine 's close relationship with Æthelberht , which gave the archbishop time to establish himself . Augustine 's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Church . 
 Augustine 's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine 's , Canterbury , but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church , which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration . After the Norman Conquest the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted . After the Conquest , his shrine in St Augustine 's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels , flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and Mellitus . King Henry I of England granted St. Augustine 's Abbey a six @-@ day fair around the date on which Augustine 's relics were translated to his new shrine , from 8 September through 13 September . 
 A life of Augustine was written by Goscelin around 1090 , but this life portrays Augustine in a different light than Bede 's account . Goscelin 's account has little new historical content , mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches . Building on this account , later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine 's life , often quite fanciful . These authors included William of Malmesbury , who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey , the author ( generally believed to be John Brompton ) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine , and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances . Another problem with investigating Augustine 's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo , a fourth @-@ century saint . Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often , however . During the English Reformation , Augustine 's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost . 
 Augustine 's shrine was re @-@ established in March 2012 at the church of St. Augustine in Ramsgate , Kent , very close to the mission 's landing site . St Augustine 's Cross , a Celtic cross erected in 1884 , marks the spot in Ebbsfleet , Thanet , East Kent , where Augustine is said to have landed .

 Madagascar ( / <unk> / ; Malagasy : Madagasikara ) , officially the Republic of Madagascar ( Malagasy : <unk> 'i Madagasikara [ <unk> <unk> ̥ ] ; French : République de Madagascar ) , and previously known as the Malagasy Republic , is an island country in the Indian Ocean , off the coast of Southeast Africa . The nation comprises the island of Madagascar ( the fourth @-@ largest island in the world ) , as well as numerous smaller peripheral islands . Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana , Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago , allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation . Consequently , Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot ; over 90 % of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth . The island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats . 
 The first archaeological evidence for human foraging on Madagascar dates to 2000 BC . Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and AD 550 by Austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from Borneo . These were joined around AD 1000 by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa . Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time , each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life . The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more sub @-@ groups of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands . 
 Until the late 18th century , the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances . Beginning in the early 19th century , most of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar by a series of Merina nobles . The monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the French colonial empire , from which the island gained independence in 1960 . The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods , termed republics . Since 1992 , the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo . However , in a popular uprising in 2009 , president Marc Ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina . Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014 , when Hery Rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community . Madagascar is a member of the United Nations , the Organisation internationale de la <unk> and the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) . 
 In 2012 , the population of Madagascar was estimated at just over 22 million , 90 % of whom live on less than $ 2 per day . Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state . The majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs , Christianity , or an amalgamation of both . Ecotourism and agriculture , paired with greater investments in education , health , and private enterprise , are key elements of Madagascar 's development strategy . Under Ravalomanana , these investments produced substantial economic growth , but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population , producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class . As of 2014 , the economy had been weakened by the then recently concluded political crisis , and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population .

 In the Malagasy language , the island of Madagascar is called Madagasikara [ <unk> ̥ ] and its people are referred to as Malagasy . The island 's appellation " Madagascar " is not of local origin , but rather was popularized in the Middle Ages by Europeans . The name <unk> was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th @-@ century Venetian explorer Marco Polo as a corrupted transliteration of the name Mogadishu , the Somali port with which Polo had confused the island . 
 On St. Laurence 's Day in 1500 , Portuguese explorer Diogo Dias landed on the island and christened it São Lourenço . Polo 's name was preferred and popularized on Renaissance maps . No single Malagasy @-@ language name predating Madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island , although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited .
