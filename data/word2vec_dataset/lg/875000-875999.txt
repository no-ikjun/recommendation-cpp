 Davis was the 18th player taken in the first round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft , chosen by the New York Mets in his junior year as compensation for the Mets ' loss of Tom Glavine to the Atlanta Braves in free agency . He was drafted for his power bat . Baseball America ranked him the third @-@ best college power hitter in the draft , and The New York Times indicated that he projects to hit 25 – 30 home runs . He signed for $ 1 @.@ 575 million . 
 Davis said , " It was a huge thrill . I was excited to be picked by New York . " He received fatherly advice from his dad , and recalled : 
 He just said they 've got the best fans , and it 's a blast because every game is live or die for them . It 's a great environment to grow up playing baseball , and learning how to play under pressure in front of all those people . He loved it , and I 'm looking forward to it , too . 
 Davis was assigned to the Single @-@ A Brooklyn Cyclones . On defense he excelled , as he committed only one error in 492 total chances at first base , for a league @-@ leading .998 fielding percentage . Uncharacteristically , he struggled on offense , batting only .256 , without a home run in 58 games . Asked the following year to name his most embarrassing professional moment , he replied : " Not hitting one home run in my first professional season . " He noted : 
 It was first time I ever swung wood full time . I was learning how to play pro ball . I had never played every day in my life . That 's totally different .... You have to learn to conserve your energy . In college , you just left it all out on the field every game . In pro ball , you do that and you 'll wear out , because you play every single day . 
 In 2009 , Davis started the year with the St. Lucie Mets . He began to turn it around , hitting .289 with 7 home runs in 59 games . He was then promoted to the Double @-@ A Binghamton Mets , where he came into his own , hitting .309 with 13 home runs , 41 RBIs , and a <unk> slugging percentage in half a season . Mako <unk> , the B @-@ Mets manager , described him by saying : " Very live bat ; the ball jumps off his bat when he makes contact . And as for defense , he 's like a vacuum cleaner . " For 2009 , Davis was named the Mets Organizational Player of the Year . 
 After the season the Mets assigned him to the Surprise Rafters of the Arizona Fall League , where he hit .391 . He was named to the Arizona Fall League 's all star Rising Stars Game . In September 2009 , he played for the gold @-@ medal @-@ winning U.S.A. World Cup team . In the off @-@ season , Baseball America rated him the Mets ’ No. 4 prospect . 
 Promoted to the Buffalo Bisons , the Mets ' Triple @-@ A affiliate , to start the 2010 season , he hit .364 with a .500 on @-@ base percentage in 10 games . 
 For the week ending June 24 , 2013 , Davis was the Pacific Coast League 's Player of the Week . In 2013 , in 10 games with the AAA Las Vegas 51s , he batted .364 with a .500 on @-@ base percentage and a .636 slugging percentage . 
 In his minor league career , he batted .289 , with a .376 OBP and a <unk> slugging percentage in 752 at bats .

 Davis played in spring training with the Mets in 2010 , and led the team with a .480 average as he hit 3 homers . He also sparkled on defense , prompting José Reyes to observe : " People talk about his hitting , but he is one of the best defensive first basemen you will ever see for a player his age . " Many Mets players were rooting for Davis to break camp with the team , but he was sent down to the minors at the end of spring training . On April 19 , however , the Mets purchased Davis 's minor league contract . At that point Davis had played only 65 games in his life above the Single @-@ A level . 
 Davis made his debut at Citi Field on April 19 against the Chicago Cubs . He singled in his first at bat , and had two singles in four at bats in a Mets win . " This is awesome , " he gushed . In a sign of acceptance and welcome , after the victory Mets veteran Jeff Francoeur slapped a shaving @-@ cream pie in his face . Davis had two multi @-@ hit games in his first four games . In his fifth game , on April 23 , he hit his first home run . It traveled 450 feet ( 140 m ) , onto Shea Bridge at Citi Field , and was the longest home run of any Met at Citi Field . He had his first multi @-@ home @-@ run game on May 7 . 
 A gifted , slick @-@ fielding defensive first baseman , in 3 of his first 21 games he made spectacular catches of foul pop @-@ ups , bracing himself against the railing in front of the first base dugout , and then flipping over the railing as he caught the ball . The 6 ft 4 in ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) Davis said : " I 'm going to try to catch any ball I can . I 've got long arms , I guess . I 'd rather end the game , than worry about getting a bruise . " 
 The Met fans began to treat him like a folk hero . The New York Post described him as a " cult hero . " Within a month of his debut , he had become a fan favorite . " I Like Ike " banners began appearing at Citi Field , a phrase once used in the decades @-@ prior presidential campaigns of Dwight D. Eisenhower . Weeks later , he recalled : 
 I had such nerves the first few days . I didn 't even have an approach . It was just see the ball , hit the ball . Only now am I settling in , getting the chance to think about how a pitcher is going to approach me . 
 While the Mets had appeared uncertain whether Davis could handle the pressure of the major leagues as spring training ended , by mid @-@ May — just a month after calling him up to the majors — they moved him to the cleanup spot in the batting order . Manager Jerry Manuel said : " I think we 're going to try to leave him there for a while . I think he 's ready to handle that . " 
 On June 8 , Davis hit his first career walk off home run , against the Padres ' Edward Mujica . His 11 home runs prior to the All Star break tied with Benny <unk> ( 1999 ) for the second @-@ most by a Mets rookie , behind Ron Swoboda ( 15 , in 1965 ) . 
 By September 26 , as advanced defense metrics reflected a " UZR / 150 " ( ultimate zone rating ) of 12 @.@ 5 , putting him second in baseball behind Oakland 's <unk> Barton , sportswriter Mike Silva mused as to whether he could win a Gold Glove . Using the advanced metric Defensive Runs Saved , sportswriter John Dewan indicated that Davis was best in the NL and second @-@ best in baseball , having saved 14 runs , again behind only Barton in the majors . He showed good range , and saved a number of throws with his soft hands on scoops . 
 For the season , he was second among all NL rookies in runs ( 73 ) , doubles ( 33 ) , walks ( 72 ) , extra @-@ base hits ( 53 ) , on @-@ base percentage ( .351 ) , and OPS ( <unk> ) . He was also third in RBIs ( 71 ) and slugging percentage ( <unk> ) , and tied for third in home runs ( 19 ) . 
 He set the Mets rookie record for total bases ( 230 ) . He also tied Lee <unk> 's 1977 Mets rookie record in walks ( 72 ) and Ty Wigginton 's 2003 Mets rookie record in extra @-@ base hits ( 53 ) . He was second among rookies in Mets history with 33 doubles ( behind Wigginton ) , his 19 home runs tied for second @-@ most with Ron Swoboda ( 1965 ) , behind Darryl Strawberry ( 1983 ) , his 71 RBIs tied for second with Wigginton , behind Strawberry , and his 138 hits were 4th on the Mets all @-@ time list ( behind Jay Payton — 2000 , Ron Hunt — 1963 , and Wigginton ) . 
 Davis was named the first baseman on Baseball America 's 2010 All @-@ Rookie Team . He came in 7th in the voting for 2010 NL Rookie of the Year , receiving two third @-@ place votes .

On May 10 , he sustained a left ankle sprain and bone bruise in a collision with third baseman David Wright . The injury occurred on a routine popup near the pitcher 's mound , with Davis rolling his ankle in an injury that didn 't appear very serious at the time .

 Mega Man X2 , known as Rockman X2 ( <unk> ) in Japan , is a video game developed by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) . The game was released in Japan on December 16 , 1994 and in North America and PAL regions in 1995 . It is the direct sequel to Mega Man X , released one year prior . Mega Man X2 takes place in the near future in which humans try to peacefully coexist with intelligent robots called " Reploids " , with some of the Reploids going " Maverick " and threatening daily life . The plot follows the android protagonist X , a " Maverick Hunter " who has saved humanity from the evil Sigma six months earlier . A trio of Mavericks calling themselves the " X @-@ Hunters " has arisen , intent on destroying X by luring him with <unk> of his comrade Zero , who died in the conflict with Sigma . 
 Mega Man X2 features much of the same action @-@ platforming elements as the first installment of the series , following the traditional gameplay of the original Mega Man series . The player is tasked with completing a series of stages by destroying enemies , gaining various power @-@ ups , and winning the special weapon of each stage 's boss . Like the first Mega Man X , this game lets the player dash , scale walls , and obtain access to special abilities via optional pieces of armor . Mega Man X2 is graphically similar to its predecessor as well , but Capcom included the Cx4 in @-@ cartridge enhancement chip to allow for some 3D wireframe effects . The development team was instructed to utilize this technology as much as possible when working on the game . 
 The presentation and gameplay of Mega Man X2 have earned the game a mostly positive critical reception . However , reviewers were dismayed by the lack of changes from the original Mega Man X. Mega Man X2 was included in the Mega Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) in North America in 2006 . The game was also released on Japanese mobile phones in 2008 and 2009 and worldwide on the Virtual Console in 2011 and 2012 for the Wii and in 2013 / 2014 for the Wii U. 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mega Man X2 is set in an ambiguous year during the 22nd century ( " <unk> " ) in which the world is populated both by humans and mechanical beings known as " Reploids " ( replicant androids ) . The mass @-@ produced Reploids are based on a complex , humanoid robot dubbed Mega Man X ( or simply " X " ) who was discovered by the archaeologist Dr. Cain in laboratory ruins many months earlier . Created with human @-@ level intelligence and free will , some Reploids have a tendency towards destructive , criminal activity and are subsequently dubbed " Mavericks " by the government . A military force called the " Maverick Hunters " is formed to halt or prevent such activity . The events of the first Mega Man X game entail the hunter X 's fight to stop Sigma , a Maverick overlord bent on the destruction of humanity . X prevails in his mission , but at the cost of his partner Zero 's life . 
 Six months following the incident , X assumes the head of the Maverick Hunters . X tracks a " manufactured Maverick " bearing Sigma 's emblem to a Reploid factory , where he launches a full assault . However , despite Sigma 's apparent death and X 's recent efforts , the Maverick rebellion continues . Three powerful Mavericks — <unk> , Agile , and <unk> — form a group called the " X @-@ Hunters " and gain control of the North Pole . In the time between Sigma 's demise and the trio 's sudden uprising , <unk> has collected the deceased Zero 's <unk> . After the factory mission , X is assigned to seek and exterminate eight Maverick leaders on a large continent directly south of the North Pole . The X @-@ Hunters contact the Maverick Hunters shortly thereafter and taunt them with Zero 's body . The X @-@ Hunters drift among the eight Maverick locations and attempt to lure X out , each one promising the protagonist a piece of Zero if he can defeat them . 
 The story deviates slightly depending on whether or not the player collects all three of Zero 's parts before heading to the X @-@ Hunter fortification in the North Pole . If the player gathers all the parts , Dr. Cain states he will attempt to reassemble and reactivate Zero using his original control chip . If the player does not succeed , X is informed by Dr. Cain that the X @-@ Hunters have attacked Maverick Hunter headquarters and stolen any collected parts and the control chip . Just as X annihilates the last of the X @-@ Hunters , Sigma reveals himself to have been behind the plot . X leaves the exploding compound and tracks Sigma to the Central Computer , one of the eight locations he visited earlier . If the player fails to collect all of Zero 's parts , X finds both Sigma and the newly rebuilt Zero waiting for him halfway through the stage . X must then beat Zero in combat . If the player does manage to collect all of the parts , a gray @-@ armored clone of Zero accompanies Sigma instead ; the real Zero will then appear at X 's side and destroys the clone . The outcome of either event has Sigma retreating and Zero creating a passageway in the floor to allow X pursuit . When the villain is defeated , X evacuates the facility to rendezvous with Zero outside , and the two watch as the facility self @-@ destructs . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Mega Man X2 is an action @-@ platform game in the same fashion as the first Mega Man X and the original Mega Man series . The player takes on the role of the titular character X , who must traverse and clear a series of eight , side @-@ scrolling stages in the order of the player 's choosing . The protagonist 's initial abilities include running , jumping , scaling walls , dashing along the ground , and firing his chargeable " X @-@ Buster " arm cannon . The player must contend with countless robotic enemies and several platforming hazards such as bottomless pits , deadly spikes , and rising lava . Along the way , the player can pick up extra lives and items that restore health and weapon power . Each stage contains one main boss at the end ; defeating the stage 's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be quickly switched to and used in any remaining levels . Every boss is weak to another 's weapon , so the player may strategize the order in which the stages are completed . 
 Mega Man X2 features a number of extra gameplay elements . At certain times , the player can pilot vehicles including an attack mech in Wheel Gator 's stage and an attack <unk> in Overdrive Ostrich 's stage . Each of the eight stages contains an optional entrance for a battle with one of the three X @-@ Hunters , should the player select that stage when one of them is present . Defeating an X @-@ Hunter will earn the player a piece of Zero , which may affect the storyline late in the game . Like the first Mega Man X , players can locate and acquire numerous hidden power @-@ ups . " Heart Tanks " extend the player 's maximum life bar , " Sub @-@ Tanks " store life energy for later use , and armor upgrade capsules grant a set of new abilities . For example , the leg part will allow the player to perform a dash in mid @-@ air , while the X @-@ Buster part will allow for two charged blasts in succession . When specific conditions are met a special capsule is unlocked in one of the game 's final stages , allowing X to perform a one @-@ shot kill attack ( the " Shoryuken " ) used by characters from Capcom 's Street Fighter series . 
 = = Development = = 
 Mega Man X2 was developed by a team at Capcom , which included artists and designers Keiji Inafune , Sho Tsuge , and Yoshihisa Tsuda . A majority of the people who worked on Mega Man X2 had either been heavily involved with the development of the first Mega Man X or were completely new to the franchise . Though he was largely responsible for designing characters for the original Mega Man series as well as Mega Man X , Inafune was " hands @-@ off " with the art design in Mega Man X2 . He instead began focusing more on directing , producing , and story writing for the newer series beginning with this title . According to Tsuda , it was Inafune 's decision to bring Zero back to life in Mega Man X2 simply because he thought it would be " a shame " to keep him dead . Inafune felt particularly attached to Zero , a character whom he had originally intended to be the main protagonist of the X series . Even though Inafune had mostly relinquished his character design duties in Mega Man X2 , he refused to allow any drastic changes to the illustration of Zero . 
 The game 's antagonists , the X @-@ Hunters , were present as several illustrations within Inafune 's sketchbook prior to the completion of the first Mega Man X. Their aesthetic features were combined to create the basis for Sigma 's design in Mega Man X ; the three designs were then fleshed out as three separate characters for the sequel . The team had planned to include a fourth , female X @-@ Hunter and were going to denote them as the " Four Guardians " . However , both this character and <unk> 's second form were cut from the final version of the game due to a lack of resources . In creating the eight , ancillary Maverick bosses , the development team considered holding public , fan submissions as they had done with several games in the original Mega Man series . They ultimately decided against the idea as they wanted to further establish a contrast between the two series . Tsuge elaborated , " With Mega Man , we wanted the players to feel a certain familiarity with the characters , but it was our intention that the X series would have a world with a more hardcore feel to it . We didn 't want the bosses in this world to be cute products of kids ' imaginations , we needed them to be solid characters refined by professionals . " 
 Mega Man X2 has an in @-@ cartridge enhancement by Capcom called the Cx4 chip , a digital signal processor which allows for limited 3D graphical effects like rotation , enlarging , and shrinking of wireframe objects . The company held weekly meetings devoted to utilizing the chip to its maximum potential in Mega Man X2 . Tsuge commented that the Cx4 was their " greatest adversary to date " as they were instructed to use it in as many ways as possible . The musical score for Mega Man X2 was chiefly composed by Yuki Iwai . Others , such as Ippo Yamada , were involved in some of the game 's sound production . Tsuge wanted the Flame Stag stage theme cut from the game , but the song was kept due to its popularity among the development staff . Additionally , the game 's ending theme was originally its final boss track . As the team felt it was more appropriate for the ending music , it was slightly altered and made as such . The Mega Man X2 soundtrack , featuring the original SNES instrumentals , was included as part of the Capcom Music Generation : Rockman X1 ~ X6 compilation released by Suleputer in 2003 . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Reception for Mega Man X2 has been primarily positive by virtue of its graphics , sound , and a persistently enjoyable gameplay model which critics and fans of the Mega Man series had come to expect . Comparing the game to the first Mega Man X , GamePro 's Chris <unk> called Mega Man X2 " improved in almost every way " . <unk> summarized , " The new C4 chip energizes the already great graphics , the extremely responsive controls are perfect and the levels contain more enemies and hidden locations than any MM cart yet . " Dave Halverson of GameFan likewise enjoyed the level designs and judged the new armor abilities and the music to be better than the original Mega Man X. GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer were appreciative of Capcom 's attempt at expanding Mega Man X2 over its predecessor in all aspects , especially the story , which they called " involving ... with engaging characters " . IGN named Mega Man X2 as the 31st @-@ best game in its list of the top 100 SNES games of all time . " Following up the explosive debut of the Mega Man X series was no small task , " the website abstracted , " but Mega Man X2 accomplished the job admirably . " 
 In spite of the general praise given to Mega Man X2 , some sources complained of its lack of deviation from Mega Man X and earlier games in the series . Both Jeremy Parish and Nadia Oxford of 1UP.com found the game a forgettable entry in the franchise . Parish stated that although it carried the plot of the first Mega Man X forward , the game itself was simply " more of the same ... but not as good " . Oxford commented , " In light of Mega Man 2 's vast improvement over the original Mega Man , Mega Man X2 's feeble innovations are disappointing . " Aside from thinking it was uninspired , Super Play columnists Zy Nicholson and Wil Overton felt that Mega Man X2 did not use Capcom 's Cx4 chip to its maximum potential . The writers were unimpressed by the 3D graphics of the sparse in @-@ game instances where the Cx4 is used , particularly when compared to late @-@ 1994 SNES releases like Donkey Kong Country and Street Racer , neither of which use added cartridge technology . 
 In 2006 , Mega Man X2 was included as part of the North American Mega Man X Collection for the GameCube and PS2 . A version for i @-@ mode and EZweb @-@ compatible mobile phones was made available in Japan between 2008 and 2009 . Mega Man X2 was released on the Wii Virtual Console service in Japan on December 27 , 2011 , in PAL regions on May 31 , 2012 , and in North America on June 14 , 2012 .

 Robert George Dylan Willis MBE ( born Robert George Willis on 30 May 1949 ) , known as Bob Willis , is an English former cricketer who played for Surrey , Warwickshire , Northern Transvaal and England . A right @-@ handed and aggressive fast bowler with a notably long run @-@ up , Willis spearheaded several England bowling attacks between 1971 and 1984 , across 90 Test matches in which he took 325 wickets at 25 @.@ 20 runs per wicket , at the time second only to Dennis Lillee . He is currently England 's fourth leading wicket taker , behind James Anderson , Ian Botham , and Stuart Broad . Willis took 899 first @-@ class wickets overall , although from 1975 onwards he bowled with constant pain , having had surgery on both knees . He nevertheless continued to find success , taking a Test career best eight wickets for 43 runs in the 1981 Ashes series against Australia , one of the all @-@ time best Test bowling performances . He was Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1978 . 
 In addition to the Test arena , Willis played 64 One Day International matches for his country , taking 80 wickets , and was a prolific List @-@ A ( one day ) cricketer with 421 wickets overall at 20 @.@ 18 . With the bat , Willis made little impression as a tail @-@ ender with a best Test score of 28 not @-@ out ( * ) ; however , he managed two half @-@ centuries at first @-@ class level and for a time held a record number of Test not @-@ outs . Willis captained the England team in 18 Tests and 28 ODI matches between June 1982 and March 1984 . Under Willis ' captaincy England won seven , lost five and drew six Tests , and won 16 of the ODIs . Botham recalled Willis as " a tremendous trier .. a great team @-@ man and an inspiration " , as well as the " only world @-@ class fast bowler in my time as an England player . " The editor of Wisden wrote of him in similar terms : " His indomitable service to England is handsomely reflected in his great collection of Test wickets . Although often beset with aches and pains , he never spared himself when bowling for his country . " 
 Retiring in 1984 during a Test series against the West Indies , Willis found later work as a commentator with Sky Sports . He formed a noted commentary partnership with Botham ; however , Willis ' relatively low @-@ key style , in contrast to Botham 's ebullience , meant that from 2006 onwards Willis tended to be used as a second string commentator . He remains an often @-@ heard broadcaster , a published writer and an occasional critic of the modern game .

In 1965 , Willis added his third name " Dylan " by deed poll in honour of American musician Bob Dylan , of whom he is a fan . Willis was educated at the Royal Grammar School , Guildford , playing his early cricket for Stoke d <unk> Cricket Club , where he later became Vice President and Life Member , and two seasons for the Cobham <unk> . He was also an avid schoolboy footballer , but was not a natural athlete and loathed rugby , which was the school 's dominant sport . Willis recalled in 2009 that during his school years " in the winter when the muscled brethren were playing , I used to play football with the school old boys . This taught me how to drink cider and vomit it up on Surbiton station , and other life @-@ altering lessons . " Willis ' bowling potential was rewarded with selection for Surrey Schools and Surrey Colts , under the directorship of <unk> Evans , who would become a close friend .

Willis , 19 years of age , took one wicket for 48 runs in the first innings , and bowled four wicketless overs in the second . He was not called on to bat at all . Two days later , he faced Glamorgan and took three wickets . He played several further Second XI matches through May and June 1969 , before his first @-@ class debut on 6 August . Scotland was touring England that season and had already beaten Warwickshire . Willis took three wickets for 13 runs from 13 overs in his first innings , and two for 37 in his second , to help Surrey to victory by an innings and 97 runs . Willis went on to take 22 first @-@ class wickets that season at 17 @.@ 22 from six matches , placing him 15th in the national averages for that season 's County Championship . Surrey came third in the competition that year . Willis also played two List @-@ A games , but took only one wicket at 52 @.@ 00 . 
 Willis had thus earned a second season at Surrey , and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches , taking 40 first @-@ class wickets at 28 @.@ 37 , and 31 one day wickets at 14 @.@ 65 . Surrey came fifth in the Championship that year . He achieved a noteworthy performance in the Gillette Cup quarter @-@ final against Middlesex . In a high @-@ scoring match , Surrey made 280 for the loss of five wickets . Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240 – 3 , but Willis turned the game , and they collapsed and finished on 272 – 9 . Willis took 6 – 49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award . Despite this , Surrey 's preference for Geoff Arnold and Robin Jackman kept Willis out of the side on occasions . He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham . However , Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey , captain and vice captain of England 's Test side , contacted him via telephone to ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there . Willis , who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling , later credited his call up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich , Willis ' long @-@ term friend , mentor and Surrey team @-@ mate .

 Willis joined England 's 1970 – 71 tour of Australia as a replacement for the injured Alan Ward , and played several warm @-@ up matches for the MCC in December . Wisden records that his " infectious enthusiasm and team spirit played no small part in Australia 's downfall " as England won the Ashes in the subsequent Test series . Willis ' first Test , on 9 January 1971 – the fourth Test of the series , played when the series stood level after two draws and an abandonment – saw him score 15 not out as England batted first and reached 332 . In the Australian first innings he bowled an economical nine overs for 26 runs , while Derek Underwood took four wickets to reduce Australia to 236 . Subsequently , an unbeaten 142 * from Geoffrey Boycott set Australia 416 to win . With John Snow routing Australia with 7 / 40 , Willis was only given three overs to bowl on a pitch " without pace " , but he managed to take his first Test wicket – Ashley Mallett , caught by Alan Knott for six . 
 Willis remained in the team for the fifth Test at Melbourne , and rewarded the selectors with 3 / 73 in the first innings and 1 / 42 in the second as the match was drawn . Of the final two matches , Willis took three wickets in the drawn Adelaide Test , and four more in the final match of the series , a victory at Sydney Cricket Ground which gave England a 2 : 0 series victory . Willis finished his first Test series with 12 wickets at 27 @.@ 41 , and had also taken several " crucial catches " . He was retained for the second match of the two @-@ Test series against New Zealand in Auckland in March , where he took two wickets . 
 = = = Surrey to Warwickshire = = = 
 Willis returned in early 1971 to help Surrey win the 1971 County Championship title . However , friction was developing between the club and himself . During that season Willis took 31 Championship wickets at 28 @.@ 83 , but found himself unable to accept the contract offered to him by the club . Though the county was reluctant to lose him , Willis sought another club . He took two wickets in his final match for Surrey against Hampshire on 11 September 1971 . After turning down Leicestershire and Lancashire he signed for Warwickshire , for whom he had immediate success , with 25 wickets at 29 @.@ 28 , including one five @-@ wicket haul ( taking five wickets in one innings ) . Willis , who under rules then applying was banned from playing for his new county before July , helped Warwickshire win the 1972 Championship , thus achieving the unusual feat of winning the Championship in consecutive years with two different counties . In his final match of the season , he took 8 / 44 to dismantle Derbyshire . His new team won nine of their 20 matches , drew 11 and lost none . He was not selected for the 1972 Ashes series in England , and travelled to South Africa as part of Derrick Robins ' invitation XI in January . On the tour Willis took 13 wickets from the six matches . 
 Willis spent part of the 1973 season injured with one of what would become several recurring complaints . He nevertheless managed 43 wickets in the Championship at 18 @.@ 95 , though his injury barred him from all but one Test against the West Indies cricket team . The West Indies amassed 652 / 8 declared . Willis took four wickets for 118 runs – career @-@ best Test figures thus far – and was the last batsman standing as <unk> Holder and Keith Boyce routed England for 233 and 193 . He then make his ODI debut with two games against the touring side in September , taking 2 / 29 and scoring five not out as England took a one @-@ wicket victory in the West Indies ' first ever ODI match . Willis went wicketless and at conceded 5 @.@ 5 runs an over in the second , which the West Indies won by eight wickets . 
 = = = West Indies , Indian subcontinent and Australia = = = 
 Willis then travelled to the Caribbean as part of England 's winter tour , in what Wisden described as an " automatic selection " however he was to struggle against the top Test side . In the first Test , on 2 February 1974 , he took only one wicket , followed by three in the second , and one for a hundred runs in the final match . He was to struggle against the West Indies throughout his career . His bowling average against them ended at 36 @.@ 34 , whereas against no other team was it above 26 @.@ 14 . 
 Willis then returned to England , to face India and Pakistan , playing in one Test against each . Against India he took 4 / 64 – a career best against that team – and made a Test best 24 with the bat . Pakistan toured in early August , and Willis featured in one Test . He took one wicket for 133 runs . He also played one ODI where he took one wicket caught and bowled as Pakistan achieved a seven wicket victory . At this point , Willis was suffering from a recurring back injury . He played 13 Championship games for Warwickshire during the 1974 season , taking 44 wickets at 21 @.@ 56 including one five @-@ wicket haul . In November , Willis touring Australia during the 1974 / 75 Ashes series , playing in five Test matches . He took 17 Test wickets at 30 @.@ 70 , including a best of 5 / 42 , out of 26 first @-@ class wickets at 31 @.@ 19 overall . He was , however , playing with growing injury concerns which required several painkilling injections . 
 = = = Injury and operation = = = 
 Willis returned to England in January 1975 with a recurring knee injury which had caused him to collapse at a county game early that season , and underwent several operations to correct it . He had surgery on both knees , and suffered a post @-@ operative blood clot . He was forced to use crutches for most of the season , and reflected in 1978 that it was " similar to a 50 @,@ 000 @-@ mile service . " His recovery was particularly tortuous , requiring daily runs around the cricket field and an intensive gym program under the supervision of Dr. Arthur Jackson , an advocate of slow running therapy to build stamina . He played no part in the international arena in 1975 , and managed only four first @-@ class appearances , though these returned a healthy 18 wickets at 18 @.@ 77 . He was not to return to the Test game until 1976 , where he faced the West Indies in two matches in July and August . 
 That year , he had made a comfortable return to the county game from injury – taking 16 Championship wickets at 26 @.@ 12 . He had also scored a career best 43 with the bat . After coming fit from injury , Willis was brought into the squad for the fourth Test against the West Indies on 22 July as part of wholesale bowling changes that saw Brian Close , Edrich , Mike Hendrick , Mike Selvey and Pat Pocock replaced with John Snow , Ward , Bob Woolmer , David Steele and Willis . He took three wickets for 71 runs and then a five @-@ wicket haul in the second innings . This both gave him career best figures and took him past 50 Test wickets . His last four wickets fell in 24 balls at the cost of three runs , described by Wisden as a " fine piece of fast bowling " . Tony Greig 's England , however , struggled to make any impression on the West Indies through the series , Viv Richards dominating with 829 runs across the series . Willis could only take one further wicket in the fifth and final Test , which the tourists won easily . By this time Willis , whose injury troubles were continuing , turned down a coaching opportunity in South Africa in order to not risk his fitness , and went on the dole . 
 = = = Revival in India and the 1977 Ashes = = = 
 Over the winter of 1976 / 77 , England toured India in a five Test series through December to February , and it proved to be a revival for Willis . Wisden recorded the India tour to be the time when he " put to flight any who doubted his right to be acclaimed as one of the world 's foremost fast bowlers . " Willis took 32 wickets for 15 @.@ 09 across the entire tour , 20 of those in the Test matches for 16 @.@ 75 . He took five for 27 in the second Test , and then six for 53 in the fourth – earning him career best Test figures thus far , and taking him past 400 first @-@ class wickets . Four of his wickets came in four overs with the second new ball , " although he received no help from the pitch " . Wisden record that " His 20 wickets in the series stamped Willis as a bowler of genuine pace and in @-@ disputable class . " 
 The 1977 Ashes took place across five Tests between June and August that year , in all of which Willis featured . Preceding them were three ODI fixtures , across which Willis took a total of five wickets at 15 @.@ 80 . The first Test took place on 16 June , at Lord 's . Australia , batting second and looking to take a lead over England 's 216 all out , were dismantled by Willis who returned a career @-@ best 7 / 78 . After a century from Woolmer , Australia fell to 114 / 6 with two more wickets to Willis before the match ended as a draw . Willis ' " hostile speed " gained praise in giving " Australia a real fright . " Wills took four more wickets in the second Test to aid Underwood in restricting Australia 's totals and giving England a nine wicket victory , and was " fast and accurate " for his third Test five @-@ wicket haul , the match in which Botham made his debut . Willis went wicketless in England 's innings victory in the fourth Test , however he took another five @-@ for in the final match , including both Australian openers . His 27 wickets across the series was a record for an England fast bowled facing Australia in England , and his final wicket of the series was his 100th . Around these Test matches , Willis also made 10 County Championship appearances , netting 29 wickets at 19 @.@ 41 . This included a haul of 8 / 32 against Gloucestershire on 20 August , which would remain his best first @-@ class figures for his career . 
 The year ended with Willis on winter tour to Pakistan and New Zealand . Willis took dismissed seven Pakistani batsmen for 27 @.@ 14 runs each , though did not appear in any of the ODI matches . In New Zealand he took a further 14 wickets at 18 @.@ 21 , including 5 / 32 in the first Test . 
 = = = Wisden Cricketer of the Year – 1978 = = = 
 Willis made 10 Championship appearances in the 1978 season , taking 37 wickets at 18 @.@ 27 . He was also third in the national averages for the Benson and Hedges Cup that year , with 16 wickets at 6 @.@ 75 , including four wickets for four runs in one innings . That year also saw Pakistan and New Zealand return to tour England between June and August . Though Botham took Man of the Series for his 13 wickets , Willis also netted 13 Pakistani batsmen for 17 @.@ 92 , including a five @-@ wicket haul in the second Test . He also earned a Man of the Match award for his 4 / 15 in the first ODI . Against New Zealand , Willis took 12 Test wickets at 19 @.@ 08 , and passed 150 career Test wickets with his 4 / 16 in the third Test . 
 Wisden noted Willis ' achievements against Australia in 1977 , stating that " the new @-@ ball fire power of Bob Willis , which yielded 27 wickets , was of special significance in England 's high summer of success . No England bowler of authentic speed can boast a comparable record in a home series against Australia " . In continued : " It was singularly appropriate that team and personal triumph should go hand in hand , for few players have given such loyal and unstinted service to England as the wholehearted Willis ... Happily determination is one virtue Willis does not lack , and his re @-@ emergence as a top ranking fast bowler was well and truly deserved . " Across all first @-@ class matches that year , Willis had taken 65 wickets at 18 @.@ 41 , the most of any season of his career . His 35 List @-@ A wickets was also the second highest he would achieve for a season behind the 45 of 1983 . Wisden also praised him for refusing to partake in Kerry Packer 's World Series cricket , and proclaimed him a Wisden Cricketer of the Year along with Botham , Hendrick , Alan Jones and Ken McEwan . 
 = = = 1978 – 79 Ashes = = = 
 In the winter of 1978 / 79 , Willis travelled to Australia for that season 's Ashes series , which England won 5 – 1 against an Australian team depleted by the rebel Packer tour . The tour commenced with four first @-@ class fixtures against South Australia , Victoria , New South Wales and Queensland . Willis then bowled 1 @,@ 123 deliveries during the Test series , taking 20 wickets at 23 @.@ 05 . In the first Test on 1 December 1978 , he took 4 / 44 and 3 / 69 in a seven @-@ wicket England win . He then took 5 / 44 in the second match on 15 December , as England secured a 2 : 0 lead with a 166 run victory , and following an abandoned ODI match on Boxing Day failed to take a wicket as Australia won the third Test to bring the series to 2 : 1 . 
 The fourth Test followed on 6 January , and England took a 93 @-@ run victory with two wickets to Willis , before a repeat of the first ODI was attempted and again abandoned after 7 @.@ 2 overs . England then played three first @-@ class matches before a second ODI on 24 January . Australia , batting first , were routed for 101 all out by Hendrick and Botham , Willis bowling a wicketless but economic spell of eight overs for 15 runs and four maidens . England reached the target with seven wickets to spare . In the fifth Test that followed , Willis picked up 3 / 41 in Australia 's second innings , however with the bat he made 24 from 20 balls , with three fours and a six . With this cameo knock , he both surpassed his previous best Test score , and passed 1 @,@ 500 first @-@ class runs . 
 In the sixth and final Test , England took a nine wicket victory to seal the series convincingly 5 : 1 . Graham Yallop , the Australian captain , had opened the Australian bowling attack with an old ball and two spinners , Bruce Yardley and Jim Higgs , in an effort to disrupt the English openers . Willis took 1 / 48 and managed to hit 10 runs with the bat . Willis " struck early and decisive blows " through the tournament , although struggled for rhythm between the second and fifth Tests , whereupon he " suddenly regained his fire and rhythm . " In all first @-@ class fixtures of the tour , Willis had taken 34 wickets at 20 @.@ 47 , though this was the third highest average of the England bowlers . His tail @-@ end batting had netted him 115 runs at 12 @.@ 77 . 
 = = = 1979 World Cup = = = 
 In 1979 , England hosted the Cricket World Cup . The host nation played a 13 @-@ man squad : captain Mike Brearley , Botham , Geoffrey Boycott , Phil Edmonds , Graham Gooch , David Gower , Hendrick , Wayne Larkins , Geoff Miller , Chris Old , Derek Randall , Bob Taylor ( cricketer ) ( wk ) and Willis . England , who had no warm @-@ up games , played their first match against Australia on 9 June at Lord 's , who the " breezed " past . Willis took one wicket for 20 runs from his 11 overs , surpassed by Boycott – who would be an unlikely bowling hero during the tournament – who took 2 / 15 . Reduced to chasing 159 , England proceeded slowly , with Brearley 's 44 coming from 147 balls , and they reached the target at 47 @.@ 1 overs . Their next game , against Canada , saw the visiting team routed for 45 with Willis taking 4 / 11 and Man of the Match Old taking 4 / 8 . Boycott and Gooch finished the game within 13 @.@ 5 overs . England 's final Group A match on 16 June saw them defeat Pakistan by 14 runs . Willis hit three fours in his 24 from 37 balls to help England to 165 / 9 , and his one wicket for 37 runs , along with Boycott 's 2 / 14 , helped England keep Pakistan from the target . 
 England thus qualified for the semi @-@ finals against New Zealand . Willis managed to chip one run from his two balls as England reached 221 / 8 , and then took a single wicket to keep New Zealand to 212 . During the match , however , Willis fell to injury . He had left the field before the end of the match with a recurrence of his knee injury and was ruled out of the final . With Pakistan defeated in the other semi @-@ final England were left to face the West Indies in the final at Lord 's on 23 June . England , winning the toss and choosing to bowl first , conceded 286 runs from the 60 @-@ over innings thanks largely to Viv Richard 's 138 * , which Botham recalls as one of his " greatest innings " . Though both Brearley and Boycott reached half @-@ centuries , the hosts were dismissed by Joel Garner 's five @-@ wicket haul , falling to 194 all out , and the West Indies secured the title . Though he missed the final , Willis took seven wickets across the whole competition at 15 @.@ 57 runs each – placing him fifth in bowling average across all the teams , and his economy rate of 2 @.@ 44 runs an over was the fourth best . 
 Willis followed his recuperation from injury by playing the first , third and fourth Test matches against India , taking 10 wickets at 29 @.@ 80 . Between his international appearances , he struggled with nine Championship wickets at 42 @.@ 00 , as Warwickshire came fifteenth in the country . 
 = = = 1980 , Australia and the West Indies = = = 
 The winter of 1979 / 80 and the followed summer saw difficult tours for Willis : the Benson and Hedges World Series Cup and a Test tour in Australia followed by a home series against the West Indies . Willis partook in all seven of England 's matches for the World Series Cup , however he struggled with six wickets at 41 @.@ 00 . England did secure the highest number of points however they were beaten in both finals by the West Indies . In the midst of these matches , England and Australia played three Test matches in which Willis took only 3 wickets at 74 @.@ 66 , going wicketless in third Test . In the county front , however , his position at Warwickshire was reaffirmed as he was appointed county captain . 
 Two ODI matches back in England commenced the West Indies tour , with Willis being included only in the team for the second match , here he took two wickets and two catches in a three @-@ wicket England victory . Wills then faced the West Indies Test team across four matches , the first on 5 June . He took four wickets for 82 runs in the first innings , and five in the second – passing 650 first @-@ class wickets in the process though the Man of the Match award was given to Andy Roberts ' 5 / 72 and 3 / 57 , the West Indies winning by two wickets . The second Test was a draw , though Willis collected three wickets . He only managed 1 / 99 in the third match , however , and equalled his Test best score of 24 with the bat in the fourth Test , passing 500 Test runs in the process . The West Indies secured a 1 : 0 series victory . Willis had marked his improved form with 14 wickets at 29 @.@ 07 , and had fared better in the County Championship that year , taking 27 wickets at 31 @.@ 70 . He had also taken 23 one day wickets that season at 25 @.@ 95 . 
 = = = 1981 Ashes = = = 
 Australia arrived in England for the 51st Ashes series in 1981 . Willis , who was selected to play in all six Test matches , came into the series on a run of good county form . He had played four county matches , commencing with 5 / 61 against Yorkshire on 6 May , and 3 / 58 against Lancashire on 10 June . The first Test took place at Trent Bridge , Nottingham , on 18 June . England , batting first , were cut down for 185 all out thanks to four wickets for Terry Alderman and three a @-@ piece for Dennis Lillee and Rodney Hogg . Only Mike Gatting passed fifty , and Willis was dismissed for a first @-@ ball duck . Willis , however , combined with Dilley , Hendrick and Botham to reduce Australia to 179 all out , with three wickets for Willis . England could not take advantage , however , as Lillee and Alderman shared the host nation 's ten wickets equally between them to leave Australia only 132 to win . Dilley took four wickets and Willis snatched Graeme Wood for eight to reach 200 Test wickets , however the tourists won the match with four wickets to spare . 
 Between the first and second Tests , Willis went back to Warwickshire to face Gloucestershire in a County Championship match , grabbing three wickets . He returned to face Australia on 2 July for the second Test , and England batting first . Thanks to 82 from Peter Willey , and a second half @-@ century from Gatting , together with five runs from Willis , England reached 311 – though Geoff Lawson took seven wickets . Australia surpassed this and were dismissed for 345 , with three wickets for Willis and three for Dilley . The England bowlers suffered from no balls , Willis alone bowling 28 . England declared late in the game on 265 / 8 , and Willis picked up another wicket as Australia reached 90 / 4 at the close of play . Botham , who had captained the side until then , was sacked and replaced by Brearley . Willis , who was struggling for fitness and had a chest infection , was dropped from the side . He sat out a Warwickshire county match and after speaking to Alec Bedser was given back his place in the team on the condition that he played in a 40 @-@ over match , played a Second XI game , and bowled 12 overs in the nets . He succeeded in these tasks , and was tentatively let back into the squad over a spinner . 
 The third Test – Willis ' 60th – came on 16 July , and England were able to level the series 1 : 1 thanks to Botham 's Man of the Match performance ( seven wickets , century and half century ) and Willis 's hostile bowling in the second innings . Willis bowled 30 wicketless overs in Australia 's first innings , and made one one and two with the bat , before returning to bowl with Australia requiring 130 runs . At this point , England had been quoted at 500 – 1 to win the match . Willis began an " inspired " bowling performance , having requested to bowl downhill from the Kirkstall Lane end once Australia were 56 / 1 . Trevor Chappell , Kim Hughes and Graham Yallop were caught by close fielders , while Rod Marsh and John Dyson were caught at fine leg and behind the wicket respectively trying to play the hook shot . Dennis Lillee was caught from the only ball Willis pitched up . Then when Willis uprooted Ray Bright 's middle stump Australia were bowled out for 111 , losing by 18 runs . Willis took 8 / 43 , his career best Test figures . Two of his victims had been out for zero , and three others for single figure scores . John Dyson had top @-@ scored with 34 before Willis removed him . Willey recalled it as an " amazing spell " while Wisden called it " the most staggering bowling of his life when his place again seemed threatened . " 
 England then moved into the fourth Test 1 : 1 in the series . Again batting first , Alderman 's five @-@ for took England to 189 all out , with Willis making 13 runs . He then bowled a wicketless but " stormy " 19 overs " as if the devil were at his heels " and , after England had set Australia a final target of 151 runs , took two wickets which along with Botham 's five @-@ wicket haul dismissed the Australians for 121 and handed England a 29 @-@ run victory and a series lead . Willis played for his county against Middlesex between the fourth and fifth Tests , taking one wicket . He then rejoined his team for the fifth Test at Old Trafford . England reached 231 thanks to partly to a " priceless " 56 @-@ run late partnership between Paul Allott ( 52 ) and Willis ( 11 ) before Willis then led the bowling attack with four wickets to restrict Australia to 130 all out . Another century from Botham took England to 404 , setting the tourists 506 runs to win . Yallop and Allan Border both scored centuries , however three wickets for Willis and two for Paul Allott , Botham and John Emburey dismissed them for 402 , 103 runs short of victory . 
 Willis continued to enjoy some form with the bat with 33 * against Nottinghamshire in the interval between the fifth and final Tests , though he went wicketless . On 27 August , Australia and England met for the sixth Test at the Oval . The tourists reached 352 thanks to a century from Border , while Willis took four wickets and Botham six . A century from Boycott then defied Lillee 's seven wicket haul to take England to 314 , and in reply Hendrick and Botham took four wickets each to set their team a target of 383 runs to win while Willis went without a wicket in the second innings . With half @-@ centuries from Gatting and Brearley , England reached 261 before the match ended as a draw . England were victorious in the series 3 : 1 , and Botham 's efforts led to it being unofficially referred to as ' Botham 's Ashes ' . 
 Willis meanwhile , travelled to India with England in November 1981 for a six Test series against India and one against Sri Lanka . He took 12 wickets at 31 @.@ 75 against India , and three more Test and two wickets ODI against Sri Lanka . Between these international fixtures , Willis had secured 13 County Championship wickets at 28 @.@ 55 , though Warwickshire came bottom of the table . 
 = = = England captaincy = = = 
 Willis began the 1982 county season with five County Championship fixtures , featuring his first half @-@ century with the bat , a career @-@ best 72 , while leading Warwickshire against the touring Indian side on 9 May . He also took two wickets . He also reached his 750th first @-@ class wickets with his 2 / 71 against Yorkshire on 19 May . India were scheduled to play three Tests and two ODI matches that tour ; however , before the matches began , the England selectors dropped Fletcher , the captain . Willis , though seen as an unlikely candidate and ambivalent towards the role , was awarded the captaincy . On 2 June , the new captain faced India as part of the England ODI squad , taking two wickets and effecting a run @-@ out with the help of Botham , who also took four wickets . England restricted India to 193 and achieved victory by nine wickets . The second ODI match followed two days later , and England also won – this time by 114 runs with Willis taking 1 / 10 from seven overs . 
 With two victories under his belt , Willis led his team to the first Test on 10 June . Batting first , he hit a career @-@ best 28 runs in a last @-@ wicket partnership with Allott ( 41 ) worth 70 – an England record against India – which took the hosts to 433 all out . Willis then set about taking apart the Indian batting line @-@ up with 3 / 41 and 6 / 101 to leave England 65 runs to chase , which they reached for the loss of three wickets . Wisden described Willis as " bowling near his fastest " and he took his 250th Test wicket during the match . Willis took two further wickets in the second Test ; however , centuries from Botham and Sandeep Patil , who hit Willis for 24 runs in an over , ensured large innings scores that pushed the match to a draw . Botham followed with his career @-@ best 208 in the third match to take England to 594 all out , and Willis then took 3 / 78 to keep India to 410 . He then declared England 's second innings at 191 to leave India 376 to win , and collected the wicket of Ravi Shastri before India closed out the final day with 111 / 3 . Willis thus completed his first Test series in victorious fashion , with 15 Test wickets of his own at 22 @.@ 00 . Willis was available for only three more first @-@ class games that season , and finished it with a total of 24 wickets at 35 @.@ 08 . He promptly travelled to Australia to lead England in the 1982 @-@ 83 Ashes . 
 Over the winter of 1982 / 83 , England 's winning Ashes team travelled to Australia under Willis ' captaincy . Willis took two three @-@ wicket hauls in two warm @-@ up first @-@ class matches ; however , he was absent from two others and Botham took over the captaincy . By now , continuing injury problems were beginning to plague the ageing bowler 's body . He took 3 / 95 in the first Test as Australia reached 424 in reply to England 's first innings 411 , of which Willis had made 26 . Derek Randall 's century in England 's second innings took them to 358 , and Australia reached 73 at the close of play on the final day for the loss of two wickets , both of which were taken by Willis , leaving the match drawn . Willis picked up 5 / 66 in the second Test ; however , Australia easily reached a low fourth innings target to go 1 @-@ 0 up . The third Test followed a similar pattern , with England replying with two low scores in the face of Australia 's first innings 438 , and Australia taking an eight @-@ wicket win to take a 2 @-@ 0 lead in the series , despite Willis ' three wickets . England achieved what was then the narrowest Ashes victory margin of three runs in the fourth Test at Melbourne , with Willis taking three wickets . Wills commentated on the game that " You never give up and you never think it has gone . " The fifth match ended in a draw , so Australia won the series 2 @-@ 1 . Across the entire tour , Willis took 28 first @-@ class wickets . In the following World Series Cup between England , Australia and New Zealand , England were knocked out despite 14 wickets for Willis at 21 @.@ 14 . 
 Willis returned to Warwickshire for the 1983 season , struggling in the county season with 21 wickets at 36 @.@ 76 in the County Championship , though finding more success in the one day arena with a career @-@ best 45 wickets at 16 @.@ 24 . He also led England in a four Test series against New Zealand , finding greater success with 20 wickets at 13 @.@ 65 including a five @-@ wicket haul . This , coming in the second Test , took Willis past 850 first @-@ class wickets and 300 Test wickets . England won the series convincingly 3 : 1 , and returned to New Zealand over the winter . In the drawn first Test , Willis overtook Fred Trueman 's record England tally of 307 Test wickets when he dismissed Lance Cairns in the first innings . England lost the second Test by an innings despite 4 / 51 from Willis . With the third Test ending as a draw , England lost the series . Willis , with increasing physical and mental weariness and now using hypnotherapy to reduce stress and focus his game , took three wickets in the following ODI series , in which England beat New Zealand 2 : 1 . 
 England played a three Test series against Pakistan in early 1984 , however Willis was unable to contribute more than two wickets in the first match due to injury . He made only five County Championship appearances , taking only nine wickets at 42 @.@ 22 . Willis , with pressure mounting due to injury and poor performances by the England team , was sacked as captain before the upcoming Test series against the West Indies , and replaced by Gower . 
 As a captain , Willis has subsequently received mixed assessment . Botham retained fond memories of Willis the player , but remarked that Willis found it difficult to captain him because the men were of similar age . Willis , often noted for his enthusiasm , became an " effective motivator " as a captain ; however , he was " no outstanding tactical genius " and " towards the end his feelings bordered on disgust at the conviction that some of England 's cricketers accepted failure too readily . Nor was he able to close himself off against media comment . " He was also characterised as a loner in the game , and a reluctant captain grateful to be placed back within the ranks after repeated defeats while he was at the reins . His 18 Tests as England captain saw 7 victories , 5 defeats , and 6 draws , while he led England in 29 ODI matches , winning 16 and losing 13 . 
 Willis played in the next Test series against the West Indies , taking two wickets in the first two <unk> and before the last match played against Derbyshire for his county , taking three wickets . Willis took to the field on 12 July for the third Test and took only two wickets for 123 runs as the West Indies , particularly Michael Holding , " hammered " his bowling – Holding hit 59 from 55 deliveries . Willis conceded 40 more runs from eight overs in the second innings , which Wisden referred to as " the death throes " of his career . He announced his retirement from all cricket immediately after England 's defeat . 
 He finished his career with 325 Test wickets , at the time second only to Dennis Lillee , and 899 wickets in all first @-@ class matches . Only James Anderson , Ian Botham , and Stuart Broad have since surpassed his number of Test wickets for England . Willis also retains the world record for most Test wickets without a single 10 @-@ wicket haul in a match . 
 = = Commentary = = 
 After retiring from playing cricket , Willis established himself as a television commentator on Sky . He began in 1985 , and was initially in partnership with Botham in the commentary box , " his laconic style did not suit all " and he was dropped from the " front @-@ line commentary duties " . Willis appeared on BBC TV Cricket between 1989 and 1990 as a summariser before joining Sky Sports in 1991 . He also appeared on David Tomlinson 's This is Your Life in 1991 , A Question of Sport in 2004 and 20 to 1 in 2005 . 
 Willis has continued to work for Sky Sports , largely commentating in the county game , where he has been vocal on the need for changes in English cricket , particularly through a group of former players known as the Cricket Reform Group . He was critical of Mike Atherton during the England tour of Zimbabwe in 1997 . In 2006 he criticised the then England coach Duncan Fletcher 's practices , England 's performance in the 2006 @-@ 07 Ashes , and was vocal in calling for the retirement of out @-@ of @-@ form national captain Michael Vaughan in 2008 . 
 Willis has attracted detractors due to his somewhat melancholic style . The Independent commentated on the 1995 Texaco Trophy that Willis had " trenchant content , dismal delivery . As a player Willis had trouble getting to sleep . As a commentator he struggles to stay awake . His voice remains on one note – the drone of your neighbour 's mower . " Andrew Smith wrote in 1999 that " On Sky TV , Willis is often discourteous and unfair to players . Didn 't he ever make a mistake ? " though the Daily Mail , for whom Willis had begun writing , defended his commentary style . CricInfo 's launching of two polls on cricket commentary both returned negative views of Willis ' " hyper @-@ critical " commentary . Willis received only 15 % of the vote , above only Dermot Reeve and Allott . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Willis married his wife Juliet in 1980 . They have a daughter , Katie , born in 1984 . In 2005 it was reported that Willis ' relationship with his wife had ended . Willis had previously admitted an extra @-@ marital affair between 1991 and 1995 , when it became public after he was seen leaving the address of secretary Lauren Clark . 
 = Algonquin Round Table = 
 The Algonquin Round Table was a celebrated group of New York City writers , critics , actors and wits . Gathering initially as part of a practical joke , members of " The Vicious Circle " , as they dubbed themselves , met for lunch each day at the Algonquin Hotel from 1919 until roughly 1929 . At these luncheons they engaged in wisecracks , wordplay and witticisms that , through the newspaper columns of Round Table members , were disseminated across the country . 
 Daily association with each other , both at the luncheons and outside of them , inspired members of the Circle to collaborate creatively . The entire group worked together successfully only once , however , to create a revue called No Sirree ! which helped launch a Hollywood career for Round Tabler Robert Benchley . 
 In its ten years of association , the Round Table and a number of its members acquired national reputations , both for their contributions to literature and for their sparkling wit . Although some of their contemporaries , and later in life even some of its members , disparaged the group , its reputation has endured long after its dissolution . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The group that would become the Round Table began meeting in June 1919 as the result of a practical joke carried out by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey . Toohey , annoyed at New York Times drama critic Alexander Woollcott for refusing to plug one of Toohey 's clients ( Eugene O 'Neill ) in his column , organized a luncheon supposedly to welcome Woollcott back from World War I , where he had been a correspondent for Stars and Stripes . Instead Toohey used the occasion to poke fun at Woollcott on a number of fronts . Woollcott 's enjoyment of the joke and the success of the event prompted Toohey to suggest that the group in attendance meet at the Algonquin each day for lunch . 
 The group first gathered in the Algonquin 's Pergola Room ( later called the Oak Room ) at a long rectangular table . As they increased in number , Algonquin manager Frank Case moved them to the Rose Room and a round table . Initially the group called itself " The Board " and the luncheons " Board meetings " . After being assigned a waiter named Luigi , the group re @-@ christened itself " Luigi Board " . Finally they became " The Vicious Circle " although " The Round Table " gained wide currency after cartoonist Edmund Duffy of the Brooklyn Eagle caricatured the group sitting at a round table and wearing armor .

 = = Activities = = 
 In addition to the daily luncheons , members of the Round Table worked and associated with each other almost constantly . The group was devoted to games , including <unk> and poker . The group had its own poker club , the <unk> Literary and Inside Straight Club , which met at the hotel on Saturday nights . Regulars at the game included Kaufman , Adams , Broun , Ross and Woollcott , with non @-@ Round Tablers Herbert Bayard Swope , silk merchant Paul Hyde Bonner , baking heir Raoul Fleischmann , actor Harpo Marx , and writer Ring Lardner sometimes sitting in . The group also played charades ( which they called simply " The Game " ) and the " I can give you a sentence " game , which spawned Dorothy Parker 's memorable sentence using the word horticulture : " You can lead a horticulture but you can 't make her think . " 
 Members often visited <unk> Island , a private island co @-@ owned by several " <unk> " — but governed by Aleck Woollcott as a " benevolent tyrant " , as his biographer Samuel Hopkins Adams charitably put it — located on several acres in the middle of Lake <unk> in Vermont . There they would engage in their usual array of games including Wink murder , which they called simply " Murder " , plus croquet . 
 A number of Round Tablers were inveterate practical jokers , constantly pulling pranks on one another . As time went on the jokes became ever more elaborate . Harold Ross and Jane Grant once spent weeks playing a particularly memorable joke on Woollcott involving a prized portrait of himself . They had several copies made , each slightly more askew than the last , and would periodically secretly swap them out and then later comment to Woollcott " What on earth is wrong with your portrait ? " until Woollcott was beside himself . Eventually they returned the original portrait . 
 = = No Sirree ! = = 
 Given the literary and theatrical activities of the Round Table members , it was perhaps inevitable that they would write and stage their own revue . No Sirree ! , staged for one night only in April 1922 , was a take @-@ off of a then @-@ popular European touring revue called La <unk> @-@ Souris , directed by Nikita <unk> . 
 No Sirree ! had its genesis at the studio of Neysa McMein , which served as something of a salon for Round Tablers away from the Algonquin . Acts included : " Opening Chorus " featuring Woollcott , Toohey , Kaufman , Connelly , Adams and Benchley with violinist Jascha Heifetz providing offstage , off @-@ key accompaniment ; " He Who Gets <unk> " , a musical number featuring the song " The <unk> ' <unk> Blues " written by Dorothy Parker and performed by Robert Sherwood accompanied by " chorus girls " including Tallulah Bankhead , Helen Hayes , Ruth Gillmore , Lenore Ulric and Mary Brandon ; " Zowie , or the Curse of an Akins Heart " ; " The Greasy Hag , an O 'Neill Play in One Act " with Kaufman , Connelly and Woollcott ; and " Mr. Whim Passes By — An A. A. Milne Play " . 
 The only item of note to emerge from No Sirree ! was Robert Benchley 's contribution , The Treasurer 's Report . Benchley 's disjointed parody so delighted those in attendance that Irving Berlin hired Benchley in 1923 to deliver the Report as part of Berlin 's Music Box Revue for $ 500 a week . In 1928 , Report was later made into a short sound film in the Fox Movietone sound @-@ on @-@ film system by Fox Film Corporation . The film kicked off a second career for Benchley in Hollywood . 
 With the success of No Sirree ! the Round Tablers hoped to duplicate it with an " official " Vicious Circle production open to the public with material performed by professional actors . Kaufman and Connelly funded the revue , named The Forty @-@ niners . The revue opened in November 1922 and was a failure , running for just 15 performances . 
 = = Decline of the Round Table = = 
 As members of the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City , inevitably the group drifted apart . By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken . Edna Ferber said she realized it when she arrived at the Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group 's table occupied by a family from Kansas . Frank Case was asked what happened to the group . He shrugged and replied , " What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty @-@ Second Street ? These things do not last forever . " Some members of the group remained friends after its dissolution . Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945 , although her political leanings did strain their relationship . Others , as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott 's death in 1943 , simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another . 
 = = Public response and legacy = = 
 Because a number of the members of the Round Table had regular newspaper columns , the activities and quips of various Round Table members were reported in the national press . This brought Round Tablers widely into the public consciousness as renowned wits . 
 Not all of their contemporaries were fans of the group . Their critics accused them of <unk> , or exchanging favorable plugs of one another 's works , and of rehearsing their witticisms in advance . James Thurber was a detractor of the group , accusing them of being too consumed by their elaborate practical jokes . H. L. Mencken , who was much admired by many in the Circle , was also a critic , commenting to fellow writer Anita Loos that " their ideals were those of a vaudeville actor , one who is extremely ' in the know ' and inordinately trashy " . 
 The group showed up in the 1923 best @-@ seller Black Oxen by Gertrude Atherton . She sarcastically described a group she called " the <unk> " : 
 Groucho Marx , brother of Round Table associate Harpo , was never comfortable amidst the viciousness of the Vicious Circle . " The price of admission is a serpent 's tongue and a half @-@ concealed stiletto . " Even some members of the Round Table disparaged it later in life . Dorothy Parker in particular criticized the group . 
 Despite Parker 's bleak assessment and while it is true that some members of the Round Table are perhaps now " famous for being famous " instead of for their literary output , Round Table members and associates contributed to the literary landscape , including Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning work by Circle members Kaufman , Connelly and Sherwood ( who won four ) and by associate Ferber and the legacy of Ross 's New Yorker . Others made lasting contributions to the realms of stage and screen — Tallulah Bankhead and Eva Le Gallienne became Broadway greats and the films of Harpo and Benchley remain popular ; and Parker has remained renowned for her short stories and literary reviews . 
 The Algonquin Round Table , as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged there , helped earn the Algonquin Hotel its status as a New York City Historic Landmark . The hotel was so designated in 1987 . In 1996 the hotel was designated a national literary landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA based on the contributions of " The Round Table Wits " . The organization 's bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel . Although the Rose Room was removed from the Algonquin in a 1998 remodel , the hotel paid tribute to the group by commissioning and hanging the painting A Vicious Circle by Natalie <unk> , depicting the Round Table and also created a replica of the original table . The hotel occasionally stages an original musical production , The Talk of the Town , in the Oak Room . Its latest production started September 11 , 2007 and ran through the end of the year . 
 A film about the members , The Ten @-@ Year Lunch ( 1987 ) , won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature . The dramatic film Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle ( 1994 ) recounted the Round Table from the perspective of Dorothy Parker . 
 Portions of the 1981 film Rich and Famous were set in the Algonquin and one of the film 's characters , Liz Hamilton ( played by Jacqueline Bisset ) refers to the Round Table during the film . 
 In 1993 , The Algonquin Round Table was featured in The Young Indiana Jones and the Scandal of 1920 where the titular character meet the group and attend at least two lunches . Wonderful Nonsense - The Algonquin Round Table is a documentary produced for the DVD release of that film in 2008 . 
 In 2009 , Robert Benchley 's grandson , Nat Benchley , and co @-@ editor Kevin C. Fitzpatrick published The Lost Algonquin Round Table , a collection of the early writings of the group . 
 In the 2015 Hollywood movie " The Martian " , the NASA JPL engineer Tim Grimes refers to the Algonquin Round Table when describing the crude communication JPL had established with stranded astronaut Mark <unk> : " Thirty @-@ two minute round trip communications time , all he can do is ask yes / no questions , and all we can do is point the camera . This won 't exactly be an Algonquin Round Table of snappy repartee . " 
 = Iso Rae = 
 Isobel ( known as Iso ) Rae ( 18 August 1860 – 16 March 1940 ) was an Australian impressionist painter . After training at Melbourne 's National Gallery of Victoria Art School , where she studied alongside Frederick McCubbin and Jane Sutherland , Rae travelled to France in 1887 with her family , and spent most of the rest of her life there . A longstanding member of the Étaples art colony , Rae lived in or near the village of Étaples from the 1890s until the 1930s . During that period , Rae exhibited her paintings at the Royal Society of British Artists , the Society of Oil Painters , and the Paris Salon . During World War I , she was a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment and worked throughout the war in Étaples Army Base Camp . She and Jessie Traill were the only Australian women to live and paint in France during the war , however they were not included in their country 's first group of official war artists . Following Hitler 's rise to power , Rae moved to south @-@ eastern England , where she died in 1940 . 
 = = Early life and training = = 
 Rae was born on 18 August 1860 in Melbourne , youngest daughter of Scottish emigrants Thomas Rae , a manufacturer , and his wife Janet Love . Rae studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1877 to 1887 , where fellow students included Rupert Bunny and John Longstaff . Her teachers included George <unk> and Oswald Rose Campbell . Rae had some academic success in student exhibitions , receiving prizes and recognition from the judging panel on several occasions , alongside fellow students such as Longstaff , Frederick McCubbin , Jane Sutherland and May Vale . Rae joined , and exhibited with , the Victorian Academy of Arts between 1881 and 1883 . 
 In 1887 , Rae travelled to France and settled in Paris with her mother Janet and sister Alison . They lived there for three years , before the family moved to the artists ' colony at the fishing village of Étaples , in northern coastal France . During this initial part of her career , Rae exhibited works in Australia and New Zealand , though she remained in Europe . Exhibitions in which she was hung included the 1889 New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin , and the 1896 Victorian Artists ' Society , at which several of her landscapes were shown . 
 = = Career = = 
 Rae became a long @-@ term resident at the Étaples colony . There she worked alongside a number of other Australian artists including Hilda Rix Nicholas , Rupert Bunny , James Peter Quinn , Edward Officer , and others who took an interest in the Australians ' work , such as Frenchman Jules Adler . In the late 1890s Rae exhibited regularly at the Royal Society of British Artists and the then Society of Oil Painters . Her works were sometimes of <unk> scenes : she won third prize in her graduating year with a painting " of a Chinese hawker displaying his wares to two girls standing at a kitchen door " , while two decades later exhibited in Australia a picture of a working @-@ class girl carting water at dusk . 
 While living in Étaples , Rae exhibited regularly at the Paris Salon , with her success reported in the Australian press . She had works hung on many occasions , always in what was referred to as the New Salon , including 1908 , 1909 , 1910 , 1911 , 1912 , 1913 , and 1914 . On some of the later occasions , her sister Alison 's works were also included . 
 When World War I broke out some Australians , such as Rix Nicholas , fled to England , however Rae stayed and became , along with Jessie Traill , one of only two Australian women artists to portray the war while living in France . When in 1918 Australia first appointed official war artists , sixteen men were chosen ; Rae , despite having lived in France for the duration of the conflict , was not included . She nevertheless documented prolifically the experience of the war in her adopted home town , creating over two hundred drawings . Most of these portrayed the Étaples Army Base Camp , " the largest of its kind ever established overseas by the British " , which at its zenith housed 100 @,@ 000 , including hospital services for up to 22 @,@ 000 patients . Most of the drawings are of nocturnal scenes , possibly because during the war Rae and her sister both worked in the Voluntary Aid Detachment , and would have had little spare time during the days . Few of these works were acquired by public galleries , with art historian Sasha Grishin arguing that they were " generally regarded as too intimate , too personal and too feminine to be included " . 
 Museum curator Betty Snowden reviewed the collection of World War I drawings . She observed the influence of the post @-@ impressionist movement to which Rae was exposed when first she came to France , and her attention to the regimentation and tensions of camp life . Snowden wrote : 
 In her drawings she uses black outlines filled with flat areas of colour , a post @-@ impressionist technique reminiscent of some of the French poster artists of the late nineteenth century ... The regular patterning of men , tents and buildings in many of the works suggests the control that was imposed by the vast machine of men and modern war . In many drawings there is a strong sense of waiting : waiting to move into battle , waiting for the war to end , waiting to be sent home . 
 The Australian War Memorial holds eleven of Rae 's works , including Cinema Queue , which Snowden described as a " dramatic elevated night scene , with her use of strong glowing light against the deep black of the night , and gouache over pastel used to highlight the glow of lights in the dark . The long line of men waiting reflects a general mood of waiting prevalent in the camp – and suggests that here even entertainment is dark and regimented . " 
 Rae 's mother died in France during the war . The sisters remained there until the 1930s , when Hitler 's rise to power prompted them to relocate to England , where they settled in St Leonards @-@ on @-@ Sea , in Sussex . Rae died on 16 March 1940 at Brighton Mental Hospital in Brighton . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Reviewers ' assessment of Rae 's work varied . She was criticised for allowing her impressionist style to become extreme and visually distracting from her subjects , but that same approach was seen by another critic as charming , and exhibiting " harmonious colour and vigorous effects " . 
 Rae is not included in Max Germaine 's Dictionary of Women Artists in Australia , Caroline Ambrus 's The Ladies ' Picture Show , or Helen Topliss 's Modernism and Feminism : Australian Women Artists 1900 – 1940 . Nevertheless , the secondary market for Rae 's works has been relatively strong , with one work selling in 2012 for 10 @,@ 000 Euros , as against a pre @-@ auction estimate of two @-@ thirds that sum . Works by Rae are held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia , National Gallery of Victoria , and the Australian War Memorial . Outside Australia , her work is represented in the Musée du Touquet , just outside Étaples township . 
 = Ian Smith ( Scottish rugby player born 1903 ) = 
 Ian Scott Smith ( 31 October 1903 – 18 September 1972 ) was a rugby union wing who played 32 Tests for Scotland and two Tests for the British Isles . Born in Melbourne , Australia , and brought up in New Zealand , Smith moved to England and was educated at Winchester College , before studying at Oxford University and later Edinburgh University . At Oxford he took up rugby and was eventually selected for Scotland , for whom he was eligible because of his Scottish parents . He toured with the British Isles ( now known as the British and Irish Lions ) to South Africa in 1924 , and played all four matches in Scotland 's first ever Five Nations Grand Slam in 1925 . He represented Scotland until 1933 when he captained them in their Triple Crown winning season . His 24 international tries , all scored in the Five Nations or Home Nations , was an international record until 1987 and a record for the Five / Six Nations until 2011 . Smith holds joint possession of the Scottish record to this day . 
 Rugby author Richard Bath wrote of him : 
 A member of the famous Oxford quartet of Wallace , Aitken , Macpherson and Smith , the lithe Australian @-@ born wing made his mark as an integral member of the outstanding sides of the 1920s , which won the Grand Slam in 1925 , the year when he scored an astounding eight tries in the first two internationals of the season against France and Wales . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Smith was born in Melbourne in Australia in 1903 , but was brought up in New Zealand . He was educated at Winchester College , where they did not play rugby , and then went to Oxford University . It was at Oxford that he was persuaded to play rugby by GPS Macpherson . Up until then he had only played association football . Macpherson captained Oxford when Smith played in the Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1923 – Smith scored two tries in Oxford 's victory . 
 Smith had Scottish parents and ancestors from the Borders region , and so was eligible to play for Scotland . He was first capped for Scotland when he faced Wales on 2 February 1924 , and he scored three tries on Test debut ; a 35 – 10 victory . He played in Scotland 's remaining 1924 Five Nations matches – against Ireland and a Calcutta Cup match against England – although he was unable to score again . In 1924 he was invited to play for the Barbarians for their annual encounter with East Midlands for the Mobbs Memorial Match . Smith scored one of five tries for the Barbarians during the game to win 15 – 3 . He played in a total of six matches for the Barbarians , including five games during the club 's 1923 and 1924 Easter tours . 
 In the second half of 1924 he was selected to tour South Africa with the British Isles . It was on this tour that the British Isles were first given the " Lions " nickname . Smith played in the first two Tests of the tour , both of them lost . He also played four non @-@ Test matches during the tour , including one against Rhodesia where he scored two tries . Rowe Harding , an opponent with Wales and a team @-@ mate with the 1924 Lions , reckoned Smith to be the " greatest wing of all time " . 
 In 1925 Smith played in all four of Scotland 's Five Nations matches . The first was against France at Inverleith , where Smith scored four tries , and helped them to win 25 – 4 . He then played against Wales at Swansea and scored another four tries ; Scotland again won , this time 24 – 14 . Their third game of the Championship was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road , and although Smith was unable to score this time , Scotland still won 14 – 8 . Scotland 's last match of the Championship was against England at Murrayfield Stadium . This was the first match ever played at Murrayfield , and was watched by over 70 @,@ 000 spectators . Although Smith did not score himself , he was involved in a crucial Scottish try : the ball was passed through several hands before Smith passed to Johnnie Wallace who scored in the right @-@ hand corner . English supporters claimed Smith had put his foot into touch , but the Welsh referee disagreed and awarded the try . Eventually Scotland triumphed 14 – 11 to go undefeated and claim their first ever Five Nations Grand Slam . Smith 's eight tries for a single Championship equalled the record set by Cyril Lowe in 1914 and remains an individual record as of 2014 . 
 He continued to play for Scotland throughout the 1920s . He played all four Scotland matches in the 1926 Five Nations , and scored two tries against England at Twickenham ; his only tries of the Championship . He played three matches in 1927 , this times scoring four tries , two against France and two against England . In both 1926 and 1927 Scotland shared the Five Nations Championship with Ireland . Smith did not play in 1928 , but returned in 1929 , when Scotland won the Five Nations again . He played all four matches , and scored three tries , two against England . 
 In 1930 he played three Five Nations ' matches , missing the England game , and did not score any tries . He did play all four matches in 1931 , and scored his only tries of the Championship in the game against England . This was the fourth time he scored two tries in a match against England . In January 1932 Smith played for Scotland against South Africa , which was won 6 – 3 by South Africa . By 1932 France had been ejected from the Championship due to allegations of professionalism , and the four Home Nations returned to only playing one another for the International Championship . Smith played all three matches in 1932 , but scored only once , against England . 
 In 1933 , Smith captained Scotland for the Home Nations Championship . Because of his background of playing association football , team mate James Henderson said of Smith : 
 He was great , of course , ' The Flying Scotsman ' , but when he was our captain in the 1933 Triple Crown success , we never had team talks before the game . He would just tell us to get on with it ; no great plans or anything , because he didn 't know much about the game . " 
 Smith played in all three matches during the Championship , and scored one try when they played Wales in February . They played Ireland last after the planned match had been cancelled because of a blizzard . They won the match 8 – 6 and secured the Championship and the Triple Crown . It was Smith 's last match for Scotland . 
 He studied accounting at the University of Edinburgh , and served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps during the Second World War . Following the war he practised law , before retiring to Kelso in the Scottish Borders . In 2013 Smith was included in the second group of inductees into the Scottish Rugby Hall of Fame . 
 = = Statistics and character = = 
 Smith played a total of 32 Tests for Scotland , and scored 24 tries , which still gives him a share of the Scottish record with Tony Stanger . Smith 's record for international tries was not beaten until 1987 when it was overtaken by Australian David Campese . Remarkably , Smith 's first 17 tries were scored in only 14 Test matches . His 24 career tries in the Five Nations – now Six Nations – remained a record until first equalled and then surpassed by Ireland 's Brian O 'Driscoll in 2011 . Smith spent much of his playing career playing in the backline with GPS Macpherson ; 21 of Smith 's 24 Scotland tries were scored outside the three @-@ quarter Macpherson . When Smith scored four tries against France in 1925 , Macpherson contributed to all those scores . 
 Author Richard Bath wrote : 
 An exuberant young man , who once famously drove his car down an Edinburgh pavement after a post @-@ international drinking binge , Smith held the record for tries scored ( 24 ) , until he was overtaken by Australia 's David Campese , 55 years after Smith retired to concentrate on his career as a solicitor . 
 = Roma @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Roma class was a pair of ironclad warships built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1860s and 1870s . The class comprised two ships , Roma and Venezia . Roma was a broadside ironclad armed with five 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) and twelve 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) guns , while Venezia was converted into a central battery ship during construction , armed with a much more powerful battery of eighteen 10 @-@ inch guns . Neither ship had an eventful career , due in large part to their rapid shift to obsolescence . Venezia and Roma were withdrawn from service for auxiliary duties in 1880 and 1890 , respectively . Both were stricken from the naval register in 1895 and broken up for scrap the following year , Roma having been badly damaged in a fire in 1895 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Roma class was designed by Insp. Eng . Giuseppe De Luca , who initially planned to build both ships as broadside ironclads . By this time , however , other navies had begun to build central battery ships , which concentrated a smaller number of guns in an armored casemate that had limited capability for end @-@ on fire . This change allowed the ship to be shorter , which in turn required less armor and made the ship more maneuverable . As a result , De Luca re @-@ designed the second ship of the class , Venezia , into a central battery ironclad while she was under construction . 
 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 The ships of the Roma class had wooden hulls , though they did incorporate some iron in their construction . The two ships varied slightly in their dimensions , a result of Venezia having been converted into a central battery ship during construction . Roma was 79 @.@ 67 meters ( 261 @.@ 4 ft ) long between perpendiculars ; she had a beam of 17 @.@ 33 m ( 56 @.@ 9 ft ) and an average draft of 7 @.@ 57 m ( 24 @.@ 8 ft ) . Venezia was 79 @.@ 65 m ( 261 @.@ 3 ft ) between perpendiculars , with a beam of 17 @.@ 48 m ( 57 @.@ 3 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 6 m ( 25 ft ) . Roma displaced 5 @,@ 698 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 608 long tons ; 6 @,@ 281 short tons ) normally , while Venezia displaced 5 @,@ 722 t ( 5 @,@ 632 long tons ; 6 @,@ 307 short tons ) . Both ships displaced 6 @,@ 151 t ( 6 @,@ 054 long tons ; 6 @,@ 780 short tons ) at full load . The ships had a crew of 549 – 551 officers and men . 
 The ships ' propulsion system consisted of one single @-@ expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by six coal @-@ fired , cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers . The boilers were trunked into a single funnel amidships . The engines produced a top speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) from 3 @,@ 670 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 740 kW ) . They could steam for 1 @,@ 940 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 590 km ; 2 @,@ 230 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ships were fitted with a three @-@ masted barque rig to supplement the steam engine for long distance cruising . Each ship had 31 @,@ 833 square feet ( 2 @,@ 957 @.@ 4 m2 ) of sail area . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Roma was a broadside ironclad , and she was armed with a main battery of five 10 in ( 254 mm ) guns and twelve 8 in ( 200 mm ) guns . Venezia was completed as a central battery ship , with a battery of eighteen 10 in guns placed in an armored casemate . Both ships had their armament revised throughout their careers . In 1874 – 75 , the ships ' batteries were replaced with eleven 10 in guns for Roma and eight 10 in and one 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) for Venezia . From 1886 , Roma carried eleven 220 mm guns ; four years later her armament was reduced to five 8 in ( 200 mm ) guns . Venezia was converted into a training ship in 1881 , and was equipped with four 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns and four 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) guns . 
 Both ships were protected by wrought iron belt armor that was 5 @.@ 9 in ( 150 mm ) thick and extended for the entire length of the hull at the waterline . Venezia 's casemate had 4 @.@ 75 in ( 121 mm ) of wrought iron protecting the guns .

 The two ships , completed too late to see action in the Third Italian War of Independence , had uneventful careers . Roma was obsolescent by the time she entered service , having been superseded by more advanced central battery ships . Venezia was modified during construction into a central battery ship , but the changes necessitated lengthy delays . Ironically , by the time she was completed , the Italian navy had moved on to yet further advanced turret ships like the Caio Duilio class . Roma was mobilized during the Franco @-@ Prussian War , during which Italy took advantage of the French defeat to seize Rome . Roma and the rest of the fleet was to attack the port of Civitavecchia , but the fleet was unable to assemble sufficient forces for the operation . 
 In 1880 , Roma took part in a naval demonstration off Ragusa in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro . The following year , she was involved in a collision with the ironclad Principe Amedeo , though neither ship was damaged . That year , Venezia was converted into a torpedo training ship , while Roma remained in service until 1890 , when she became a guard ship at La Spezia . In 1895 , both ships were stricken from the naval register . Venezia was broken up for scrap the following year , but Roma was converted into a depot ship in La Spezia . On 28 July 1896 , she was set on fire by a lightning strike and badly burned . The damage proved to be beyond economical repair , and so she was broken up for scrap .

 = = Synopsis = = 
 In the cold open , Dwight tries to test Ryan with riddles found on a website , but is angered when Ryan knows all the answers before he even finishes talking . 
 Ryan Howard ( B. J. Novak ) plans to go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) . Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight 's beet farm to both teach and haze . When Ryan accuses him of trying to college frat the situation , Dwight snaps at him , saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows everything , and must think otherwise to sell .

 This episode was the first full episode of the series directed by Randall Einhorn . Einhorn had previously directed all ten webisodes of the spin @-@ off mini @-@ series " The Accountants " . " Initiation " was written by B. J. Novak , who also acts for the show as Ryan Howard . 
 The episode was filmed before " Grief Counseling " , but it aired after it . There were rumors that " Initiation " was supposed to air before " Grief Counseling " , but it turned out the location of the beet farm was only available that week . Although the idea for writer Michael Schur to be Dwight 's cousin Mose had been a joke among the writers since the first season , B. J. Novak pitched the idea when writing " Initiation " . Schur had to grow out his beard for three months and wear wool clothes on a hot day as part of his character . Mose was based on an actual participant in the UPN reality show Amish in the City . In this episode , Jim was seen singing Lovefool by The Cardigans . The song playing in Dwight 's car when he and Ryan are driving to the beet farm is River Runs Red by Life of Agony . In the basket that Mose makes for Ryan is " something he whittled " which strongly resembles a Venus figurine . 
 The third season DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from the episode , including Jan asking Michael to record his day on a schedule , Ryan being hugged by Michael before leaving for his first sales call , Dwight and Ryan leaving the office , Michael reading his schedule in a talking head scene , Pam encouraging Michael to " focus " for the day , Ryan reflecting on his life path , and Dwight showing Ryan his family cemetery and making a reference to his Nazi grandfather by calling him " a good man ... who did some VERY bad things " .

 = Sri Aurobindo = 
 Sri Aurobindo ( Bengali : [ Sri <unk> ] ) ( born Aurobindo Ghose ; 15 August 1872 – 5 December 1950 ) was an Indian nationalist , <unk> philosopher , yogi , guru and poet . He joined the Indian movement for independence from British rule , for a while was one of its influential leaders and then became a spiritual reformer , introducing his visions on human progress and spiritual evolution . 
 Aurobindo studied for the Indian Civil Service at King 's College , Cambridge , England . After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and began to involve himself in politics . He was imprisoned by the British for writing articles against British rule in India . He was released when no evidence was provided . During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences , after which he moved to Pondicherry , leaving politics for spiritual work . 
 During his stay in Pondicherry , Aurobindo developed a method of spiritual practice he called Integral Yoga . The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life divine . He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated man but transformed his nature , enabling a divine life on earth . In 1926 , with the help of his spiritual collaborator , Mirra <unk> ( referred to as " The Mother " ) , he founded the Sri Aurobindo Ashram . He died on 5 December 1950 in Pondicherry . 
 His main literary works are The Life Divine , which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga ; Synthesis of Yoga , which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga ; and Savitri : A Legend and a Symbol , an epic poem . His works also include philosophy , poetry , translations and commentaries on the Vedas , Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita . He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1943 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Aurobindo Ghose was born in Calcutta ( now Kolkata ) , Bengal Presidency , India on 15 August 1872 . His father , Krishna Dhun Ghose , was then Assistant Surgeon of <unk> in Bengal , and a former member of the Brahmo Samaj religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then @-@ new idea of evolution while pursuing medical studies in Britain . His mother was <unk> Devi , whose father was Shri <unk> Bose , a leading figure in the Samaj . She had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta for Aurobindo 's birth . Aurobindo had two elder siblings , <unk> and Manmohan , and both a younger sister , Sarojini , and a younger brother , <unk> ( also referred to as Barin , born Emmanuel Matthew ) . 
 Young Aurobindo was brought up speaking English but used Hindustani to communicate with servants . Although his family were Bengali , his father believed British culture to be superior to that of his countrymen . He and his two elder siblings were sent to the English @-@ speaking Loreto House boarding school in Darjeeling , in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother , who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child . Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns , through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism . 
 = = = England ( 1879 – 1893 ) = = = 
 Krishna Dhun Ghose wanted his sons to enter the Indian Civil Service ( ICS ) , an elite organisation comprising around 1000 people . To achieve this it was necessary that they study in England and so it was there that the entire family moved in 1879 . The three brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in Manchester . Drewett was a minister of the Congregational Church whom Krishna Dhun Ghose knew through his British friends at <unk> . 
 The boys were taught Latin by Drewett and his wife . This was a prerequisite for admission to good English schools and , after two years , in 1881 , the elder two siblings were enrolled at Manchester Grammar School . Aurobindo was considered too young for enrolment and he continued his studies with the <unk> , learning history , Latin , French , geography and arithmetic . Although the <unk> were told not to teach religion , the boys inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events , which generally bored Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed him . There was little contact with his father , who wrote only a few letters to his sons while they were in England , but what communication there was indicated that he was becoming less endeared to the British in India than he had been , on one occasion describing the British Raj as a " heartless government " . 
 Drewett emigrated to Australia in 1884 , causing the boys to be uprooted as they went to live with Drewett 's mother in London . In September of that year , Aurobindo and Manmohan joined St Paul 's School there . He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading literature and English poetry . He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and , exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett 's mother , a distaste for religion . He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic . A blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo 's residence at 49 St Stephen 's Avenue in Shepherd 's Bush , London , from 1884 to 1887 . The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in South Kensington during 1887 , their father having experienced some financial difficulties . The Club 's secretary was James Cotton , brother of their father 's friend in the Bengal ICS , Henry Cotton . 
 By 1889 , Manmohan had determined to pursue a literary career and <unk> had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance . This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father 's aspirations but to do so when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship . To become an ICS official , students were required to pass the competitive examination , as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation . Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King 's College , Cambridge , under recommendation of Oscar Browning . He passed the written ICS examination after a few months , being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors . He spent the next two years at King 's College . Sri Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse @-@ riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service . 
 At this time , the Maharaja of Baroda , Sayajirao Gaekwad III , was travelling in England . Cotton secured for him a place in Baroda State Service and arranged for him to meet the prince . He left England for India , arriving there in February 1893 . In India , Krishna Dhun Ghose , who was waiting to receive his son , was misinformed by his agents from Bombay ( now Mumbai ) that the ship on which Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk off the coast of Portugal . His father died upon hearing this news . 
 = = = Baroda and Calcutta ( 1893 – 1910 ) = = = 
 In Baroda , Aurobindo joined the state service in 1893 , working first in the Survey and Settlements department , later moving to the Department of Revenue and then to the Secretariat , and much miscellaneous work like teaching grammar and assisting in writing speeches for the Maharaja of Gaekwad until 1897 . In 1897 during his work in Baroda he started working as a part @-@ time French teacher at Baroda College ( now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda ) . He was later promoted to the post of vice @-@ principal . At Baroda , Sri Aurobindo self @-@ studied Sanskrit and Bengali . 
 During his stay at Baroda he contributed to many articles to Indu Prakash and spoke as a chairman of the Baroda college board . He started taking an active interest in the politics of India 's independence struggle against British rule , working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from overt political activity . He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and Madhya Pradesh , while traveling to these states . He established contact with Lokmanya Tilak and Sister Nivedita . He arranged the military training of <unk> Nath Banerjee ( <unk> Swami ) in the Baroda army and then dispatched him to organise the resistance groups in Bengal . 
 Aurobindo often traveled between Baroda and Bengal , at first in a bid to re @-@ establish links with his parent 's families and other Bengali relatives , including his cousin Sarojini and brother Barin , and later increasingly to establish resistance groups across the Presidency . He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the Partition of Bengal . Age 28 , he had married 14 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> , daughter of <unk> Chandra Bose , a senior official in government service , when he visited Calcutta in 1901 . <unk> died in December 1918 during the influenza pandemic . 
 Aurobindo was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy . In his public activities he favoured non @-@ co @-@ operation and passive resistance ; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt , in case that the passive revolt failed . 
 In Bengal , with Barin 's help , he established contacts with revolutionaries , inspiring radicals such as Bagha Jatin , Jatin Banerjee and <unk> Tagore . He helped establish a series of youth clubs , including the Anushilan Samiti of Calcutta in 1902 . 
 Aurobindo attended the 1906 Congress meeting headed by Dadabhai Naoroji and participated as a councillor in forming the fourfold objectives of " Swaraj , Swadesh , Boycott and national education " . In 1907 at the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown , he led with extremists along with Bal Gangadhar Tilak . The Congress split after this session . In 1907 – 1908 Aurobindo traveled extensively to Pune , Bombay and Baroda to firm up support for the nationalist cause , giving speeches and meeting with groups . He was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the Alipore Bomb Case . He was acquitted in the ensuing trial and released after a year of isolated incarceration . 
 Once out of the prison he started two new publications , <unk> in English and Dharma in Bengali . He also delivered the <unk> Speech hinting at the transformation of his focus to spiritual matters . The British persecution continued because of his writings in his new journals and in April 1910 Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry , where Britain 's secret police monitored his activities . 
 = = = Conversion from politics to spirituality = = = 
 In July 1905 then Viceroy of India , Lord Curzon , partitioned Bengal . This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British , leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries , who included Aurobindo . In 1908 , <unk> Bose and Prafulla <unk> attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford , a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists . However , the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women , the wife and daughter of barrister Pringle Kennedy . Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in Alipore Jail . The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year , but eventually he was acquitted on May 6 , 1909 . His defence counsel was <unk> Das . 
 During this period in the Jail , his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations . Consequently , his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country . 
 Aurobindo said he was " visited " by Vivekananda in the Alipore Jail : " It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence . " 
 In his autobiographical notes , Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India . He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time . He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher , except for some rules that he learned from <unk> , a friend who was a disciple of Brahmananda . In 1907 , Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele , a Maharashtrian yogi . Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi , who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required . 
 In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at <unk> while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled ' To My Countrymen ' , published in <unk> . As Aurobindo disappeared from view , the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed . Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910 , but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry , then a French colony . The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn . 
 = = = Pondicherry ( 1910 – 1950 ) = = = 
 In Pondicherry , Aurobindo dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits . In 1914 , after four years of secluded yoga , he started a monthly philosophical magazine called Arya . This ceased publication in 1921 . Many years later , he revised some of these works before they were published in book form . Some of the book series derived out of this publication were The Life Divine , The Synthesis of Yoga , Essays on The Gita , The Secret of The Veda , Hymns to the Mystic Fire , The Upanishads , The Renaissance in India , War and Self @-@ determination , The Human Cycle , The Ideal of Human Unity and The Future Poetry were published in this magazine . 
 At the beginning of his stay at Pondicherry , there were few followers , but with time their numbers grew , resulting in the formation of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1926 . From 1926 he started to sign himself as Sri Aurobindo , Sri ( meaning holy in Sanskrit ) being commonly used as an honorific . 
 For some time afterwards , his main literary output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples . His letters , most of which were written in the 1930s , numbered in the several thousands . Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple 's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice — others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings . These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of Letters on Yoga . In the late 1930s , he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier — he continued to expand and revise this poem for the rest of his life . It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement , Savitri , an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24 @,@ 000 lines . 
 Aurobindo died on 5 December 1950 . Around 60 @,@ 000 people attended his funeral . Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , and President Rajendra Prasad praised him for his contribution to Yogic philosophy and the independence struggle . National and international newspapers commemorated his death .

 Aurobindo 's close spiritual collaborator , Mirra Richard ( b . <unk> ) , came to be known as The Mother . She was a French national , born in Paris on 21 February 1878 . In her 20s she studied occultism with Max Theon . Along with her husband , Paul Richard , she went to Pondicherry on 29 March 1914 , and finally settled there in 1920 . Aurobindo considered her his spiritual equal and collaborator . After 24 November 1926 , when Aurobindo retired into seclusion , he left it to her to plan , build and run the ashram , the community of disciples which had gathered around them . Some time later , when families with children joined the ashram , she established and supervised the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with its experiments in the field of education . When he died in 1950 , she continued their spiritual work , directed the ashram , and guided their disciples .

 Aurobindo 's concept of the Integral Yoga system is described in his books , The Synthesis of Yoga and The Life Divine . The Life Divine is a compilation of essays published serially in Arya . 
 Aurobindo argues that divine Brahman manifests as empirical reality through <unk> , or divine play . Instead of positing that the world we experience is an illusion ( māyā ) , Aurobindo argues that life itself is Divine . 
 Aurobindo believed that Darwinism merely describes a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life , but does not explain the reason behind it , while he finds life to be already present in matter , because all of existence is a manifestation of Brahman . He argues that nature ( which he interpreted as divine ) has evolved life out of matter and then mind out of life . All of existence , he argues , is attempting to manifest to the level of the <unk> - that evolution had a purpose . He stated that he found the task of understanding the nature of reality arduous and difficult to justify by immediate tangible results .

 Aurobindo was an Indian nationalist but is best known for his philosophy on human evolution and Integral Yoga . 
 = = = Influence = = = 
 His influence has been wide @-@ ranging . In India , S. K. Maitra , <unk> Roy and D. P. Chattopadhyaya commented on Aurobindo 's work . Writers on esotericism and traditional wisdom , such as Mircea Eliade , Paul Brunton , and Rene <unk> , all saw him as an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition . 
 Haridas Chaudhuri and Frederic <unk> were among those who were inspired by Aurobindo , who worked on the newly formed American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco . Soon after , Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship , from which later emerged the California Institute of Integral Studies . 
 Karlheinz Stockhausen was heavily inspired by Satprem 's writings about Aurobindo during a week in May 1968 , a time at which the composer was undergoing a personal crisis and had found Aurobindo 's philosophies were relevant to his feelings . After this experience , Stockhausen 's music took a completely different turn , focusing on mysticism , that was to continue until the end of his career . 
 William Irwin Thompson traveled to <unk> in 1972 , where he met " The Mother " . Thompson has called Aurobindo 's teaching on spirituality a " radical anarchism " and a " post @-@ religious approach " and regards their work as having " ... reached back into the Goddess culture of prehistory , and , in Marshall McLuhan ’ s terms , ' culturally retrieved ' the archetypes of the shaman and la sage femme ... " Thompson also writes that he experienced Shakti , or psychic power coming from The Mother on the night of her death in 1973 . 
 Aurobindo 's ideas about the further evolution of human capabilities influenced the thinking of Michael Murphy – and indirectly , the human potential movement , through Murphy 's writings . 
 The American philosopher Ken Wilber has called Aurobindo " India 's greatest modern philosopher sage " and has integrated some of his ideas into his philosophical vision . Wilber 's interpretation of Aurobindo has been criticised by Rod <unk> . New Age writer Andrew Harvey also looks to Aurobindo as a major inspiration .

 The following authors , disciples and organisations trace their intellectual heritage back to , or have in some measure been influenced by , Aurobindo and The Mother . 
 Margaret Woodrow Wilson ( <unk> ) ( 1886 @-@ 1944 ) , daughter of US President Woodrow Wilson , she came to the ashram in 1940 and stayed there until her death . 
 <unk> Kanta Gupta ( 1889 – 1983 ) was one of Aurobindo 's senior disciples , and wrote extensively on philosophy , mysticism , and spiritual evolution based on the teaching of Aurobindo and " The Mother " . 
 Pavitra ( 1894 – 1969 ) was one of their early disciples . Born as Philippe Barbier Saint @-@ Hilaire in Paris . Pavitra left some very interesting memoirs of his conversations with them in 1925 and 1926 , which were published as Conversations avec Pavitra . 
 Indra Sen ( 1903 – 1994 ) was another disciple of Aurobindo who , although little @-@ known in the West , was the first to articulate integral psychology and integral philosophy , in the 1940s and 1950s . A compilation of his papers came out under the title , Integral Psychology in 1986 . 
 <unk> ( 1903 – 2006 ) . A doctor who obtained his medical degree from Edinburgh , his long and voluminous correspondence with Aurobindo elaborate on many aspects of Integral Yoga and fastidious record of conversations bring out Aurobindo 's thought on numerous subjects . 
 M. P. Pandit ( 1918 – 1993 ) . Secretary to " The Mother " and the ashram , his copious writings and lectures cover Yoga , the Vedas , Tantra , <unk> 's epic " Savitri " and others . 
 <unk> ( 1931 – 2007 ) joined the ashram in 1944 . Later , he wrote the play about Aurobindo 's life – Sri Aurobindo : Descent of the Blue – and a book , Infinite : Sri Aurobindo . An author , composer , artist and athlete , he was perhaps best known for holding public events on the theme of inner peace and world harmony ( such as concerts , meditations , and races ) . 
 Satprem ( 1923 – 2007 ) was a French author and an important disciple of " The Mother " who published Mother 's Agenda ( 1982 ) , Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness ( 2000 ) , On the Way to <unk> ( 2002 ) and more .

 N. R. <unk> finds Aurobindo 's theory of creation to be false , as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences . He says the theory is an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon truth of existence . <unk> says that awareness is already a reality and suggests there would be no need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness . 
 Wilber 's interpretation of Aurobindo 's philosophy rejects the notion of dividing reality as a different level of matter , life , mind , <unk> , <unk> proposed by Aurobindo in The Life Divine , and terms them as higher- or lower @-@ nested <unk> and states that there is only a fourfold reality ( a system of reality created by himself ) . 
 Adi Da finds that Aurobindo 's contributions were merely literary and cultural and had extended his political motivation into spirituality and human evolution 
 Rajneesh ( Osho ) says that Aurobindo was a great scholar but was never realised ; that his personal ego had made him indirectly claim that he went beyond Buddha ; and that he is said to have believed himself to be enlightened due to increasing number of followers .

 Dynamic Science Fiction was a pulp magazine which published six issues from December 1952 to January 1954 . It was a companion to Future Science Fiction , and like that magazine was edited by Robert W. Lowndes and published by Louis Silberkleit . It published stories by some well @-@ known authors , including " The Duplicated Man " by Lowndes and James Blish , and " The Possessed " by Arthur C. Clarke . It was launched at the end of the pulp era , and when Silberkleit decided to convert Future to a digest format in 1954 , he decided not to do the same with Dynamic , simply cancelling the magazine . 
 = = Publishing history and contents = = 
 Although science fiction ( sf ) had been published before the 1920s , it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories , a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback . By the end of the 1930s the field was booming . Between early 1939 and mid @-@ 1940 publisher Louis Silberkleit launched three sf pulp magazines : Science Fiction , Future Fiction , and Science Fiction Quarterly . All three had ceased publication by the end of World War II , killed by a combination of falling sales and wartime paper shortages . In 1950 and 1951 Silberkleit revived Future Fiction , and Science Fiction Quarterly , and the following year he launched Dynamic Science Fiction , with the first issue dated November 1952 . All three of the magazines were edited by Robert W. Lowndes , who had also edited most of the earlier issues for Silberkleit . In mid @-@ 1953 Silberkleit cut rates and slowed down payment to contributors as a result of falling circulation . By this time Silberkleit was experimenting with the digest format for Science Fiction Stories , and he soon cancelled Dynamic Science Fiction , leaving only Science Fiction Quarterly in pulp format . 
 Silberkleit initially paid reasonably good rates , and Lowndes was able to obtain some good quality material . Some of the better @-@ known stories include Arthur C. Clarke 's " The Possessed " ( March 1953 ) ; Lester del Rey 's " I Am Tomorrow " ( December 1952 ) , and James Blish and Lowndes ' novel The Duplicated Man ( August 1953 , with Lowndes ' name concealed by a pseudonym , " Michael Sherman " ) . Lowndes also published some good quality nonfiction , including two long critical essays by James E. Gunn , " The Philosophy of Science Fiction " ( serialized in the March and June 1953 issues ) , and " The Plot Forms of Science Fiction " ( serialized in the October 1953 and January 1954 issues ) . These four articles formed Gunn 's Master of Arts thesis ; Gunn subsequently became a prominent sf critic .

 Robert W. Lowndes was the editor of all six issues of Dynamic Science Fiction , which remained in pulp format throughout its run . It was priced at 25 cents throughout , and was 128 pages for the first four issues , and 96 pages for the last two . 
 Three issues were reprinted in the U.K. by Thorpe & Porter , of Leicester . These were dated January , June and November 1954 , and were pulp format . They were priced at 1 / - and were 96 pages . They correspond to the U.S. issues from June 1953 , December 1952 , and January 1954 respectively . 
 There are no anthologies of stories drawn solely from Dynamic Science Fiction , but in the 1960s Ivan Howard edited several anthologies for Silberkleit 's publishing imprint , Belmont Books , with contents drawn solely from Silberkleit 's magazines . These included : 
 Howard , Ivan , ed . ( 1963 ) . Way Out . New York : Belmont Books . Six of the seven stories are from Dynamic Science Fiction , mostly from the first issue .

 = Power Hungry ( Fringe ) = 
 " Power Hungry " is the fifth episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . The episode was written by playwright Julia Cho and consulting producer Jason Cahill , and was directed by Christopher Misiano . The episode focuses on Fringe Division 's efforts in finding a man with the uncontrolled ability to affect electrical energy , thanks to the work of a wanted rogue scientist . Meanwhile , Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) sees visions of her deceased lover , John Scott ( Mark Valley ) . 
 The episode 's premise began with the idea of a computer virus being able to spread to humans , which then evolved into the story of a man who comes into his unique abilities . Series consultant Glen Whitman noted the premise was based on the " very very weak magnetic field " of electrical energy surrounding humans that an EEG detects , and the writers simply amplified this . The special effects crew undertook much preparation to simulate a chase sequence involving an exploding transformer , leading guest actor Ebon Moss @-@ Bachrach to note how scary the effect was to film . 
 It first aired in the United States on October 14 , 2008 on the Fox network , and was seen by an estimated 9 @.@ 157 million American viewers , the network 's second highest rated show for the week . Critical reactions of the episode ranged from mixed to positive , as many believed the series was finally finding its footing . Others however critiqued the episode for seeming too ordinary for a science fiction series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Joseph Meegar ( Ebon Moss @-@ Bachrach ) , a shy delivery boy who lives with his mother ( Marylouise Burke ) , arrives late for work and delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany ( Diane Davis ) , a receptionist who he is infatuated with . Afterwards in an elevator , Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her on his cell phone . Meegar 's angst then apparently causes the elevator to fall to the underground parking lot levels , killing all but Meegar , who walks away unhurt but startled as all the car alarms go off around him . 
 Olivia reveals to Charlie Francis ( Kirk Acevedo ) about her encounter with deceased lover John Scott in the previous episode . She , Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) later arrive at the scene , where they determine that the deceased have been electrocuted before the impact , and that the elevator did not fall , but drove down . Furthermore Walter detects electromagnetic energy in the area . Meegar meanwhile , inadvertently causes a packaging machine to malfunction , severely injuring his boss after Meegar is fired . He later reveals to his mother that some time ago he answered a magazine advertisement promising to " unlock [ his ] hidden potential " , and although has no knowledge of what has been done to him , believes that what he has done was a result of being experimented on . A further panicked Meegar then causes his mother 's pacemaker to fail , and she dies . 
 The team becomes aware that a human has the uncontrolled ability to affect electrical energy , made this way by Jacob Fischer ( Max Baker ) . Fischer is a rogue scientist wanted by Interpol , who experimented on humans by luring his victims through bogus advertisements . Olivia continues to encounter John Scott , who promises her that he does love her , and will prove it . Through him , Olivia realizes that someone survived the elevator impact . Now aware of Meegar 's identity , they attempt to track him . Meegar however , is captured by Fischer who wishes to perform further tests on him . Walter finds Meegar 's Walkman and uses its cassette tape to find a unique electromagnetic signature , then has some homing pigeons guide Olivia , Peter and Charlie to his location . Alerted by the FBI 's arrival , Fischer attempts to leave with Meegar , who escapes . After Fischer is apprehended , Meegar attempts to flee from Olivia , only to be stopped by Peter . 
 After Meegar is sent to a hospital to be examined upon , Walter realizes Olivia is seeing Scott , and reveals she is not hallucinating ; he theorizes that when both minds were linked during Scott 's coma in " Pilot " , a part of Scott 's consciousness has imbedded itself into hers . Later , while driving home , she spots Scott again , who leads her to a basement where Scott has been running his own Pattern @-@ related investigations . Phillip Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) hands Olivia Scott 's personal effects . Among them she finds an engagement ring , proving Scott 's claim to have loved her .

 " Power Hungry " was written by consulting producer Jason Cahill and playwright Julia Cho , each of which would go on to write other first season episodes . Christopher Misiano directed the installment . According to Fringe co @-@ creator Roberto Orci , series writers often approached episodes ' fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to " justify it scientifically . " For " Power Hungry " , Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans . She explained , " And through kneading that idea over and over again , we came up with the idea of a character , Joseph , who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control <unk> or computer @-@ driven devices . " New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman , who later co @-@ wrote some Fringe episodes , noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible . " It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains , we do all have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads , " he said . " And that 's in part what is sensed by an EEG . So the notion was , ' how can you amplify that ' " ? 
 The chase scene involving Joseph and Olivia required much preparation , as the crew had to simulate an exploding transformer . Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a " mechanical trip " to support an electrical cable , which he then strung to the other side of the adjacent road using a pole . The crew filled the fuse box with " sparking devices " , meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines . Demonstrating this , Brink noted , " What happens is the panel cover will blow off , sparks will come out , the cable will go up , sparking down to the ground . " Misiano said of the sequence , " This young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up . It really blew ! " The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss @-@ Bachrach later told him , " that was actually really scary " to film . After he filmed his character hitting Joseph with a crow bar , actor Joshua Jackson joked , " Finally I 'm going to get a little respect on this set . " 
 Mark Valley returns as John Scott . The actor stated that despite the character 's death in the pilot ; " I 'm going to be showing up in the first season . And , for a guy who died in the pilot , I consider myself pretty fortunate . " Actors who guest star in the episode include Ebon Moss @-@ Bachrach as Joseph Meegar , Max Baker as Jacob Fischer , and Marylouise Burke as Flora Meegar . The first season DVD contains a deleted scene of Olivia and Peter picking up the homing pigeons from a friend of his named Tony . Tony quietly mentions to Peter that his sister could use Peter 's help , but when asked , Peter refuses to tell Olivia more of the story .

 Critical reactions of the episode ranged from mixed to positive .

" By this point in the series , the reviewer believed that " the thing about Fringe that is holding it back is that you 're always ahead of it . The show needs to change things up . " Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha , opined ; " Though not the show 's best hour to date , ' Power Hungry ' is still a solid entry . Good directing , writing , and outstanding production values are maintained as the series ' norm . " In addition Griffin enjoyed Fischer 's " casual surrender " , as " in the past , those associated with ' the pattern ' exhibited a fevered desire to avoid capture , going as far as committing suicide . What 's this guy 's deal ? He obviously has a plan . " However the reviewer was skeptical as to why Astrid was comfortable working with Walter again , considering he subdued her in the previous episode . 
 Los Angeles Times reviewer Patrick Kevin Day stated that at this point in the series , he " initially fretted that Fringe would never grow beyond a run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill " X @-@ Files " knock @-@ off , " but now saw the creators ' intentions . Sarah Stegall of SFScope called the episode an homage to X @-@ Files episode " D.P.O. " , whose featured character has a similar premise to Meegar . Stegall admitted that " this show is growing on me , " with the same atmosphere as The X @-@ Files " coupled with a slightly better grounding in actual science . " Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend reacted positively towards the episode , commending it as it " bounced back so quickly from that lame silver cylinder episode or they would 've lost me forever . " Dougherty also felt that the three protagonists , Olivia , Walter and Peter , " are becoming much more believable characters . " Noel Murray of the A.V. Club rated the episode a B − , opining that the cold open was the series ' best since the pilot , but added that " despite the added [ Freak of the Week ] sympathy , ' Power Hungry ' promptly peters out , because the level of oddity required for Walter and the Pattern Team to track the Freak down isn 't especially high . " Murray added that the return of Scott and his scenes with Olivia " serves to string along the home viewer , inviting us to question whether Olivia 's playing for the right team in this whole Pattern game . " Television Without Pity meanwhile , graded the episode with an A − .

 Gyakuten Kenji 2 ( Japanese : <unk> , " Turnabout Prosecutor 2 " ) , unofficially referred to as Ace Attorney Investigations 2 , is an adventure video game developed by Capcom for the handheld video game console Nintendo DS . It was released on February 3 , 2011 in Japan ; Capcom does not plan to release the game outside Japan , but an English fan translation has been released . The game is the sixth entry in the Ace Attorney series , and a sequel to Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth ( 2009 ) . 
 The game follows prosecutor Miles Edgeworth , detective Dick Gumshoe and the teenage thief Kay Faraday , who investigate five cases ; they face off against judge Hakari Mikagami , a rival character who is part of a " prosecutor purge " that removes weaker prosecutors from duty . The gameplay is divided into two types of phases : investigations , where the player searches the crime scene for evidence and talks to witnesses , and rebuttals , where they aim to find contradictions in witnesses ' testimonies using the evidence found during the investigations . 
 The development team , which included director Takeshi Yamazaki , producer Motohide Eshiro and character designer Tatsuro Iwamoto , created the game for the series ' tenth anniversary , and finalized its direction during a five @-@ day stay in the Capcom Manor in 2010 . The game took shorter than usual to create , as the developers had the original Ace Attorney Investigations to use as a base , leading to an increased focus on the game 's story . Reviewers were positive to the game , citing its story and the new " logic chess " gameplay mechanic as highlights . Several Western journalists commented on the lack of a localization and included it on lists of games they wanted to see localized .

 Ace Attorney Investigations 2 is an adventure game in which players control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth , who investigates five cases ; in one of the cases , the player also controls Edgeworth 's father Gregory . The gameplay is mostly the same as in the previous game , Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth , and is divided into two types of phases : investigations and rebuttals . 
 During the investigations , the player controls Edgeworth directly ; they search the crime scene for evidence , and talk to witnesses to learn new information . As the player investigates , observed information is saved as Edgeworth 's thoughts ; by combining these , the player can obtain further information that would otherwise remain hidden . At some points , the player can use a device called " Little Thief " to generate hologram reproductions of the crime scene using known information about it ; the player can walk around in the recreations and point out inconsistencies with the evidence , and update the recreation accordingly . Sometimes the player is able to switch back and forth between recreations of the crime scene at two different times . 
 A new gameplay mechanic , " logic chess " , is used during investigations when a character refuses to testify . The player interrogates them , which is visualized as a game of chess , with the player aiming to destroy the other character 's chess pieces . To do this , they need to build up their advantage in the discussion by alternating between speaking and listening ; when the player believes they have the advantage , they can choose to go on the offensive . The logic chess sections are timed , with the player having to make decisions before the timer bar has decreased all the way . The player takes damage if they make wrong choices , and the logic chess opponents get more difficult throughout the game . 
 After obtaining sufficient information and evidence from the investigation , the player confronts other characters and reads through their testimonies of the events in the case . The player can choose to press the character for more information on their statements , aiming to discover contradictions between the testimony and the evidence ; if they find one , they can choose to present collected evidence from the investigations to point out the contradiction .

 The first episode opens with an assassination attempt on president Teikun Ō of Zheng Fa ; he survives , but his head bodyguard , Gai Tojiro , dies . It is revealed that Tojiro 's second @-@ in @-@ command <unk> Naitō had killed Tojiro to replace him as head bodyguard , and that the assassination attempt was staged by the president to reverse his declining popularity . In the second episode , Naitō is found dead in prison . <unk> Sarushiro , a friend of Naitō , is suspected of the murder , but Edgeworth 's attempt to investigate is stymied when judge Mikagami assigns prosecutor Yumihiko Ichiyanagi to the case in Edgeworth 's place . To investigate , Edgeworth teams up with <unk> <unk> , a defense attorney and former protégé of Edgeworth 's father Gregory . They suspect several inmates , including the assassin <unk> Hōinbō , but it turns out that prison warden <unk> Miwa killed Naitō , believing that Hōinbō had sent him to kill her . Sarushiro is freed , but Mikagami warns Edgeworth that he could lose his prosecutor 's badge if he keeps investigating cases he is not assigned to . 
 The third episode takes up events eighteen years prior to the present , where Gregory and <unk> are called to defend Issei Tenkai from the charge of murdering fellow chef <unk> Hyōdō . Because the body has disappeared , Gregory and prosecutor Manfred von Karma cannot make much progress , but von Karma coerces Tenkai into falsely confessing to being an accomplice . In the present , the chef Yutaka Kazami is almost killed in an art gallery run by Tenkai 's daughter Tsukasa Oyashiki . Yumihiko is assigned to prosecute under Mikagami 's direction , but Edgeworth still investigates . He concludes that Oyashiki killed Hyōdō and attempted to kill Kazami ; Oyashiki admits to the latter crime , but accuses Kazami of being Hyōdō 's murderer . Kazami admits to murdering Hyōdō , who he had conspired with to cheat in a cooking contest , but had then been betrayed by . Kazami and Oyashiki are jailed , and Tenkai is freed . 
 In the fourth episode , an amnesic Kay is accused of murdering defense attorney Tsubasa Kagome . Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee , which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay 's case ; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate as an aide to prosecutor Franziska von Karma . He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases , and finds a recording indicating that Kagome 's murderer had a burn mark on their chin . When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee , Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi , the head of the investigation committee and Yumihiko 's father , as the auctioneer and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor . Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark , identifying him as Kagome 's murderer . Kay then remembers that someone had attacked her . 
 In the fifth episode , president Teikun Ō is found dead , and Edgeworth gets involved with Miwa 's trial : Yumihiko was due to prosecute , but did not show up , and Mikagami admits that Bansai has abducted her son Shimon to coerce her into acquitting Miwa . Edgeworth goes to rescue Shimon , but finds that Bansai 's henchmen mistakenly had abducted Yumihiko instead . Yumihiko helps recover incriminating evidence that his father attempted to destroy . Miwa is convicted , and it is revealed that Teikun Ō has been dead for twelve years : the person previously thought to be the president was a body double , who had hired Hōinbō to kill the president to take his place , and was helped by Miwa and Bansai to cover up the crime . Edgeworth learns that the person who kidnapped Shimon and assaulted Kay was Sarushiro . It is revealed that Sarushiro is Kazami 's long lost son ; Sarushiro was abducted by Hyōdō to prevent Kazami from winning the cooking contest . Hyōdō forced his own son , Naito , to dispose of Sarushiro , hence why Sarushiro had Naito killed . Hōinbō had found Sarushiro and brought him to an orphanage ; Sarushiro later saw Hōinbō kill Teikun Ō on behalf of the body double , Miwa and Bansai . They betrayed Hōinbō , but Sarushiro helped him escape ; he later planned his revenge on them , and manipulated Miwa and Bansai into killing Naitō and Kagome and killed the body double . Hōinbō is arrested , Sarushiro is imprisoned , and Edgeworth regains his position as a prosecutor .

 Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was produced by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki , and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare . While the original Ace Attorney Investigations had taken longer than usual for an Ace Attorney game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems that had to be created from scratch , Ace Attorney Investigations 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon , resulting in the developers being able to put more focus on the game 's story . According to Eshiro and Yamazaki , one of the major changes compared to the first Ace Attorney Investigations was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic ; they chose to present it metaphorically as a game of chess , which was Edgeworth 's favorite game . Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game 's sprites and background art . 
 In the summer of 2010 , the development team spent five days and four nights in a place called the Capcom Manor to work on the game ; this was inspired by the filmmaker Akira Kurosawa , who would gather scriptwriters in a hotel room to create the scripts for his films . During their stay in the manor , they discussed the game 's plot and the new gameplay system , finalized the direction , and created rough sketches for most characters in the game . For the new character Hakari Mikagami , Iwamoto used a female saint as the main image for her design , and imagined her as being an older woman he could look up to . Another new character , Yumihiko Ichiyanagi , was Eshiro 's favorite minor character in the series because of his character arc and how he grows throughout the game . The game was developed for the Ace Attorney series ' tenth anniversary ; because of this , several characters from previous games in the series made cameo appearances , including Frank <unk> and Will Powers . 
 The game was first revealed in Famitsu in September 2010 , and was showcased at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show . A Flash @-@ based demo was released on the game 's official website in 2010 , and a Nintendo DS demo was distributed in 2011 through the Wii console , Nintendo Zone hotspots , and " DS Station " kiosks at retailers . The game was released by Capcom on February 3 , 2011 in Japan for the Nintendo DS . The game was made available in several different editions : a standard edition , which only includes the game ; a " collector 's pack " , which includes a copy of the game , an orchestral soundtrack CD by Iwadare , a DVD with footage from the game 's appearance at Tokyo Game Show , and a booklet with a manga by Iwamoto ; an " extended edition " , which includes a copy of the game and a Miles Edgeworth figurine ; and a " limited edition " , which includes all the items from the other editions . 
 = = = Localization = = = 
 In early 2011 , Christian Svensson at Capcom stated that there were no plans at the time to release Ace Attorney Investigations 2 in regions outside Japan , due to higher localization costs than estimated returns ; however , according to Eshiro , the main reason for the lack of a localization was scheduling , as all the staff working on the game had disbanded and moved to different teams after finishing the game , and were unable to work on a localization . Svensson said that there was a possibility of a release on another platform , and that he would discuss ways for it to happen with Capcom 's strategy and R & D teams . In December 2011 , Capcom was still discussing internally how to address the Ace Attorney audience , with Svensson saying that there is potential to release Ace Attorney Investigations 2 as a downloadable digital title . The game 's potential English release was still discussed internally at Capcom in March 2012 , but in January 2013 , Svensson said that while Ace Attorney Investigations 2 still was talked about at Capcom , all their Ace Attorney resources , especially ones related to localization , were focused on Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney − Dual Destinies . 
 An English fan translation of Ace Attorney Investigations 2 , subtitled Prosecutor 's Path , has been developed , and includes localized names for new characters in the style of Capcom 's Ace Attorney localizations . The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court @-@ Records , where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications , which had to be approved for them to become part of the project . Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon , with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want , but said that it made the project more professional . A patch translating the game 's first two episodes was released in 2013 , and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014 . A final patch was later released in 2015 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 On its initial release week , Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was the top @-@ selling game in Japan across all platforms , selling more than 132 @,@ 000 units . This was lower than the first Ace Attorney Investigations , which sold 172 @,@ 000 copies during its opening week . The Japanese sales tracker Media Create theorized that this was due to Ace Attorney Investigations 2 having less TV commercials than the first game , and a lower level of consumer recognition according to weekly recognition surveys . They also noted that marketing had been targeting women more than men , leading to an increased interest among women , but decreased interest both among men and overall . During the game 's second week , it dropped to fourth place in the Japanese game sales charts , selling an additional 30 @,@ 910 copies . 
 Reviewers at Famitsu liked the game 's story , saying that the " <unk> " that come from tense situations are exciting . They also liked the sense of urgency brought about with the logic chess , and called the game 's use of sound effects excellent . <unk> at <unk> called Ace Attorney Investigations 2 the best entry in the series , saying that the plot and characters were the game 's highlights , keeping the player in suspense until the end . They found the first episode to be surprisingly strong , as it was a " long and exciting case " , while other Ace Attorney games ' first episodes were more of tutorials . They noted how the gameplay was mostly the same as in Ace Attorney Investigations , but did not consider this a problem as they thought it had the best type of investigations in the series , and they enjoyed the implementation of the logic chess feature . They enjoyed the music , calling it memorable . 
 In 2011 , Game Informer ranked the game as 8th on a list of the best video games that had not been released in North America ; in 2015 , they included it on a list of twelve video games they wanted to see localized , saying that it could possibly be released via the Nintendo eShop . In 2012 , GamesRadar ranked it as 7th on a list of the top seven games that " absolutely need to be localized for the west " . Rebecca <unk> at NF Magazine called the lack of a localization unfortunate , saying that the game was a crucial part of Edgeworth 's story . Tim Sheehy at Destructoid called the game promising , based on a demo available at Tokyo Game Show , saying that the demo left him wanting more . He wished that the voice acting from the game 's trailer had been present within the game itself , but also said that the lack of voice acting would not keep him from wanting to play the game . 
 = Tetsuji Takechi = 
 Tetsuji Takechi ( <unk> <unk> , Takechi Tetsuji , 10 December 1912 – 26 July 1988 ) was a Japanese theatrical and film director , critic , and author . First coming to prominence for his theatrical criticism , in the 1940s and 1950s he produced influential and popular experimental kabuki plays . Beginning in the mid @-@ 1950s , he continued his innovative theatrical work in noh , kyōgen and modern theater . In late 1956 and early 1957 he hosted a popular TV program , The Tetsuji Takechi Hour , which featured his reinterpretations of Japanese stage classics . 
 In the 1960s , Takechi entered the film industry by producing controversial soft @-@ core theatrical pornography . His 1964 film Daydream was the first big @-@ budget , mainstream pink film released in Japan . After the release of his 1965 film Black Snow , the government arrested him on indecency charges . The trial became a public battle over censorship between Japan 's intellectuals and the government . Takechi won the lawsuit , enabling the wave of softcore pink films which dominated Japan 's domestic cinema during the 1960s and 1970s . In the later 1960s , Takechi produced three more pink films . 
 Takechi did not work in film during most of the 1970s . In the 1980s , he remade Daydream twice , starring actress Kyōko Aizome in both films . The first Daydream remake ( 1981 ) is considered the first theatrical hardcore pornographic film in Japan . Though Takechi is largely unknown in Japan today , he was influential in both the cinema and the theater during his lifetime , and his innovations in kabuki were felt for decades . He also helped shape the future of the pink film in Japan through his battles against governmental censorship , earning him the titles , " The Father of Pink " and " The Father of Japanese Porn . " 
 = = Life and career = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Tetsuji Takechi was born Tetsuji Kawaguchi in Osaka on 10 December 1912 to a family headed by a wealthy industrialist . He studied economics at Kyoto National University and graduated in 1936 . Takechi first became known for his criticism and theoretical writings on the theater . In 1939 he began publishing a journal , Stage Review in which he printed his writings on the theater . In the early 1940s , he began publishing collections of these writings in book form . When World War II came to an end , Takechi used his inheritance from his father to establish a theatrical troupe . Under his direction , the Takechi Kabuki , as the group was known , put Takechi 's theatrical ideas into practise by giving innovative and popular performances of kabuki classics in Osaka from 1945 to 1955 . 
 = = = Takechi Kabuki = = = 
 The immediate post @-@ World War II era was a difficult time for kabuki . Besides the devastation caused to major Japanese cities as a result of the war , the popular trend was to reject the styles and thoughts of the past , kabuki among them . Also , during the early years of the Allied Occupation of Japan , the occupying authorities banned kabuki as feudalistic and detrimental to the public morals , though by 1947 this ban was lifted . Other traditional forms of theater , such as noh and bunraku , seen as less flamboyant and violent than kabuki , received less attention from Occupation censors . Kabuki scholars credit Takechi 's innovative productions of the kabuki classics with bringing about a rebirth of interest in the kabuki in the Kansai region after this low point in kabuki history . Takechi revitalized kabuki by reaching out to the other theatrical forms — noh , kyōgen , and the modern theater and dance — for new ideas and collaboration . He broke through long @-@ established barriers which existed between these theatrical forms , and even between kabuki schools , to create an energetic new form of kabuki . Despite his maverick nature , Takechi gave great attention to the classic kabuki texts , and emphasized to his actors the need to inhabit the roles they played . His approach to a new interpretation of the old texts was to " psychologize " them . By bringing out the psychology already present in the classic texts , Takechi felt that actors could interpret their roles with vitality and energy which he felt was lacking in contemporary performances . Of the many popular young stars of the kabuki who performed under Takechi , Nakamura <unk> III ( born 1931 ) was the leading figure . At first known as Nakamura <unk> , this period in Osaka kabuki became known as the " Age of <unk> " in his honor . 
 = = = Theater work after Takechi Kabuki = = = 
 Takechi 's innovations in kabuki brought him to the attention of the <unk> family , a longtime major force in comic kyōgen plays . With the <unk> , Takechi created and directed the kyōgen , <unk> ( The Washing River ) , in 1953 . Based on a medieval French farce , this play became the first new kyōgen to enter the traditional repertoire in a century . Takechi saw in kyōgen a more direct link to a native Japanese folk theatrical tradition , and through the kyōgen wanted to link these folk traditions with the modern theater . As a Western analogy of his intentions , Takechi pointed to the works of Ibsen and Tennessee Williams which had their roots in the classical theater of Racine , Molière and Shakespeare . 
 In 1954 , Takechi followed <unk> with a noh @-@ kyōgen version of Junji Kinoshita 's Yūzuru . Yūzuru is one of the most successful Japanese post @-@ World War II plays , having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949 . Composer <unk> Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952 . Since its premiere , Dan 's opera has been performed more than 550 times , making it possibly the most popular opera written in Japanese . Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi 's production of the play . Dan combined the noh @-@ style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus . On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi @-@ directed kyōgen , Higashi wa Higashi ( East is East ) , a parody of the kyōgen style . Among the innovations Takechi made in this play was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all @-@ male kyōgen cast . In the ultra @-@ conservative noh and kyōgen communities , simply appearing in a rival school 's production could result in an actor 's excommunication from the profession . Because of the public attention drawn through Takechi 's relentless publicity work and communication with the media , punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided . 
 Besides his work as a theatrical theorist and director , Takechi occasionally appeared in acting roles on the stage and screen . In his series of essays , Chronicles of My Life in the 20th Century , American author and translator of Japanese literature , Donald Keene mentions his own study of kyōgen at this time . In 1956 , Keene appeared in a performance of the kyōgen play Chidori with Takechi in the role of the sake shop owner , before an audience including such prominent authors as Tanizaki , Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima . 
 Writing that " every form of art " should be popular with the public , Takechi next sought to rejuvenate noh in a similar manner with which he had kabuki and kyōgen . He worked with the avant @-@ garde group Jikken Kōbō ( Experimental Workshop ) , which had been founded by composers Tōru Takemitsu , <unk> Yuasa and other artists in 1951 . One of Takechi 's more notable productions with the group was a 1955 noh version of Schoenberg 's Pierrot Lunaire ( 1912 ) . 
 In October 1955 he directed Mishima 's modern noh play , The Damask Drum in a theater @-@ in @-@ the @-@ round production at Osaka 's Sankei Hall . Mishima , dubious of Takechi 's experimental approach to classical theater , later commented that he felt like a father allowing a disreputable plastic surgeon to operate on his child . Also at Sankei Hall , Takechi directed Mishima 's <unk> Komachi , set as an opera by composer <unk> <unk> , in 1956 . 
 The controversy created by Takechi 's experiments with noh made international headlines in 1956 . The International News Service reported that Takechi had introduced elements of burlesque and striptease into the slow , stylised artform . Confirming that Takechi 's methods did make the artform popular , his " Burlesque Noh " productions at Tokyo 's <unk> Music Hall played to a consistently full house . Again , however , the leaders of the conservative Noh Society of Tokyo threatened any performer who participated in Takechi 's productions with excommunication . 
 From 4 December 1956 to 26 February 1957 , Takechi served as the host of the Nippon Television program , The Tetsuji Takechi Hour . The show featured the Takechi Kabuki 's interpretations of such Japanese stage classics as <unk> , and was also known for pushing the limits of the coverage of sexual subjects on television for its time . Takechi directed two more kabuki performances for the <unk> Theater in Tokyo , not long after it was opened in 1963 . Though these would be his last kabuki productions , Takechi 's influence on the art form continued to be felt for decades after his departure for the cinema . 
 = = = Entrance into the cinema = = = 
 In the early 1960s , Takechi turned from the stage to the cinema . Though the mainstream film industry considered Takechi an amateur and an outsider , he would continue to produce ground @-@ breaking films sporadically for the rest of his life . Some of the innovations and trends in Japanese erotic cinema which Takechi 's films pioneered include big @-@ budgets and releases , literary and artistic aspirations , fogging , political themes , and theatrical hardcore . 
 Takechi ran afoul of the government throughout his film career . The <unk> , in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia : The Sex Films , even characterize Takechi 's entire film career as " a personal war with Eirin " ( the Japanese film @-@ rating board ) . Turning from the Edo period art form of kabuki to another popular Edo period form of expression , pornography , Takechi decided to enter the film industry through the new genre of low @-@ budget , independent softcore sex @-@ films that were becoming popular in Japan . These films were called <unk> at this time , but are now more commonly referred to as pink films . 
 Takechi 's first film was A Night In Japan : Woman , Woman , Woman Story ( Nihon no <unk> : Onna onna onna monogatari , 1963 ) , a sex @-@ documentary in the mondo style popular at the time . The film focused on the women of Japan 's night life and included scenes of a nude noh performance , strippers , and geisha . Produced independently , Shochiku studios distributed the film , allowing it an international audience . It was released in West Germany on 6 March 1964 as Frauen unter <unk> Sonne ( alle Frauen <unk> ) . In the U.S. , it opened in Los Angeles under the title Women ... Oh , Women ! on 18 September 1964 . Later that year , Takechi appeared in an acting role in director <unk> Shindō 's Mother ( 1963 ) . 
 = = = Daydream ( 1964 ) = = = 
 The first Japanese mainstream film with nudity was Seijun Suzuki 's Gate of Flesh , ( 1964 ) , and Takechi made the first big @-@ budget , mainstream pink film , Daydream ( <unk> ) , the same year . Like Women ... Oh , Women ! , Daydream was produced independently but Shochiku studios distributed the film . This time , the studio gave Takechi 's film a major publicity campaign . Based on a 1926 short story by Jun 'ichirō Tanizaki , the film was a black comedy involving a series of sex scenes imagined by an artist under anesthesia in a dentist 's office . After being drugged , the artist watches helplessly from the other side of a window as the dentist tortures and performs a series of sexual acts on a female patient . 
 Though modest in comparison with pink films which would come soon after , Daydream did contain female nudity . The government refused to allow one controversial shot , which gave a brief glimpse of pubic hair . Takechi fought the government 's censorship of this shot , but lost . When the censors obscured the offending hair with a fuzzy white dot , Daydream became the first film in Japanese cinema to undergo " fogging " , a common element in Japanese erotic cinema for decades to come . 
 Despite the governmental tampering , Daydream became a major success in Japan , and was screened at the Venice Film Festival in September 1964 . The film was released in the U.S. later the same year , and in 1966 Joseph Green , director of the cult film The Brain that Wouldn 't Die ( 1962 ) re @-@ released Daydream in the U.S. with new American footage . 
 Takechi 's third film , The Dream of the Red Chamber or Crimson Dream ( <unk> （ <unk> ） , 1964 ) , was released less than two months after Daydream . Based on two short stories " <unk> <unk> no Yume " and " <unk> no Jiken " by Jun 'ichirō Tanizaki , the film depicts the lurid and violently erotic dreams of a writer , his wife and his sister , after having spent a night out drinking and visiting sex shows . The Dream of the Red Chamber underwent extensive censorship before the government would allow it to be released . About 20 % of the film 's original content was cut by Eirin , rendering the film virtually incoherent , and this footage is now considered lost . 
 = = = Black Snow ( 1965 ) = = = 
 Takechi 's Daydream had been considered a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world was focused on the country for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics . Takechi 's third film had suffered heavily from the governmental censorship , yet no legal action had been taken . Takechi 's fourth film , the Nikkatsu @-@ produced Black Snow ( 1965 ) , was even more controversial than his previous work . David <unk> credits Black Snow with bringing a political theme to the pink film . Politics would be featured in many later films in the pink genre , most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu . 
 The story of Black Snow concerns a young man whose mother serves the U.S. military at Yokota Air Base as a prostitute . <unk> unless making love with a loaded gun , the young man shoots an American G.I. , and is then shot down by U.S. soldiers . The film contained multiple scenes of sexual intercourse , and a lengthy scene of a nude woman running outside Yokota Air Base . However , more than the sex and nudity , it was the political nature of the film which attracted governmental action . Released at a time of widespread demonstration against the renewal of the U.S. Security Treaty , Black Snow had a clear anti @-@ American theme . Film critic Tadao Sato says that the film uses sex to make a political statement . " In Black Snow ... the powerless position of Japan vis @-@ a @-@ vis America , and of the Japanese populace in relation to its rulers is represented by the outraged Japanese women and the G.I. rapists . " 
 Other critics accused the film of racism and ultra @-@ nationalism . Jasper Sharp writes that though Takechi 's films did criticize Japanese society , a theme they share with pink films , Takechi identified the problem as coming from foreign influences , rather than from within . This marks him as a reactionary rather than a revolutionary , as were many pink film directors . Takechi himself claimed to be a <unk> <unk> , or " ethnic nationalist " , throughout his life . Buruma points out that this ideological affiliation contains a strong racial aspect , and notes that the G.I. the main character murders in Black Snow is African American . Buruma comments further , " This , incidentally , has become a standard cliche : whenever G.I.s are shown in Japanese porno films , invariably in the act of outrageously raping Japanese maidens , they are very often blacks to make the outrage seem even worse . " 
 Though the government had accused earlier films of obscenity , Black Snow became the first film after World War II to be prosecuted by the government on obscenity charges . All copies of the film were confiscated from Nikkatsu and from Takechi 's own home , and Takechi was arrested . The controversy gained international attention with The New York Times reporting that even the two censors who had passed the film were considered for prosecution , and that the government had announced plans to strictly censor the pink film movement . Japan 's intellectual and artistic community came to Takechi 's defense . Film directors Nagisa Oshima and Seijun Suzuki and authors Yukio Mishima and Kōbō Abe testified in Takechi 's defense at the trial . Takechi took advantage of every opportunity to publicly speak out against censorship , and one Eirin official later admitted to being " terrified by the man . " . 
 Explicitly linking his interests in kabuki and pornography as forms of expression , in the July 1965 issue of the film journal Eiga <unk> , Takechi wrote : 
 By shutting down Black Snow and prosecuting Takechi , Eirin had intended to suppress the new pink film genre , but the trial had the exact opposite outcome . The publicity surrounding the trial brought the pink film genre to the attention of the general public , and helped inspire the wave of pink films which dominated Japan 's domestic cinema for the next two decades . 
 = = = After Black Snow = = = 
 During the legal battles of the trial , Takechi filmed a pink film re @-@ telling of The Tale of Genji , which , like Tanizaki 's work , contains eroticism in the original , though not of a sexually @-@ explicit nature . On 17 September 1967 , Takechi won the Black Snow case . He also successfully countersued the government claiming that the accusation of indecency was politically motivated , due to the film 's anti @-@ American and anti @-@ capitalist themes . 
 Takechi 's next film after the trial was Ukiyo @-@ e Cruel Story ( 1968 ) , starring the current " Queen " of Pink films , Noriko Tatsumi . The <unk> call this film , about a painter of erotic pictures who is persecuted by the government , " Takechi 's personal message to Eirin . " Though still containing significant erotic content , this is one of Takechi 's few films to pass the censor relatively un @-@ edited , perhaps because Eirin saw the obvious anti @-@ governmental censorship message in the film , and did not wish to be provoked into another embarrassing public confrontation with the outspoken director . 
 Though he had won his court case , Takechi had become known as a risky and dangerous entity in the film world . Newspapers refused to advertise his films , and Takechi spent the next decade concentrating on writing projects . After his friend , the writer Yukio Mishima , committed hara @-@ kiri in 1970 , Takechi wrote The Head Of Yukio Mishima , a best @-@ selling , fictionalized version of the incident . In 1972 , he again appeared in an acting role for director <unk> Shindō in his Art Theatre Guild film based on a Tanizaki novel , Sanka . 
 = = = Return to film = = = 
 In 1981 , the then 68 @-@ year @-@ old Takechi decided to return to film with a series of theatrical hardcore films , beginning with a remake of his 1964 Daydream , also titled Daydream . Noticing actress Kyōko Aizome in one of her nude photo magazine appearances , Takechi chose her to star in the film . Japan 's first theatrically released film featuring hardcore sex , Aizome added to the controversy surrounding the film by admitting to having performed actual sexual intercourse on camera . Though , as Japanese law required , sexual organs and pubic hair were fogged on screen , the Asahi Shimbun called it a breakthrough film , and Japan 's first hardcore pornographic movie . Takechi took a novel , yet traditional approach to the fogging by covering the forbidden areas with floating images of topless female shamisen players . Unlike Takechi 's earlier Dream of the Red Chamber , the full , uncensored version of Daydream 1981 did survive , and circulated underground in Japan . This uncensored version of the film was released on video at one time in the Netherlands . 
 Takechi 's next film , Courtesan ( <unk> , 1983 ) , like his Daydream films , was based on a Tanizaki novel . Three studios were involved in the production : Fujii Movies , Ogawa Productions , and Takechi Film . The film is set at the end of the 19th century , and tells the story of a Yokohama prostitute who services American sailors . The woman is possessed by the spirit of her dead lover , who , in erotic scenes echoing The Exorcist ( 1973 ) , makes his presence known whenever she is sexually aroused . Because of the large budget involved in the production , the distributing studio submitted Courtesan to Eirin repeatedly , and agreed to every cut the reviewing board recommended . The heavy cutting the film received reduced it from near @-@ hardcore to a very softcore historical drama . Takechi again took advantage of the situation to fight Eirin , and complained publicly about the censorship . When he noticed that the censors had painted over a penis with colors , he ridiculed them by promoting his film with the line , " See the first multicolored penis in Japanese Cinema ! " 
 After this bout with the censors , Takechi vowed to produce a true , hardcore film for Japanese audiences . The result was Sacred Koya ( Koya Hijiri ) , based on a work by <unk> Izumi . He refused to allow the film to be censored in any way , either through cutting or fogging . Refusing to release the film in Japan , he did not submit it for Eirin 's approval . Instead , he released it in Guam , where it played primarily to Japanese tourist audiences for several years under the U.S. ' s more liberal pornography laws . Takechi 's last film was another remake of Daydream in 1987 , again starring Kyōko Aizome . Though it was a low @-@ budget , independent production which again underwent censorship in Japan , it became very popular in its uncensored form in France . 
 Takechi 's come @-@ back films of the 1980s were all in a theatrical hardcore style . Released during the dawn of the AV , or adult video , and the height of Nikkatsu 's softcore Roman porno films , his films fit into neither style . Jasper Sharp writes , " His big @-@ budget <unk> came from a different world to that of the pink and Roman Porno films . There was nothing else like them at the time , and consequently they had little influence on domestically @-@ produced sex films . Takechi died of pancreatic cancer the following year , on 26 July 1988 . Without a major studio 's backing or interest from the general pink film community , Takechi 's name and films faded into obscurity in Japan . In 2006 his career was the subject of a full retrospective showing in Tokyo 's Image Forum in 2006 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Jasper Sharp points out that the Japanese and western views of Takechi 's legacy are quite different . While western sources assess him as a major figure in the early development of the pink film , many current Japanese sources on the subject ignore his work . Sharp notes , however , that during his lifetime , he was covered prominently in Japanese sources . He speculates that his legacy has been largely forgotten in his homeland partly because of his status as an outsider in the Japanese film communities — both mainstream and pink . Since his films were self @-@ produced and distributed by major film companies rather than through the <unk> circuit , they are not technically pink films . Also , his right @-@ wing political background conflicts with the generally revolutionary stance more often associated with the pink film . Since his death in 1988 , the lack of a studio or other publicist , or coverage by writers on the pink film has kept his work out of the public 's eye in Japan . In the west , however , some of Takechi 's films , such as Daydream were shown during their first runs , reviewed by major publications such as Variety , and have been preserved and remained available to genre audiences on home video releases . 
 During his lifetime , Takechi 's innovations and contributions to Japanese theater in general and to kabuki specifically were influential for decades . His theoretical work , as well as his mentoring of several important stars , helped bring about a rebirth in kabuki after World War II . His contributions to cinema were much more controversial . Considered a dilettante outsider by much of the film industry , and suspected of racism and nationalism by others , his work was nevertheless defended by the younger generation of filmmakers such as Seijun Suzuki and Nagisa Oshima . Though his films are today unknown to most Japanese filmgoers , through his career @-@ long fight against censorship , the taboos which his films helped break , and the creative freedom which he helped enable , he remains an important figure in Japanese cinema .

 = Berge Meere und Giganten = 
 Berge Meere und Giganten ( Mountains Seas and Giants ) is a 1924 science fiction novel by German author Alfred Döblin . Stylistically and structurally experimental , the novel follows the development of human society into the 27th century and depicts global @-@ scale conflicts between future polities , technologies , and natural forces , culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland 's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland 's ice cap . Among critics , Berge Meere und Giganten has the reputation of being a difficult and polarizing novel , and has not received nearly as much attention as Döblin 's following novel , Berlin Alexanderplatz ( 1929 ) . 
 Inspired by the mundane sight of pebbles rolling in the Baltic Sea surf in the summer of 1921 , Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall , conducting extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process . Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology , over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature . He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923 , and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year .

At the same time that it sees radical technological innovations , Europe suffers declining birth rates and experiences waves of mass migration from Africa . In an effort to maintain their rule , the ruling Senates of Europe agree to restrict the public 's access to science and technology .

 After years of state repression and surveillance , the masses have become soft and restless . A spirit of resistance against the machines arises , and the new generation of rulers shifts course . After the end of the twenty @-@ fourth century , access to science and technology is opened up again and nationalism <unk> , alongside a quasi @-@ religious devotion to the machines . Later , researchers led by a scientist named Meki invent synthetic food production , which leads to the abandonment of farms and the countryside , a new wave of urbanization , and the solidification of the Senates ' political control . By the twenty @-@ seventh century , freed from the need to support themselves the masses have again become fat , idle , and restless ; it becomes increasingly difficult to even find enough people to run the synthetic food factories . A group of leaders incite nationalism and war to combat this tendency ; the result is a catastrophic world war between Europe and Asia — the " Ural War " — involving advanced weapons that are able to channel the elements and that turn much of Russia into a wall of fire , and then into a flooded plain . After the war the states of Europe grow increasingly isolated from each other , and " every cityscape fought for its existence . "

The resurgent London senate seeks to bring Marduk 's excesses under control , and he in turn attempts to expand his realm to gain more cultivable land , attacking nearby city @-@ states such as Hamburg and Hannover . Zimbo , from the Congo , becomes a rival of Marduk 's . New elemental weapons are developed over the course of these struggles , which involve scenes of violence and torture . Zimbo 's forces eventually manage to unseat Marduk , who then wages a guerrilla campaign of his own , destroying machines and factories wherever he can . He dies in action , and Zimbo becomes the third Consul of Berlin . 
 = = = Fifth Book : The Draining of the Cities = = = 
 As the fifth book begins , the setting shifts briefly to North America . Following the Ural War , the Japanese had led an Asian occupation of western North America . The local populations , inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies , react by leaving the cities for the wilderness and destroying the food factories and cities , eventually driving out the Asian occupation . In America and then globally people begin leaving cities in favor of the wild . Shamanism and the belief in ghosts reemerge amongst the populace , as does an oral tradition of story @-@ telling . The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement : egalitarian communities that live in nature , characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation . In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates , political leaders in London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland , thereby channeling both the drive for technological innovation and the drive to settle new land . 
 = = = Sixth Book : Iceland = = = 
 To settle Greenland , it is necessary to melt its ice sheet ; to do this , a massive expedition sets out for Iceland to harvest its volcanic energy . Led by <unk> , the expedition begins breaking open Iceland 's volcanoes . Resistance by the local population is met with massacres . Once Iceland has been split open and turned into a lake of magma , the energy is stored in " tourmaline veils " ( " <unk> " ) . The geography of Iceland is described in rich detail in this section , as is the cataclysmic destruction of the landscape . The scale of destruction proves traumatizing to many of the expedition members , who flee and have to be forcibly recaptured before the expedition can head to Greenland . 
 = = = Seventh Book : The Melting of Greenland 's Ice = = = 
 As they sail for Greenland , strange things begin to happen to the ships bearing the tourmaline veils . Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them , and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous . The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth , so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships . Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships , and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils , they have to cut through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships . Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland , it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects . Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated , and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant , animal , and mineral parts . Greenland , free of its icy burden , rises up , ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands . As the chapter ends , the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe . 
 = = = Eighth Book : The Giants = = = 
 As the wave of mutilation breaks over Europe , the force animating the monsters proves fatal : any contact with their bodies or blood provokes a frenzy of organic growth , so that animals of different species grow into each other and humans are strangled by their own growing organs . The populations remaining in the cities move underground . The ruling technocrats , led by Francis Delvil , begin to devise biological weapons to combat the monsters . Using the energy of the remaining tourmaline veils , they construct massive towers — the eponymous " Giants " — out of humans , animals , and plants , grotesque assemblages of organic life that , planted on mountains or in the sea , serve as defensive turrets . In a frenzied technological mania , some of the scientists turn themselves into giant monsters and wander around Europe , wreaking havoc and forgetting their original intent . A group of the original Iceland expedition led by <unk> returns to Europe , bearing the memory of the devastation they caused . 
 = = = Ninth Book : Venaska = = = 
 The novel 's final book begins with a group of settlers in southern France who call themselves the " Snakes " ( " Die <unk> " ) . Venaska , a beautiful woman from the south , becomes influential amongst the settlers and is revered as a kind of goddess of love . With the other " Snakes " she lives in nature , apart from the wrecked cities and their dwindling authoritarian rule . As the traumatized remnants of the Iceland expedition come into contact with the settlers , a new type of society comes into existence , marked by a reconciled relationship to nature and egalitarian social relations . To the north the giants , now including Delvil among them , still rage , but their violence slowly subsides . Within the large number of creatures that compose their bodies , they begin to lose their individual human consciousness and grow into the earth , becoming mountains and hills in England and Cornwall . As Delvil fights to retain his consciousness , Venaska arrives and reconciles him with his dissolution into nature . She too grows into the hills that mark the former giants . In the wake of the destruction of Europe 's cities and the collapse of its governments , waves of refugees storm across the landscape accompanied by rage and cannibalism . The survivors of the Iceland expedition meet them head @-@ on , dividing them into groups and leading them to settlements around the globe . As the novel ends , humanity has resettled and begun to cultivate the destroyed landscapes . The fertile land between the Belgian coast and the Loire is renamed Venaska . 
 = = Thematic and stylistic aspects = = 
 Critic Gabriele Sander has called Berge Meere und Giganten an " epic about the conflict between nature and technology , " and other critics have also emphasized the novel 's portrayal of the often violent relationship between humanity , nature , and technology . Peter Sprengel has taken a different approach , arguing that the novel is characterized not by a dichotomous opposition between nature and technology , but rather by the way it blurs the distinction between the organic and the inorganic . Hannelore Qual has documented how the novel ties Döblin 's philosophy of nature to his ideas about society and politics , arguing for an affinity between Döblin 's thought and the anarchism of Gustav Landauer and Pyotr Kropotkin . 
 Berge Meere und Giganten presciently invokes such topics as world war , urbanization , the alienation from nature , mechanization , the dehumanization of the modern world , as well as mass migration , globalization , totalitarianism , fanaticism , terrorism , state surveillance , genetic engineering , synthetic food , the breeding of humans , biochemical warfare , and others . Döblin 's experiences during the First World War , when he served in Alsace as a military doctor , left their mark on the novel : psychically damaged veterans , devastated landscapes , and all @-@ destructive technological excesses give this novel its particularly apocalyptic feeling . Because of the bleak vision of the future that the novel presents , it has often been described by critics as a fundamentally pessimistic , <unk> , or regressive work . Hannelore Qual argues against this that Berge Meere und Giganten is instead characterized by an optimistic view of social and historical perfectibility ; the portrayals of catastrophic destruction and brutally authoritarian regimes reflect , in this reading , not Döblin 's own world view but instead different historical possibilities , alongside which more egalitarian and peaceful social orders are to be found . 
 Stylistically , it is characterized by its innovative syntax and the frequent paratactic use of multiple subjects , objects , and verbs in a single sentence without conjunctions or punctuation to separate them . Structurally , it consists of nine books that , because of the immense time span , often do not share common characters or settings ; the third @-@ person narrative voice , which has been likened to that of an anonymous chronicler , does not pass judgment on the events or provide commentary that would help tie events together . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The novel was regarded as a difficult work upon its release , and its experimental stylistic , structural , and thematic idiosyncrasies have often provoked emotional judgments from critics , ranging from fascination to repulsion . Among others , Günter Grass has praised the novel 's continued relevance and insight . 
 Despite the early fascination with the novel , after the Second World War it fell into neglect as critical attention to Döblin was directed primarily towards his next novel , Berlin Alexanderplatz ( 1929 ) , and a new edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977 . The last few decades have however seen a resurgence of critical interest in the novel . 
 = = Genesis and publication = = 
 Döblin wrote the novel between fall 1921 and summer 1923 . According to the author , the novel set out to explore the question : " What will become of the human being if he keeps living like he lives now ? " Döblin would later write that the original inspiration for the novel was the sight of pebbles rolling in the surf on the Baltic Sea coast during a family vacation in the summer of 1921 ; this epiphanic vision provoked a sudden and uncharacteristic interest in nature for Döblin , who began taking extensive notes in various Berlin museums and libraries on natural history and science , geology , geography , climatology , ethnography , and other fields . If he had originally conceived of the novel as a " hymn to the city " and to technology , as he got into the project it increasingly became an encomium to nature . In early 1922 he closed his medical practice for a month to further his research for the novel . The section on Iceland and Greenland , which occurs towards the end of the published novel , was one of the first sections Döblin envisioned and drafted , and an advance publication of this section appeared in the Vossische Zeitung on New Year 's Day 1922 with the title Die <unk> <unk> im Jahre 2500 . Das <unk> ( The Melting of Greenland 's Ice in the Year 2500 : The Magical Ship ) . In May 1922 Döblin rented a villa in Zehlendorf to complete the draft of the novel , a setting explicitly referenced in the novel 's unusual " Dedication " . The exertions of drafting the novel provoked a sort of nervous breakdown : as he would later write , " the fantasy was too wild and my brain would not release me . " In a 2011 biography , Wilfried Schoeller has suggested that there was an additional reason for Döblin 's breakdown — namely , that the temporary move to Zehlendorf was also his unsuccessful attempt to leave his wife in favor of his lover Charlotte Niclas . According to Schoeller , this personal dimension left its mark on the novel , especially on the novel 's dedication . 
 Berge Meere und Giganten was published in 1924 by the Fischer Verlag . In 1931 Döblin began working on a radically simplified and shortened version , in order to make the difficult work more accessible to a wider audience ; the new version was published by the Fischer Verlag in May 1932 under the title Giganten ( Giants ) . 2006 saw the release of a new critical edition of Berge Meere und Giganten by the Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag ( Munich ) , edited by Gabriele Sander . The original manuscript and Döblin 's extensive notes for the novel are preserved in the German literary archive in Marbach am Neckar . As of 2016 , there is no English translation available . 
 = Legitimate expectation in Singapore law = 
 The doctrine of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights . In administrative law , a legitimate expectation generally arises when there has been a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual . To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness . The doctrine of legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts . Thus , where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority , the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken . Alternatively , an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right . The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority 's policy . This suggests the adoption of a free @-@ standing proportionality approach , which has been said not to apply in administrative law . 
 The procedural dimension of the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been recognized by Singapore courts and , since 2013 , the substantive form of the doctrine as well . However , whether the courts will adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring legitimate expectation with the ruler of proportionality remains an open question . 
 = = Development of the doctrine in the English courts = = 
 = = = Legitimate expectation of a procedural right = = = 
 The doctrine of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness . English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision @-@ makers . Generally , the courts will grant judicial review of an administrative decision based on an individual 's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers . The individual has to show that the representation was a clear and unambiguous promise , an established practice or a public announcement . This is largely a factual inquiry . 
 The key idea is that under certain circumstances where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority , the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made . To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness . The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment . This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( the GCHQ case ) . This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , a government signals and intelligence department , who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions . The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom . The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment @-@ related matters , even though it was not a rule . However , their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice . Such a representation can come in the form of a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision . Nonetheless , on the facts of the case , their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister 's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds . 
 = = = Legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit = = = 
 The English courts initially wavered in recognizing that an individual has a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit arising from a representation from the authorities . The notion of protecting a substantive legitimate expectation was espoused in the 1995 High Court decision in R. v. Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food , ex parte Hamble ( Off @-@ shore ) Fisheries Ltd . In that controversial case , Justice Stephen Sedley formulated the framework for legitimate expectations as the balance of the requirements of fairness against the decision @-@ maker 's reasons to change the policy . This was in step with the development of the doctrine of proportionality as prescribed in the Treaty on European Union , and in European Court of Justice case law . The decision wove proportionality back into the fabric of judicial review in the UK under the banner of an expanding doctrine of " fair administration " despite the clear rejection of proportionality as a self @-@ standing ground of review by the House of Lords in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Brind ( 1991 ) . 
 In 1996 , the Court of Appeal opined in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Hargreaves that " [ o ] n matters of substance ( as contrasted with procedure ) Wednesbury provides the correct test " . In Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation ( 1947 ) , the High Court had introduced the idea of Wednesbury unreasonableness , that is , a public authority 's decision is unlawful if , although they have " kept within the four corners of the matters they ought to consider , they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it " . The inference to be made from ex parte Hargreaves was that where an applicant claimed to have a substantive expectation , it was not for the court to judge if that expectation should be protected vis @-@ à @-@ vis the broader public interest . The court should only intervene if the decision @-@ maker 's exercise of its discretion satisfied the Wednesbury threshold . 
 However , the courts ' role in protecting substantive legitimate expectations was clearly established by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority , ex parte Coughlan ( 1999 ) . The case involved an applicant who was promised by her local authority that a new nursing home would be her " home for life " . The Court granted the application for review on the ground that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to have the substantive benefit of staying in the nursing home as promised by the local authority . It also set out the approach to be taken in safeguarding procedural and substantive legitimate expectations . Where procedural legitimate expectations were concerned , courts would require an opportunity for consultation to be given unless there was an overriding reason to <unk> from it ( such as the national security concern that arose in the GCHQ case ) . As regards substantive legitimate expectations , courts would decide whether cases lie " ... in what may inelegantly be called the macro @-@ political field " , or are those " where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people , giving the promise or representation the character of a contract " . In the first situation , the public authority " is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation , giving it the weight it thinks right , but no more , before deciding whether to change course " , and the court may only review the authority 's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness . On the other hand , when assessing a case in the second situation , the court decides whether for an authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power . The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy . 
 A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice of Appeal John Laws . In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment , ex parte Begbie ( 1999 ) , he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not " hermetically sealed " , and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ( 2005 ) , he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach : 
 [ A ] public body 's promise or practice as to future conduct may only be denied ... in circumstances where to do so is the public body 's legal duty , or is otherwise ... a proportionate response ( of which the court is the judge , or the last judge ) having regard to a legitimate aim pursued by the public body in the public interest . 
 In Coughlan the view was expressed that the court will assess whether it is unfair for an authority to frustrate a legitimate expectation when the expectation is " confined to one person or a few people , giving the promise or representation the character of a contract " . In R. ( Bancoult ) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ( No. 2 ) ( 2007 ) , it was accepted that members of a group of close to a thousand or even up to several thousand people could have a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit following the government 's announcement of its intentions . 
 Where a person convinces the court that his or her substantive legitimate expectation has been frustrated , the usual remedy is for the court to order that the public authority fulfil the expectation . However , in R. ( Bibi ) v. Newham London Borough Council ( 2001 ) it was held that when the decision in question is " informed by social and political value judgments as to priorities of expenditure " it is more appropriate for the authority to make the decision , and the court may order that the authority should merely reconsider its decision , taking into account the person 's substantive legitimate expectation . 
 Coughlan has been criticized for allowing the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law , as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and , in a sense , usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government . This is arguably inconsistent with the court 's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law . 
 = = Singapore = = 
 = = = Legitimate expectation of a procedural right = = = 
 Singaporean courts have accepted the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations . In Re Siah Mooi Guat ( 1988 ) , the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8 ( 3 ) ( k ) of the Immigration Act and had her re @-@ entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled . As the applicant 's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected , the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash the decision of the Minister . One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights : the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act , and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision . 
 In his judgment , Justice T. S. Sinnathuray considered Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs ( 1968 ) , decided by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales . He found that the procedural principles that govern the administration of Singapore 's immigration laws were similar to those in the UK . In Schmidt it was decided that an alien has no right to enter the country except by leave and the Home Secretary can refuse leave without giving any reason ; that if an alien is given leave to enter the country for a limited period he has no right to stay , and no legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay , for a day longer than the permitted period ; and that an alien 's application for an extension of his stay can be refused without reasons and without a hearing as the rules of natural justice do not apply . Furthermore , in Schmidt Lord Denning had espoused the obiter view that where an alien 's permit to stay " is revoked before the time limit expires , he ought ... to be given the opportunity of making representations : for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for a permitted time " . This argument was advanced by Siah 's counsel to persuade the court that " an alien who is in possession of an entry permit which has not yet expired is in the country lawfully until the date of expiry and , therefore , he has an interest during the unexpired portion that carries with it a public law right to a fair procedure , if and when the minister desires to terminate that leave to stay prematurely " . The High Court judge considered this proposition and conceded that it was an " attractive " one . However , he ultimately dismissed the argument by saying that it had " not been supported by any English authority " , and that the position in Singapore is " quite different " . He stated that Parliament had already provided in the Immigration Act for appeals and the right to be heard has been given statutory recognition and protection in the Act , and the applicant had already availed herself of the right to appeal . The Minister was not required to give reasons for his rejection of the appeal under the common law or the Immigration Act . 
 = = = Legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit = = = 
 The existence of the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation in Singapore public law was accepted by the Court of Appeal in the case of Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor . In his judgment written on behalf of the Court , Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated that the idea behind the doctrine is that certain " expectations could , in suitable circumstances , be deserving of protection , even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right " . Nonetheless , the Court stated : " [ W ] e were not concerned with judicial review , nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could <unk> the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment . That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here . " 
 Other decided cases also do not indicate whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation will be developed in the way it has been developed in the UK . In Siah Mooi Guat , another argument the applicant raised was that she had a legitimate expectation to continue to reside in Singapore until the expiry of her re @-@ entry permit . Sinnathuray J. distinguished Attorney @-@ General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen <unk> ( 1983 ) , a Privy Council case on appeal from Hong Kong , from the case at hand . In the Privy Council case there had been an express promise made to Ng by the Government of Hong Kong which had created a substantive legitimate expectation . In the present case , no promise had been made to be applicant that her stay in Singapore was to be conditioned by any considerations other than those provided in the Immigration Act and related regulations . No substantive legitimate expectation arose in the applicant 's favour , following the dictum of Lord Fraser of <unk> in the GCHQ case that legitimate expectation arises " either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue " . Thus , the judge did not discuss the detailed legal rules to be applied to determine when an aggrieved person may be said to have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right . 
 In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority ( 2009 ) , the applicant and her husband owned a semi @-@ detached house which they wished to redevelop . In 2002 , the Urban Redevelopment Authority ( URA ) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi @-@ detached houses . The URA rejected the applicant 's redevelopment application on the basis of the circular . Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved . The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation . It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith 's Judicial Review ( 6th ed . , 2007 ) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created : the public body 's representation must be clear , unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification ; induced by the conduct of the decision @-@ maker ; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority ; and applicable to the applicant , who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply . The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made . The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right , but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her , it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore . 
 In UDL Marine ( Singapore ) Pte . Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp. ( 2011 ) , the High Court " entertain [ ed ] some doubt " as to whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is part of Singapore law , but did not discuss the matter further as neither the respondent nor the Attorney @-@ General had made submissions on the issue . Subsequently , however , in Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte . Ltd. v. Singapore Land Authority ( 2013 ) a differently constituted High Court held that substantive legitimate expectation should be recognized as a ground of judicial review if the following conditions are satisfied : 
 ( a ) The applicant must prove that the statement or representation made by the public authority was unequivocal and unqualified ; 
 ( i ) if the statement or representation is open to more than one natural interpretation , the interpretation applied by the public authority will be adopted ; and 
 ( ii ) the presence of a disclaimer or non @-@ reliance clause would cause the statement or representation to be qualified . 
 ( b ) The applicant must prove the statement or representation was made by someone with actual or ostensible authority to do so on behalf of the public authority . 
 ( c ) The applicant must prove that the statement or representation was made to him or to a class of persons to which he clearly belongs . ( d ) The applicant must prove that it was reasonable for him to rely on the statement or representation in the circumstances of his case : 
 ( i ) if the applicant knew that the statement or representation was made in error and chose to capitalise on the error , he will not be entitled to any relief ; 
 ( ii ) similarly , if he suspected that the statement or representation was made in error and chose not to seek clarification when he could have done so , he will not be entitled to any relief ; 
 ( iii ) if there is reason and opportunity to make enquiries and the applicant did not , he will not be entitled to any relief . 
 ( e ) The applicant must prove that he did rely on the statement or representation and that he suffered a detriment as a result . 
 ( f ) Even if all the above requirements are met , the court should nevertheless not grant relief if : 
 ( i ) giving effect to the statement or representation will result in a breach of the law or the State ’ s international obligations ; 
 ( ii ) giving effect to the statement or representation will infringe the accrued rights of some member of the public ; 
 ( iii ) the public authority can show an overriding national or public interest which justifies the frustration of the applicant 's expectation . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 Academics have expressed scepticism as to whether the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights . Thio Li @-@ ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights . Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority , since the court is only concerned with the manner in which the decision was made and not whether the decision was fair . Thus , the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy . Conversely , as Mark Elliot posits , giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers . The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest . Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision . Such interference with the public authority 's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function . 
 On the other hand , in Coughlan the Court of Appeal cited the following passage from R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners , ex parte MFK Underwriting Agents Ltd . ( 1990 ) : 
 If a public authority so conducts itself as to create a legitimate expectation that a certain course will be followed it would often be unfair if the authority were permitted to follow a different course to the detriment of one who entertained the expectation , particularly if he acted on it . ... The doctrine of legitimate expectation is rooted in fairness . 
 The Court of Appeal emphasized that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness . Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive 's policy @-@ making powers , as it is for public authorities , acting within their statutory powers , to adopt or change policies . The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review . On the other hand , it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority 's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power .

 = Alyssa Healy = 
 Alyssa Jean Healy ( born 24 March 1990 on the Gold Coast , Queensland ) is a cricketer who plays for New South Wales and the Australian women 's team . She made her international debut in February 2010 . 
 A right @-@ handed batter and wicket @-@ keeper , she is the daughter of Greg Healy , who was part of the Queensland squad , while her uncle Ian Healy was Australia 's Test wicket @-@ keeper and held the world record for the most Test dismissals . Healy first came to prominence in late 2006 when she became the first girl to play among boys in the private schools ' competition in New South Wales . She moved up the state age group ranks and made her debut for the senior New South Wales team in the 2007 – 08 season . She played most of her first two seasons as a specialist batsman due to the presence of Leonie Coleman — a wicket @-@ keeper for Australia — in the state side . Coleman left New South Wales at the start of the 2009 – 10 season and Healy took up the glovework on a full @-@ time basis for her state . During the same season , she recorded her highest score of 89 not out at faster than a run a ball , and made the most dismissals of any wicket @-@ keeper in the Women 's National Cricket League . 
 Following the injury to Australian captain and wicket @-@ keeper Jodie Fields , Healy was given her international debut in the 2010 Rose Bowl series against New Zealand . She played in the first five One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) and five Twenty20 ( T20 ) internationals , but was dropped for the last three ODIs during the New Zealand leg of the series . Healy played in every match of the 2010 World Twenty20 as Australia won the tournament after an unbeaten campaign . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Healy is the daughter of Greg , who was a member of the Queensland squad , while Greg 's younger brother Ian was Australia 's Test wicket @-@ keeper from the late 1980s until 1999 and was the world record holder for the most Test dismissals . Another uncle , Ken , played for Queensland . Despite the family heritage , and watching her uncle represent Australia , she said that she did not become interested in cricket until she moved from Queensland to Sydney as a child and was coaxed into taking up the sport by a friend . 
 Her selection at the age of 16 in late 2006 as wicket @-@ keeper for Barker College First XI , the first time a girl had been picked to play among boys in the elite private schools ' cricket competition in New South Wales , drew press commentary from various sources . This came about after an anonymous person , believed to be a former male student , circulated an email entitled " Save Barker Cricket Now " in the school community attacking the selection as a " disgrace " and calling for gender segregation of the cricket team . The sportsmaster of Barker College condemned the anonymous writer as " gutless " and maintained that Healy 's selection was based on merit . Ian Healy and Alex Blackwell , a cricketer for the Australian women 's team and former Barker student , also defended the selection and criticised the email author . The <unk> was also criticised , and Alyssa Healy commended , by social commentators in newspapers . In 2010 , she reflected " I 'd do it all again ... I really enjoyed playing school cricket with the boys and it definitely helped lift my skills and tighten my technique . " Both she and Australian team @-@ mate <unk> Perry have publicly advocated girls playing against boys . 
 In January 2007 , Healy was selected in the New South Wales team to play in the Under @-@ 19 interstate competition . Opening the batting in all three matches and keeping in only the second of these , she scored 47 , 73 and 41 in her first three matches , and took one catch . She went on to end with 345 runs at a batting average of 57 @.@ 50 , topping the run @-@ scorers list and was named the best under @-@ 17 player at the tournament . The following month , she was selected in the Australia Youth team , composed of under @-@ 23 cricketers , to play against New Zealand A , the only player selected before making their senior domestic debut . She scored 10 not out , 41 and 63 in three matches , and made one stumping . Her 63 from 84 balls in the final match was the top @-@ score for the Australians , but it was not enough to prevent a 22 @-@ run defeat . She played as a wicket @-@ keeper batting in the middle @-@ order in the first match , and opened in the last two matches , playing purely as a batsman . The series ended 1 – 1 after the second match was tied . 
 = = Senior domestic debut = = 
 At the start of the 2007 – 08 season , she made her senior debut for the New South Wales Breakers in the Australian domestic one @-@ day league . She was used as a specialist batsman in the top @-@ order , as Leonie Coleman , a wicket @-@ keeper in the Australian squad , also played for New South Wales . She made her debut against South Australia and was unsuccessful to begin with , scoring only 24 runs in her first five innings . After one month at senior level , she broke through with a match @-@ winning performance in her sixth senior game . After Queensland had made 170 , Healy came in with the score at 5 / 99 after 32 overs , with 18 overs remaining . She raised the run rate , scoring 41 not out from 50 balls , with eight fours , shepherding the tail @-@ enders and guiding her state to a two @-@ wicket win with 17 balls to spare . 
 New South Wales reached the final and were awarded the title because they placed first in the qualifying matches after rain washed out the deciding game . Healy ended the season with 78 runs at 11 @.@ 14 . She also played in two Twenty20 interstate matches . She scored two and made a stumping in the first match , and neither batted nor kept wicket in the latter . New South Wales prevailed in both . 
 At the end of the season , she was selected for the Under @-@ 23 Australian team to play a series against the senior England and Australian teams . She scored 45 , 1 and 41 not out in three matches . In the third match , she combined for a second @-@ wicket partnership of 52 with Elyse Villani , hitting six boundaries in 62 balls and guiding her team to an eight @-@ wicket win over the Australian team . Playing as a specialist batsman , she also took three catches . The new 2008 – 09 season started the same way , with the Under @-@ 23 national team playing against Australia and India . The first match , against India , was washed out and Healy made a duck [ zero ] and 9 in the other matches . Playing as a batsman , she did not take a catch . 
 Healy again played as a batsman , with Coleman ensconced behind the stumps . In the first four matches of the new domestic season , she batted only once , scoring nine . In these matches she was placed in the lower @-@ order and did not bowl . She was dropped after these four matches . 
 She then played six matches for the Second XI in the space of a week , mostly as a top @-@ order batsman , sometimes opening and as a wicket @-@ keeper . New South Wales won all the fixtures except for one that was abandoned due to inclement weather . She scored 120 runs at 40 @.@ 00 , took six catches and made three stumpings , and was recalled to the senior team after one week in the second @-@ string outfit . In her first three matches back , Healy was placed in the middle @-@ order and not required to bat or keep wickets . In the last league match , she scored 59 from 55 balls in an 89 @-@ run partnership at faster than a run a ball with Lisa Sthalekar against Victoria . New South Wales won by three wickets despite losing Healy and three subsequent batsmen in the closing phase of the run @-@ chase . In the final against the same team the following week , Healy made 11 from 22 balls before being run out , but New South Wales nevertheless won by six wickets with more than 15 overs to spare to claim the title . Healy ended the one @-@ day competition with 79 runs at 26 @.@ 33 . She was named Australia 's 30 @-@ strong shortlist for the 2009 Women 's Cricket World Cup , but was not a part of the final squad of 15 . 
 Healy also played in two Twenty20 matches for her state during the season , scoring 35 from 27 balls against South Australia and 16 from 21 balls against Victoria . She was New South Wales ' second top @-@ scorer in both matches ; the first was won but the second lost . 
 = = Full @-@ time wicket @-@ keeper = = 
 After the Women 's World Cup held in early 2009 , Coleman transferred to play for the Australian Capital Territory , so Healy became New South Wales ' gloveman on a full @-@ time basis for the start of the 2009 – 10 season . After making scores of 11 , 12 and 29 in her first three innings of the one @-@ day season , she struck an unbeaten 89 against Victoria . Coming in upon the fall of Leah Poulton with the score at 1 / 9 after three overs , she hit 13 fours in 82 balls , putting on partnerships of 72 with Blackwell and 82 with Sthalekar . New South Wales reached their target of 187 with more than 13 overs to spare and Healy was named the Player of the Match , having earlier taken a catch and made a stumping . Her season was interrupted by her selection in the Australian Under @-@ 21 team to play against the New Zealand Emerging Players . In five matches , she scored 50 runs at 10 @.@ 00 , took five catches and made one stumping as Australia won the series 4 – 1 . 
 In the final of the one @-@ day competition , she scored 23 from 37 balls batting at No. 3 and took two catches as New South Wales defeated Victoria by 59 runs . Healy ended her first full season as a wicket @-@ keeper with 208 runs at 29 @.@ 71 , the second @-@ highest average in her team behind Blackwell . In 11 matches , she also took 11 catches and completed 9 stumpings , effecting more dismissals than any other player . 
 She made 52 runs at 13 @.@ 00 in seven T20 matches . Her best score was an unbeaten 20 from 13 balls in an eight @-@ wicket win over Tasmania . In the final , Victoria batted first and made 5 / 127 , Healy completing a catch and stumping . In reply , Healy made a duck as New South Wales lost four wickets in the first 13 balls and were all out for 75 to lose by 22 runs . 
 = = International debut = = 
 Healy was selected in the Australian squad for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand in February 2010 due to an injury to the incumbent wicketkeeper and captain Jodie Fields . The selection committee released a statement saying " Alyssa has been identified for higher honours for a number of years and now gets the chance to display her wicket @-@ keeping skills and attacking batting on the international stage " . Healy made her ODI debut at the Adelaide Oval and played in all five ODIs in the Australian leg of the series . In her first match , she scored 21 from 11 balls in the death overs , hitting four fours as Australia made 241 before bowling out the visitors for 126 to seal a 115 @-@ run win . She took one catch , removing Amy Satterthwaite from the bowling of Rene Farrell . Healy made consecutive ducks in the next two matches , and made four in the final match at Junction Oval . She had only brief opportunities with the bat in the closing stages of the innings . She ended the series with 25 runs at 6 @.@ 25 and a strike rate of 100 @.@ 00 , five catches and a stumping . 
 She then played in the three T20s held at Bellerive Oval in Hobart . The first of these matches was a curtain @-@ raiser to the match between the Australia and West Indies men teams , and was the first match to be shown live on free @-@ to @-@ air television in Australia . New Zealand batted first and Australian fast bowler <unk> Perry extracted an outside edge from captain Aimee Watkins from the first ball of the match . The ball flew straight to Healy 's mid @-@ riff and she dropped it . Watkins went on to score 44 from 36 balls as New Zealand made 7 / 117 and Healy 's only dismissal was to catch Nicola Browne from Sthalekar 's off spin . Healy came to the crease at 6 / 107 at the end of the 19th over and had scored three runs from as many balls and found herself on strike for the final ball of the match , bowled by Browne , with Australia needing three runs for the win . The delivery was wide outside off and Healy 's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant first slip area . It would have gone for a match @-@ winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket @-@ keeper Rachel Priest diving across and catching the ball one @-@ handed in her right glove , handing the tourists a two @-@ run victory . 
 Healy had little impact with the bat in the three T20s in Australia and two more at the start of the New Zealand leg of the series , scoring 17 runs at 5 @.@ 66 and a strike rate of 77 @.@ 27 . Apart from one catch on her debut , she did not make any more dismissals . Australia lost all five matches . She was then omitted for the three ODIs in New Zealand as batsman Jess Cameron stood in as a makeshift wicket @-@ keeper . 
 = = 2010 World Twenty20 = = 
 Healy was selected for the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies and played in every match after Fields was again forced out by injury . In the first warm @-@ up match , she took two catches and did not bat as Australia lost to New Zealand by 18 runs . In the last warm @-@ up match , she was again not required to bat and did not make a dismissal as the Australians defeated Pakistan by 82 runs . 
 Australia were grouped with England , South Africa and the West Indies . In the first match against England , Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar . In pursuit of 105 for victory , Australia were struggling when Healy came to the crease with the score at 7 / 63 after 14 @.@ 2 overs . Three wickets had fallen in the space of 16 balls , during which only three runs had been added , and England had the momentum , and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory . Healy then struck three fours , making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw , ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar . However , Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available , leaving the scores tied . 
 A Super Over eventuated , and Laura Marsh bowled for England . Healy came in at 1 / 3 after Leah Poulton fell on the fourth ball . She hit a two from the fifth ball , and was run out by Jenny Gunn while attempting to complete a second run on the sixth and final ball of Australia 's Super Over , leaving them at 2 / 6 . England also ended with 2 / 6 after a run out in an attempt to secure the winning run on the final ball . Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the match — Jess Cameron scored the solitary six . 
 In the next match against South Africa , Healy was elevated two positions to No. 7 . Coming in upon the fall of Cameron , her partner Sarah Elliott was then run out without further addition to the score . Healy hit one boundary and was then out for 8 from 6 balls at 7 / 151 . Her dismissal was part of a sudden collapse as Australia lost 6 / 16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused . Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22 @-@ run win . In the final group match against the West Indies , Healy came in at 6 / 111 and hit 12 from 8 balls , before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7 / 133 . She had put on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar . She caught <unk> <unk> from the bowling of Perry for a golden duck as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the top of their quartet . 
 Australia went on to face India in the semi @-@ final . Healy stumped leading Indian batsman <unk> Raj from the bowling of Sthalekar and was not required to bat as Australia reached their target of 120 with seven wickets and seven balls to spare . Australia elected to bat first in the final against New Zealand , but was top @-@ order struggled and Healy came to the crease to join Elliott at 5 / 51 in the 13th over after the fall of two wickets in quick succession . The pair lifted the run rate by adding 21 runs in 18 balls . Healy scored 10 from as many balls , but was then run out attempting a second run after being dropped by Sara McGlashan in the outfield . This left the score at 6 / 72 in the 16th over , and Australia eventually ended on 8 / 106 . 
 During the middle of the run @-@ chase , Priest was incorrectly given out stumped by Healy after the television umpire Asad Rauf had pressed the wrong button , and he had to retract his decision . Soon after New Zealand were at 5 / 36 after 11 overs , leaving them with 71 runs to score from the last 54 balls , and Australia were in the ascendancy . However , New Zealand 's chances were revived by Nicola Browne and Sophie Devine , who put on 41 from as many balls . In the 18th over , Healy caught Browne from Perry 's bowling , and Australia went on to win by three runs after New Zealand ended on 6 / 103 .

 = John Vanbiesbrouck = 
 John Vanbiesbrouck ( born September 4 , 1963 ) , nicknamed " the <unk> " , is an American professional ice hockey executive and former player . A goaltender as a player , he was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007 . Vanbiesbrouck played in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the New York Rangers , Florida Panthers , Philadelphia Flyers , New York Islanders , and New Jersey Devils . He began his career playing major junior hockey for the Sault Ste . Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) . Following a successful season with the Greyhounds , he was drafted by the New York Rangers in the fourth round , 72nd overall , in the 1981 NHL Draft . After his junior career ended , he played for the Rangers minor league affiliate , the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League . Despite the team 's near collapses due to financial concerns , Vanbiesbrouck led the Oilers to a league championship and shared the league 's MVP honors . 
 He began playing full @-@ time with the Rangers in the 1984 – 85 season . Vanbiesbrouck won the Vezina Trophy as the league 's top goaltender and was named a First Team NHL All @-@ Star the following season . After playing in parts of 11 seasons with the Rangers , he was taken in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft by the Florida Panthers . In Florida , Vanbiesbrouck was a three @-@ time all @-@ star , and led the Panthers to their first and only Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 1996 . While in Florida he recorded his 300th career victory , becoming the 15th goaltender and only the second American goalie in NHL history to do so . During his career , Vanbiesbrouck compiled a record of 374 wins , 346 losses , 119 ties , and 40 shutouts , making him the winningest American @-@ born goaltender and tying Frank Brimsek for most career shutouts by an American @-@ born goaltender . 
 Internationally , Vanbiesbrouck has represented the United States on several occasions . He played in the 1982 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships as well as four IIHF World Championships . He was named to the Second All @-@ Star team at the 1985 World Ice Hockey Championships . He also played in two Canada Cup tournaments , registering the lowest goals against average in 1987 and was a back @-@ up goaltender during the Americans ' second @-@ place finish in 1991 . He represented Team USA for the final time in 1998 , serving as the back @-@ up on the Olympic ice hockey team . 
 Following his playing career , he took over as the head coach and General Manager of the Greyhounds . However , after using a racial slur referencing his team captain , he resigned . Vanbiesbrouck worked as a broadcaster and in hockey @-@ related businesses . In 2013 , Vanbiesbrouck was named the general manager of the United States Hockey League 's Muskegon Lumberjacks . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Vanbiesbrouck was born in Detroit , Michigan to a Belgian immigrant bricklayer , Robert Vanbiesbrouck , and an Italian immigrant Sara . He grew @-@ up with two brothers ; the oldest , Frank , who was also a goaltender in youth hockey . He inspired Vanbiesbrouck to play goaltender . John later noted that he learned more about goaltending just from watching Frank than any coaching could , adding that no one ever helped him more to become the player he was .

 While playing midget level hockey Vanbiesbrouck joined the Little Caesars hockey club , a travel ice hockey team in Detroit . During a tournament in Toronto , Vanbiesbrouck lost his jersey and was forced to wear a teammate 's uniform . He played well in the tournament with junior scouts in attendance . Since Vanbiesbrouck wore another player 's jersey he went undrafted in the midget draft , while the player whose jersey he wore was drafted in the fourth round . After being unclaimed in the draft Vanbiesbrouck was offered a try @-@ out with the Sault Ste . Marie Greyhounds , members of the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League , later becoming the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) . At the try @-@ out he made the team , winning a spot over several other players and became the starting goalie for the Greyhounds . Vanbiesbrouck played in 56 games and complied a 31 – 16 – 1 record during his first season in Sault Ste . Marie . Following the 1980 – 81 season he was drafted in the 4th round , 72nd overall of the NHL Draft by the New York Rangers . 
 On December 5 , 1981 , just months after being drafted , Vanbiesbrouck made his professional debut with the Rangers as an emergency call @-@ up . He defeated the Colorado Rockies 2 – 1 . Despite only allowing one goal and earning his first NHL win , the Rangers decided to return him to Sault Ste . Marie — a move intended to aid his development . He finished the year with a 12 – 12 – 2 record for the Greyhounds and made his first international appearance , representing the United States at the 1982 World Junior Championships . He played one more season for the Greyhounds , playing 62 games winning 39 of them and being named to OHL Second All @-@ Star Team . 
 Following his career with the Greyhounds , Vanbiesbrouck moved on to the minor leagues joining the Central Hockey League 's ( CHL ) Tulsa Oilers . During the 1983 @-@ 84 season , his first with the Oilers , the ownership group was unable to sustain the team . They went bankrupt , were taken over by the league , and forced to play their remaining games on the road . After losing their home rink the team was housed in Denver , Colorado where they shared a practice facility with the University of Denver and fellow CHL team the Colorado Flames . The lack of ice time often forced the Oilers to practice in a Mall where they were not allowed to shoot pucks . For extra practice Vanbiesbrouck had tennis balls hit at him in the parking lot . Despite all the adversity the Oilers won the Adams Cup as league champions . Meanwhile , Vanbiesbrouck won the Terry Sawchuk Award , with back @-@ up Ron Scott , for fewest goals against in the league and shared CHL MVP honors with Bruce Affleck by winning the Tommy Ivan Trophy . 
 = = = New York Rangers = = = 
 He made the Rangers full @-@ time in the 1984 – 85 season , playing in 42 games and posted a 4 @.@ 20 goals against average ( GAA ) . The following year Vanbiesbrouck enjoyed a breakout season , playing in 61 games , winning a career high 31 . The 31 victories accounted for all but 5 of the Rangers ' regular season total . His success continued over to the post @-@ season , where he led the Rangers to an upset over the Philadelphia Flyers in the opening round . He then followed it by beating a Washington Capitals team that registered 107 points in the regular season . The Rangers lost in the Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens . In the off season Vanbiesbrouck was named a First Team NHL All @-@ Star , won the Vezina Trophy as the league 's top goaltender , and signed a new three @-@ year contract with the Rangers . He was unable to repeat his success in the next season , winning 18 games in 50 games played while losing 20 contests . 
 Prior to the 1987 – 88 season Vanbiesbrouck was hit by a puck under his mask in practice , which caused a non @-@ displaced fracture of his lower jaw and a broken tooth . Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut , and he was able to return to practice the next day . He showed no ill effects from the injury , playing in 56 games , winning 27 . On June 13 , 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons . He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child . The glass broke beneath him , and as he braced for the fall , his wrist was cut by the glass . Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage . He was initially expected to miss 4 – 6 months , but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre @-@ season training camp just 3 months later . Again he played in 56 games , and increased his win total to 28 . 
 He began the 1989 @-@ 90 season as the Rangers ' starting goaltender , but after the Rangers struggled in early January , he began to share the duties with the recently called up Mike Richter . During the playoffs head coach Roger Neilson employed a rotation system between the two goaltenders . The Rangers won their first round match @-@ up against the Islanders , but lost to the Capitals in the second round . For his part Vanbiesbrouck posted a 2 – 3 record with a 3 @.@ 02 GAA and a <unk> save percentage . 
 The following season the two goaltenders formed the best duo in the NHL . The duo remained together even after Vanbiesbrouck had a chance to leave via free agency in 1992 . A new collective bargaining agreement established him as a group 2 free agent , allowing the Rangers to match any offer from another team or to claim draft choices as compensation if he were to sign with another team . After not receiving much interest from other clubs , Vanbiesbrouck re @-@ signed with the Rangers , signing a two @-@ year deal with an option for the third averaging $ 1 million per season . At the end of the 1992 – 93 season , the decision was made to trade Vanbiesbrouck . With the upcoming expansion draft the Rangers would only be able to protect one goaltender . Faced with the prospect of losing one of their two goaltenders , the Rangers traded the " equally talented " but older Vanbiesbrouck to the Vancouver Canucks for future considerations ( Doug Lidster ) . 
 = = = Florida Panthers = = = 
 Vancouver made the trade not with the intention of keeping Vanbiesbrouck , but rather in an attempt to keep other players on their roster from being drafted . Rules of the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft allowed teams to protect one goaltender , nine forwards and five defensemen . Additional rules stated that teams could only lose one goaltender in the draft and prevented teams from losing both a defenseman and a goaltender . Prior to the draft Florida Panthers general manager Bobby Clarke won a coin @-@ toss giving them the first pick in the draft . Thus with their first selection , the Panthers picked Vanbiesbrouck to be the number one goalie for their team . Upon his arrival in Florida , Vanbiesbrouck went on a " mall tour " to help elevate the visibility of the franchise and made an informative video explaining ice hockey terms for Blockbuster , then owners of the franchise . In January 1994 he made his return to Madison Square Garden . In his first game back to his former home venue , Vanbiesbrouck made 51 saves ultimately losing the game 3 – 2 to his former team . During the season he was also named to the All @-@ Star game as the Panthers ' sole representative . In the game Vanbiesbrouck played the third period , made six saves and was credited with the win . At the completion of his first season in Florida , he played in 57 games posting a 21 – 25 – 11 record , registering a 2 @.@ 53 GAA , and his career best save percentage of .924 ranked him second in the league . Vanbiesbrouck was named a Second Team NHL All @-@ Star and was shortlisted for the Hart and Vezina Trophies . His 21 wins tied the Minnesota North Stars ' Cesare Maniago 's record for the most by an expansion goaltender . The record was later passed by Ron <unk> during the Columbus Blue Jackets inaugural season . The Panthers finished the season with 83 points , one point behind the New York Islanders , for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference . The following season was shortened due to the 1994 – 95 NHL lockout . As a result , Vanbiesbrouck played in just 37 games registering a 14 – 15 – 4 record . He <unk> his GAA from the previous year to 2 @.@ 47 and increased his shutout total from one to four . However his save percentage dropped to .914 . The Panthers again fell a point short of making the playoffs . 
 In the 1995 – 96 season , Vanbiesbrouck was named to the All @-@ Star Game . In the game he played the second period and gave up three goals on seven shots . The Panthers were in playoff position for more than half of the season , but faltered late in the season and were close to falling out of the playoff race . Late in the season Vanbiesbrouck shutout the New Jersey Devils putting Florida into the playoffs . At the end of the regular season he played in 57 games posting a 21 – 25 – 11 with 2 shutouts . His games played ranked him tenth in the league while his GAA of 2 @.@ 68 was ninth . In the first round Florida defeated the Boston Bruins in five games . Their second round match @-@ up was against the heavily favored Philadelphia Flyers . Vanbiesbrouck posted a shutout in the first game of the series , the third post season shutout of his career and the first in Panthers playoff history . During the series Vanbiesbrouck held the Flyers scoreless for 116 : 46 straight minutes , as Florida upset Philadelphia winning four games to two . In the Conference Finals the Panthers were again huge underdogs to the Pittsburgh Penguins , a team that featured the leagues two top scorers in Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr .

Small for a goaltender , standing only 5 ' 8 " , he relied on his quickness to regain his feet after making saves or to make additional saves in goalmouth scrambles . Vanbiesbrouck was aggressive when it came to playing the puck , which helped him tie the Rangers single season record for assists by a goaltender and set the Rangers career record as well . Although he was considered one of the best positional goaltenders in the league , his greatest attribute may have been his self @-@ confidence . Former teammate Tom Laidlaw once noted that he believed Vanbiesbrouck 's confidence carried him farther than his talent .

It 's a mistake and consequences have to be paid by me , I 've embarrassed everybody and my family by this one comment . It 's not what they represent and it 's not what the Sault Greyhounds organization represents . " He added " I told Trev this is an old wound with me , I grew up with it .
