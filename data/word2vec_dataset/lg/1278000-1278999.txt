 Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Toki Wasure No Meikyū Original Soundtrack is the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Fables : Chocobo 's Dungeon ( チョコボの不思議なダンジョン <unk> , Chokobo no Fushigi na Danjon Toki Wasure no Meikyū , lit . Chocobo 's Mysterious Dungeon : The Labyrinth of Forgotten Time ) , which features remixes of various Final Fantasy music . It was arranged by Yuzo Takahashi of Joe Down Studio , a Hokkaido @-@ based music development studio . The title track and opening theme — both original to the soundtrack — were composed by Kumi Tanioka , while the final track " Door Crawl " was written and sung by Ai Kawashima . Other composers whose works were used are Nobuo Uematsu , Naoshi Mizuta , Masashi Hamauzu , Junya Nakano , and Kenji Ito . The album was released by Square Enix on January 23 , 2008 with the catalog number SQEX @-@ <unk> . 
 The album was well received by critics such as <unk> of RPGFan , who enjoyed the arrangements , particularly those of pieces from games early in the Final Fantasy series . He praised Joe Down Studios for not falling into the trap of " introducing a veneer of self @-@ importance " that he felt was common in remakes of early Final Fantasy pieces . Chris of Square Enix Music Online also liked the album , saying that the arrangements " make many tracks sound better than they 've ever sounded before " . His largest complaint about the album was that it does not include every track from the game , some of which he was interested in hearing . He ascribed the exclusions to the publisher 's desire to release the soundtrack as a single disc , and concluded that the album was still a " very enjoyable overall experience " . 
 " Door Crawl " , the theme song of Chocobo 's Dungeon , was released as a single entitled Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Toki Wasure No <unk> : Door Crawl . The album was released by Toshiba EMI on December 12 , 2007 . It has a length of 14 : 18 , and contains three tracks . The title track , " Door Crawl " ( <unk> ) , is joined by " Colorless Thing " ( <unk> , " Iro no Nai Mono " ) and " Light " ( <unk> , " <unk> " ) , both unrelated to Chocobo 's Dungeon . The disc was Kawashima 's 15th single ; it reached # 20 on the Oricon Weekly Charts and sold 6 @,@ 520 copies in its first week . Lex of Square Enix Music Online had mixed feelings about the single , saying that " Door Crawl " was " a pleasant and laid back listen " , but that " Colorless Thing " was " nothing special " and that " Light " was " ruined " by the synth instruments .

 The Chocobo and the Magic Books mini @-@ series comprises Chocobo to Mahou no Ehon , released in North America as Final Fantasy Fables : Chocobo Tales and literally translating to Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book , as well as its to @-@ date Japan @-@ only sequel , Chocobo to Mahō no Ehon : <unk> to Shōjo to <unk> no Yūsha , translated as Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book : The Witch , The Maiden , and the Five Heroes . Neither game has received a separate full soundtrack release ; Chocobo Tales produced a download @-@ only album on iTunes titled The Best of Chocobo and the Magic Book Original Soundtrack , while together their soundtracks were released in full as the two @-@ disc Chocobo and the Magic Books Original Soundtrack . The majority of the tracks are either unchanged versions or arrangements of Final Fantasy and Chocobo compositions ; Chocobo Tales contains only two original tracks — one of which is only eight seconds long — while its sequel has 12 original tracks out of 33 . The soundtracks for both games were composed by Yuzo Takahashi . Magic Books contains 61 tracks across two discs , with a total length of 1 : 51 : 57 ; Best of 's 10 tracks span 26 : 16 . The tracks in Best of correspond to tracks 8 , 1 , 3 , 9 , 19 , 25 , 12 , 18 , 27 , and 28 of the first disc of Magic Books , in that order . 
 While neither album has seen much attention from critics , The Best of Chocobo and the Magic Book Original Soundtrack was dismissed by Chris of Square Enix Music Online as " not a worthwhile sampler " of the soundtrack . Terming it a " truncated compilation " , he criticized the track selection as including what were in his opinion some of the weakest arrangements while excluding the strongest , and concluded that the album serves no purpose given the subsequent release of the full soundtrack as part of The Best of Chocobo and the Magic Book Original Soundtrack . He was much more complimentary of the Magic Books album , saying that it " confirmed that Yuzo Takahashi is a bright young composer " and calling the arrangements and original compositions " both melodically engaging and stylistically versatile " . 
 Tracklist 
 = Hygrophorus eburneus = 
 Hygrophorus eburneus , commonly known as the ivory waxy cap or the cowboy 's handkerchief , is a species of edible mushroom in the <unk> family of fungi . It is widespread in Europe and North America , and has also been collected in northern Africa . The fruit bodies are medium @-@ sized , pure white , and when wet are covered in a layer of slime thick enough to make the mushroom difficult to pick up . The gills are broadly attached to the stem or running down it ; as the family name suggests , they feel waxy when rubbed between the fingers . Like all Hygrophorus species , the fungus is mycorrhizal — a symbiotic association whereby the underground fungal mycelia penetrate and exchange nutrients with tree roots . They are common in a variety of forest types , where they grow on the ground in thickets or grassy areas . Hygrophorus eburneus is the type species of the genus Hygrophorus . A number of biologically active chemicals have been purified from the fruit bodies of the fungus , including fatty acids with bactericidal and fungicidal activity . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first named as Agaricus eburneus by French botanist Jean Bulliard in 1783 . Elias Fries divided the large genus Agaricus into a number of " tribes " ( taxonomically equivalent to modern sections ) in his Systema Mycologicum I , and classified A. eburneus in the tribe Limacium . When In 1836 , Fries first defined the genus Hygrophorus in his Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici , H. eburneus was included . The fungus has also been named Limacium <unk> by Paul Kummer in 1871 , when he raised the tribes of Fries to the rank of genus , and Gymnopus eburneus by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821 . H. eburneus is the type species of the genus Hygrophorus , and is classified in the section Hygrophorus , subsection Hygrophorus . This includes species with non @-@ amyloid , smooth spores , and divergent hyphae in the tissue of the hymenium . Other species in this subsection include H. <unk> , H. coccus , H. <unk> , H. <unk> , and H. glutinosus . 
 The mushroom is commonly known as the " ivory waxy cap " , the " white waxy cap " , or the " cowboy 's handkerchief " . The specific epithet eburneus is a Latin adjective meaning " of ivory " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of H. eburneus is 2 to 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) broad , with a shape ranging from convex to flattened , sometimes with an umbo ( a raised area in the center of the cap ) . In age the cap margin sometimes becomes elevated and the center of the cap depressed . The cap is pure white , and depending on the moisture in the environment , may be glutinous to sticky . The cap surface is smooth , the margin is even and in young specimens , rolled inward and covered with short fibrils . The flesh is white , thick in the center of the cap but thinning toward the margin . The odor and taste are mild . The gills are somewhat arcuate @-@ decurrent , meaning they are shaped like a bow , curving upward and then running down the stem for a short distance . In terms of spacing , they are subdistant to distant , so that space can be seen between them . The gills are moderately broad , broadest near the stem , narrowed in front , pure white , slightly yellowish or buff with age or when dried . The stem is 4 @.@ 5 to 15 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) long , 2 to 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 to 0 @.@ 3 in ) thick , equal in width throughout its length to somewhat tapered downward or with a greatly attenuated base , and glutinous . Its surface is silky beneath the gluten . The top of the stem is covered with short fibrils , pure white , sometimes becoming grayish or dirty with age . It is initially stuffed with cotton @-@ like mycelia , then later becomes hollow . The caps of dried fruit bodies will typically remain white , while the stems will dry darker , especially if they are initially waterlogged . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 When they are viewed in mass , such as with a spore print , the spores appear white . Observing with a light microscope reveals additional details : spores are ellipsoid , smooth , and measure 6 – 8 by 3 @.@ 5 – 5 µm . They are pale yellow in Melzer 's reagent . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are 42 – 52 by 608 µm , and four @-@ spored . There are no pleurocystidia or cheilocystidia . The gill tissue is made of branching hyphae about 7 – 12 µm wide . The cap cuticle is made of gelatinous , narrow ( 3 – 6 µm ) hyphae which are repent ( bent over ) but typically with some erect free ends . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 The mushroom is edible , although it may not be appealing to many due to its sliminess . In China , a yak milk beverage is made with H. <unk> and yak milk , by lactic acid fermentation with Lactobacillus bulgaricus , Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus <unk> as mixed starter . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 A lookalike species of Hygrophorus eburneus is H. <unk> , which differs by having a less slimy cap , dry to slightly viscid stem , and frequent association with spruce . H. <unk> is just as slimy , but has a cream @-@ colored cap , thicker stalk , and grows with pine . The " snow white waxy cap " ( H. borealis ) is also similar in appearance , but has a smaller cap diameter of up to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) — and is not slimy . Hygrophorus <unk> , which typically grows with Quercus species , differs in its pale pinkish @-@ buff cap and gills , and has a distinct sour odor ; also , H. <unk> does not have a potassium hydroxide reaction on the stem as does H. eburneus . The " white slime mushroom " ( Limacella <unk> ) has non @-@ waxy gills that are free from attachment to the stalk . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The fruit bodies of H. eburneus grow on the soil , mostly in coniferous woods , thickets and grassy areas . The fungus prefers soil that is moist , mesic , loamy and calcareous . 
 The fungus is widely distributed in North America . It is also found in Europe ( Poland and Portugal ) , Israel and North Africa . 
 = = Bioactive compounds = = 
 Several fatty acids with bactericidal and fungicidal activity have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of H. eburneus . The bioactive fatty acids are built upon a chemical structure called γ @-@ <unk> . The following gamma @-@ <unk> derivatives have been identified from the mushroom : ( 2E , 9E ) -4 @-@ oxooctadeca @-@ 2 @,@ 9 @,@ 17 @-@ <unk> acid , ( 2E , <unk> ) -4 @-@ oxooctadeca @-@ 2 @,@ 11 @,@ 17 @-@ <unk> acid , ( E ) -4 @-@ oxohexadeca @-@ 2 @,@ 15 @-@ dienoic acid , ( E ) -4 @-@ oxooctadeca @-@ 2 @,@ 17 @-@ dienoic acid , ( 2E , 9E ) -4 @-@ oxooctadeca @-@ 2 @,@ 9 @-@ dienoic acid , ( 2E , <unk> ) -4 @-@ oxooctadeca @-@ 2 @,@ 11 @-@ dienoic acid , ( E ) -4 @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ enoic acid , and ( E ) -4 @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ enoic acid . The compound ( E ) -4 @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ enoic acid has been investigated for potential use as a fungicide against the oomycete species Phytophthora <unk> , a causal agent of potato and tomato late blight disease . 
 Additional secondary metabolites discovered in H. eburneus include the ceramide compound named <unk> ( ( 2S , 3R , 4R , 2 ’ R ) <unk> ( 2 ’ -hydroxy @-@ 9 ’ Z @-@ ene @-@ <unk> ) <unk> @-@ 1 @,@ 3 @,@ 4 @-@ <unk> ) , and the β @-@ carboline alkaloids known as <unk> and <unk> . The report of discovery of the latter two compounds in 2008 represents their first known occurrence in fungal fruit bodies . 
 = Psilocybe pelliculosa = 
 Psilocybe pelliculosa is a species of fungus in the family Hymenogastraceae . The fruit bodies , or mushrooms , have a conical brownish cap up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter atop a slender stem up to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) long . It has a white partial veil that does not leave a ring on the stem . American mycologist Alexander H. Smith first described the species in 1937 as a member of the genus known today as Psathyrella ; it was transferred to Psilocybe by Rolf Singer in 1958 . 
 Psilocybe pelliculosa is found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada , where it grows on the ground in groups or clusters along trails or forest roads in coniferous woods . A single collection has also been reported from Finland . The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin , although at relatively low concentrations . Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P. pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences in the form of the fruit body , or by microscopic characteristics . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described scientifically by Alexander H. Smith in 1937 as <unk> pelliculosa , based on specimens he collected in Washington and Oregon . The type specimen was collected near Lake <unk> , Oregon , in November 1935 . In a 1941 publication , Smith revised his opinion , and considered the species to be the same as Hypholoma silvatica ( later Psilocybe silvatica ) , as he thought that the slight differences between the two were of no taxonomic significance . After reevaluating these two species in addition to several others closely related , Rolf Singer and Smith later reestablished the taxon and transferred it to Psilocybe in 1958 . Psilocybe authority Gastón Guzmán classified the species in the section <unk> , a grouping of related species characterized by having roughly ellipsoid , usually thick @-@ walled spores , and lacking pleurocystidia . 
 The specific epithet pelliculosa is derived from the Latin <unk> , meaning " film " , and refers to the gelatinous pellicle of the cap . The mushroom is commonly known as the " conifer Psilocybe " or the " striate Psilocybe " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of P. pelliculosa is initially sharply cone @-@ shaped , and expands slightly over time to become broadly bell @-@ shaped , but it never expands to become completely flat . The cap margin is pressed against the stem initially , and for a short time is appendiculate ( has partial veil fragments hanging from the margin ) . The caps of mature specimens are smooth , sticky , and have translucent radial striations that reach dimensions of 0 @.@ 8 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter . The color ranges from umber to <unk> ( dark dingy yellow @-@ brown ) when the mushroom is moist , and changes to pinkish @-@ buff when dry . The cap margin can have a greenish @-@ gray tinge . The cap cuticle is a thin gelatinous covering that can be peeled off . 
 The gills have an adnate attachment to the cap , are narrow to moderately broad , closely spaced , and eventually separate from the stem . Young gills are cinnamon @-@ brown in color , with lighter edges , but darken in maturity because they become covered with the dark spores . The stem is 6 to 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) long by 1 @.@ 5 to 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 06 to 0 @.@ 08 in ) thick , and roughly equal in width throughout except for a slightly enlarged base . The lower region of the stem is brownish in color and has silky " hairs " pressed against the stem ; the upper region is grayish and pruinose ( lightly dusted with powdery white granules ) . The flesh turns slightly bluish or greenish where it has been injured . The application of a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide solution on the cap or flesh will cause a color change to pale to dark yellowish- to reddish @-@ brown ; a drop on the stem produces a less intense or no color change . 
 The spore print is purplish @-@ brown . Under the microscope , the spores appear dull purple @-@ brown . They are ellipsoid to somewhat egg @-@ shaped , and , according to Singer 's original description , measure 8 – 10 by 4 – 5 μm . A later study of specimens collected from British Columbia , Canada , instead reported a larger spore size range of 10 – 13 by 6 – 7 μm . The spores have an apical germ pore . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , hyaline ( translucent ) , and measure 22 – 35 by 7 – 10 μm . There are abundant cystidia that form a sterile band on the edges of the gills ( cheilocystidia ) ; these cystidia are smooth , inflated , and fusoid @-@ ventricose ( enlarged in the middle and tapered toward both ends ) with an sharp tip , and measure 25 – 30 by 6 – 9 μm . The cap cuticle ( an ixocutis ) is made of a layer of roughly horizontal , gelatinized , wavy , hyaline hyphae that are 0 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 5 μm in diameter . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The overall stature of the fruit bodies of P. pelliculosa is generally similar to those of Mycena , Galerina , or Hypholoma . Smith noted a superficial resemblance to Psathyrella fagicola , based on similarities in the nature of the cap cuticle , the coloring , and the stem base covered in silky fibers . Psilocybe pelliculosa may be distinguished from <unk> fagicola by the presence of a partial veil , firm gills , and smaller fruit bodies . P. pelliculosa is frequently mistaken for the widespread P. semilanceata , but the latter can be distinguished by its larger spores and a conical , papillate cap . Another similar species is Psilocybe silvatica , and a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between the two species . P. silvatica , found from New York to Michigan and north to Canada , has longer spores . P. pelliculosa has a general resemblance to Hypholoma <unk> , a species found in northern North America and Europe . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The fruit bodies of P. pelliculosa grow in groups or clusters on moss , forest debris , and humus in coniferous forests . The fungus prefers to fruit in disturbed areas such as trails and abandoned forest roads ; it is not commonly found in grasslands . It is known from the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it has been collected in California , Idaho , Oregon , Washington , and it is widely distributed in British Columbia , Canada . It is also found in northern Europe , a single collection from Finland . The fungus often fruits along forest paths and abandoned logging roads where alders and firs are growing . Fruit bodies tend to appear in late summer to early winter after cool , wet weather . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Psilocybe pelliculosa contains the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and baeocystin , and is used as a recreational drug . In terms of psychoactive potency , Stamets considers the species " relatively weak " . Psilocybin levels have been reported to range from 1 @.@ 2 to 7 @.@ 1 milligrams per gram of dried mushroom , while baeocystin was measured at 0 @.@ 04 % . According to some reports from the 1960s , the fungus does not produce psilocybin when fruit bodies are cultivated in the laboratory .

 Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) is being released from a military prison for unknown reasons . Upon leaving , he runs into Charles Widmore ( Alan Dale ) who reveals that he prevented communication between his daughter Penelope ( Sonya Walger ) and Desmond while he was in prison , and strongly warns Desmond against attempting to reform a relationship . Desmond , wanting to prove that he is not a coward , travels to the United States from the United Kingdom to train for a sailing race around the world , sponsored by Charles Widmore . He meets Libby ( Cynthia Watros ) in a cafe , and after a deep conversation , Libby gives Desmond a yacht owned by her late husband . While Desmond is training , Penny tracks him down and angrily questions him . ( There is a moment in the background where Jack is seen arriving at the stadium to run . ) Desmond tells her that he is determined to win Widmore 's race and promises that he will return . However , while sailing , Desmond gets caught in a bad storm , and washes up on the island . He is rescued by a man in a yellow HAZMAT suit , Kelvin Inman ( Clancy Brown ) ( who also is the American intelligence officer that releases Sayid in one of his flashbacks ) who takes him to the Dharma Initiative Swan Station . The two live together for three years before Desmond finds out that Inman is secretly planning on escaping the island using Desmond 's boat . Desmond violently confronts Inman about this , accidentally killing him in the process . After almost letting the countdown timer run down , Desmond starts drinking liquor and contemplates suicide . Before he shoots himself however , he hears John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) banging on the hatch door , and turns on a light . Desmond then realizes that there is still hope and decides not to kill himself . 
 = = = On the island = = = 
 While at the funeral for Ana Lucia Cortez ( Michelle Rodriguez ) and Libby , a boat comes into view out at sea . Jack , Sayid , and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat . They hear music coming from inside it . Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance . After breaking the hatch open , they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat . The next day , after Mr. Eko ( Adewale Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje ) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer , Locke enlists Desmond 's help in letting the timer run down to zero . Desmond <unk> the blast doors shut , locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it . Eko , distraught , seeks Charlie Pace 's ( Dominic Monaghan ) help . The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open , but the blast doors are unscathed , while they are both injured . 
 Meanwhile , Desmond and Locke discuss the purpose of the stations and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out , the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island , thus causing the crash . Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning , but Desmond assures him that it is all real . As the timer passes zero , Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch , saying he will blow the dam . After he turns the key in the system termination switch , a shrill humming noise and violet @-@ white light envelops the entire island , causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike on opposite sides of the island to bend in apparent pain . That night , Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch ; the whereabouts of Desmond , Eko , and Locke are not revealed . Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton ( Emilie de Ravin ) , and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors . 
 The survivors split up into two groups to head to the Others ' camp . Michael Dawson ( Harold Perrineau ) , Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) , Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) , James " Sawyer " Ford ( Josh Holloway ) , and Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) walk on land to the camp , bringing guns and ammunition with them . Meanwhile , Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) , Sun @-@ Hwa Kwon ( Yunjin Kim ) , and Jin @-@ Soo Kwon ( Daniel Dae Kim ) plan to use Desmond 's sailboat to go by sea . Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal , saying that " this time , they will know that we are coming " , a reference to the attacks in the first season finale . When the boat reaches the Others ' camp , Sayid finds it to be deserted . Meanwhile , Michael , Jack , Sawyer , Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them , and Sawyer kills one . Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap , and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby . They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach , ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid . There , they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes , suggesting that the reports sent out from the monitoring hatch discovered in the episode " ? " had never been read . Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile , they hear whispers , and suddenly Sawyer , Kate , and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts . The hostages , bound and gagged , are brought to a dock , where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale ( Michael Emerson ) . Gale keeps his bargain with Michael , returning his son , Walt Lloyd ( Malcolm David Kelley ) , to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued . Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island 's location . Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn 't matter as they would not be able to find the island , should they return . He also gives Michael a counter @-@ threat : if he did tell people of the island 's location , people would know what he did to get his son back . Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are , to which Henry responds " We 're the good guys , Michael " . Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island .

 " Live Together , Die Alone " was the thirteenth episode of the series directed by Jack Bender . The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse , the ninth episode that the two had written together . 
 Due to being two hours long , more time went into shooting " Live Together , Die Alone " than most episodes . It was shot in 17 days by two separate crews . Several scenes had to be shortened or cut due to time constraints . One scene that was cut was : after it is revealed that Michael was a traitor , Sawyer wanted to go back to the camp , because he thought it would be stupid to keep following someone who lied to him . In the past , Lost has had an issue with spoilers being leaked from the set , so for the production of " Live Together , Die Alone " , the crew took extra steps to ensure secrecy of pivotal scenes . Alex Petrovitch , who played Henrik , recalled that when auditioning for his part " names , places , and circumstances ( of his scene ) were shifted so that you couldn ’ t link the scene to the show . " Even other cast members were not told about Petrovitch 's scene . Another measure used by the cast and crew to limit the release of spoilers was calling the final scene by the code name " Challah " instead of referencing anything in the scene . However , the attempts to cover up the flashback scenes were less successful and a call sheet was leaked by Lost fan Ryan Ozawa onto the internet , detailing the full plotlines of Desmond 's flashbacks , about a month before the episode aired . It is in this episode that it is revealed that Henry Gale is in fact the leader of the Others .

Entertainment Weekly writer Scott Brown described his viewing experience as " I was up , I was down , I was frustrated , I was thrilled , and finally I was ... well , a bit numb .

 = = Early life = = 
 Trevor Linden 's grandfather , Nick van der Linden , emigrated to Canada from the Netherlands in 1929 . He ran a construction company until his son Lane , Trevor 's father , replaced him in 1979 . Trevor was born in Medicine Hat , Alberta to Lane and Edna Linden . Linden was a skilled athlete ; despite hockey being his top priority , he also participated in baseball , golf , volleyball , basketball , and speed skating . An excellent student in school , he was offered a scholarship to Princeton University to play for their hockey team ; instead , Linden chose to stay in Medicine Hat and play with the local major junior team , the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL . Linden grew up watching the Tigers and idolized Lanny McDonald , who played in Medicine Hat before he joined the NHL . 
 After one season playing with the Medicine Hat Midget Tigers of the Alberta Midget Hockey League ( <unk> ) , Linden joined the WHL Tigers for the final five games of the 1985 – 86 regular season , where he scored two goals ; he also appeared in six playoff games , scoring one goal . The next season , at the age of 16 , he made the team full @-@ time . In his first full season in the WHL , Linden had 36 points in 72 games , and then had nine points in 20 playoff games , including two goals in the championship game , helping Medicine Hat win their first Memorial Cup as Canadian junior champions . The next year , Linden had 110 points in 67 games , and led the Tigers to their second consecutive Memorial Cup title . During the 1988 WHL playoffs , Linden set a WHL playoff record by scoring the fastest goal from the start of a game , scoring seven seconds into a 6 – 5 Tigers win over the Saskatoon Blades on April 15 , 1988 . At the 1988 NHL Entry Draft , the Vancouver Canucks selected Linden second overall , after the Minnesota North Stars selected Mike Modano .

 Linden made his NHL debut on October 6 , 1988 against the Winnipeg Jets , aged 18 . He scored his first goal on October 18 , 1988 , against Kelly Hrudey of the New York Islanders and later , on November 17 , he scored his first hat trick against the Minnesota North Stars . Linden finished the season tied for the team lead in goals ( 30 ) and second for points ( 59 ) . He was the first Canucks rookie to score 30 goals and came within one point of tying Ivan Hlinka 's team record of 60 points as a first @-@ year player , set in 1981 – 82 ( the record was later tied by Pavel Bure in 1991 – 92 ) . Linden also became the first rookie to win the Cyclone Taylor Award , given to the Canucks ' most valuable player . He was named to the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team , and finished second to Brian Leetch , of the New York Rangers , in voting for the Calder Trophy , given to the rookie of the year . Fans voted him as the winner of The Hockey News ' rookie of the year award . The Canucks made the playoffs in the 1988 – 89 season , for the first time in three years , and Linden scored seven points in the Canucks ' seven @-@ game series loss to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames . 
 In his sophomore NHL season , Linden finished second on the team in goals , with 21 , and points , 51 , and finished third in assists with 30 . The following year , he was one of three Canucks to share a rotating captaincy ( the others being Doug Lidster and Dan Quinn ) . Linden led the team with 37 assists and 70 points , and made his first appearance in an NHL All @-@ Star Game , where he was the youngest player . At the age of 21 , he was made sole captain of the team , becoming the youngest Canucks captain . That season , Linden led the Canucks in scoring for a second straight year with 75 points ( 31 goals and 44 assists ) , leading the Canucks to their first division title since the 1974 – 75 season . 
 A natural winger early in his career , Linden began learning to play at the center position during the Canucks training camp in October 1992 . Canucks head coach Pat Quinn initiated the switch in response to the losses of centers Anatoli Semenov and Petr Nedved during the off @-@ season . The Canucks repeated as Smythe Division champions that year , setting franchise records for wins and points with 46 and 101 , respectively . For the third straight season , Linden surpassed 30 goals and 70 points , finishing with totals of 33 goals and 72 points . 
 In the 1993 – 94 season , Linden scored 32 goals , the fifth time in six seasons he had scored at least 30 , but his points total fell to 61 as the Canucks finished 12 points behind the division leader . Although they were the seventh seed in the playoffs , the Canucks reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 12 years and second time in team history . Considered the underdogs against the first place New York Rangers captained by Mark Messier , the Canucks initially fell behind three games to one but pushed the series to seven games . In game seven , Linden scored twice ( the next player to get two goals in a game seven was Alex Tanguay in 2001 ) but the Canucks lost , 3 – 2 . Linden finished second on the team in playoff scoring , with 12 goals and 25 points . It was revealed afterwards that Linden had played through the finals with broken ribs and torn rib cartilage . 
 In the 1995 – 96 season , Linden had 33 goals , 47 assists and 80 points , the most he has ever collected in all three statistical categories . On February 27 , 1996 , he played in his <unk> consecutive game , breaking the team record previously held by Don Lever . The following season marked the end of Linden 's ironman streak ; between October 4 , 1990 and December 3 , 1996 , he appeared in 482 consecutive games , the longest in the league at the time . His team record was later broken in 2007 by Brendan Morrison . In his 49 games that season , he scored nine goals and 31 assists . At the conclusion of the season , the NHL recognized Linden 's contributions to the Vancouver community and awarded him the King Clancy Memorial Trophy . 
 At the start of the 1997 – 98 season , the Canucks added free agent Mark Messier , a six @-@ time Stanley Cup winner , and manager / coach Mike Keenan , who were , respectively , captain and coach , of the New York Rangers when they defeated Vancouver in the 1994 Stanley Cup finals . Keenan 's hiring was as a result of Pat Quinn being dismissed as general manager , and Keenan also assumed the title of bench boss by firing head coach Tom Renney early in the season . According to some accounts , Linden initially gave up the team captaincy to Messier out of respect , but later regretted the move as he felt that Messier 's invasion of the dressing room was hostile . Friction developed between Linden and Keenan early in the season . As the relationship worsened , Keenan claimed that it was evident that Linden would be traded . After a 5 – 1 loss to the St. Louis Blues , Keenan openly blamed Linden for the loss , a moment Linden refers to as his " darkest time " . Playing in 42 games with the Canucks before the February Olympic break , Linden had seven goals and 21 points . 
 = = = New York , Montreal and Washington ( 1998 – 2001 ) = = = 
 Linden was traded to the New York Islanders on February 6 , 1998 , for Todd Bertuzzi , Bryan McCabe , and the Islanders ' third round choice ( used to select Jarkko Ruutu ) in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft . After the conclusion of the Olympics , in which he participated , Linden joined the Islanders and played 25 games with the team . He scored 10 goals and seven assists for 17 points to finish the season , with a combined 17 goals and 21 assists for 38 points in 67 games . The following year , his first full season in three years , Linden was second on the team with 47 points , and third with 18 goals ; however , on May 29 , 1999 , the Islanders traded Linden to the Montreal Canadiens for a first round draft pick in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft ( Branislav <unk> ) , for mostly financial reasons . The thrill of playing in Montreal , the " centre of hockey , " was an exciting prospect to Linden after his time spent with the Islanders , where the arena was usually half @-@ filled when he played there . 
 With Montreal , Linden was often injured , and only appeared in 50 games during his first season with the Canadiens , scoring 30 points , while the next year he appeared in 57 games , scoring 33 points . While with the Canadiens , he signed a four @-@ year contract worth $ 15 million ; however , he was traded for the third time in his career , this time to the Washington Capitals , going with <unk> <unk> , and New Jersey 's 2nd round choice in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft ( later traded to Tampa Bay who picked Andreas <unk> ) in exchange for Richard <unk> , Jan Bulis , and Washington 's 1st round choice in the 2001 Draft ( Alexander <unk> ) . With Washington , Linden reached the playoffs for the first time in four years , in the 2000 – 01 season . 
 = = = Return to Vancouver ( 2001 – 2008 ) = = = 
 After 28 games , over two seasons , with the Capitals , Linden had scored only four goals and three assists . On November 10 , 2001 , the Capitals traded Linden with a second round draft pick in either 2002 or 2003 ( Denis Grot ) to the Canucks for their first round pick in 2002 ( Boyd Gordon ) and a third round pick in 2003 ( later traded to Edmonton who picked Zack <unk> ) . He scored 34 points with Vancouver in 64 games , which included his 1,000th regular season game on March 26 , 2002 , against the Los Angeles Kings . In his first playoff series with Vancouver in six years , he scored a goal and four assists in six games . 
 The 2002 – 03 season was Linden 's first full season with the Canucks since 1996 – 97 , though Linden sprained his knee in the season opener and had to miss two weeks . He returned in time to be honoured for his 1,000th career game , which he achieved the season before . As he did not want to distract the team from the playoff race , Linden asked for the ceremony to be delayed . On November 25 , 2002 , against the Minnesota Wild , Linden scored his 263rd goal with the Canucks , breaking former captain Stan Smyl 's team record for most goals . He finished the year with 19 goals and 22 assists for 41 points , his highest goal total in seven seasons , and his highest points total since 1998 – 99 . 
 The following season , Linden broke several more Canucks records . In a February 16 , 2004 , game against the Colorado Avalanche , he played in his <unk> game as a Canuck , passing Smyl . On March 8 , once again playing the Avalanche , Linden had two points , including his team @-@ record 674th point with the Canucks , a mark also previously held by Smyl . For the first time in five years , he played in all 82 games , recording 36 points . After a year @-@ long break from hockey during the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout , in which he actively participated in new Collective Bargaining Agreement ( CBA ) negotiations , Linden again appeared in all 82 games during the 2005 – 06 season , scoring seven goals and 16 points . Linden became the first player to play 1 @,@ 000 games with the Canucks on April 13 , 2006 , when they faced the San Jose Sharks . 
 In the 2006 – 07 season opener , on October 5 , 2006 , Linden scored the game winner against the Detroit Red Wings to become the first Canuck to score 300 goals with the team . After notching 25 points in 80 games , he helped the Canucks reach the second round of the playoffs . He scored two game @-@ winning goals in the first round , including the series winning goal against the Dallas Stars in game seven of their first @-@ round matchup , which was Linden 's sixth game @-@ seven goal of his playoff career . He finished the playoffs with a team @-@ leading seven points in 12 games . This made Linden the Canucks ' all @-@ time leader in playoff goals ( 34 ) , assists ( 61 ) and points ( 95 ) . 
 After taking the summer to decide if he would return for another season , Linden signed a one @-@ year contract with the Canucks in August 2007 . The season was not ideal for Linden , who was a healthy scratch 23 times . In the 59 games he played , he scored seven goals and five assists , by far the lowest totals in his career . Against the Calgary Flames on November 8 , 2007 , he earned his 412th assist with the Canucks , surpassing Smyl , once again . He finished his career with 415 assists as a Canuck , which stood as the all @-@ time mark until Henrik Sedin surpassed him on March 14 , 2010 . Linden played in the final game of his NHL career on April 5 , 2008 against the Calgary Flames . Despite Vancouver losing 7 @-@ 1 , Linden was named the game 's first star and skated a lap around GM Place to a standing ovation and received handshakes from the Calgary players . 
 On June 11 , 2008 , after 19 seasons in the NHL and 20 years to the day of being drafted into the NHL by the Canucks , Linden announced his retirement , leaving as the franchise leader in games played with the Canucks ( 1140 ) and assists ( 415 , since surpassed by Henrik Sedin ) , and second in goals to later captain Markus Näslund . Shortly after , Vancouver City Council stated that they would honour Linden by declaring the date of his jersey retirement to be Trevor Linden Day in Vancouver . 
 The Canucks retired Linden 's jersey number , 16 , from circulation in a pre @-@ game ceremony December 17 , 2008 , prior to playing the Edmonton Oilers . Linden became the second Canuck to have his jersey retired , joining former captain Stan Smyl , whose jersey number , 12 , was retired in 1991 . Earlier in the day , the Canucks changed the number of the entrance gate for players and VIPs from Gate 5 to Gate 16 in honour of Linden .

Consequently , Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004 – 05 lockout . This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss , the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors , in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season .

 = 1919 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1919 Atlantic hurricane season was among the least active hurricane seasons in the Atlantic on record , featuring only five tropical storms . Of those five tropical cyclones , two of them intensified into a hurricane , with one strengthening into a major hurricane ( category 3 or higher on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . ) Two tropical depressions developed in the month of June , both of which caused negligible damage . A tropical storm in July brought minor damage to Pensacola , Florida , but devastated a fleet of ships . Another two tropical depressions formed in August , the first of which brought rainfall to the Lesser Antilles . 
 The most intense tropical cyclone of the season was the Florida Keys hurricane . Many deaths occurred after ships capsized in Bahamas , the Florida Keys , and Cuba . Strong winds left about $ 2 million in damage in Key West . After crossing the Gulf of Mexico , severe impact was reported in Texas , especially the Corpus Christi area . Overall , the hurricane caused 828 fatalities and $ 22 million in damage , $ 20 million of which was inflicted in Texas alone . Three other tropical cyclones developed in September , including two tropical storms and one tropical depression , all of which left negligible impact on land . The final tropical system of the season also did not affect land and became extratropical on November 15 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 55 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength .

 = Top Hat = 
 Top Hat is a 1935 American screwball musical comedy film in which Fred Astaire plays an American dancer named Jerry Travers , who comes to London to star in a show produced by Horace Hardwick ( Edward Everett Horton ) . He meets and attempts to impress Dale Tremont ( Ginger Rogers ) to win her affection . The film also features Eric Blore as Hardwick 's valet Bates , Erik Rhodes as Alberto Beddini , a fashion designer and rival for Dale 's affections , and Helen Broderick as Hardwick 's long @-@ suffering wife Madge . 
 The film was written by Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor . It was directed by Mark Sandrich . The songs were written by Irving Berlin . " Top Hat , White Tie and Tails " and " Cheek to Cheek " have become American song classics . It has been nostalgically referred to — particularly its " Cheek to Cheek " segment — in many films , including The Purple Rose of Cairo ( 1985 ) and The Green Mile ( 1999 ) . 
 Top Hat was the most successful picture of Astaire and Rogers ' partnership ( and Astaire 's second most successful picture after Easter Parade ) , achieving second place in worldwide box @-@ office receipts for 1935 . While some dance critics maintain that Swing Time contained a finer set of dances , Top Hat remains , to this day , the partnership 's best @-@ known work . 
 = = Plot = = 
 An American dancer , Jerry Travers ( Fred Astaire ) comes to London to star in a show produced by the bumbling Horace Hardwick ( Edward Everett Horton ) . While practicing a tap dance routine in his hotel bedroom , he awakens Dale Tremont ( Ginger Rogers ) on the floor below . She storms upstairs to complain , whereupon Jerry falls hopelessly in love with her and proceeds to pursue her all over London . 
 Dale mistakes Jerry for Horace , who is married to her friend Madge ( Helen Broderick ) . Following the success of Jerry 's opening night in London , Jerry follows Dale to Venice , where she is visiting Madge and modelling / promoting the gowns created by Alberto Beddini ( Erik Rhodes ) , a dandified Italian fashion designer with a penchant for malapropisms . 
 Jerry proposes to Dale , who , while still believing that Jerry is Horace , is disgusted that her friend 's husband could behave in such a manner and agrees instead to marry Alberto . Fortunately , Bates ( Eric Blore ) , Horace 's meddling English valet , disguises himself as a priest and conducts the ceremony ; Horace had sent Bates to keep tabs on Dale . 
 On a trip in a gondola , Jerry manages to convince Dale and they return to the hotel where the previous confusion is rapidly cleared up . The reconciled couple dance off into the Venetian sunset , to the tune of " The Piccolino " .

 Top Hat began filming on April 1 , 1935 and cost $ 620 @,@ 000 to make . Shooting ended in June and the first public previews were held in July . These led to cuts of approximately ten minutes , mainly in the last portion of the film : the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed to show off the huge set were heavily cut . A further four minutes were cut before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall , where it broke all records , went on to gross $ 3 million on its initial release , and became RKO 's most profitable film of the 1930s . After Mutiny on the Bounty , it made more money than any other film released in 1935 . 
 = = = Script development = = = 
 Dwight Taylor was the principal screenwriter in this , the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers . Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts , complaining that " it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee " , and " I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour " . Allan Scott , whose first major project this was , and who would go on to serve on six of the Astaire @-@ Rogers pictures , was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor , Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout . The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes , including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film : Beddini 's motto : " For the women the kiss , for the men the sword " which originally ran : " For the men the sword , for the women the whip . " Of his role in the creation of Top Hat , Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared " a kind of childlike excitement . The whole style of the picture can be summed up in the word inconsequentiality . When I left RKO a year later , Mark said to me , ' You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen . ' " On the film 's release , the script was panned by many critics , who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee . 
 = = = Musical score and orchestration = = = 
 This was composer Irving Berlin 's first complete film score since 1930 and he negotiated a unique contract , retaining the copyrights to the score with a guarantee of ten per @-@ cent of the profits if the film earned in excess of $ 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 . Eight songs from the original score were discarded as they were not considered to advance the film 's plot . One of these : " Get Thee Behind Me , Satan " was recycled into Follow the Fleet ( 1936 ) . All five songs eventually selected became major hits and , in the September 28 , 1935 broadcast of Your Hit Parade , all five featured in the top fifteen songs selected for that week . 
 Astaire recalled how this success helped restore Berlin 's flagging self @-@ confidence . Astaire had never met Berlin before this film , although he had danced on stage to some of his tunes as early as 1915 . There ensued a lifelong friendship with Berlin contributing to more Astaire films ( six in total ) than any other composer . Of his experience with Astaire in Top Hat Berlin wrote : " He 's a real inspiration for a writer . I 'd never have written Top Hat without him . He makes you feel so secure . " 
 As Berlin could not read or write music , and could only pick out tunes on a specially designed piano that transposed keys automatically , he required an assistant to make up his piano parts . Hal Borne – Astaire 's rehearsal pianist – performed this role in Top Hat and recalled working nights with him in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel : " Berlin went ' Heaven ... ' and I went dah dah dee ' I 'm in Heaven ' ( dah @-@ dah @-@ dee ) . He said , ' I love it , put it down . ' " These parts were subsequently orchestrated by a team comprising Edward Powell , Maurice de <unk> , Gene Rose , Eddie Sharp , and Arthur Knowlton who worked under the overall supervision of Max Steiner . 
 Berlin broke a number of the conventions of American songwriting in this film , especially in the songs " Top Hat , White Tie and Tails " and " Cheek to Cheek " , and , according to Rogers , the film became the talk of Hollywood as a result of its score . 
 = = = Set design = = = 
 In an Astaire @-@ Rogers picture , the Big White Set — as these Art Deco @-@ inspired creations were known — took up the largest share of the film 's production costs , and Top Hat was no exception . A winding canal — spanned by two staircase bridges at one end and a flat bridge on the other — was built across two adjoining sound stages . Astaire and Rogers dance across this flat bridge in " Cheek to Cheek " . Around the bend from this bridge was located the main piazza , a giant stage coated in red bakelite and this was the location for " The Piccolino " . This fantasy representation of the Lido of Venice was on three levels comprising dance floors , restaurants and terraces , all decorated in candy @-@ cane colours , with the canal waters dyed black . The vast Venetian interiors were similarly inauthentic , reflecting instead the latest Hollywood tastes . 
 Carroll Clark , who worked under the general supervision of Van Nest Polglase , was the unit art director on all but one of the Astaire @-@ Rogers films and he managed the team of designers responsible for the scenery and furnishings of Top Hat . 
 = = = Wardrobe : The " feathers " incident = = = 
 Although Bernard Newman was nominally in charge of dressing the stars , Rogers was keenly interested in dress design and make @-@ up . For the " Cheek to Cheek " routine , she was determined to use her own creation : " I was determined to wear this dress , come hell or high water . And why not ? It moved beautifully . Obviously , no one in the cast or crew was willing to take sides , particularly not my side . This was all right with me . I 'd had to stand alone before . At least my mother was there to support me in the confrontation with the entire front office , plus Fred Astaire and Mark Sandrich . " 
 Due to the enormous labor involved in sewing each ostrich feather to the dress , Astaire — who normally approved his partner 's gowns and suggested modifications if necessary during rehearsals — saw the dress for the first time on the day of the shoot , and was horrified at the way it shed clouds of feathers at every twist and turn , recalling later : " It was like a chicken attacked by a coyote , I never saw so many feathers in my life . " According to choreographer Hermes Pan , Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers , who promptly burst into tears , whereupon her mother , Lela , " came charging at him like a mother rhinoceros protecting her young . " An additional night 's work by seamstresses resolved much of the problem , however , careful examination of the dance on film reveals feathers floating around Astaire and Rogers and lying on the dance floor . Later , Astaire and Pan presented Rogers with a gold feather for her charm bracelet , and serenaded her with a ditty parodying Berlin 's tune : 
 Feathers — I hate feathers 
 And I hate them so that I can hardly speak 
 And I never find the happiness I seek 
 With those chicken feathers dancing 
 Cheek to Cheek 
 Thereafter , Astaire nicknamed Rogers " Feathers " — also a title of one of the chapters in his autobiography — and parodied his experience in a song and dance routine with Judy Garland in Easter Parade ( 1948 ) . 
 Astaire also chose and provided his own clothes . He is widely credited with influencing 20th Century male fashion and , according to Forbes male fashion editor , G. Bruce Boyer , the " Isn 't It a Lovely Day ? " routine : " shows Astaire dressed in the style he would make famous : soft @-@ shouldered tweed sports jacket , button @-@ down shirt , bold striped tie , easy @-@ cut gray flannels , silk paisley pocket square , and suede shoes . It 's an extraordinarily contemporary approach to nonchalant elegance , a look Ralph Lauren and a dozen other designers still rely on more than six decades later . Astaire introduced a new style of dress that broke step with the spats , celluloid collars , and <unk> worn by aristocratic European @-@ molded father @-@ figure heroes . " 
 = = Musical numbers and choreography = = 
 The choreography , in which Astaire was assisted by Hermes Pan , is principally concerned throughout with the possibilities of using taps to make as much noise as possible . In the film , Astaire suffers from what Rogers terms an " affliction " : " Every once in a while I suddenly find myself dancing . " Astaire introduces the film 's tap motif when he blasts a tap barrage at the somnolent members of a London Club . There are eight musical numbers . 
 In the " Opening Sequence " , after the RKO logo appears , Astaire , shown only from the waist down , dances onto a polished stage floor , backed by a male chorus sporting canes . On pausing his name appears . Rogers then follows suit and the two dance together as the picture dissolves to reveal a top hat . A similar concept was used in the opening sequence of The Barkleys of Broadway ( 1949 ) . 
 The second is " No Strings ( I 'm Fancy Free ) " . On retiring to his hotel suite , Horton advises him to get married . Astaire declares his preference for bachelorhood and the song – this number was the brainchild of scriptwriter Dwight Taylor and is found in his earliest drafts – emerges naturally and in mid @-@ sentence . Astaire sings it through twice and during the last phrase leaps into a ballet jump , accompanied by leg beats , and launches into a short solo dance that builds in intensity and volume progressing from tap shuffles sur place , via traveling patterns , to rapid @-@ fire heel jabs finishing with a carefree tour of the suite during which he beats on the furniture with his hands . On his return to the center of the room , where he noisily concentrates his tap barrage , the camera cranes down to discover Rogers in bed , awake and irritated . As she makes her way upstairs , Horton fields telephone complaints from hotel management . Astaire incorporates this into his routine , first startling him with a tap burst then escorting him ostentatiously to the telephone . As Horton leaves to investigate , Astaire continues to hammer his way around the suite , during which he feigns horror at seeing his image in a mirror – a reference to his belief that the camera was never kind to his face . The routine ends as Astaire , now dancing with a statue , is interrupted by Rogers ' entrance , a scene which , as in The Gay Divorcee and Roberta , typifies the way in which Astaire inadvertently incurs the hostility of Rogers , only to find her attractive and wear down her resistance . 
 In " No Strings ( reprise ) " , Rogers , after storming upstairs to complain , returns to her room at which point Astaire , still intent on dancing , nominates himself her " sandman " , sprinkling sand from a <unk> and lulling her , Horton and eventually himself to sleep with a soft and gentle sand dance , to a diminuendo reprise of the melody , in a scene which has drawn considerable admiration from dance commentators , and has been the subject of affectionate screen parodies . 
 In " Isn 't This a Lovely Day ( to be Caught in the Rain ) " , while Rogers is out riding , a thunderstorm breaks and she takes shelter in a bandstand . Astaire follows her and a conversation about clouds and rainfall soon gives way to Astaire 's rendering of this , one of Berlin 's most prized creations . Astaire sings to Rogers ' back , but the audience can see that Rogers ' attitude towards him softens during the song , and the purpose of the ensuing dance is for her to communicate this change to her partner . The dance is one of flirtation and , according to Mueller , deploys two choreographic devices common to the classical minuet : sequential imitation ( one dancer performs a step and the other responds ) and touching . Initially , the imitation is mocking in character , then becomes more of a casual exchange , and ends in a spirit of true cooperation . Until the last thirty seconds of this two and a half minute dance the pair appear to pull back from touching , then with a crook of her elbow Rogers invites Astaire in . The routine , at once comic and romantic , incorporates hopping steps , tap spins with barrages , loping and dragging steps among its many innovative devices . The spirit of equality which pervades the dance is reflected in the masculinity of Rogers ' clothes and in the friendly handshake they exchange at the end . 
 For " Top Hat , White Tie and Tails " , probably Astaire 's most celebrated tap solo , the idea for the title song came from Astaire who described to Berlin a routine he had created for the 1930 Ziegfeld Broadway flop Smiles called " Say , Young Man of <unk> , " in which he gunned down a chorus of men – which included teenagers Bob Hope and Larry Adler – with his cane . Berlin duly produced the song from his trunk and the concept of the film was then built around it . In this number Astaire had to compromise on his one @-@ take philosophy , as Sandrich acknowledged : " We went to huge lengths to make the ' Top Hat ' number look like one take , but actually it 's several . " Astaire 's remarkable ability to change the tempo within a single dance phrase is extensively featured throughout this routine and taken to extremes – as when he explodes into activity from a pose of complete quiet and vice versa . This routine also marks Astaire 's first use of a cane as a prop in one of his filmed dances . The number opens with a chorus strutting and lunging in front of a backdrop of a Parisian street scene . They make way for Astaire who strides confidently to the front of the stage and delivers the song , which features the famous line : " I 'm stepping out , my dear , to breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class , " trading the occasional tap barrage with the chorus as he <unk> dance begins with Astaire and chorus moving in step . Astaire soon lashes out with a swirling tap step and the chorus responds timidly before leaving the stage in a sequence of overlapping , direction @-@ shifting , hitch steps and walks . In the first part of the solo which follows , Astaire embarks on a circular tap movement , embellished with cane taps into which he mixes a series of unpredictable pauses . As the camera retreats the lights dim and , in the misterioso passage which follows , Astaire mimes a series of stances , ranging from overt friendliness , wariness , surprise to watchful readiness and jaunty confidence . Jimmy Cagney attended the shooting of this scene and advised Astaire , who claims to have ad @-@ libbed much of this section . The chorus then returns in a threatening posture , and Astaire proceeds to dispatch them all , using an inventive series of actions miming the cane 's use as a gun , a submachine gun , a rifle and , finally , a bow and arrow . 
 Astaire 's first seduction of Rogers in " Isn 't This a Lovely Day , " falls foul of the mistaken @-@ identity theme of the plot , so he makes a second attempt , encouraged by Broderick , in the number " Cheek to Cheek " . As in " No Strings , " the song emerges from Astaire 's mid @-@ sentence as he dances with the hesitant Rogers on a crowded floor . Berlin wrote the words and music to this enduring classic in one day , and , at 72 measures , it is the longest song he ever wrote . He was very appreciative of Astaire 's treatment of the song : " The melody keeps going up and up . He crept up there . It didn 't make a damned bit of difference . He made it . " As he navigates through this difficult material , Rogers looks attracted and receptive and , at the end of the song , they dance cheek to cheek across a bridge to a deserted ballroom area nearby . According to Mueller 's analysis , the duet that follows – easily the most famous of all the Astaire @-@ Rogers partnered dances – reflects the complexity of the emotional situation in which the pair find themselves . No longer flirting , as in " Isn 't This a Lovely Day ? , " the pair are now in love . But Rogers feels guilty and deceived and would prefer to avoid Astaire 's advances – in effect , fall out of love with him . Therefore , Astaire 's purpose here is to make her put aside her misgivings ( which are a mystery to him ) and surrender completely to him . The choreographic device introduced to reflect the progress of this seduction is the supported backbend , exploiting Rogers ' exceptionally flexible back . The main dance begins with the first of two brief passages which reuse the device of sequential imitation introduced in " Isn 't This a Lovely Day ? " . The pair spin and lean , dodging back and forth past each other before moving into a standard ballroom position where the first hints of the supported backbend are introduced . The first backbend occurs at the end of a sequence where Astaire sends Rogers into a spin , collects her upstage and maneuvers her into a linked @-@ arm stroll forward , repeats the spin but this time encircles her while she turns and then takes her in his arms . As the music becomes more energetic , the dancers flow across the floor and Rogers , moving against the music , suddenly falls into a deeper backbend , which is then repeated , only deeper still . The music now transitions to a quiet recapitulation of the main melody during which the pair engage in a muted and tender partnering , and here the second passage involving sequential imitation appears . With the music reaching its grand climax Astaire and Rogers rush toward the camera , then away in a series of bold , dramatic manoeuvers culminating in three ballroom lifts which showcase Rogers ' dress before abruptly coming to a halt in a final , deepest backbend , maintained as the music approaches its closing bars . They rise , and after a couple of turns dancing cheek to cheek for the first time since the dance began , come to rest next to a wall . Rogers , having conducted the dance in a state of dreamlike abandon now glances uneasily at Astaire before walking away , as if reminded that their relationship cannot proceed . 
 By now , Rogers has learned Astaire 's true identity although neither of them yet know that her impulsive marriage to Rhodes is null and void . Dining together during carnival night in Venice , and to help assuage her guilt , Astaire declares : " Let 's eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we have to face him , " which serves as the cue for the music of " The Piccolino " , the film 's big production number . A gondola parade is followed by the entry of a dancing chorus who perform a series of ballroom poses and rippling @-@ pattern routines <unk> by Hermes Pan . Berlin , who lavished a great deal of effort on the song designed it as a pastiche of " The Carioca " from Flying Down to Rio ( 1933 ) and " The Continental " from The Gay Divorcee ( 1934 ) , and the lyric communicates its fake origin : " It was written by a Latin / A gondolier who sat in / his home out in Brooklyn / and gazed at the stars . " It is a song about a song and Rogers sings it to Astaire after which an off @-@ camera chorus repeats it while the dance ensemble is photographed , Busby Berkeley @-@ style , from above . The camera then switches to Rogers and Astaire who bound down to the stage to perform a two @-@ minute dance , all shot in one take , with the Astaire @-@ Pan choreography separately referencing the basic melody and the Latin vamp in the accompaniment . They dance to the accompaniment as they descend the steps and glide along the dance floor , then , when the melody enters , they halt and perform the Piccolino step , which involves the feet darting out to the side of the body . The rest of the dance involves repetitions and variations of the Piccolino step and the hopping steps associated with the vamp , leading to some complex amalgamations of the two . On the vamp melody 's final appearance , the dancers perform a highly embellished form of the Piccolino step as they travel sideways back to their table , sinking back into their chairs and lifting their glasses in a toast . 
 " The Piccolino ( reprise ) " : After the various parties confront each other in the bridal suite , with Rogers ' " marriage " to Rhodes revealed as performed by a fake clergyman , the scene is set for Astaire and Rogers to dance into the sunset , which they duly do , in this fragment of a much longer duet – the original was cut after the July 1935 previews – but not before they parade across the Venetian set and reprise the Piccolino step .

 Reviews for Top Hat were mainly positive . The Los Angeles Evening Herald Express praised the film , exclaiming " Top Hat is the tops ! With Fred Astaire dancing and singing Irving Berlin tunes !

" The New York Times praised the film 's musical numbers , but criticized the story line , describing it as " a little on the thin side , " but also stating that " it is sprightly enough to plug those inevitable gaps between the <unk> gay dances . " Top Hat " is worth standing in line for . From the appearance of the lobby yesterday afternoon , you probably will have to . " 
 Variety also singled out the story line as well as the cast , stating " the danger sign is in the story and cast . Substitute Alice Brady for Helen Broderick and it 's the same lineup of players as was in The Gay <unk> . Besides which the situations in the two scripts parallel each other closely " .

 Caroline Island or Caroline Atoll ( also known as Millennium Island and <unk> Island ) , is the easternmost of the uninhabited coral atolls which comprise the southern Line Islands in the central Pacific Ocean . 
 First sighted by Europeans in 1606 , claimed by the United Kingdom in 1868 , and part of the Republic of Kiribati since the island nation 's independence in 1979 , Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and is considered one of the world 's most pristine tropical islands , despite guano mining , copra harvesting , and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries . It is home to one of the world 's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds , most notably the sooty tern . 
 The atoll is currently designated as a wildlife sanctuary . In 2014 the Kiribati government established a 12 @-@ nautical @-@ mile fishing exclusion zone around each of the southern Line Islands ( Caroline ( commonly called Millennium ) , Flint , Vostok , Malden , and Starbuck ) . 
 The atoll is best known for its role in the millennium celebrations . A 1995 realignment of the International Date Line made Caroline Island one of the first points of land on Earth to reach January 1 , 2000 on the calendar . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Caroline Atoll lies near the southeastern end of the Line Islands , a string of atolls extending across the equator some 1 @,@ 500 km ( 930 mi ) south of the Hawaiian Islands in the central Pacific . The slightly crescent @-@ shaped atoll ( 3 @.@ 76 km2 or 1 @.@ 45 mi2 in land area ) consists of 39 separate islets surrounding a narrow lagoon , 8 @.@ 7 by 1 @.@ 2 km2 in size , or with an area of 6 @.@ 3 km2 . The total atoll area , including dry land , lagoon and reef flat , measures 13 by 2 @.@ 5 km , or 24 km2 . The islets rise to a height of only 6 meters ( 20 feet ) above sea level . The islets , like those of all atolls , share a common geologic origin and consist of sand deposits and limestone rock set atop a coral reef . According to the path of the International Date Line , Caroline Island is the easternmost point on land on Earth . 
 Three large islets make up the bulk of Caroline 's land area : Nake Islet ( 1 @.@ 04 km2 or 0 @.@ 40 mi2 ) at the north ; Long Islet ( 0 @.@ 76 km2 or 0 @.@ 29 mi2 ) at the northeast of the lagoon and South Islet ( 1 @.@ 07 km2 or 0 @.@ 41 mi2 ) . The remaining assembly of small islets , most of which were named during the 1988 ecological survey , conducted by Angela and Cameron Kepler , fall into four major groupings : the South Nake Islets , the Central Leeward Islets , the Southern Leeward Islets , and the Windward Islets ( see map at the Wayback Machine ( archived December 23 , 2010 ) ) . Caroline 's islets are particularly ephemeral — over the course of a century of observation , several of the smallest islets have been documented to appear or disappear entirely following major storms , while the shapes of larger ones have significantly changed . 
 The central lagoon , roughly 6 by 0 @.@ 5 km ( 3 @.@ 73 by 0 @.@ 31 mi ) , is shallow – at most 5 – 7 m ( 16 – 23 ft ) in depth – and is crossed repeatedly by narrow coral heads and patch reefs . Reef flats generally extend about 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) from shore — although some sources report them to extend more than a kilometer from land — and make boat landings perilous except at high tide . There are no natural landings , anchorages , or deep water openings into the central lagoon ; water which spills into the lagoon over shallow channels at high tide is contained within the surrounding reef and remains stable despite ocean tides . Most landings are generally made at a small break in the reef at the northwest corner of the South Islet ( visible on the satellite photo above ) . 
 Densities of giant clams reach up to four per square foot in parts of the lagoon . The most common species is the “ small giant clam ” Tridacna maxima and largest clam species , Tridacna gigas is also found in the lagoon . 
 There is no standing fresh water on Caroline Island , although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers ( or <unk> @-@ Herzberg lenses ) , and wells have been built to tap drinking water for temporary settlements . Soils on Caroline are similarly poor , dominated by coral gravel and sand , with significant organic content present only within stable , forested island centers . Guano deposits make island soil , where it does exist , nitrogen @-@ rich ; but even in the oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll , soils are only a few centimeters ( one or two inches ) thick . 
 Like the rest of Kiribati , Caroline Island enjoys a tropical maritime climate which is consistently hot and humid . Meteorological records are sparse , but temperatures generally range between 28 and 32 degrees Celsius ( 82 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit ) year round . Caroline lies within a region of highly variable precipitation , but is estimated to receive an average of 1 @,@ 500 mm ( 59 in ) of rain annually . Tides are on the order of 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) and trade winds , generally from the northeast , mean that corner of the island experiences the roughest seas . 
 Caroline Island is among the most remote islands on earth – 230 km ( 140 mi ) from the closest land at Flint Island , 1 @,@ 500 km ( 930 mi ) from the nearest permanent settlement on Kiritimati , 4 @,@ 200 km ( 2 @,@ 600 mi ) from the Kiribati capital of Tarawa , and 5 @,@ 100 km ( 3 @,@ 200 mi ) from the nearest continental land in North America . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 Despite more than three centuries of occasional human impact on Caroline , it is considered to be one of very few remaining " near @-@ pristine tropical islands . " and has been rated as one of the most unspoiled Pacific atolls . Its relatively undisturbed state has led to Caroline being considered for designation as a World Heritage Site and as a Biosphere Reserve . Ecological surveys documenting the island 's flora and fauna have been made intermittently through the later 20th century : Caroline was visited in 1965 by the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program , in 1974 by the Line Island Expedition , and in 1988 and 1991 by the United Nations Environment Programme Wildlife Conservation Unit . 
 Caroline Island is heavily vegetated , and most islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation : an outermost herb mat , typically composed mainly of Heliotropium <unk> ; an inward zone of shrub , primarily Heliotropium foertherianum ; and a central forested region , typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees . Coconut palms have also been introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets . This pattern of vegetation is consistent across the larger islets , with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs . Other common plants include <unk> maritima and Morinda citrifolia . 
 Caroline Island is an important breeding site for a number of species of seabirds , most notably the sooty tern ( Onychoprion <unk> ) , numbering around 500 @,@ 000 – a colony of sooty terns dominates the eastern islets – and the great frigatebird ( Fregata minor ) , numbering over 10 @,@ 000 . Caroline Island and its neighbor , Flint Island , also host some of the world 's largest populations of the coconut crab . ( Birgus latro ) . Other native animals include the Tridacna clam , which is abundant in the central lagoon , hermit crabs , and multiple species of lizards . 
 The endangered green turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) nests on the beaches of Caroline Island , but there have been reports of poaching by recent homesteaders . The bristle @-@ thighed curlew ( Numenius <unk> ) , a migrant visitor from Alaska , is also classified as vulnerable . 
 Around twenty non @-@ native species of flora have been introduced to Caroline Island via human contact . Among these are the vine Ipomoea violacea , which has begun to proliferate . Domestic cats and dogs introduced alongside a small homestead have driven the seabird population away from the islet of <unk> Ata @-@ Ata . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Prehistory = = = 
 Caroline Island is believed to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then become home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface . Although these geological processes are poorly understood , the orientation of the Line Islands ( roughly north @-@ south ) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago , before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel . The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago . 
 There is evidence of settlement by Polynesian peoples on the largest islets from before European contact . Graves and template platforms were uncovered by early expeditions to the island , and a large marae exists on the west side of Nake Islet . To date , these artifacts have not been surveyed by archaeologists . 
 = = = 17th to 19th century = = = 
 The first recorded sighting of Caroline Island by Europeans was on February 21 , 1606 , by Pedro Fernández de <unk> , a Portuguese explorer sailing on behalf of Spain ; his account names the island " San Bernardo . " The atoll was " rediscovered " on December 16 , 1795 by Captain William Robert Broughton of HMS Providence , who gave the atoll the name Carolina ( which later became Caroline ) " in compliment to the daughter of Sir P. Stephens of the Admiralty . " Caroline was again sighted in 1821 by the English whaling ship Supply and was then named " Thornton Island " for the ship 's captain . Other early names for the atoll include Hirst Island , Clark Island , and Independence Island . Among other early visits which left behind accounts of the island are that of the USS Dolphin in 1825 ( recorded by Lieutenant Hiram Paulding ) , and of a whaling ship in 1835 ( recorded by Frederick <unk> Bennett in his Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round the Globe From the Year 1833 – 1836 ) . 
 In 1846 , the Tahitian firm of Collie and <unk> attempted to establish a small stock @-@ raising and copra ( coconut meat ) community on the island , an operation which met with limited financial success . In 1868 , Caroline was claimed by the British vessel HMS Reindeer , which noted 27 residents in a settlement on South Islet . This settlement lasted until 1904 , when the six remaining Polynesians were relocated to Niue . 
 In 1872 , the island was leased by the British government to <unk> Brothers , who conducted minimal guano mining on the island . In 1881 , the lease was later taken over by the mining operation 's manager , John T. Arundel ( for whom one of the islets is named ) . Guano mining , which began in 1874 , supplied a total of about 10 @,@ 000 tons of phosphate until supplies were exhausted around 1895 . 
 In 1883 , an expedition of American astronomers traveled from Peru to Caroline Island aboard the USS Hartford to observe a total solar eclipse on May 6 . A French expedition also observed the eclipse from Caroline , and the United States Navy mapped the atoll . Johann Palisa , a member of the expedition , discovered an asteroid later that year which he named Carolina " in remembrance of his visit to [ the ] island . " 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Leased to S.R. Maxwell and Company , a new settlement was established in 1916 , this time built entirely upon copra export . Much of the South islet was deforested to make way for coconut palms , a non @-@ indigenous plant . The business venture , however , went into debt , and the island 's settlement slowly decreased in population . By 1926 , it was down to only ten residents and by 1936 , the settlement consisted of only two Tahitian families before abandonment sometime in the late 1930s . 
 Caroline Island remained uninhabited and undisturbed through World War II and afterwards . It remained under British jurisdiction , repossessed by the British Western Pacific High Commission in 1943 and governed as part of the Central and Southern Line Islands . In January 1972 , the Central and Southern Line Islands , including Caroline , were joined with the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands , which had become autonomous in 1971 as part of British decolonization efforts . 
 In 1979 , the Gilbert Islands became the independent nation of Kiribati ; Caroline Island is Kiribati 's easternmost point . The entire island is owned by the government of the Republic of Kiribati , overseen by the Ministry of Line and Phoenix Groups , which is headquartered on Kiritimati . Competing claims to sovereignty over the island by the United States ( under the Guano Islands Act ) were relinquished in the 1979 Treaty of Tarawa , ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1983 . 
 The island was briefly inhabited again from 1987 to 1991 by Ron Falconer , his wife Anne , and their two children , who developed a largely self @-@ sufficient settlement on the atoll . Following a transfer of ownership , Falconer was evicted from the island by the Kiribati government . A book , Together Alone ( ISBN 1 @-@ 86325 @-@ 428 @-@ 5 ) , written by Falconer , documents the story of their residence on Caroline Island . 
 In the 1990s , the island was leased to <unk> Felix , a French Polynesian entrepreneur ; he established a small homestead on one of the islets and reportedly had plans for development of the atoll . The island is also occasionally visited by Polynesian copra gatherers under agreements with the Kiribati government in Tarawa . 
 = = = Time zone realignment = = = 
 On December 23 , 1994 , the Republic of Kiribati announced a change of time zone for the Line Islands , to take effect January 1 , 1995 . This adjustment effectively moved the International Date Line over 1 @,@ 000 kilometers ( 620 mi ) to the east within Kiribati , placing all of Kiribati on the Asian or western side of the date line , despite the fact that Caroline 's longitude of 150 degrees west corresponds to UTC − 10 rather than its official time zone of UTC + 14 . Caroline Island now is at the same time as the Hawaiian Islands ( Hawaii @-@ Aleutian Standard Time Zone ) , but one day ahead . This move made Caroline Island both the easternmost land in the earliest time zone ( by some definitions , the easternmost point on Earth ) , and one of the first points of land which would see sunrise on January 1 , 2000 — at 5 : 43 a.m. , as measured by local time . 
 The stated reason for the move was a campaign promise of Kiribati President <unk> Tito to eliminate the confusion of Kiribati straddling the Date Line and therefore being constantly in two different days . However , Kiribati officials were not reluctant to attempt to capitalize on the nation 's new status as owners of the first land to see sunrise in 2000 . Other Pacific nations , including Tonga and New Zealand 's Chatham Islands , protested the move , objecting that it infringed on their claims to be the first land to see dawn in the year 2000 . 
 In 1999 , in order to further capitalize upon the massive public interest in celebrations marking the arrival of the year 2000 , Caroline Island was officially renamed Millennium Island . Although uninhabited , a special celebration was held on the island , featuring performances by Kiribati native entertainers and attended by Kiribati president Tito . Over 70 Kiribati singers and dancers traveled to Caroline from the capital Tarawa , accompanied by approximately 25 journalists . The celebration , broadcast by satellite worldwide , had an estimated audience of up to one billion viewers . 
 Despite many media and government claims to the contrary , Caroline Island was not the first point of land to see sunrise on January 1 , 2000 ( local time ) ; that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica , at 66 ° 03 ′ S 135 ° 53 ′ E , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier . As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle , and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December , the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects . 
 = = = 21st century and future = = = 
 As Caroline Island only extends six meters above sea level , it would be in danger if sea levels rise . The Kiribati government estimates that the island may be reclaimed by the sea as soon as 2025 , and the United Nations has rated Caroline Island as among those most in danger from sea level rise .

 = 2002 Pacific typhoon season = 
 The 2002 Pacific typhoon season was an active season , with many tropical cyclones affecting Japan and China . Every month had tropical activity , with most storms forming from July through October . Overall , there were 37 tropical depressions declared officially or unofficially , of which 26 became named storms ; of those , there were 15 typhoons , which is the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , while 8 of the 15 typhoon intensified into super typhoons unofficially by the JTWC . 
 The season began early with the first storm , Tapah , developing on January 10 , east of the Philippines . Two months later , Typhoon Mitag became the first super typhoon ever to be recorded in March . In June , Typhoon Chataan dropped heavy rainfall in the Federated States of Micronesia , killing 48 people and becoming the deadliest natural disaster in the state of Chuuk . Chataan later left heavy damage in Guam before striking Japan . In August , Typhoon Rusa became the deadliest typhoon in South Korea in 43 years , causing 238 deaths and $ 4 @.@ 2 billion in damage . Typhoon Higos in October was the third strongest typhoon to strike Tokyo since World War II . The final typhoon of the season was Typhoon Pongsona , which was one of the costliest storms on record in Guam ; it did damage worth $ 700 million on the island before dissipating on December 11 . 
 The western Pacific basin covers the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2002 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms formed in the entire Northwest Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) . Tropical depressions in this basin have the " W " suffix added to their number when classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) , which can result in the same storm having two names ; in these cases both storm names are given below , with the PAGASA name in parentheses . 
 = = Seasonal summary and predictions = = 
 On March 6 , meteorologists from University College London at <unk> issued a forecast for the season for above average activity , since sea surface temperatures were expected to be slightly warmer than usual ; the group used data by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , and compared the potential 28 @.@ 6 storms to the 30 @-@ year average of 26 @.@ 3 . The group raised the number of predicted storms in April to 29 @.@ 6 , and again in early May to 30 @.@ 5 . They ultimately overestimated the number of storms that would form . The Laboratory for Atmospheric Research at the City University of Hong Kong also issued a season forecast in April 2002 , predicting 27 storms with a margin of error of 3 , of which 11 would become typhoons , with a margin of error of 2 . The agency noted a stronger than normal subtropical ridge over the open Pacific Ocean , as well as ongoing El Niño conditions that favored development , but expected below @-@ normal development in the South China Sea . These predictions proved to be largely accurate . 
 During the year , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula , and north of the equator , in its role as the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center , as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989 . The JMA issued forecasts and analyses every six hours starting at midnight UTC using numerical weather prediction ( NWP ) and a climatological tropical cyclone forecast model . They used the Dvorak technique and NWP to estimate 10 @-@ minute sustained winds and barometric pressure . The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin , operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and supplying forecasts to the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans . The agency moved their backup facility from Yokosuka , Kanagawa in Japan to Monterey , California in 2002 . Several meteorologists left the agency near the beginning of the year , although the new forecasters compensated for their inexperience by relying on the consensus of various forecast models . In 2002 , the JTWC began experimenting with five @-@ day forecasts . 
 During most of the year , sea surface temperatures were above normal near the equator , and were highest around 160 ° E from January to July , and in November . Areas of convection developed farther east than usual , causing many storms to develop east of 150 ° E. The average point of formation was 145 @.@ 9 ° E , the easternmost point since 1951 . Partially as a result , no tropical storms made landfall in the Philippines for the first time since 1951 , according to the JMA . Two storms – Ele and Huko – entered the basin from the Central Pacific , east of the International Date Line . Overall , there were 26 named storms in the basin in 2002 , which was slightly below the norm of 26 @.@ 7 . A total of 15 of the 26 storms became typhoons , a slightly higher than normal proportion . 
 The season began early , but did not become active until June , when six storms passed near or over Japan after a ridge weakened . Nine storms developed in July , many of which influenced the monsoon trough over the Philippines to produce heavy rainfall and deadly flooding . The flooding was worst in Luzon , where 85 people were killed . The series of storms caused the widespread closure of schools and offices . Many roads were damaged , and the floods left about $ 1 @.@ 8 million ( ₱ 94 @.@ 2 million PHP ) in crop damage , largely to rice and corn . Overall damage from the series of storms was estimated at $ 10 @.@ 3 million ( ₱ 522 million PHP ) . From June to September , heavy rainfall affected large portions of China , resulting in devastating flooding that killed over 1 @,@ 500 people and left $ 8 @.@ 2 billion ( ¥ 68 billion CNY ) in damage . During this time , Tropical Storm Kammuri struck southern China with a large area of rainfall that damaged or destroyed 245 @,@ 000 houses . There were 153 deaths related to the storm , mostly inland in Hunan , and damage totaled $ 322 million ( ¥ 2 @.@ 665 billion CNY ) . Activity shifted farther to the east after September , with Typhoon Higos striking Japan in October and Typhoon Pongsona hitting Guam in December .

The track maps plot the track and intensity of the storms ; light and dark blue indicate tropical depression and tropical storm status , respectively , and intensifying colors of yellow through red correspond to the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale from 1 to 5 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Tapah ( <unk> ) = = = 
 The first storm of the season was Tropical Storm Tapah , which formed on January 9 near Palau . It developed from the monsoon trough and was first observed by the JTWC two days before its formation . The system initially consisted of an area of convection with a weak circulation , located in an area of weak wind shear . On January 10 , the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression , the same day that the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 01W and PAGASA classified it as " <unk> " . The storm moved west @-@ northwestward due to a ridge to the north , and the system gradually became better organized . On January 12 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Tapah , and later that day estimated peak winds of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . Around that time , Tapah developed an eye feature beneath its convection , prompting both the JTWC and PAGASA to estimate peak winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . An approaching trough weakened the ridge , which turned the storm to the northwest . Due to increasing wind shear , convection gradually weakened , and the JMA downgraded Tapah to a tropical depression on January 13 ; however , other agencies maintained the system as a tropical storm . The next day , Tapah dissipated along the eastern coast of Luzon in the Philippines . 
 = = = Typhoon Mitag ( Basyang ) = = = 
 Typhoon Mitag developed from a trough near the equator on February 25 near the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) . It moved westward through the archipelago and intensified into a typhoon , before passing near Yap on March 2 . High winds and heavy rainfall affected the state , causing an islandwide power outage and destroying hundreds of houses . Mitag severely damaged crops , resulting in food shortages . The rainfall and storm surge flooded much of the coastline as well as Yap 's capital , Colonia . Damage totaled $ 150 million , mostly to crops . There was one death related to the storm 's aftermath . 
 After affecting Yap , Mitag turned to the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough . It passed to the north of Palau , contributing to one death there . Despite predictions of weakening , the typhoon continued to intensify , reaching peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) on March 5 . The JTWC estimated peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) when the storm was about 610 km ( 380 mi ) east of Catanduanes in the Philippines ; this made Mitag a super typhoon , the first one on record in the month of March . The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly . Only four days after reaching peak winds , the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines . 
 = = = Tropical Depression 03W ( Caloy ) = = = 
 On March 15 , the JTWC began monitoring a tropical disturbance , and four days later upgraded it to a tropical depression near Palau . The next day , both the JMA and PAGASA classified the system as a depression , and PAGASA named it " Caloy " . Moving west @-@ northwestward due to a ridge to the north , the depression moved across the Philippine island of Mindanao on March 21 and continued through the archipelago . Owing to strong wind shear , the system never intensified , and the JMA discontinued advisories on March 23 after the system reached the South China Sea . The JTWC maintained the system as a tropical depression until March 25 , when a mid @-@ latitude trough absorbed the system off the east coast of Vietnam . 
 Heavy rains from the depression affected the southern Philippines , causing flash flooding and landslides . The storm damaged 2 @,@ 703 homes , including 215 that were destroyed . Damage totaled about $ 2 @.@ 4 million ( ₱ 124 million PHP ) . There were 35 deaths in the Philippines , mostly in Surigao del Sur in Mindanao from drownings . 
 = = = Typhoon Hagibis = = = 
 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance near the Caroline Islands in the middle of May . By that time , the system was an area of convection with a weak circulation , although the system organized as outflow improved . It tracked northwestward within the monsoon trough , steered by a mid @-@ level ridge . The system developed into a tropical depression on May 14 about 500 km ( 310 mi ) southwest of Chuuk Lagoon , and early the next day the JTWC initiated advisories . For several days the depression remained weak , until it intensified into Tropical Storm Hagibis on May 16 about 200 km ( 120 mi ) southwest of Guam . The developing storm dropped rainfall on Guam that ended the island 's wildfire season . The storm quickly intensified , developing an eye feature later that day . Early on May 18 , the JMA upgraded Hagibis to a typhoon , and around that time , an approaching trough turned the storm to the northeast . 
 While accelerating northeastward , Hagibis developed a well @-@ defined eye and underwent a period of rapid deepening . On May 19 , the JMA estimated peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated 1 @-@ minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) ; this made Hagibis a super typhoon , the second of the year . At the time of its peak , the typhoon was located about 305 km ( 190 mi ) west @-@ southwest of the northernmost Northern Marianas Islands . Hagibis only maintained its peak for about 12 hours , after which the eye began weakening . The trough that caused the typhoon 's acceleration also caused the storm to lose tropical characteristics , and dry air gradually became entrained in the circulation . On May 21 , Hagibis became extratropical to the east of Japan after having weakened below typhoon intensity . The remnants continued to the northeast and dissipated south of the Aleutian Islands on May 22 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Noguri ( Espada ) = = = 
 In early June , a disturbance within the monsoon trough persisted in the South China Sea to the east of Vietnam . On June 4 , a tropical depression developed just off the east coast of Hainan , with a broad circulation and scattered convection . The system tracked slowly eastward due to a ridge to the north , and conditions favored intensification , including favorable outflow and minimal wind shear . The JTWC initiated advisories on June 6 , and despite the favorable conditions , the depression remained weak . On June 7 , the system briefly entered the area of responsibility of PAGASA , and the agency named it Espada . Later that day , the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm , and on June 8 the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Noguri halfway between Taiwan and Luzon . Increased outflow from an approaching trough allowed the storm to quickly intensify . The JTWC upgraded Noguri to a typhoon late on June 8 , after an eye developed . By that time , the storm was moving to the northeast due to a building ridge to the southeast . The JMA only estimated peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . However , the JTWC estimated peak winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , after the eye became well @-@ organized . Increasing wind shear weakened Noguri , and the storm passed just west of the Miyako @-@ jima on June 9 . The convection diminished , and the JTWC declared Noguri extratropical while the storm was approaching Japan . The JMA continued tracking the storm until it dissipated over the Kii Peninsula on June 11 . 
 While the storm passed south of Taiwan , it dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 320 mm ( 13 in ) in Pingtung County . Rainfall in Japan peaked at 123 mm ( 4 @.@ 8 in ) at a station in Kagoshima Prefecture . The threat of the storm prompted school closures and 20 airline flight cancellations . Noguri injured one person , damaged one house , and caused about $ 4 million ( ¥ 504 million JPY ) in agricultural damage . 
 = = = Typhoon Rammasun ( Florita ) = = = 
 Typhoon Rammasun was the first of four typhoons to contribute to heavy rainfall and deadly flooding in the Philippines in July 2002 ; there were 85 deaths related to the four storms , with 2 @,@ 463 homes damaged or destroyed . Rammasun developed around the same time as Typhoon Chataan , but farther to the west . The storm tracked northwestward toward Taiwan , and on July 2 it attained its peak intensity with winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) . Rammasun turned northward , passing east of Taiwan and China . In Taiwan , the outer rainbands dropped rainfall that alleviated drought conditions . In contrast , rainfall in China followed previously wet conditions , resulting in additional flooding , although less damage than expected ; there was about $ 85 million in crop and fishery damage in Zhejiang . 
 After affecting Taiwan and China , Rammasun began weakening due to an approaching trough , which turned the typhoon northeastward . It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako @-@ jima and also produced strong winds in Okinawa . About 10 @,@ 000 houses lost power on the island , and high surf killed two sailors . On the Japanese mainland , there was light crop damage and one serious injury . After weakening to a tropical storm , Rammasun passed just west of the South Korean island of <unk> , where high waves killed one person . The storm crossed the country , killing three others and leaving $ 9 @.@ 5 million in damage . High rains also affected North Korea and Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East . 
 = = = Typhoon Chataan ( Gloria ) = = = 
 Typhoon Chataan formed on June 28 , 2002 , near the FSM , and for several days it meandered while producing heavy rainfall across the region . In Chuuk , a state in the FSM , the highest 24 @-@ hour precipitation total was 506 mm ( 19 @.@ 9 in ) , which was greater than the average monthly total . The rain produced floods up to 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) deep , causing deadly landslides across the island that killed 47 people ; this made Chataan the deadliest natural disaster in the island 's history . There was also one death on nearby Pohnpei , and damage in the FSM totaled over $ 100 million . 
 After affecting the FSM , Chataan began a northwest track as an intensifying typhoon . Its eye passed just north of Guam on July 4 , though the eyewall moved across the island and dropped heavy rainfall . Totals were highest in southern Guam , peaking at 536 mm ( 21 @.@ 1 in ) . Flooding and landslides from the storm severely damaged or destroyed 1 @,@ 994 houses . Damage on the island totaled $ 60 @.@ 5 million , and there were 23 injuries . The typhoon also affected Rota in the Northern Mariana Islands with gusty winds and light rainfall . Typhoon Chataan attained its peak intensity of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) on July 8 . It weakened while turning to the north , and after diminishing to a tropical storm , Chataan struck eastern Japan on July 10 . High rainfall , peaking at 509 mm ( 20 @.@ 0 in ) , flooded 10 @,@ 270 houses . Damage in Japan totaled about $ 500 million ( ¥ 59 billion JPY ) . 
 = = = Typhoon Halong ( Inday ) = = = 
 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on July 5 near the Marshall Islands , near where Chataan originated . For much of its duration , Halong moved toward the northwest , gradually intensifying into a tropical storm . Early on July 10 , Halong passed just south of Guam as a tropical storm , according to the JMA , although the JTWC assessed it as a typhoon near the island . It had threatened to strike the island less than a week after Chataan 's damaging landfall , and although Halong remained south of Guam , it produced high waves and gusty winds on the island . The storm disrupted relief efforts following Chataan , causing additional power outages but little damage . 
 After affecting Guam , Halong quickly strengthened into a typhoon and reached its peak winds on July 12 . The JTWC estimated peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , while the JMA estimated 10 @-@ minute winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) . The typhoon weakened greatly while curving to the northeast , although its winds caused widespread power outages on Okinawa . Halong struck southeastern Japan , dropping heavy rainfall and producing strong winds that left $ 89 @.@ 8 million ( ¥ 10 @.@ 3 billion JPY ) in damage . There was one death in the country and nine injuries . Halong became extratropical on July 16 and dissipated the next day . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Nakri ( <unk> ) = = = 
 A circulation formed on July 7 in the South China Sea , with associated convection located to the south . Outflow increased as the system became better organized , and late on July 7 a tropical depression formed to the southwest of Taiwan . A ridge located over the Philippines caused the system to track northeastward . Early on July 9 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Nakri near western Taiwan . It was a small storm , and while moving along the northern portion of the island , Nakri weakened as its convection diminished . However , it intensified while moving away from Taiwan , reaching peak winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) on July 10 . The monsoon trough turned Nakri to the east for two days , until a weakening ridge turned it to the north on July 12 . That day , the storm passed just west of Okinawa , and shortly thereafter Nakri weakened to a tropical depression , after experiencing cooler waters and increasing shear . On July 13 , Nakri dissipated west of Kyushu . 
 While passing over Taiwan , Nakri dropped heavy rainfall that reached 647 mm ( 25 @.@ 5 in ) at <unk> Islet . A total of 170 mm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) fell in one day at the Feitsui Dam , representing the highest daily total at that point in the year . Taiwan had experienced drought conditions prior to earlier Typhoon Rammasun , and additional rainfall from Nakri eliminated all remaining water restrictions . Airline flights were canceled throughout the region due to the storm , and some schools and offices were closed . Nakri killed one fisherman and a <unk> during its passage . High rains also affected southeastern China , and later Okinawa . The storm induced heavy rainfall in the Philippines , as well as in Japan , where landslides and flooding were reported along a cold front . 
 = = = Typhoon Fengshen = = = 
 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on July 13 , which quickly intensified due to its small size . By July 15 , Fengshen attained typhoon status , and after initially moving to the north , it began a movement toward the northwest . On July 18 , the typhoon reached peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , according to the JMA , making it the strongest storm of the season . The JTWC estimated peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 270 km / h ( 165 mph ) , and the agency estimated that Fengshen was a super typhoon for five days . This broke the record for longest duration at that intensity , previously set by Typhoon Joan in 1997 , and later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006 . 
 While near peak intensity , Typhoon Fengshen underwent the Fujiwhara effect with Typhoon Fung @-@ wong , causing the latter storm to loop to its south . Fengshen gradually weakened while approaching Japan , and it crossed over the country 's Ōsumi Islands on July 25 as a severe tropical storm . When the typhoon washed a freighter ashore , four people drowned and the remaining fifteen were rescued . In the country , Fengshen dropped heavy rainfall and produced heavy rains , causing mudslides , $ 4 million ( ¥ 475 million JPY ) in crop damage , and one death . After affecting Japan , Fengshen weakened in the Yellow Sea to a tropical depression , before moving across China 's Shandong Peninsula and dissipating on July 28 . 
 = = = Tropical Depression 13W ( Juan ) = = = 
 On July 16 , an area of convection increased northwest of Palau with a weak circulation . Moderate shear dispersed the thunderstorms , although the system gradually organized . It tracked northwestward due to a ridge to the north , becoming a tropical depression on July 18 . PAGASA gave the system the local name " Juan " , and the JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 13W , although the JMA did not classify it as a tropical storm . Early on July 19 , the depression struck Samar Island in the Philippines , and continued northwestward through the archipelago . An increase in convection the next day prompted the JTWC to upgrade the system to a tropical storm before it moved over Luzon and the Metro Manila area . Increasing shear and disrupted outflow due to land interaction weakened the system , and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July 22 . PAGASA continued tracking the system until the following day . 
 The depression dropped heavy rainfall in the Philippines during its passage , only weeks after several consecutive tropical systems caused deadly flooding in the country . The rains forced 2 @,@ 400 people to evacuate . Storm @-@ related tornadoes and landslides killed at least three people . Three people were electrocuted , and flash flooding killed at least two people . In all , Tropical Depression Juan killed 14 people and injured two others . There were 583 houses that were damaged or destroyed , and damage totaled about $ 240 @,@ 000 ( ₱ 12 @.@ 1 million PHP ) , mostly on Luzon . 
 = = = Typhoon Fung @-@ wong ( Kaka ) = = = 
 A small circulation formed northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands on July 18 . Later that day , the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression . Convection and outflow increased the next day , and the system moved slowly westward due to a ridge over Japan . After further organization , the JTWC initiated advisories on July 20 while the depression was just southwest of Iwo Jima . Shortly thereafter , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Fung @-@ Wong . On July 22 , the storm began undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with the larger Typhoon Fengshen to the east , causing Fung @-@ wong to turn southwestward . Around that time , the storm entered PAGASA 's region , earning it the local name " Kaka " . Fung @-@ wong quickly intensified after developing a small eye , becoming a typhoon on July 23 , with peak winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . It turned to the south and later southeast while interacting with the larger Fengshen , which passed north of it . On July 25 , the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm while at the southernmost point of its track . The storm turned to the north and completed a large loop between the Ryukyu and Northern Marianas Islands that day . The combination of cooler waters , wind shear , and dry air caused weakening , and the storm deteriorated into a tropical depression on July 27 . Passing a short distance south of Kyushu , Fung @-@ wong dissipated later that day . 
 The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Japan , reaching 717 mm ( 28 @.@ 2 in ) at a station in Miyazaki Prefecture . The rains caused two landslides and resulted in delays to bus and train systems , as well as cancellations to ferry and airline routes . There was also minor crop damage . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Kalmaegi = = = 
 A tropical disturbance developed on July 17 in the Central Pacific Ocean , near the International Date Line . Deep convection with outflow persisted around a circulation , and at 06 : 00 UTC on July 20 the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression , just east of the date line and about 980 km ( 610 mi ) west @-@ southwest of Johnston Atoll . The system crossed the line shortly thereafter and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Kalmaegi . The JMA classified the system as a tropical storm , although the JTWC maintained it as a tropical depression . Kalmaegi moved northwestward due to a ridge to the north , and initially a tropical upper tropospheric trough provided favorable conditions . However , the trough soon increased wind shear and restricted outflow , which caused quick weakening . The thunderstorms diminished from the circulation , and around 12 : 00 UTC on July 22 , Kalmaegi dissipated about 30 hours after forming . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Kammuri ( Lagalag ) = = = 
 A large monsoonal system persisted toward the end of July 2002 near the Philippines . On August 2 , a tropical depression formed off the northwest coast of Luzon and moved west @-@ northwestward . Late on August 3 , it intensified into Tropical Storm Kammuri off the coast of Hong Kong . A weakening ridge turned the storm northward toward the coast of China . Tropical Storm Kammuri made landfall late on August 4 , after reaching peak winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . The system dissipated over the mountainous coastline of eastern China and merged with a cold front on August 7 . 
 High rainfall from Kammuri affected large portions of China , particularly in Guangdong province where it moved ashore . In Hong Kong , the rains caused a landslide and damaged a road . Two dams were destroyed in Guangdong by the flooding , and 10 people were killed by a landslide . Throughout the province , over 100 @,@ 000 people had to evacuate due to flooding , and after 6 @,@ 810 houses were destroyed . The floods damaged roads , railroads , and tunnels , and left power and water outages across the region . Rainfall was beneficial in alleviating drought conditions in Guangdong , although further inland the rains occurred after months of deadly flooding . In Hunan Province , the storm 's remnants merged with a cold front and destroyed 12 @,@ 400 houses . Across its path , the floods damaged or destroyed 245 @,@ 000 houses , and destroyed about 60 hectares ( 150 acres ) of crop fields . Kammuri and its remnants killed 153 people , and damage was estimated at $ 509 million ( ¥ 4 @.@ 219 billion CNY ) . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Vongfong ( Milenyo ) = = = 
 A tropical depression developed on August 10 east of the Philippines . Initially it was disorganized due to hostile conditions , and it failed to intensify significantly before crossing the Philippine island of Luzon . There , flooding forced 3 @,@ 500 people to evacuate their homes . In the Philippines , the storm killed 35 people and caused $ 3 @.@ 3 million in damage , with 13 @,@ 178 houses damaged or destroyed . It was the final storm named by PAGASA during the season . 
 After affecting the Philippines , the tropical depression dissipated in the South China Sea on August 14 . The next day , the system reformed , although the JTWC labeled the new depression as a separate cyclone . It moved northwestward , strengthening into Tropical Storm Vongfong on August 18 . It brushed eastern Hainan before making landfall on August 19 in southern China near Wuchuan , Guangdong . Soon after the circulation dissipated , it dropped heavy rainfall across the region . One person died in a traffic accident in Hong Kong , and landslides killed twelve people . The storm destroyed 6 @,@ 000 houses , mostly in Guangdong , and damage in the country totaled at least $ 86 million . 
 = = = Typhoon Phanfone = = = 
 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on August 11 , just west of <unk> Atoll . It moved generally northwestward due to a ridge to the north , quickly intensifying into Tropical Storm Phanfone by August 12 . With good outflow and developing rainbands , the storm continued to strengthen , becoming a typhoon on August 14 . Phanfone developed a well @-@ defined eye , surrounded by deep convection . On August 15 , the JMA estimated 10 @-@ minute winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated 1 @-@ minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , making it a super typhoon . Diminished outflow and an eyewall replacement cycle caused weakening , and it passed near Iwo Jima on August 16 . Phanfone turned to the northeast two days later due to a weakening ridge , and dry air caused rapid deterioration . Passing southeast of Japan , it fell to tropical storm status on August 19 before becoming extratropical the next day ; the remnants continued to the northeast and crossed the International Date Line on August 25 . 
 Wind gusts on Iwo Jima reached 168 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Rainfall in mainland Japan peaked at 416 mm ( 16 @.@ 4 in ) near Tokyo , and the typhoon flooded 43 houses . High rains caused road damage and landslides , as well as some aquaculture damage . The storm caused 22 ferry routes and 10 flights to be canceled , and temporarily shut down refineries near Tokyo . On the offshore island of Hachijō @-@ jima , high winds caused a temporary power outage . 
 = = = Typhoon Rusa = = = 
 Typhoon Rusa developed on August 22 from the monsoon trough in the open Pacific Ocean , well to the southeast of Japan . For several days , Rusa moved to the northwest , eventually intensifying into a powerful typhoon . The JMA estimated peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) . On August 26 , the storm moved across the Amami Islands of Japan , where Rusa left 20 @,@ 000 people without power and caused two fatalities . Across Japan , the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 902 mm ( 35 @.@ 5 in ) in Tokushima Prefecture . 
 After weakening slightly , Rusa made landfall on Goheung , South Korea with 10 @-@ minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . It was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm air and instability from a nearby cold front . Rusa weakened while moving through the country , dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at 897 @.@ 5 mm ( 35 @.@ 33 in ) in Gangneung . A 24 @-@ hour total of 880 mm ( 35 in ) in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country ; however , the heaviest rainfall was localized . Over 17 @,@ 000 houses were damaged , and large areas of crop fields were flooded . In South Korea , Rusa killed at least 233 people , making it the deadliest typhoon in over 43 years , and caused $ 4 @.@ 2 billion in damage . The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall in neighboring North Korea , leaving 26 @,@ 000 people homeless and killing three . Rusa also destroyed large areas of crops in the country , which was already affected by ongoing famine conditions . The typhoon became extratropical over eastern Russia on September 1 , dissipating three days later . 
 = = = Typhoon Sinlaku = = = 
 Sinlaku formed on August 27 northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands . After initially moving to the north , it began a generally westward motion that it maintained for the rest of its duration . Sinlaku strengthened into a typhoon and attained its peak winds on August 31 . Over the next few days , it fluctuated slightly in intensity while moving over or near several Japanese islands . On September 4 , the typhoon 's eye crossed over Okinawa . It dropped heavy rainfall and produced strong winds that left over 100 @,@ 000 people without power . Damage on the island was estimated at $ 14 @.@ 3 million , including $ 3 @.@ 6 million in damage to Kadena Air Base . 
 After affecting Okinawa , Sinlaku threatened northern Taiwan , which had been affected by two deadly typhoons in the previous year . Damage ended up being minimal on the island , although two people were killed . Sinlaku weakened slightly before making its final landfall in eastern China near Wenzhou on September 7 . The storm produced a record wind gust there of 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) , and just south of the city , high waves destroyed several piers and a large boat . High rainfall and winds from Sinlaku wrecked 58 @,@ 000 houses , and large areas of crops were destroyed . Damage in China was estimated at $ 709 million , and there were 28 deaths there . 
 = = = Typhoon Ele = = = 
 An eastern extension of the monsoon trough southwest of Hawaii organized into Tropical Depression Two @-@ C on August 27 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Ele six hours later . Despite the nearby presence of Alika , Ele developed rapidly and strengthened into a hurricane on August 28 . After contributing to the demise of Alika , Ele intensified to winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) before crossing the International Date Line on August 30 . 
 Reclassified as a typhoon , Ele moved north @-@ northwestward due to a weakness in the ridge to the north . Early on August 31 , the JTWC estimated the storm 's peak 1 @-@ minute winds at 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . On September 2 , the JMA estimated peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) while Ele was northeast of Wake Atoll . The typhoon turned to the northeast due to an approaching trough , although Ele resumed its previous north @-@ northwest motion after a ridge built behind the trough . It gradually weakened due to cooler waters and increasing wind shear , and on September 6 Ele deteriorated below typhoon status . The thunderstorms became detached from the circulation , causing Ele to weaken to a tropical depression late on September 9 . By that time , it began moving to the northeast , and on September 10 it transitioned into an extratropical storm . The remnants of Ele continued to the northeast until moving back into the central Pacific as an extratropical storm on September 11 and dissipating on September 13 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Hagupit = = = 
 An area of convection developed on September 8 to the northeast of Luzon . Moving to the west due to a ridge to the north , it slowly organized , forming into a tropical depression on September 9 in the South China Sea . As it approached southeastern China , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hagupit and reached peak winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . At around 19 : 00 UTC on September 11 , the storm made landfall west of Macau and quickly weakened into a tropical depression . The JTWC promptly discontinued advisories , although the JMA continued tracking Hagupit over land . The remnants executed a loop over Guangdong before moving offshore and dissipating on September 16 near Hong Kong . 
 Hagupit dropped heavy rainfall along the coast of China for several days , peaking at 344 mm ( 13 @.@ 5 in ) in Zhanjiang City . The rains flooded widespread areas of crop fields and resulted in landslides . In Guangdong , 330 houses were destroyed , and damage was estimated at $ 32 @.@ 5 million . In Hong Kong , 32 people were injured due to the storm , and 41 flights were canceled . In Fuzhou in Fujian Province , thunderstorms related to Hagupit flooded hundreds of houses . Further west in Jiangxi , floods from the storm destroyed 3 @,@ 800 houses , ruined 180 bridges , and killed 25 . Offshore , a helicopter rescued the crew of 25 from a sunken boat during the storm . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Changmi = = = 
 An area of thunderstorms increased near the FSM on September 15 within the monsoon trough . Located within an area of moderate wind shear , its convection was intermittent around a weak circulation . On September 18 , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) , and the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression ; however , the two warning agencies were tracking different circulations within the same system , and by September 19 the circulation JMA was tracking became the dominant system . Shortly thereafter , the agency downgraded the system to a low pressure area after it weakened . The next day , JMA again upgraded the system to a tropical depression , and the JTWC issued a second TCFA when the system had a partially exposed circulation near an area of increasing convection . Late on September 21 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Changmi to the south of Japan . The next day , Changmi attained peak winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . However , the JTWC noted that the system was absorbing dry air and becoming extratropical , and thus did not issue warnings on the storm . Moving northeastward , Changmi became an extratropical cyclone on September 22 , and gradually became more intense until crossing the International Date Line early on September 25 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Mekkhala = = = 
 An elongated trough with associated convection developed in the South China Sea by September 21 . Light shear and increasing outflow allowed the system to become better organized , and it formed into a tropical depression on September 22 between Vietnam and Luzon . A ridge to the northeast allowed the system to track northwestward . For several days the depression failed to organize further , despite favorable conditions ; however , late on September 24 the circulation developed rainbands and a weak eye feature . Early the next day , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Mekkhala , which quickly intensified to a peak intensity of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . At around 12 : 00 UTC on September 25 , Mekkhala made landfall on western Hainan near peak intensity . Soon after , it moved into the Gulf of Tonkin and weakened due to land interaction and increasing shear . Mekkhala remained a weak tropical storm until September 28 , when it weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated soon after in the extreme northern portion of the Gulf of Tonkin . 
 Mekkhala dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 479 mm ( 18 @.@ 9 in ) in Sanya , Hainan . Along the island , high winds washed ashore or sank 20 boats , and 84 fishermen were rescued . Throughout Hainan , the high rains wrecked 2 @,@ 500 houses and left $ 80 @.@ 5 million in damage . High rains spread into southwestern China , particularly in Guangxi . In Beihai , the storm destroyed 335 houses , resulting in $ 22 million in damage . 
 = = = Typhoon Higos = = = 
 Typhoon Higos developed on September 25 east of the Northern Marianas Islands . It tracked west @-@ northwestward for its first few days , steadily intensifying into a powerful typhoon by September 29 . Higos weakened and turned to the north @-@ northeast toward Japan , making landfall in that country 's Kanagawa Prefecture on October 1 . Shortly thereafter , it crossed over Tokyo , becoming the third strongest typhoon to do so since World War II . It weakened while crossing Honshu , and shortly after striking Hokkaidō on October 2 , Higos became extratropical . The remnants passed over Sakhalin and dissipated on October 4 . 
 Before striking Japan , Higos produced strong winds in the Northern Marianas Islands while passing to their north . These winds damaged the food supply on two islands . Later , Higos moved across Japan with wind gusts as strong as 161 km / h ( 100 mph ) , including record gusts at several locations . A total of 608 @,@ 130 buildings in the country were left without power , and two people were electrocuted in the storm 's aftermath . The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 346 mm ( 13 @.@ 6 in ) . The rains flooded houses across the country and caused mudslides . High waves washed 25 boats ashore and killed one person along the coast . Damage in the country totaled $ 2 @.@ 14 billion ( ¥ 261 billion JPY ) , and there were five deaths . Later , the remnants of Higos affected the Russian Far East , killing seven people in two shipwrecks near Primorsky Krai . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Bavi = = = 
 A tropical disturbance organized within the monsoon trough in early October near the FSM . The convection gradually consolidated around a single circulation , developing into a tropical depression on October 8 . Wind shear was weak and outflow was good , which allowed for slow strengthening ; however , the system was elongated , with a separate circulation to the west . Around this time , the system produced gale force winds on Kosrae in the FSM . Late on October 9 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bavi to the east of Guam , although it was still a broad system at the time . After becoming a tropical storm , Bavi moved generally northward due to a ridge retreating to the northeast . By October 11 , winds were fairly weak near the center and were stronger in outer rainbands . That day , the JMA estimated peak winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Despite the broad structure , with an exposed circulation at the peak , the JTWC estimated winds as high as 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) , making Bavi a typhoon . Shortly after reaching peak winds , the storm turned to the northeast and entered the westerlies . Increasing shear weakened the convection , and Bavi became extratropical on October 13 . It continued to the northeast and crossed into the Central Pacific on October 16 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Maysak = = = 
 On October 25 , an organized area of convection persisted southeast of Wake Island . With minimal wind shear , it quickly developed a circulation , becoming a tropical depression on October 26 . Due to a ridge to the east , it moved generally northwestward and slowly intensified . Late on October 27 , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Maysak . Initially , the system absorbed nearby dry air , although the storm was able to continue developing deep convection . An approaching trough turned Maysak to the northeast , and on October 29 it reached peak winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) , according to the JMA . On two occasions , the JTWC assessed Maysak as briefly intensifying into a typhoon , based on an eye feature , although increased shear later caused weakening . Continuing to the northeast , Maysak moved into the central Pacific Ocean on October 30 , by which time it had become extratropical . 
 = = = Typhoon Huko = = = 
 In the central Pacific Ocean , a tropical depression developed in the monsoon trough on October 24 to the south of Hawaii . It moved generally west @-@ northwestward , intensifying into Tropical Storm Huko on October 26 . It became a hurricane two days later , and briefly weakened back to tropical storm status before becoming a hurricane again on October 31 . On November 3 , Huko crossed the International Date Line into the western Pacific . Despite favorable inflow patterns and warm sea surface temperatures , Huko only strengthened to reach peak winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . It moved quickly to the west @-@ northwest due to a strong ridge to its north . Dry air caused Huko to weaken slightly , and on November 4 the typhoon passed about 95 km ( 60 mi ) northeast of Wake Island . The typhoon brought heavy rains and winds gusts of 40 – 45 mph ( 64 – 72 km / h ) to the island . Huko moved through a weakness in the ridge , resulting in a turn to the north and northeast . Late on November 5 , Huko weakened below typhoon status , and increasing shear caused further weakening . On November 7 , Huko became extratropical , and later that day its remnants crossed back into the central Pacific . Several days later , the remnants affected northern California . 
 = = = Typhoon Haishen = = = 
 In the middle of November , an area of thunderstorms developed southwest of Chuuk in the FSM within the monsoon trough . With weak shear and good outflow , it slowly organized , becoming a tropical depression on November 20 . It moved quickly to the west @-@ northwest , intensifying into Tropical Storm Haishen late on November 20 to the southeast of Guam . While passing south of the island , Haishen produced gale @-@ force winds . The convection organized into a central dense overcast and developed an eye feature . Early on November 23 , Haishen intensified into a typhoon ; around that time , it began moving to the north due to an approaching trough . The typhoon quickly intensified to peak winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) . Soon after , Haishen began weakening due to increasing shear , and the eye quickly dissipated . Late on November 24 , it weakened below typhoon status , and early on November 25 Haishen became extratropical . The remnants continued to the northeast , dissipating on November 26 . 
 = = = Typhoon Pongsona = = = 
 Typhoon Pongsona was the last typhoon of the season , and was the second costliest disaster in 2002 in the United States and its territories . It formed on December 2 , having originated as an area of convection to the east @-@ southeast of Pohnpei in late November . With a ridge to the north , the depression tracked generally westward for several days , intensifying into Tropical Storm Pongsona on December 3 . After an eye developed on December 5 , the storm attained typhoon status to the north of Chuuk . Steady intensification continued , until it became more rapid on December 8 while approaching Guam . That day , the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated peak winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , making Pongsona a super typhoon . Around its peak intensity , the eye of the typhoon moved over Guam and Rota . After striking Guam , Pongsona began moving to the north and later to the northeast , quickly weakening due to the presence of dry air and interaction with an approaching mid @-@ latitude storm . After the convection diminished over the center , Pongsona became extratropical early on December 11 . Early the next day , it dissipated east of Japan . 
 On Guam , Pongsona was the third most intense typhoon on record to strike the island , with wind gusts reaching 278 km / h ( 173 mph ) . Damage totaled $ 700 million , making it one of the five costliest storms on Guam . The typhoon injured 193 people and killed one person . In addition to its strong winds , Pongsona dropped torrential rainfall that peaked at 650 @.@ 5 mm ( 25 @.@ 61 in ) . A total of 1 @,@ 751 houses were destroyed on Guam , and another 6 @,@ 740 were damaged to some degree . Widespread areas lost water , and the road system was heavily damaged . On neighboring Rota , Pongsona damaged 460 houses and destroyed 114 , causing an additional $ 30 million in damage . Both Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands were declared federal disaster areas , which made federal funding available for repairing storm damage . In Guam , the federal government provided about $ 125 million in funding for individuals and other programs . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 On February 15 , a weak tropical depression developed east of Mindanao , according to the JMA ; by the next day , the system dissipated . In the beginning of April , a tropical disturbance developed along the southern end of a stationary cold front west of Enewetak Atoll . While gradually organizing , the system produced gale @-@ force wind gusts in the FSM . On April 5 , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 04W . The system moved northwestward due to a nearby extratropical storm , which later caused the depression to also become extratropical about 650 km ( 405 mi ) west @-@ southwest of Wake Atoll . The JMA issued its last advisory on April 8 . 
 A tropical depression formed in the South China Sea on May 28 , given the name " <unk> " by PAGASA . The JTWC never anticipated significant strengthening , and the system largely consisted of convection displaced to the southeast of a broad circulation . A ridge to the southeast steered the depression to the northeast , and on May 30 the depression made landfall in southwestern Taiwan . The combination of land interaction and wind shear caused dissipation that day . 
 The JMA monitored a tropical depression east of Iwo Jima on July 25 , although by the next day the agency was no longer tracking the system . On August 3 , a small circulation was located just off the southeast coast of Japan , which later developed an area of convection over it . The JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 17W at 06 : 00 UTC on August 5 , describing the system as a " midget cyclone " . A mid @-@ level ridge to the southeast steered the depression eastward away from Japan . Unfavorable conditions caused weakening , and the JTWC discontinued advisories six hours after its first warning . Another tropical depression formed on September 21 to the northeast of the Marshall Islands , but dissipated by the next day . 
 Three non @-@ developing depressions formed in October . The first was classified as a depression by the JMA on October 12 in the South China Sea . It quickly dissipated , although the system dropped heavy rainfall reaching 108 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) at a station in the Paracel Islands . The second , classified as Tropical Depression 27W by the JTWC , formed on October 17 about 1 @,@ 220 km ( 760 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Saipan . It moved westward due to a ridge to the north , and failed to intensify due to weak outflow and dry air . It dissipated on October 19 . The day before , another depression formed near the International Date Line . Classified as Tropical Depression <unk> by the JTWC , it moved generally northward due to a break in the ridge . Wind shear dissipated the depression on October 20 .

 Within the western Pacific Ocean , both the JMA and PAGASA assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the basin , which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names . As part of its duty as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center ( RSMC ) , the JMA 's Typhoon Center in Tokyo assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization 's Typhoon Committee , should they be judged to have 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . The PAGASA assigns names to all tropical cyclones that move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility , located between 135 ° E and 115 ° E and between 5 ° N @-@ 25 ° N , even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it .

 Clinton <unk> " Clint " Romesha ( / ' <unk> / ; born August 17 , 1981 ) is a former United States Army soldier who received the Medal of Honor for actions during the Battle of Kamdesh in 2009 during the war in Afghanistan . 
 Born into a family with a strong military background , Romesha joined the U.S. Army in 1999 , and was posted at various times in Germany , South Korea and Colorado . Trained as an M1 Abrams tank crewman , Romesha had seen four deployments , including to Kosovo , Iraq twice , and Afghanistan . On 3 October 2009 , he was assigned to the 3rd Squadron , 61st Cavalry Regiment , 4th Brigade Combat Team , 4th Infantry Division , deployed to Combat Outpost Keating in eastern Afghanistan . When a force of 300 Taliban insurgents attacked the base , Romesha was credited with rallying his comrades and leading the counterattack , directing close air support and providing suppressive fire to help the wounded to an aid station . Despite being wounded , Romesha continued to fight through the 12 @-@ hour battle . 
 Romesha left the Army in 2011 to spend more time with his family . He later took a job in the oil industry in North Dakota . On 11 February 2013 , he received the Medal of Honor from President Barack Obama . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Romesha was born in August 1981 in Lake City , California , to a family with a strong military background . His grandfather , Aury Smith , is a World War II veteran who fought in the Battle of Normandy . His father is a Vietnam War veteran who later became a church leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints . Romesha is the fourth of five siblings , including two brothers who also joined the military . He is a member of the LDS Church and attended seminary for four years during high school but ultimately decided not to become a missionary for the church as his family had hoped he would . Romesha grew up in Lake City , where he developed an avid love of hockey . 
 He married Tamara Romesha on 13 February 2000 . They met in junior high school and began dating several years later . The couple have three children ; <unk> , Gwen , and Colin . Friends describe Romesha as having a sense of humor and being " intense , short and wiry . " 
 = = = Military career = = = 
 Romesha enlisted in the United States Army in September 1999 and underwent Basic Combat Training and later Advanced Individual Training at Fort Knox , Kentucky . Trained to be an armor crewman for the M1 Abrams tank , Romesha was first assigned as a tank gunner in Company B , 1st Battalion , <unk> Armor Regiment , 2d Brigade , 1st Infantry Division , and posted at Rose Barracks , Germany . During this posting he deployed to Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force . His next assignment was as a gunner / assistant tank commander with Company A , 2nd Battalion , 72d Armor Regiment , 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Casey , South Korea . After a former mentor was killed in Iraq , Romesha volunteered for a tour supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom when parts of his unit received redeployment orders . 
 Next , Romesha was assigned as section leader with Troop B , 3d Squadron , 61st Cavalry Regiment , 4th Brigade Combat Team , 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson , Colorado . There , he completed the Long Range Reconnaissance Course , the Advanced Leader Course , and Air Assault Training . Trained as a Cavalry Scout , Romesha saw his second deployment to Iraq in this unit . 
 In May 2009 , Romesha 's unit deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom . His unit was assigned to Combat Outpost Keating in the Kamdesh District , Nuristan Province in Eastern Afghanistan . It replaced the outgoing 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team at the remote outpost in the mountains of a semiautonomous area of the country . Keating was located in a valley surrounded by steep mountains , and over the course of the deployment , it came under attack regularly . U.S. commanders opted to close the outpost by October 2009 , considering it indefensible . During the deployment , Romesha was given the nickname " Ro " by his comrades . He was noted for his sense of humor and calm temperament in the difficult deployment . 
 = = = Medal of Honor action = = = 
 On 3 October 2009 , according to a report published by U.S. Army historian Richard S. Lowry , Taliban fighters launched a coordinated attack on the outpost from three sides at about 06 : 00 , capturing its ammunition depot . Some 300 fighters participated in the attack armed with a recoilless rifle , rocket @-@ propelled grenades , mortars , machine guns , and small arms , badly outnumbering the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) presence of about 85 U.S. Army , Afghan National Army and Latvian Army soldiers , and the 35 Afghan soldiers who abandoned their positions . It would later be known as the Battle of Kamdesh . 
 During the first three hours of the fight , the U.S. troops remained under intense mortar and small arms fire , before the Taliban fighters breached the compound and set fire to it . Romesha moved under heavy fire to reconnoiter the area and seek reinforcements from a nearby barracks , helping the ISAF force to regroup and fight despite being targeted by a Taliban sniper . Romesha led the firefight to reclaim the depot , organizing a five @-@ man team to counterattack while still under fire . He then neutralized one of the Taliban fighters ' machine gun teams . While engaging a second , he took cover behind a generator which was struck by a rocket propelled grenade , and Romesha was wounded in the neck , shoulder and arms by shrapnel . Despite being wounded , Romesha directed air support that killed an estimated 30 Taliban and then took out several more Taliban positions himself . He provided suppressive fire to allow three other wounded American soldiers to reach an aid station and then recovered several American casualties while still under fire . Romesha 's efforts allowed the troop to regroup and fight off a force superior in numbers . The fight lasted 12 hours , and eight American soldiers were killed , making the engagement one of the costliest for ISAF forces during the war . Nine soldiers were decorated with Silver Star Medals for the fight . Several days later , the ISAF forces withdrew from the post . 
 Romesha received the award from President Barack Obama in an award ceremony at the White House on 11 February 2013 . He is the fourth living Medal of Honor recipient for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ( following Salvatore Giunta , Leroy Petry , and Dakota Meyer ) , and the eleventh overall for these campaigns .

 Romesha was only able to contact his wife four days after the battle , and later noted she was greatly upset when hearing the full story of his actions at Kamdesh . In an interview later with Soldiers Live , Romesha said he felt he " was being selfish and not being fair " having volunteered for so many deployments away from his wife and children . Following the Afghanistan deployment , Romesha went through the Army Career and Alumni Program in preparation to separate from the Army . On 4 April 2011 , Romesha left the military in order to spend more time with his family . 
 Following military service , Romesha moved to North Dakota , where his sister lived , to look for a job in the oil industry . He moved to Minot , North Dakota and purchased a 100 @-@ year @-@ old , flood @-@ damaged home that he is restoring himself . He took a job at KS Industries , an oil field construction firm . Initially crewing a hydro excavation truck , he went through a driver 's training program and later began managing the crews of six other trucks . He currently works as a field safety specialist for KS Industries . His exploits during the firefight were later written about by journalist Jake Tapper in his book , The Outpost . 
 In a press conference on 16 January 2013 shortly after being notified he would receive the medal , Romesha played down his actions in the conflict , noting many other veterans who had received more serious injuries in the battle . Romesha noted that he did not suffer post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or other lasting psychological injuries from deployment , but that others he knew during the deployment did . 
 On 11 February 2013 , Romesha received the Medal of Honor at a ceremony held at the White House . After receiving the award , when speaking to the press wearing his Stetson , Romesha stated he felt " conflicted " about receiving the medal due to the loss of those who died while serving with him . 
 In the days following the award , Romesha was recognized in a number of other events . He was inducted into The Pentagon 's " Hall of Heroes " on 12 February , and traveled to New York City on 17 February to visit with the cast of Spider @-@ Man : Turn Off the Dark on Broadway , hosted by the USO . He was recognized by Governor of North Dakota Jack Dalrymple in an event at the North Dakota State Capitol on 21 February 2013 . On 2 March , Romesha spoke at the military ball of the ROTC program at University of North Dakota . Since then Romesha keeps the Medal of Honor on him . It has some tarnish and wrinkles on it from being carried everywhere , shown to and handled by many .

On that morning , Staff Sergeant Romesha and his comrades awakened to an attack by an estimated 300 enemy fighters occupying the high ground on all four sides of the complex , employing concentrated fire from recoilless rifles , rocket propelled grenades , anti @-@ aircraft machine guns , mortars and small arms fire . Staff Sergeant Romesha moved uncovered under intense enemy fire to conduct a reconnaissance of the battlefield and seek reinforcements from the barracks before returning to action with the support of an assistant gunner . Staff Sergeant Romesha took out an enemy machine gun team and , while engaging a second , the generator he was using for cover was struck by a rocket @-@ propelled grenade , inflicting him with shrapnel wounds . Undeterred by his injuries , Staff Sergeant Romesha continued to fight and upon the arrival of another soldier to aid him and the assistant gunner , he again rushed through the exposed avenue to assemble additional soldiers . Staff Sergeant Romesha then mobilized a five @-@ man team and returned to the fight equipped with a sniper rifle . With complete disregard for his own safety , Staff Sergeant Romesha continually exposed himself to heavy enemy fire , as he moved confidently about the battlefield engaging and destroying multiple enemy targets , including three Taliban fighters who had breached the combat outpost ’ s perimeter . While orchestrating a successful plan to secure and reinforce key points of the battlefield , Staff Sergeant Romesha maintained radio communication with the tactical operations center . As the enemy forces attacked with even greater ferocity , unleashing a barrage of rocket @-@ propelled grenades and recoilless rifle rounds , Staff Sergeant Romesha identified the point of attack and directed air support to destroy over 30 enemy fighters . After receiving reports that seriously injured Soldiers were at a distant battle position , Staff Sergeant Romesha and his team provided covering fire to allow the injured Soldiers to safely reach the aid station . Upon receipt of orders to proceed to the next objective , his team pushed forward 100 meters under overwhelming enemy fire to recover and prevent the enemy fighters from taking the bodies of their fallen comrades . Staff Sergeant Romesha ’ s heroic actions throughout the day @-@ long battle were critical in suppressing an enemy that had far greater numbers . His extraordinary efforts gave Bravo Troop the opportunity to regroup , reorganize and prepare for the counterattack that allowed the Troop to account for its personnel and secure Combat Outpost Keating . Staff Sergeant Romesha ’ s discipline and extraordinary heroism above and beyond the call of duty reflect great credit upon himself , Bravo Troop , 3d Squadron , 61st Cavalry Regiment , 4th Brigade Combat Team , 4th Infantry Division and the United States Army . 
 = All @-@ China Women 's Federation = 
 The All @-@ China Women 's Federation ( Chinese : <unk> , pinyin : Zhōnghuá <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , also known as the ACWF , is a women 's rights organization established in China on 24 March 1949 . It was originally called the All @-@ China Democratic Women 's Foundation , and was renamed the All @-@ China Women 's Federation in 1957 . It has acted as the official leader of the women ’ s movement in China since its founding . It is responsible for promoting government policies on women , and protecting women ’ s rights within the government . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ 1949 : Women ’ s movement prior to the CCP and predecessors = = = 
 The early women ’ s movement in China focused on eradicating the assumption that women were inferior to men . The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves , since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men . The Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women . During the 2nd National Congress in 1922 , the CCP issued a statement arguing for the end of Chinese traditions that repress women . The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women , and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress . 
 When the CCP entered the First United Front to fight warlords and unite China from 1924 – 27 with the <unk> ( GMD ) , the each party established their own women ’ s department during this time . However , the United Front ended with the White Terror ( 1927 ) , where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers . The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule . These territories were called soviets , and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror because they were not under the control of the GMD . The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women , and they established the New Life Movement , which sought to counter the gender role espoused by the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD . The CCP 's time in the soviets from 1927 – 1945 also gave them the opportunity to develop the skills for organizing federations and governing , which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later . 
 The Chinese women ’ s movement gained a new momentum with the Second Sino @-@ Japanese war ( 1937 – 1945 ) . Leaders of the women 's movement expressed nationalist sentiments in response to the threat the war posed to their daily lives . These leaders called for the liberation of women to defend the nation . The number of official women ’ s organization within the CPC at one of the soviets , Yan ’ an , grew during the invasion . In March 1938 , at the First Women ’ s Congress held by the Women ’ s Federation of Shaan @-@ Gan @-@ Ning ( a forerunner to the ACWF ) in a different communist @-@ controlled area , the leaders of the women 's movement began to form their nationalist ideas into an agenda . The women in attendance stated that the goal of the women ’ s movement should be to unite women and to work together to liberate China . The First Women 's Congress also outlined goals for the women 's movement such as : helping women escape abusive marriages , improving women ’ s health , eradicating the practice of foot binding , ending domestic abuse , and protecting women ’ s inheritance rights . The ACWF would adopt many of the same goals in 1949 . 
 = = = 1949 – 1966 : Founding and early years = = = 
 The All @-@ China Democratic Women ’ s Federation was established on 24 March 1949 as China 's first country @-@ wide women ’ s organization , and would be renamed the All @-@ China Women 's Federation later that year . Women who had been dominant in the women ’ s movement and the CPC were included in the federation ’ s leadership . Cai Chang , a prominent leader in the women ’ s movement since , an active CPC member , and a veteran of the Long March , was the first chair of the organization . The organization began as a federation of various regional women ’ s groups with the dual goals of building a socialist China and promoting the status of women . The ACWF soon developed beyond its original mission of promoting gender equality , and it became a tool used by the party to mobilize women for economic , political and ideological motives . 
 The early stages of the organization were characterized by a focus on Marxist – Leninist ideology . The CPC viewed the women ’ s movement as a part of the larger Chinese revolution against the feudal past , but some leaders in the CPC argued that because most of the women continued to do domestic work , and did not actively participate in the revolution , this contradicted the Marxist – Leninist ideology . The ACWF contested this assertion , stating that the economic conditions were not at the point where jobs could be provided to all women . Therefore , housekeepers , wives and mothers who were dedicated to their work could indeed be seen as contributing to socialism . 
 To emphasize the contribution of women , the Five Good Family Campaign was introduced in 1956 to acknowledge efforts in areas such as education , managing the household , establishing connections with neighbors , keeping the house clean , and self @-@ improvement . Promoting this campaign and ideology was important to the ACWF , and it encouraged local chapters to form women ’ s congresses to spread the message . By 1953 , there were over 40 @,@ 000 officials working to spearhead local organizing campaigns . 
 Around 1957 , the ACWF entered a new phase , dropping " Democratic " from its name , as the federation was formally incorporated in the party structure . It entered the administrative hierarchy of the state , and declared itself a mass organization . Formal inclusion into the state apparatus altered some of the duties of the ACWF . The ACWF was now responsible for spreading political propaganda among women , guaranteeing the inclusion of women in political campaigns , marketing the campaigns to Chinese women , and organizing parades , meetings and demonstrations to encourage female participation in campaigning . The CPC sought to use the ACWF to promote its gender @-@ specific ideas and create a formal channel to mobilize women . The ACWF also established affiliations with other mass movements : The YWCA of China and the Women Personnel Section of the Trade Union . 
 In addition to this , the ACWF played an important role internationally for the CPC . As a communist country in the Cold War , China had difficulty establishing diplomatic connections . ACWF was able to reach out to women ’ s movements abroad , and even hosted 23 delegations from other parts of the world for the Asia Women ’ s Representative Conference in December 1949 . This enabled the PRC to go around the diplomatic blockade and forge connections with other countries . However , soon the Cultural Revolution would begin in China , which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies . 
 = = = 1966 – 1976 : The ACWF and the Cultural Revolution = = = 
 The women 's movement during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ( 1966 – 1976 ) , like other movements in this period , came to depend on the cult of Mao Zedong . During the Cultural Revolution , the women ’ s movement was viewed as bourgeois and reactionary since it had originated in the West . The ACWF shutdown in 1968 because it was considered anti @-@ revolutionary . The party argued that the women ’ s movement needed to be completely immersed in the revolutionary movement instead of harboring its own agenda . The offices of the ACWF were occupied by the army and many of the female cadres who had been involved with the women ’ s movement were sent to labor camps in the countryside . Women ’ s work ceased to function until the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976 . 
 The committee for the 4th National Women ’ s Congress met in 1976 , started rehabilitating many of the female cadres sent to the countryside , and reinstated the ACWF . The ACWF was completely reestablished in 1978 and soon it announced its support for the Four <unk> , Deng Xiaoping 's plan to modernize agriculture , national defense , industry and technology in China . The newly reformed ACWF was able to strengthen its ability to set up local chapters , but , while other federations were able to resume work in the early 1970s , he ACWF did not resume work on a national level until 1978 . 
 = = = 1976 – present : NGO status in the reform era = = = 
 Following the Cultural Revolution , the All @-@ China Women 's Federation began to prioritize protecting women ’ s rights and promoting equality over its responsibilities as an organ of the party . While the ACWF was responsible for communicating how the CPC had helped the women ’ s movement , they also began to critique the previous actions taken during the women ’ s movement as having been unsuccessful in the face of China ’ s dominant patriarchy . The ACWF increasingly studied women 's movements in other countries , and held debates that transcended the parameters set by the CPC . ACWF campaigns became more diverse as they attempted to meet the disparate needs of the urban population and the rural population . While the ACWF continues to toe the party line , it is no longer involved in mass political campaigns . The party officially declared the ACWF a supervisory body in the early 1990s , so the ACWF is responsible for analyzing that effectiveness of the government in promoting women 's rights . It was also approved to found for @-@ profit businesses in 1992 , so it less reliant on government financing , and more autonomous in setting its own agenda . 
 The new focus was on women 's self @-@ discovery ; and the ACWF launched the Four Self Campaign consisting of : self @-@ respect , self @-@ confidence , self @-@ improvement , and self @-@ reliance . An example of the ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China can be seen in the One @-@ Child Policy . The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content , but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women . In the end , the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country , to promote the One @-@ Child policy to the Chinese women , and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy . 
 The ACWF also expanded its legal training for cadres , strengthened its finances , became involved with gay rights , fought employment discrimination and female trafficking , and introduced legislation to meet the challenges faced by women . In 2000 , ACWF developed jobs for one million unemployed women by creating small economic ( for profit ) entities in which women can work as family service aides or in women 's service groups . The organization also helps China 's " leftover " women . These are women who remain unmarried after the age of 27 . ACWF offers them alternatives to marriage such as the opportunity to pursue an education . With these changes , the ACWF became less concerned with mobilizing grass roots organization , and focused on its role in setting the public discourse for the social and political issues of women . 
 By 1994 the organization had over 68 @,@ 000 branches and somewhere between 80 @,@ 000 and 90 @,@ 000 cadres . By 1995 the party declared the ACWF , at least nominally , a non @-@ governmental organization in response to criticism from women 's groups abroad . However , the international women 's movement questioned the validity of that declaration . While the federation expanded in size , it became increasingly difficult to continue to reach all Chinese women through traditional channels . Other NGOs appeared to fill some of the void , but many of those became incorporated within the federation to gain legitimacy . By the end of the 1990s there were 6 @,@ 386 women ’ s associations and recreational clubs under the ACWF umbrella . The ACWF continues to struggle to reach an increasingly diverse female population in China , to incorporate groups outside the ACWF umbrella , and to defend its NGO status .

 The main action of the All @-@ China Women 's Federation is <unk> <unk> ( women ’ s work ) . The federation currently has seven functional departments to carry out this work : the Department for Children , the International Liaison Department , the Department for Women ’ s Development , the Publicity Department , the Department for Women ’ s Rights and Interests , the Human Resources Development Department and the General Office . The ACWF maintains a strong connection to the CPC through the women ’ s committees in the government . These committees cover topics ranging from systems of education , science , arts and medicine . The party still does have direct control over some aspects of the ACWF through cadres , who work within the federation who may be receiving a government salary , and through the government 's power of promotion . The ACWF also has many affiliated organizations that expand its influence including : the China Women ’ s Development Foundation , Marriage and Family Magazine , the Legal Assistance Center of the ACWF , the China Women ’ s Activity Center , the China Women ’ s University , the China Women ’ s News , the China Women ’ s Publishing House , Women of China Magazine Publishing House . Many of these affiliated organizations help distribute information to the women of China . The ACWF has over 49 newspapers and magazines , and major debates about the women ’ s movement occur in its national journals the Women of China , Chinese Women ’ s Movements , and Collection of Women ’ s Studies .

 = = = = Interaction with the Communist Party = = = = 
 Though the All @-@ China Women 's Federation is officially labeled an NGO , its longstanding relationship with the CPC means that the party still has interests in the federation and its members . The four levels of the federation still coincide with the state administrative system . The highest ranking body of the ACWF is the National Congress of Women which meets every five years . The National Congress Women studies reports sent to them from the Executive Committee of the ACWF , decide the goals for the women ’ s movements , make changes to the constitution , and elect the Executive Committee and Standing Committees of the ACWF . Under this national level , the provincial level ’ s women ’ s congresses meet every three years to select their Executive and Standing Committees . However the local level must also carry out the directive and report to the CPC committee in addition to following the ACWF . This is supposed to give the organization a dual structure of carrying out party orders and informing the government of women ’ s interests . 
 = = = = Grass root versus upper levels of the ACWF = = = = 
 The All @-@ China Women 's Federation is run from the national level with the provincial , municipal , county , district and village levels below it . However it is considered a nominal hierarchical structure because the Party controls each level over and above the jurisdiction of the ACWF . Instead of direct control , the higher levels provide guidance , ideas , and trainings to the levels below it . Some members have complained that women trained by the party are promoted more rapidly than women trained by the ACWF . Due to this perceived promotion rate , the grass roots members are incentivized to follow the demands of the party instead of the demands of the ACWF . Other members of the ACWF believe that the grassroots structure is successfully in touch with the women they are working for since they are on the front lines of the movement , and see little problem with the disconnect between the upper levels of the party and grassroots levels . 
 = = = Relationship with the women ’ s movement = = = 
 One of the problems that the All @-@ China Women 's Federation has identified is that women in China do not understand the federation ’ s contributions , or its significance in the women ’ s movement . The members of the ACWF identified two potential sources for the lack of understanding . The first is that the ACWF has many roles and branch organizations which may be obscuring the contribution it is making . The second is that it has lacked consistency in how it has represented women , especially during its early years . Another problem facing the ACWF is its relationship with the international women ’ s movement . The relationship between the Marxist view of feminism and current international views on feminism are often viewed as contradictory . Marxism often labels feminist movements as bourgeois because it focuses on the betterment of only one segment of society instead of society as a whole , and states capitalism , not the patriarchy , is the creator of gender inequality . The ACWF struggles with how to engage both , sometimes denying to have borrowed anything from international feminism . 
 = = Challenges = = 
 = = = Cooperation with outside women ’ s groups = = = 
 The All @-@ China Women 's Federation is the largest women ’ s organization in China and the only women ’ s organization still in existence that appeared before the 1980s . However , the ACWF has recently been struggling to adequately represent a diverse range of women ’ s interest , and some critics believe that women ’ s growing needs ought to be represented by a more diverse group of organizations . Most women @-@ interest NGOs operating in China are currently listed under the ACWF and have sought a close relationship with the organization to gain legitimacy and protection . Some of the organizations that are listed outside the ACWF are run by women who are affiliated with the ACWF , so there is considerable overlap . New women 's groups have more freedom in exploring sensitive topics and alternative theories on gender because they are not affiliated with the government in any manner . The ACWF has encouraged some of these groups to form , and brought others under their umbrella , which extends the reach of the ACWF . However , given the limited resources available to the women ’ s movement , and the ACWF historically representing the only large organization , tensions exists between these women ’ s groups and the ACWF . 
 = = = NGO status = = = 
 The state officially labeled the All @-@ China Women 's Federation an NGO in 1995 . Yet how applicable the term NGO is to the ACWF has been contested , given the ACWF ’ s long and continuing relationship with the CPC . Some leaders in the women ’ s movement opposed the ACWF attending an NGO forum in Manila in 1993 because they did not believe that it met the criteria of an NGO . Even the ACWF hesitates using the term NGO within China because it has been linked to anti @-@ government groups , although it has embraced the title internationally . International donor agencies generally are more likely to work with NGO 's , so the classification of an NGO has helped the ACWF obtain financing from international organizations . Others believe that the ACWF classifies as an NGO because it has separated itself from the government in recent years , and still others believes that ACWF could be classified as a NGO if the definition was broadened .

 Aquemini is the third studio album by American hip hop duo OutKast , released on September 29 , 1998 through LaFace Records . The title is a portmanteau of the two performers ' Zodiac signs : Aquarius ( Big Boi ) and Gemini ( André 3000 ) , which is indicative of the album 's recurring theme of the differing personalities of the two members . The group recorded the majority of the album in Bobby Brown 's Bosstown Recording Studios and Doppler Studios , both in Atlanta , Georgia . 
 Released as the follow @-@ up to the duo 's 1996 album ATLiens , Aquemini expands on the previous record 's outer space @-@ inspired compositions by incorporating live instrumentation . The commercial success of ATLiens allowed for more creative freedom for the group , which led to the members self @-@ producing the majority of the tracks . The band employed a large number of musicians for the album , who frequently entered and exited the studio throughout the recording process and had a major influence on the writing development of the album 's songs . Lyrically , Aquemini explores various themes including human nature , addiction , and interpersonal relationships . 
 The album was certified platinum in November 1998 , only two months after its release , and was certified double platinum on July 2 , 1999 by the Recording Industry Association of America . Aquemini peaked at number two on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop charts . Four of the album 's tracks had already or would later become singles , although some were limited ( promotional ) releases and not available commercially . The record also received rave reviews from music critics , who praised the album 's musicality and unique lyrical themes . It was ranked at number 500 in the book version of Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .

 In 1994 , the American hip hop duo OutKast released their debut album , Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik , which was recorded when members Big Boi and André 3000 were eighteen years old . Bolstered by the success of the single " Player 's Ball " , the record established OutKast as prominent figures in the Southern hip hop scene . After the album was certified platinum , LaFace Records gave OutKast more creative control and advanced money for their 1996 follow @-@ up album ATLiens . On ATLiens , André 3000 and Big Boi abandoned the " hard @-@ partying playa characters " of their debut album in favor of personas that were more futuristic , and produced many of the songs on their own for the first time . Critics praised the group 's maturing musical style on the record , which debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and sold nearly 350 @,@ 000 copies in its first two weeks of release . The single " Elevators ( Me & You ) " reached number 12 and spent 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . 
 After the release of ATLiens , André 3000 entered a relationship with neo soul singer Erykah Badu , who was part of a burgeoning movement in the urban music scene described as " more bohemian than ghetto " . André 3000 adopted a more flamboyant style of dress during performances in promotion of ATLiens that included large glasses , blond wigs , and marching band uniforms . Badu gave birth to his first child in November 1997 , which presented new artistic inspiration for the rapper .

 Due to OutKast 's newfound commercial success and higher budget for the album , the group enjoyed a more relaxed schedule and " could really just live " at the studio . The duo and studio musicians lived and worked in the studio for weeks straight , with Big Boi noting , " It usually takes us two to three years to make a record because we take our time ; we ain 't giving you that fast food , trying to meet a deadline . It ain 't done until it 's done sonically . " For Aquemini , the duo used live instrumentation and improvisation , bringing a baby grand piano into the studio and hiring musicians who played " everything from stoner funk to prog rock " . Producer Neal H. Pogue recalled , " That was the beauty of making all those records - having musicians come in and out . It was almost like a Motown , that 's what we had . Or like a Stax Records thing . That 's what I loved about it . It brought back that whole feeling of making records . It was organic . " Much of the music on Aquemini was formulated during jam sessions , in which one musician would begin with creating a chord pattern and the rest would incorporate their instruments following that sequence . While recording Aquemini , André 3000 drew influence from reggae music and listened to Bob Marley constantly during the sessions . After the musical aspects of a song were developed , André 3000 and Big Boi would then create lyrics that they felt would fit with the tone of the song . 
 For the record , André 3000 did most of the album 's production , while Big Boi crafted hooks for the songs . André 3000 and producer Mr. DJ learned about beat creation through observing the members of Organized Noize at work , with Mr. DJ observing that despite André 3000 's normally frugal lifestyle , his enthusiasm for production led him to splurge on costly recording equipment . At one point , André 3000 attempted singing and modifying his voice with pitch @-@ correction equipment , but Big Boi warned him that this would alienate the group 's urban audience . Another point of contention was the order of the track listing ; Big Boi wanted to begin the album with " Y 'all Scared " while André 3000 and the other producers and musicians wanted the first track to be " Return of the G " , preferring that the record start with a song with just the duo as opposed to one with multiple collaborators . Big Boi missed his flight to attend the album mastering session and by the time he arrived , the others had already settled on a cohesive tracklist for the record . After a long , heated discussion , Big Boi eventually agreed to opening the album with " Return of the G " . The album features the song " West Savannah " , which had been recorded during the Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik sessions , and was included on Aquemini to give listeners a " bonus " that had sentimental value for the duo , as well as to pay homage to Big Boi 's family living in Savannah . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Big Boi described the music on the album as " very experimental " noting that it featured live instrumentation that included horns , guitar , piano , and harmonica . AllMusic 's Steve Huey detected the " ethereal futurism " of ATLiens in the music on Aquemini , but also noted that " more often Aquemini plants its feet on the ground for a surprisingly down @-@ home flavor " . He also observed a " Southern earthiness and simultaneous spirituality " in Organized Noize 's production work on the record . 
 Lyrically , much of Aquemini features introspection about the desolation of the human condition . <unk> themes addressed on the record include drug addiction , precarious relationships , and freedom from self @-@ inflicted struggles . Other subjects include excessive reliance on technology and the Atlanta club scene . On the record , the group often shifts between science fiction @-@ inspired topics and the harsh realities of urban life . Saul Austerlitz of the Yale Herald notes the central theme of the group 's " ability to move between two <unk> G @-@ funk glamorized by the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur and the group 's own spacier , more poetic excursions " in the album . Another theme is the duality of the two members and their differing personalities , with Big Boi as " the player " and Andre 3000 as " the poet " , according to the album 's cover . Big Boi generally covers the more conventional hip @-@ hop topics such as his childhood in the South and attractive women , while Andre 3000 discusses more unorthodox themes . In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s , OutKast did not tone down the regional qualities , like the harmonica break on " Rosa Parks " and distinctive Atlanta slang and diction throughout . The duo experimented with several delivery styles on the record , using " relaxed , hyper , distorted , speedy and conversational presentations . "

 Aquemini begins with the introductory track " Hold On , Be Strong " , which was written by session guitarist Donny Mathis and was originally a full song with verses , but the group preferred to only use the hook . André 3000 played a kalimba on the song after purchasing the instrument at a flea market , drawing inspiration from Earth , Wind & Fire . " Return of the G " addresses concerns from fans who felt that the group 's style had changed too drastically since the release of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik , as well as those who make poor decisions in order to keep their street credibility . When discussing the lyrical content of the song , André 3000 explained , " I was young and wilder and some of my fashion choices people didn 't accept at the time . I started getting flak from some people , so they were like , ' Either he 's gay or on drugs ' ... ' Return of the Gangsta ' was trying to give them a sense of , ' Hey , I 'm still a regular person . ' " " Rosa Parks " contains blues @-@ influenced guitar work and folksy harmonies that " announce OutKast 's distinctive style of Southern boogie . The groove goes into overdrive during a clapping , foot @-@ stomping breakdown funkified by a fierce harmonica as the kick drum pounds incessantly . " 
 The next track , " Skew It On the Bar @-@ B " features rapper Raekwon of the Wu @-@ Tang Clan and discusses the disappointment of the group 's debut album not achieving the coveted " five @-@ mic " rating from The Source : " I gotta hit the Source / I need my other half mic / because that <unk> was a classic right ? " . " Skew It On the Bar @-@ B " is followed by the title track , which has been compared to the music of soul singer Isaac Hayes . Pogue experimented with delays and echos in his production to make the song " dimensional , like you could actually put your hands through the song . " " Synthesizer " contains elements of electrofunk and features funk musician George Clinton . Emma Warren of The Guardian called the track " raw and woozy " , dubbing it the " weirdest moment of the record " . On " West Savannah " , Big Boi discusses his Southern roots , and references individuals who grew up outside of the South who fail to recognize different regional Southern identities by stating " You might call us country , but we 's only Southern " .

 " Da Art of <unk> ' ( Part 1 ) " tells the story of a self @-@ destructive childhood friend named Sasha Thumper who dies of a drug overdose . Commenting on the song 's lyrical content , author Mickey Hess remarks that André 3000 " manages to walk the fine line between emotionalism and masculinity by articulating this highly emotional narrative with an almost emotionless tone . " The next track , " Da Art of <unk> ' ( Part 2 ) " , is an apocalyptic song that represents the group 's vision of " the last song recorded in the world " , with André 3000 commenting , " I do remember thinking , ' What if it was the end of the world and we had to get to the Dungeon on some X @-@ Men superhero shit . I think I was vibing on some end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ world , last @-@ recorded @-@ song shit ' " . Following is " Mamacita " , which features Dungeon Crew rapper <unk> in a meditation on male @-@ female relationships , inspired by an ex @-@ girlfriend of André 3000 who began pursuing women after their breakup . " SpottieOttieDopaliscious " relates a story of ill @-@ fated romance , with André 3000 describing the infatuation during an encounter with a woman at a club and Big Boi noting the hopelessness of the relationship as the song progresses . 
 " Y 'all Scared " is a collaboration with three members of Goodie Mob and contains the chant " If you scared , say you scared " accompanied by prominent organ and guitar work . " Nathaniel " is an a capella rap by the group 's close friend who at the time was an inmate in a Georgia prison , and the song is a recording of an actual collect call during his time in jail . The track is an introduction to " Liberation " . The eight @-@ minute @-@ long " Liberation " combines a variety of musical styles , including gospel , jazz , blues , and world music . The song is notable for not including rapped vocals and instead features vocal alternations between singing and spoken word styles . Lyrically , the track utilizes images of slavery to symbolize artistic freedom and not being concerned with the opinions of the public and record labels . The album closes with " <unk> " , which features a fuzzy guitar riff and snippets from OutKast 's speech at the 1995 Source Awards in which the group emphasized the Southern hip @-@ hop scene as a legitimate subgenre .

 The group originally planned to create a film in conjunction with Aquemini , completing a script three months before the release of the record . OutKast met with MTV for the project , who , despite liking the idea for the film , hoped to instead buy the project and cast Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes instead , feeling they had more " star power . " Although the duo recalls being " heartbroken " at the time , André 3000 and Big Boi continued to work on ideas for a collaborative film , eventually resulting in the 2006 musical Idlewild starring the group . David Browne of The New York Times viewed the album art as an homage to blaxploitation films of the 1970s . The record 's title is a combination of the two members ' zodiac signs , with André 3000 being a Gemini and Big Boi being an Aquarius . 
 Aquemini debuted behind Jay @-@ Z 's Vol . 2 ... Hard Knock Life at number two on the Billboard Hot 200 , the same opening position of both ATLiens and the group 's next release , Stankonia . The record sold 227 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of release , ahead of A Tribe Called Quest 's The Love Movement and Lauryn Hill 's The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill . In Norway and Germany , the album peaked at numbers 39 and 66 , respectively . 
 In 1999 , civil rights activist Rosa Parks filed a lawsuit against OutKast for the song " Rosa Parks " , claiming that the song used her name without her permission , constituting false advertising and an infringement on her right to publicity , in addition to defamation of character . The lawsuit was dismissed on first amendment grounds that year by a federal judge , but the appeals court partially reinstated the suit in 2003 , stating that the group must have an artistic reason for titling the song with her name . The case was settled in 2005 with OutKast and LaFace Records agreeing to create educational programs to " enlighten today 's youth about the significant role Rosa Parks played in making America a better place for all races .

" Steve Jones of USA Today commented that the duo 's " molasses @-@ smooth raps speak to the stark realities of urban streets . " Tony Green of Spin said that although they are not as spiritual as Goodie Mob , Outkast 's " <unk> signifying " offers listeners more than simple musical pleasure and that they " have crafted some of the most seductive and <unk> textures .

" Braxton called Aquemini " a brilliant record " and commented that it " possesses an uncanny blend of sonic beauty , poignant lyricism and spirituality that compels without commanding " . 
 In a retrospective review , Tim Stelloh from PopMatters described the album as a " loud , unpretentious , eclectic kick in the ass " . He praised it for being " full of both fear and curiosity , and those emotions were channeled through its production . " Dave Hughes , writing in Slant Magazine , stated : " Ten years on , Aquemini is the single strongest aspect of one of the art form 's deepest benches . <unk> and more experimental than the pair 's early work , and focused enough to feel comfortable in a sprawl , it 's the moment when OutKast came fully into itself .

 = SM U @-@ 6 ( Austria @-@ Hungary ) = 
 SM U @-@ 6 or U @-@ VI was a U @-@ 5 @-@ class submarine or U @-@ boat built for and operated by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) before and during the First World War . The submarine was built as part of a plan to evaluate foreign submarine designs , and was the second of three boats of the class built by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume after a design by Irishman John Philip Holland . 
 U @-@ 6 was laid down in February 1908 and launched in June 1909 . The double @-@ hulled submarine was just over 105 feet ( 32 m ) long and displaced between 240 and 273 tonnes ( 265 and 301 short tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . U @-@ 6 's design had inadequate ventilation and exhaust from her twin gasoline engines often intoxicated the crew . The boat was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy in July 1910 , and served as a training boat — sometimes making as many as ten cruises a month — through the beginning of the First World War in 1914 . 
 The submarine had only one wartime success , which was sinking a French destroyer in March 1916 . Later that year , in May , U @-@ 6 became entangled in anti @-@ submarine netting deployed as part of the Otranto Barrage . Coming under fire from Royal Navy 's drifters running the nets , U @-@ 6 was abandoned and sunk . All of her crewmen were rescued and were held in captivity through the end of the war . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 U @-@ 6 was built as part of a plan by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy to competitively evaluate foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake , Germaniawerft , and John Philip Holland . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy authorized the construction of U @-@ 6 ( and sister ship , U @-@ 5 ) in 1906 by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume . The boat was designed by American John Philip Holland and licensed by Holland and his company , Electric Boat . U @-@ 6 was laid down on 21 February 1908 in the United States , partially assembled , and shipped to Whitehead 's for final assembly , a process which , author Edwin <unk> notes , " caused a lot of trouble " . She was launched at Fiume on 12 June 1909 . 
 U @-@ 6 's design featured a single @-@ hull with a tear @-@ drop shaped body that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines . She was 105 feet 4 inches ( 32 @.@ 11 m ) long by 13 feet 9 inches ( 4 @.@ 19 m ) abeam and had a draft of 12 feet 10 inches ( 3 @.@ 91 m ) . She displaced 240 tonnes ( 240 long tons ) surfaced , and 273 tonnes ( 269 long tons ) submerged . Her two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes featured unique , cloverleaf @-@ shaped design hatches that rotated on a central axis , and the boat was designed to carry up to four torpedoes . For surface running , U @-@ 6 was outfitted with 2 gasoline engines , but suffered from inadequate ventilation , which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew ; her underwater propulsion was by two electric motors . 
 = = Service career = = 
 U @-@ 6 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 1 July 1910 , with Linienschiffsleutnant Georg Ritter von Trapp in command . Over the next three years she served primarily as a training boat , making as many as ten training cruises per month . On 7 November 1911 , she hosted a Norwegian naval delegation that inspected her . On 26 June 1912 , U @-@ 6 was accidentally rammed by the submarine tender Pelikan while surfacing after a deep diving trial . 
 At the outbreak of World War I , U @-@ 6 was one of only four fully operational U @-@ boats in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy fleet , and was stationed at Cattaro by late 1914 . U @-@ 6 's activities over the early part of the war are not reported , but the boat 's armament was augmented by a 3 @.@ 7 cm / 23 ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) deck gun in December 1915 . Sister boat U @-@ 5 had her first radio receiver installed at the same time her deck gun was added , but it is not reported whether U @-@ 6 did , too . On 23 February 1916 , U @-@ 6 made an unsuccessful attack on an Italian Indomito @-@ class destroyer , but she then managed to torpedo and sink the French destroyer Renaudin on 18 March off Durazzo . Renaudin went down with 47 of her 83 @-@ man complement . 
 On the night of 12 May , U @-@ 6 headed out to try to intercept shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona . Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen , U @-@ 6 's commander since November 1915 , attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed a part of the Otranto Barrage . While submerged , von Falkhausen heard an unexplained noise on the hull of the boat , which was likely the sound of U @-@ 6 fouling one of the anti @-@ submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga . The drifter 's skipper was alerted to the submarine 's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired . Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II . In the meantime , von Falkhausen surfaced U @-@ 6 to try to cut loose the buoy being dragged behind his boat . When the hatch was opened , the crew discovered the boat entangled in the net . 
 Though unable to submerge , von Falkhausen attempted to flee on the surface , but the port propeller shaft became fouled . Realizing that he was stuck , and with Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II beginning to shell his boat , U @-@ 6 's captain ordered code books and confidential material thrown overboard and the submarine scuttled . U @-@ 6 's three officers and seventeen crewmen were all rescued , but spent the remainder of the war as prisoners of the Italians . In her career , U @-@ 6 sank one ship totaling 756 GRT .

He said , " The people at UMBC have been good to me , and this is my home ... these are my kids and I recruited them . I just didn 't think this was the right time to move . " UMBC granted Zimmerman a contract extension through the 2014 season . 
 In 2009 , UMBC captured its fifth consecutive outright or shared America East regular season title . In the conference semifinals , the Retrievers edged Binghamton , 9 – 8 . In the final , however , UMBC jumped out to an early lead over Albany and never relinquished it , and won , 15 – 7 . Zimmerman was named the 2009 America East Coach of the Year . In the first round of the NCAA tournament , the Retrievers faced sixth @-@ seeded North Carolina . UMBC entered the game with the number @-@ one ranked midfield in the nation , but it was lacking in depth , and the first @-@ string was thus forced to play most of the 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) game . The Retrievers led 8 – 6 at halftime , but North Carolina assumed control during the third period and went on to win , 15 – 13 . That season , The Baltimore Sun called Zimmerman " the best coach in college lacrosse . " 
 While coach at UMBC , Zimmerman has traveled to Japan , Argentina , and the United Kingdom in order to promote the sport of lacrosse . In 2002 , 2004 , and 2006 , UMBC hosted fall scrimmages against teams from Keio University . In the summer of 2005 , the Retrievers traveled to Japan . Regarding the possibility of the sport being a future Olympic event , Zimmerman said , " It ’ s incumbent upon us to introduce and develop the game when opportunities occur in order to reach that goal . " The Greater Baltimore Chapter of the United States Lacrosse Hall of Fame inducted Zimmerman on January 25 , 2003 .

 = Micky Adams = 
 Michael Richard " Micky " Adams ( born 8 November 1961 ) is an English former professional footballer turned football manager , who was most recently manager of League of Ireland Premier Division side Sligo Rovers . As a player he was a full back , and made a total of 438 league appearances in a nineteen @-@ year professional career in the Football League , including five years with Southampton at the highest level . He began his managerial career as player @-@ manager for Fulham in 1994 and has led several teams at varying levels with mixed success , being named Manager of the Season twice , sacked a number of times and earning four promotions for the teams he has managed . 
 Born in Sheffield , Adams was part of the youth team at Sheffield United from the age of twelve until released in 1977 . He turned professional at the Third Division team Gillingham in 1979 , where he established himself in the first team , winning a move in 1983 to Coventry City who were in the First Division . He spent four years at Coventry before being sold on to Leeds United in 1987 . He was bought by Southampton for £ 250 @,@ 000 in 1989 , where he enjoyed five years of top @-@ flight football . He was loaned out to Stoke City in 1994 , before he signed with Fulham later in the year . Appointed as Fulham 's player @-@ manager in March 1996 , he led the club out of the Third Division in 1996 – 97 , and was named as the Third Division Manager of the Season . Sacked by Fulham despite his success , he walked out on Swansea City after less than two weeks in charge , and instead took charge at Brentford in November 1997 . He was sacked after the club were relegated at the end of the season . At this point he ended his playing career . 
 He joined Nottingham Forest as assistant manager , taking charge for one Premier League game in a caretaker capacity . He returned to management with Brighton & Hove Albion in April 1999 . He led the club to the Third Division title in 2000 – 01 , winning the division 's Manager of the Season award for a second time . He then moved to Leicester City as an assistant , before finally being named as the club 's manager in April 2002 . He took the club to the Premier League as First Division runners @-@ up in 2002 – 03 , though he tendered his resignation in October 2004 , having failed to keep the club in the top @-@ flight . He took charge at former club Coventry City in January 2005 , though lost his job in January 2007 . He returned to Brighton in May 2008 , though his second spell in charge would only last nine months . He was appointed as manager of Port Vale in June 2009 , before he departed for Sheffield United in December 2010 . He failed to prevent United being relegated into League One , and was sacked in May 2011 ; this enabled him to return to Port Vale as manager . Despite starting the season in administration , he led Vale to promotion into League One in 2012 – 13 . He resigned as Vale manager in September 2014 , and took charge at Tranmere Rovers the following month . He left Tranmere with the club bottom of the Football League in April 2015 . He was appointed manager of Irish side Sligo Rovers for a three @-@ month spell starting in August 2015 . 
 He has been married twice and has four daughters and one son .

 Adams was born in Sheffield , South Yorkshire , and was an associate schoolboy with Sheffield United from the age of twelve , where his boyhood idol was Tony Currie . He was a favourite of manager Jimmy Sirrel , though Adams was released from the youth set @-@ up a few months after Harry Haslam replaced Sirrel as manager in September 1977 . 
 = = = Gillingham = = = 
 United 's youth team coach John Shaw also left the club and became a coach at Gillingham , and so Adams then travelled 240 miles out from home to join Gillingham as an apprentice in August 1978 . During his time as an apprentice he won four caps for the England youth team , and competed in a tournament in Yugoslavia . He went on to sign as a professional at Gillingham in November 1979 . Due to his natural pace , Adams started his playing career as a left @-@ winger before being converted into a left @-@ back after he was found to lack the technical skill necessary to beat opponents . Coming through the club 's ranks at the same time as Steve Bruce , Adams later cited Buster Collins as a major influence upon his career . In 1982 – 83 he was named in the PFA 's Third Division Team of the Year . 
 = = = Coventry City and Leeds United = = = 
 After 103 appearances for Third Division Gillingham he moved on to top @-@ flight Coventry City in 1983 for a fee approaching £ 85 @,@ 000 . He struggled with injury during his time at Highfield Road , and was never popular with the fans . Keith Houchen also recalled that he did not get along with manager John Sillett and was prone to sulking when left out of the team . Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over a four @-@ year period before Leeds United manager Billy Bremner took him to the Second Division for a £ 110 @,@ 000 fee . Near the end of his first season at Leeds he played in the club 's FA Cup Semi @-@ final defeat to former club Coventry at Hillsborough , as Coventry won 3 – 2 in extra time . Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 by losing the play @-@ off Final to Charlton Athletic , again after extra time . 
 = = = Southampton = = = 
 His return to First Division football came in March 1989 when Southampton offered Leeds £ 250 @,@ 000 for his services . Adams made his debut for the " Saints " on 25 March 1989 , taking Derek Statham 's place at left @-@ back in a 3 – 1 defeat by Arsenal . Adams retained his place for the next seven games , before losing out to Gerry Forrest for the last few matches of the season . Adams played the first seven matches of the 1989 – 90 season before losing his place through injury to Francis <unk> , who then began to form a useful full @-@ back partnership with Jason Dodd . In April 1990 , Adams was recalled alongside new signing <unk> <unk> and they played out the remainder of the season together . 
 Adams began to establish himself as the first @-@ choice left @-@ back at the start of the 1990 – 91 season , partnered first by <unk> and then Dodd , and finally by Barry Horne on the right . Once he had overcome the niggling injuries of his first two seasons at The Dell , Adams ' consistency began to ensure that the left @-@ back position was more or less his own , with his energetic forays along the touchline helping to give the side an extra cutting edge . His first goals for the Saints came in the 1991 – 92 season against Everton , Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United . Against West Ham on 14 April 1992 , he scored the only goal with a far @-@ post volley in the 88th minute after Matthew Le Tissier had created space to whip over a cross : the goal was described as " a moment of true class in an otherwise ordinary game " . 
 During the inaugural season of the Premier League , Adams missed only four games , making 38 appearances with four goals , with his right @-@ wing partner now being Jeff Kenna , with manager Ian Branfoot playing Dodd and <unk> further forward . He wrote himself into the history books , for all the wrong reasons , when he was sent off for dissent on 19 August 1992 against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road , during the second game of the season . His was the first ever red card in the Premiership . The 1993 – 94 Premiership season was Adams ' last in the top flight ; he started the season as the preferred choice at left @-@ back before losing out to Simon Charlton . He featured in 19 out of 42 league games that season as Southampton finished 18th and narrowly avoided relegation . His final game for Southampton came in a 1 – 0 defeat at home to Norwich City , immediately following which Branfoot was sacked as manager , to be replaced by Alan Ball . Adams never played under Ball and was loaned out to Stoke City in March 1994 until the end of the season . He scored three goals in ten games for the " Potters " , but did not join the club on a permanent basis as the management staff refused to allow him to help out as a coach at the club 's academy . In his five years with Southampton , Adams made a total of 174 first @-@ team appearances , scoring seven goals . 
 = = = Fulham = = = 
 In July 1994 , he joined Fulham on a free transfer where he was reunited with Ian Branfoot in preparation for the " Cottagers " 1994 – 95 season . Fulham had just been relegated to Division Three ( the bottom tier of the professional league ) for the first time in their history . He signed with the club on the understanding that Branfoot would teach him the ropes of coaching . They finished seventh in the league that season , but due to a restructuring of the league which saw one less promotion place in the three lower divisions , Fulham missed out on a play @-@ off place . When Branfoot became general manager in March 1996 , Adams was appointed player @-@ manager of a Fulham side on course for their lowest ever finish – 17th in Division Three . 
 = = Managerial career = = 
 Before going into management , the " straight @-@ talking Yorkshireman " had already demonstrated his ability to spot talented youngsters . Around 1994 , he spotted Wayne Bridge playing for Olivers Battery ; he recommended Bridge to Southampton , who then signed him as a trainee in July 1996 . 
 = = = Fulham = = = 
 Adams moved into management with Fulham , taking over from Ian Branfoot in March 1996 with the London club languishing in 91st place in the league pyramid . After he had helped the club avoid non @-@ league football , Fulham were promoted to Division Two as runners @-@ up in the following season 's final table , and Adams was given the Third Division Manager of the Season award . He built his side on free transfers and small fees , installing belief and self @-@ confidence in the players at his disposal rather than spending big money . The highest fee he spent on a player during his reign was £ 200 @,@ 000 for former " Saints " teammate Paul Moody . 
 Following Mohamed Al @-@ Fayed 's takeover of Fulham , Adams was dismissed as manager in September 1997 in favour of the higher profile combination of Kevin Keegan ( director of football ) and Ray Wilkins ( head coach ) . 
 " I have to say that it was probably the right decision because look where they are now . All Mr Fayed has to say is ' there 's my record ' . At the time getting rid of me was a harsh decision . A director at the club told me I was going to be the Alex Ferguson of Fulham . I signed a five @-@ year contract ... and four months later I was sacked . " 
 = = = Swansea to Brentford to Nottingham = = = 
 Shortly after his dismissal from Fulham , Adams made a quick return to management with Swansea City in Division Three , but left after thirteen days and three matches in charge . Adams claimed that the money he had been promised to strengthen the team had not been forthcoming . 
 Before 1997 was out , Adams took his third job of the 1997 – 98 season when he was named manager of Brentford . The club had suffered a slump in league form after losing the previous season 's Division Two play @-@ off final , and were struggling near the foot of the table . He signed striker Andy Scott from Sheffield United for a fee of £ 75 @,@ 000 , as well as signing Glenn Cockerill as player / assistant manager , Warren Aspinall and loanee Nigel <unk> . However injuries began to mount , with <unk> Anderson , Derek Bryan and Ricky Reina all sidelined . Adams was named as Second Division Manager of the Month for March after overseeing three wins and two draws . Despite Adams ' efforts , Brentford were relegated to Division Three on the last day of the season , and the club was bought out by Ron Noades , who installed himself as the new Brentford manager . 
 After taking a break from the game , Adams joined Nottingham Forest as assistant manager under Dave Bassett . Bassett was dismissed in January 1999 and so Adams took charge as caretaker manager for a single Premiership match , before Ron Atkinson was appointed as Bassett 's replacement . 
 = = = Brighton & Hove Albion = = = 
 Adams returned to management in April 1999 with Division Three team Brighton & Hove Albion . The club were in the middle of a financial crisis , which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground just to stay afloat ; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status . His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th , whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora . The £ 100 @,@ 000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad . 
 In his second season as manager , 2000 – 01 , Adams guided Brighton to promotion as Division Three champions after the club had spent five seasons in the league 's basement division . A late chase for the title proved to be unnecessary , as high flying Chesterfield were deducted nine points for financial irregularities , leaving Brighton ten points clear at the season 's end . He was named as Third Division Manager of the season for a second time , also picking up the Third Division Manager of the Month award in September 2000 . 
 Adams was clear about his ambitions at managing at a higher level , stating his disappointment at not being offered the management positions at either Southampton or West Ham United in the summer of 2001 . He did leave " Seagulls " in October 2001 , though by then he had already set the foundations for Brighton to achieve a second successive promotion as Division Two champions in 2001 – 02 . Over the summer he had brought in players such as Simon Morgan , Geoff Pitcher , Robbie Pethick and Dirk Lehmann , to give Brighton depth . 
 = = = Leicester City = = = 
 In October 2001 Adams left Brighton to become assistant manager to Dave Bassett at Leicester City . Peter Taylor , the former Leicester manager , was drafted in to complete Brighton 's promotion campaign . Adams chose the move in an attempt to get closer to his dream of managing a Premiership club . He understood that Bassett was to move ' upstairs ' at the end of the season , leaving Adams free to take the management job for 2002 – 03 . 
 Adams spent six months working under Bassett , during which time Leicester were almost permanently stuck to the bottom of the Premier League table . In March 2002 he demanded the management position for the next season , though he later apologised for his comments and insisted he was happy working under Bassett , and had no regrets about leaving Brighton . The next month , just before relegation was confirmed , Adams was promoted to the manager 's seat while Bassett became Director of Football . Adams said : " I 'm not expecting to produce a miracle , I 'm still working with the same group of players " . 
 In July 2002 he appointed Alan Cork as his number two . Losing just one of their opening eleven games , his side made an excellent start to the campaign , seeing Adams rewarded with the Manager of the Month award for September 2002 . Despite Leicester going into receivership with debts of £ 30 million and being banned from the transfer market until a takeover was completed , Adams was able to guide them to promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt — they ended the 2002 – 03 season as Division One runners @-@ up behind champions Portsmouth . At the end of the campaign he signed a new three @-@ year contract . 
 " I have a lot of respect for Micky Adams , who has proved himself at all levels . He has gone into clubs with little or no money to spend and shown he is not afraid of taking on tough jobs . I wish him well in the future , because he is one of the brightest young managers in the game . " 
 He was in charge for the first game at the Walkers Stadium . Despite a good start to their campaign , the club fell into the relegation zone in the new year . Adams was clearly resentful of lucrative long term contracts dealt out to his less talented players by previous managers , which restricted his ability to bring in fresh faces to boost their campaign . Leicester slipped back down again in 2003 – 04 to 18th place , bracketed together with the two other relegated sides — Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers — whose goal difference was inferior to Leicester 's . The " Foxes " were becoming a " yo @-@ yo club " and Adams blamed this on a lack of investment . During March 2004 nine Leicester players were arrested for various offences related to a drunken outing that ended with an alleged sexual assault on three German tourists , with three players being charged : Paul Dickov , Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie . The three faced up to fourteen years in prison if found guilty of rape , and the trio 's bail totalled £ 196 @,@ 500 . The club had already been rocked by various incidents on overseas tours over years , with Stan Collymore arrested for setting off a fire extinguisher in 2000 , and Dennis Wise breaking Callum Davidson 's jaw in a row over a card game in 2002 . Adams had previously initiated a crackdown in club discipline , going so far as to enforce random breathalyser tests . Adams said that " in a lot of people 's eyes , the players are guilty before they have had a fair trial – which is not the case " . The incident also cast doubt over Adams ' future at the club , as reports surfaced that he planned to quit the club . He did in fact offer his resignation , which was rejected by the club . However he kept faith in his players ' innocence , and claimed " if they are guilty of anything it is of being unprofessional – of being drunk to excess " . His faith was later vindicated when it transpired that all allegations against the players were false . 
 The club lost their talismanic Turk Muzzy Izzet in the summer of 2004 . Adams had previously stated his concern that they would be unable to regain their top tier status before he resigned as Leicester manager in October 2004 , after a poor start to the Championship campaign dashed the club 's hopes of an instant return to the Premiership . 
 " This is a very sad day for Leicester City Football Club . Everyone connected with the club wanted Micky to stay and we did our utmost to try to persuade him to change his mind . " 
 = = = Coventry City = = = 
 In January 2005 , Adams made a return to management in the Championship with struggling Coventry City , a club he had been at during his playing career . Adams managed to save the club from relegation by the end of the season , winning the Football League Championship Manager of the Month award for April in the process . 
 He was expected by some to mount a challenge for promotion to the Premiership in 2005 – 06 , which was the club 's first season in the new Ricoh Arena . The team started out poorly , but improved in the second half of the season to rise up the table , with Adams making an inspired signing in Dennis Wise . However , despite excellent home form , he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th , missing out on a play @-@ off place by only two league places , though several points adrift of that year 's standard . 
 He spent £ 300 @,@ 000 on midfielder Chris Birchall for the start of the 2006 – 07 season . His team started well , however mid @-@ way through the campaign , following a run of five games without defeat , Coventry suddenly and unexpectedly hit a bad run of form . A 5 – 0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion began a sequence of eight games without a win , including six defeats . This culminated in a 2 – 0 home defeat to Bristol City in the FA Cup , a game which also saw a record low attendance at the Ricoh Arena . On 17 January 2007 , the day after the cup exit , the club parted company with Adams , with Coventry lying 16th in the Championship . Adams stated that he intended to return to management as soon as possible . He admitted that the sale of Gary <unk> to Birmingham City had been a turning point in the club 's season , but also said that " I genuinely believe that I could have turned it around " and " I tried my best and that 's all I can do . " 
 " We are committed to our three @-@ year quest to get Coventry City back into the Premiership and believe that tough decisions like this will sometimes be needed to fulfil that aim as is sadly the case today . 
 = = = Colchester and return to Brighton = = = 
 In July 2007 , Adams was appointed by Colchester United as assistant manager to Geraint Williams , replacing Mick Harford who had left the previous month . He subsequently left this role in January 2008 , stating that he wanted to return to management . 
 In May 2008 , Adams returned to the helm at Brighton & Hove Albion , supplanting Dean Wilkins . He brought in former Wales international Robbie Savage and future Premier League midfielder Bradley Johnson in on loan . On 2 February 2009 , he spent £ 150 @,@ 000 on defender James McNulty and signed striker Craig Davies for an undisclosed fee ; however 19 days later Adams left the club by " mutual consent " , ( although he had stated he wished to stay ) due to poor team performances . He later acknowledged that it had been a mistake to return to Brighton , and that he should have instead sought a fresh opportunity elsewhere . 
 = = = Port Vale = = = 
 Adams was announced as manager of Port Vale in June 2009 , having been a late applicant for the post vacated by Dean Glover . However " legal complications " meant he would only sign a contract nearly two months later . Chairman Bill Bratt stated that Adams ' first goal would be to stabilise the club , following the " Valiants " fall from the second tier to near the bottom of the Football League within ten years . He made his first signing on 15 June , bringing in 21 @-@ year @-@ old midfielder Tommy Fraser , who had played for Adams at Brighton . After confirming the signing of Adam Yates , who was linked to the club before his arrival , Adams signed Doug Loft , who had also played under him at Brighton . On 21 July , Adams had appointed veteran striker Geoff Horsfield as player @-@ assistant manager . 
 He led the Vale to victory over Championship sides Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday in the opening rounds of the League Cup . However following a period of three defeats in seven days , Adams decided to place his whole squad on the transfer list , saying of his team 's performance : " We looked like a woman who had a big fur coat on but underneath she ’ s got no knickers on . " It was a controversial move , one that divided opinion among analysts and fans , also bringing the fourth tier club to national attention . He later admitted he merely played " a psychological game with them ... [ and ] I don 't think they fell for it – I don 't think anybody fell for it " . Three wins – including a cup win over League One Stockport County and a league win at local rivals Crewe Alexandra – and three draws within four weeks saw Adams nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for October 2009 . In the January 2010 transfer window he signed winger Lewis Haldane permanently , and took winger Sean Rigg and striker Craig Davies on loan . Adams ' men stormed into the play @-@ off places for the first time in the season with just two games left to play , following a 2 – 1 win over champions @-@ elect Notts County . Yet with just one point from their final two games , the Vale finished the season in 10th place . 
 In building for the 2010 – 11 season , Adams released nine players , and signed Sean Rigg , Stuart Tomlinson , Justin Richards , Ritchie Sutton and Gary Roberts . The season began similarly to the previous campaign , with a 3 – 1 win at Championship side Queens Park Rangers in the League Cup First Round , new signing Richards scoring twice . Five wins in five for September saw Adam 's gifted the League Two Manager of the Month award , his team also boasting five clean sheets . He was also handed the award for November , after his team advanced into the Third Round of the FA Cup and rose to the top of the League Two table on the back of five clean sheets in seven games . Departing for his boyhood club at the end of December 2010 , he left the club in second position in League Two . 
 = = = Sheffield United = = = 
 In December 2010 , following Gary Speed 's departure from the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales , Adams was one of a handful of names linked to the vacant position at United . On Christmas Eve , Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had " reluctantly " given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United . Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position , and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation , to then challenge for promotion , and finally " to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team " . Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant , Cork had worked as Adams ' assistant at Fulham , Swansea , Leicester and Coventry . The fourth manager at the club that season , he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed . As Adams explained : " When you 're manager at Port Vale you probably get three calls a day and one of those is from the wife asking me what time I 'm coming home for my tea . " His honeymoon period dissipated quickly , as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge ( four draws and seven defeats ) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two @-@ goal lead to lose 3 – 2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United . Adams told the press that " The fans were singing ' you 're not fit to wear the shirt ' , I cannot disagree with them . That is as disappointing a result as I have ever had in my career . " It took three months before he achieved his first win . The victory came on 8 March 2011 ( his fourteenth game in charge ) , as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2 – 1 . Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season , finishing six points short of safety . Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe . McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a " clean sweep at the top and start afresh " ; whilst Adams said that whilst he was " very , very disappointed with the decision ... I am a Blade and will always be a Blade . " 
 = = = Return to Port Vale = = = 
 After losing his job at Bramall Lane , he was immediately offered a three @-@ year contract at former club Port Vale . He signed the contract within days , saying it was time to " finish the job I started " . Upon hearing the news , star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club , and promptly signed a two @-@ year deal as player @-@ coach . In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club 's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed . His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson . He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season , and signing Walsall centre @-@ half Clayton McDonald , left @-@ back Mike Green , and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe . Days before the start of the season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion , and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope , also a free transfer signing . After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals – both scoring and conceding – Adams decided to give his players " a kick up the backside " by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers ( on loan ) and Robert <unk> . He stepped down as a director on 5 November , the day of his 100th game in charge at Port Vale , after former director Stan <unk> withdrew the £ 50 @,@ 000 sponsorship he had provided to keep Adams on the board of directors . 
 His team exited the three cup competitions at the First Round in 2011 – 12 , and after losing to non @-@ league Grimsby Town in the FA Cup in a run of five games without a win – which included 388 minutes without scoring a goal – he signed Guy Madjo , Jennison Myrie @-@ Williams and Shane O 'Connor on loan . These proved to be inspired signings , as a Madjo hat @-@ trick meant that the two Stevenage loanees scored a total of five goals between them in their first three games . However , in December he admitted that the club 's off @-@ the @-@ field issues were a cause of concern for him and that he was being " kept very much in the dark . " Nominated for the Manager of the Month award for three wins in four December games , Adams revealed that due to the club 's precarious financial position he was unable to sign any new players or even retain his loan players in the January transfer window – despite the chairman having previously told him to draw up a list of transfer targets . He did though manage to sign Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall on non @-@ contract terms . He would also have signed Chris Birchall , however before the deal was finalised the Football League placed the club under a transfer embargo after a tax bill went unpaid . The club were unable to pay the player 's wages in February . The club entered administration on 9 March , ending what had been a genuine push for promotion ; talks between the administrator and Adams did not seem constructive , as Adams told the press that he was " taking legal advice " . However he stayed put , and steered the " Valiants " to a 12th @-@ place finish ; they would have been only 3 points off the play @-@ offs had the club not entered administration . In May , he was linked with the vacant management position at Gillingham , with his friendship with " Gills " chairman Paul Scally cited in his favour in media reports . 
 With the club still unable to sign new players due to administration in May 2012 , Adams offered contracts to 16 of his players for the 2012 – 13 campaign . However he lost four of his best players in Lee Collins , Anthony Griffith , Sean Rigg , and captain and top @-@ scorer Marc Richards ; all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere , leaving Adams needing to rebuild the team largely from scratch . He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie @-@ Williams from Stevenage , Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent , Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal , Crewe Alexandra centre @-@ back David <unk> , and former Wales international Richard Duffy . He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012 , after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the Football League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration @-@ hit club to second in the league . New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players : striker Lee Hughes , midfielder Chris Birchall , and centre @-@ back Darren Purse . Other signings included left @-@ back Daniel Jones , centre @-@ back Liam Chilvers , striker Calvin Andrew , and midfielder Sean McAllister . However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games , and Adams claimed that " idiots " in a " certain section of the crowd " were giving him " personal " abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons . Vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion , finishing as the division 's top @-@ scorers as wingers Jennison Myrie @-@ Williams and Ashley Vincent provided quality service to prolific striker Tom Pope throughout the campaign . 
 In preparation for League One football , Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed to replace the departing Ashley Vincent . He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson , midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith , and forward Gavin Tomlin . On 22 September , Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery . The club overstretched itself financially , meaning that as they lay outside the play @-@ offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan . Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place – far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation . During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training , and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one @-@ year rolling contract . He signed the contract the following month . 
 After eleven players left the club in 2014 , Adams rebuilt for the 2014 – 15 campaign by signing left @-@ sided player Colin Daniel , Northern Ireland internationals Ryan McGivern and Michael O 'Connor , pacey winger Mark Marshall , Crewe Alexandra attacker Byron Moore , veteran midfielder Michael Brown , and midfielder Steve Jennings , and also took in three loanees in Swiss full @-@ back Freddie <unk> , highly rated striker Jordan Slew and French target man Achille Campion . Defeat to local rivals Crewe Alexandra marked the club 's fifth consecutive loss , and after the game Adams accepted that his position would be under threat if results did not turn around quickly . Following six straight defeats Adams resigned as manager on 18 September after lengthy discussions with the chairman .
