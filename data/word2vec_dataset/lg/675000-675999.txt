 The Pigeon River forms the border between Minnesota and Ontario in this area . The first 32 km ( 20 mi ) of the river is crooked , swift , interrupted by rapids and falls , and flows in places through a steep @-@ walled canyon . The High Falls are 37 m ( 120 ft ) high and presents an impassable obstacle to river travel . The Cascade Falls are further up the river . The soft shale erodes easily , leaving the Logan and Pigeon River <unk> which create the waterfalls and cascades . 
 A portage was necessary from the shore of Lake Superior past the High Falls . Southwest of the mouth of the Pigeon River is Grand Portage Bay ; about 1 @.@ 6 km ( 1 @.@ 0 mi ) inland there is a gap through the surrounding hills and bluffs which provides a gradual ascent to Cascade Falls . The river is navigable by canoe beyond the Cascade Falls . The Sioux and Chippewa created a 14 @.@ 5 km ( 9 @.@ 0 mi ) long portage from Grand Portage Bay to bypass the three falls and several kilometers of turbulent river up to the Cascade Falls , probably by following animal trails . The French called this trail the Great Portage because it was so long . 
 The first @-@ known non @-@ native visitors were French @-@ speaking people from France and eastern Canada who started to explore the area in about 1655 . They were looking for the Northwest Passage and to trade for furs , particularly beaver pelts . Beaver pelts were in demand for European fashion during the 17th and 18th centuries . The Grand Portage was on the major fur trade route of the 18th century and was the first of more than 40 portages along the fur trade route . The French @-@ Canadian voyageurs would carry two 40 kg ( 88 lb ) packs from the main storage depot at Grand Portage Bay along the trail to their smaller storage depot at Fort Charlotte ; it took a few hours . In 1784 Grand Portage Bay became the headquarters for the North West Company . The post was abandoned in 1803 when the North West Company moved north . 
 = = Present @-@ day topography = = 
 In Ontario , the shales and greywackes from the Rove Formation of the Animikie Group are overlain by a 60 m ( 200 ft ) cap of diabase . This diabase cap is a sill remnant , and most of the diabase is covered by a considerable thickness of mineral soil . The mesa at Russell Point ( about 16 km ( 10 mi ) south of Thunder Bay ) is a Logan sill of diabase over the softer Rove Formation metasediments . It is one of the many flat @-@ topped , steep @-@ sided mesas along Lake Superior 's northwestern shore south of Thunder Bay that are collectively known as the Nor <unk> Mountains . 
 In Minnesota , the Rove Formation area shows a relationship of bedrock to topography , with its valley @-@ and @-@ ridge landscape . There are several series of steep , east @-@ west oriented valleys which were created by the erosion of the exposed shale . The diabase @-@ capped ridges between the valleys slope gently to the south ( 4 ° to 15 ° from the horizontal ) ; the northern faces are precipitous ; they rise 60 to 140 m ( 200 to 460 ft ) above deep , cold lakes , creating an asymmetrical cross @-@ section profile . The asymmetrical cross section of the ridges is the result of bands of massive , poorly jointed rock alternating with highly jointed rock units . The valleys contain glacially quarried bedrock lakes ; they are also asymmetrical in cross section because of the same structural elements which control the ridge shapes . Most of the lakes show an asymmetrical bottom configuration , showing a steep subaqueous slope on the south shore . The northern @-@ facing cliffs provide the habitat for a few species of endangered flora . The Rove Formation has landscape features that are not found elsewhere in Minnesota . 
 Most of the valleys are occupied by chains of elongate lakes , many of which are bordered by solid rock on all sides . Many of the east @-@ west valleys terminate abruptly at either one or both ends when the bordering sills merge . The elevation of the lakes ranges from Rose Lake 's 465 m ( 1 @,@ 526 ft ) to Loon Lake 's 532 m ( 1 @,@ 745 ft ) above sea level . Lakes on the opposite sides of a single ridge may differ in surface elevation by as much as 60 m ( 200 ft ) . Many of the rock @-@ bound lakes have a depth of about 30 m ( 100 ft ) ; a few are deeper than 61 m ( 200 ft ) . 
 A topographic map shows that the majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley @-@ and @-@ ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota ; the border of the landscape is the Minnesota @-@ Canadian border . This border is composed of the Pigeon River , and these Rove Formation lakes ( going east to west ) : South Fowl , North Fowl , Moose , Mountain , <unk> , Rose , South , Little North and Gunflint . The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes . The only Rove @-@ typical east @-@ west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes . 
 The preglacial drainage pattern was controlled by the rock structure . Ver <unk> reconstructed a preglacial drainage pattern that shows major streams flowing east in the slate belts . Short tributaries and short north @-@ south segments of the major streams cut across ridges which formed small gaps that are still present . 
 The Laurentian Continental Divide is within the formation . Between North Lake , Ontario , and South Lake , Minnesota , is a low saddle of land right on the border ; this is the divide . North Lake drains into the Rainy River and then to Hudson Bay . South Lake drains into the Pigeon River and then to Lake Superior . 
 <unk> are thin and poor because the glaciers had abraded down to the bedrock . The soils are clayey silt . 
 = = Endangered flora = = 
 Topographically this is the Rove Slate Bedrock Complex <unk> Association . The sedimentary and diabase rocks are calcareous ; they produce a more basic , nutrient @-@ rich soil compared to the poorer soils typical of the Canadian shield . The Royal River drains Royal Lake [ which is about 1 @.@ 2 km ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) east of South Fowl Lake ] into John Lake , both in Minnesota . The relatively rich soils , particularly in the Royal River drainage area , along with steep , moist , north @-@ facing cliffs provide the habitat for these rare plants . For over a century this <unk> association has been recognized as being ecologically and botanically unique ; it harbors a rare assemblage of plants , including the rarest plants in Minnesota . Virtually all of the known sensitive plant species in this landscape association occur on the north side of the cliffs or in the Royal River drainage . 
 Six vascular plants are unique in that they are at the extreme edge of their range or are disjunct from the main range of their species . They are the <unk> spleenwort ( Asplenium <unk> L. ) , in Minnesota six small populations of 20 to 40 plants have been found in the Rove area ; Ross 's ( or Short ) sedge ( Carex rossii ) , only three populations are known to exist in the Rove area ; Large @-@ leaved <unk> ( <unk> macrophylla or Arenaria macrophylla ) , evidence indicates that this is a very rare species with limited distribution and restrictive environmental needs ; Sticky <unk> ( <unk> borealis var. <unk> ) , is restricted to a single cliff in Cook County ; <unk> saxifrage ( Saxifraga paniculata ssp. neogaea ) , 11 populations are known to exist in the Rove formation ; and Smooth Woodsia ( Woodsia <unk> ) , there are small , isolated populations in the Rove Formation . 
 During two sensitive plant surveys conducted in June and July 2003 , and July 2004 , a Superior National Forest sensitive plant , Canada Yew ( Taxus canadensis ) , was found ; and a state @-@ listed species of concern , Blunt @-@ fruited sweet <unk> ( <unk> depauperata ) , has only four populations within 30 km ( 19 mi ) of each other . Minnesota 's Department of Natural Resources lists these vascular plants as being threatened : Rocky Mountain <unk> ( Woodsia <unk> ssp. <unk> ) , there are few isolated populations in the formation ; and <unk> 's rock @-@ cress ( <unk> <unk> or Arabis <unk> var. <unk> ) , rare in Ontario and Minnesota . Minnesota 's Department of Natural Resources lists the <unk> saxifrage ( Saxifraga <unk> ) as endangered , one source refers it to being " very rare " and that Cook County has Minnesota 's single colony with about a dozen plants – the entire population occupies less than a 1 m2 ( 1 sq yd ) – so it is vulnerable to singular events which would alter its habitat . 
 = International Speedway Corporation = 
 International Speedway Corporation ( ISC ) is a corporation whose primary business is the ownership and management of NASCAR and IndyCar race tracks . ISC was founded by NASCAR founder Bill France , Sr. in 1953 for the construction of Daytona International Speedway and in 1999 they merged with Penske Motorsports to become one of the largest motorsports companies in North America . The company has played an important , though controversial , role in the modernization of the sport . It has worked with NASCAR to create new tracks and update older ones in an effort to improve the racing and the experience for spectators ( though because both companies have several members of the France family in top positions , ISC 's competitors have filed multiple lawsuits on antitrust grounds ) and has constructed popular new tracks in regions previously thought uninterested in NASCAR . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Bill France Racing = = = 
 International Speedway Corporation ( ISC ) was founded as Bill France Racing , Inc . ( later Daytona International Speedway Corporation ) in 1953 and in 1957 the company signed a contract for the use of land on which to build Daytona International Speedway , one of the world 's first superspeedways . A decade later , France decided to build another superspeedway , this time on a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 8 km ² ) site near Talladega , Alabama and after its completion Talladega Superspeedway became NASCAR 's fastest track . These two tracks were the fastest on the series schedule until the advent of restrictor plates in 1988 . In 1968 , the company assumed its current name to reflect its more ambitious scope . Two years later , ISC created the Motor Racing Network , a play @-@ by @-@ play radio network for NASCAR races , with MRN 's first race coverage coming at the 1970 Daytona 500 . 
 = = = Transition = = = 
 The early 1980s saw NASCAR 's popularity increase , not only among fans , but also with sponsors . Companies like Ford , General Motors , Winston and Gatorade were willing to put up advertising dollars and holding auto races became a much more profitable venture . To capitalize on this , the company began pursuing expansion through the purchase of existing tracks . In 1982 , the company bought one of the series ' most popular and traditional ones , Darlington Raceway which has been in operation since 1950 , as well as Tucson Raceway Park , a .375 miles ( 0 @.@ 604 km ) dirt oval ( since paved ) in Arizona . The following year they partnered with Corning Glass Works to purchase the Watkins Glen International road course in upstate New York . In 1987 , Bill France , Sr. stepped down as president of the company with Jim France replacing him . Two years later , ISC incorporated its food service company , <unk> . 
 = = = Penske merger = = = 
 By this time ISC was profitable , but most of their races were still in the South and in mostly rural areas , with many of the country 's major cities like Los Angeles , Detroit , Miami and Chicago lacking a nearby track . ISC began looking for ways to change this in the late 1990s . Homestead @-@ Miami Speedway was built in 1995 by Ralph Sanchez and Wayne Huizenga and in 1997 ISC and Penske Motorsports ( owned by motorsports magnate Roger Penske ) partnered with the track 's owners . In 1999 , the company continued its push into the country 's urban centers when it merged with Penske , who at the time owned four <unk> : Nazareth Speedway , North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham , North Carolina , Michigan International Speedway and the newly constructed Auto Club Speedway ( which opened as California Speedway ) . Chairman Bill France , Jr. cited the company 's " attractive markets " as one of the major reasons for going ahead with the deal . The new company retained the ISC name , with Penske 's son Gregory Penske joining the board of directors . Not all of the new tracks from the Penske merger fit into the company 's plans however , as Nazareth was soon closed down and Rockingham was sold . The merger also gave ISC a 90 % stake in Homestead @-@ Miami Speedway and the company soon bought out the final 10 % to acquire complete control over the track . 
 In the same year , ISC formed the Motorsports Alliance with the owners of the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway ; this company would go after another huge market in Chicago by building the new Chicagoland Speedway in nearby Joliet , Illinois and by buying out the smaller Route 66 Raceway dragstrip . In 2007 , ISC bought out its partners in the company to take control of both tracks . 
 In 2001 , ISC would continue its trend towards modern facilities by constructing Kansas Speedway near Kansas City . In 2003 , Lesa Kennedy took over from Jim France the role of president of the company . On June 1 , 2009 , John R. Saunders took over as President of ISC , becoming the first ISC president without a " France " surname . Mr. Saunders held the position of Executive Vice President of Operations prior to becoming President . 
 = = Today = = 
 Today , the company owns 13 active tracks which collectively hold 19 of the 36 events on the schedule of NASCAR 's premier competition , the Sprint Cup Series . Twelve of the thirteen host a Sprint Cup race ( the thirteenth being Route 66 Raceway , a dragstrip ) . In addition to the stock car racing that NASCAR is famous for , ISC tracks also host IRL IndyCar races , Grand @-@ Am , IMSA GT and SCCA sports car races , <unk> go @-@ kart races and AMA motorcycle races . Besides NASCAR , other stock car series like IROC and <unk> use their tracks . 
 The company 's other holdings include the Motor Racing Network , a radio network that broadcasts NASCAR events , and <unk> , a food service business that operates concession stands at its tracks . In 2005 , ISC partnered with Speedway Motorsports , Inc. to form Motorsports Authentics , a company that markets and distributes NASCAR @-@ related souvenirs and collectibles . 
 Although ISC is controlled by the France family , it is separate from NASCAR . About 35 % of the stock in ISC is owned by the heirs of NASCAR founder Bill France and the remainder trades on the stock market . Lesa Kennedy is CEO and Jim France is Chairman . 
 ISC is still headquartered in Daytona Beach , Florida near Daytona International Speedway . ISC is working on a new development called ONE <unk> that will feature anchor tenants Bass Pro Shops , Cobb Theatres and a Marriott Autograph Collection hotel .

 ISC and NASCAR have both made public their desire to have a presence in areas it sees as having the potential for growth , most notably the Pacific Northwest and New York City . ISC has said that the earliest either of these tracks would be operating is 2011 . 
 = = = Pacific Northwest = = = 
 = = = = Marysville = = = = 
 In 2003 , ISC began scouting sites in Washington and Oregon for a new track to attract fans from around the Pacific Northwest , eventually settling on a site near Marysville , Washington in Snohomish County north of Seattle . Although the plan was met with some resistance from residents – particularly those living near the site for the planned speedway – local business owners and other residents were in favor of the plan , believing that the track would be good for the area 's economy and would create jobs . Unlike ISC 's later proposal in New York , the Marysville proposal would be supported by public funds raised through taxes , in much the same way as other sports venues in the area ( KeyArena , Safeco Field , CenturyLink Field ) . The track would have been publicly owned and leased to ISC . In November 2004 , local officials and ISC announced that they could not go through with the deal , saying that the costs for that particular site would be too high . 
 = = = = Bremerton , WA = = = = 
 After the deal in Marysville fell through , ISC courted another site , this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton , WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle . Although like the Marysville proposal the proposal in Bremerton was to be partially funded with public money , the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes , in a scheme similar to the one used to fund Kansas Speedway . Also like the Marysville proposal , the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year . ISC 's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens , but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007 . 
 In March 2007 , Washington state representative Larry Seaquist caused a minor controversy when he was quoted as saying , " These people are not the kind of people you would want living next door to you . They 'd be the ones with the junky cars in the front yard and would try to slip around the law . " The quote was assumed to be an attack on NASCAR fans but Seaquist later claimed that it was directed at ISC . 
 In April 2007 , this plan was also abandoned by ISC after failing to get their bill out of committee in the Washington State Legislature or to gain the full support of the Kitsap County Commissioners . 
 = = = New York City = = = 
 On November 30 , 2004 , the company made no secret of its interest in building a superspeedway in the New York market and was in talks with Staten Island officials about the logistics of constructing a track there . In 2004 , ISC purchased 600 acres ( 2 @.@ 4 km2 ) on Staten Island in New York City for the construction of a 4 / 5 mile ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) short track that would hold 80 @,@ 000 fans and have the New York City skyline as its backdrop . The proposal was met with fierce resistance from many of the island 's residents . At a public meeting in April 2006 , police had to end the meeting early for fears of rioting and safety concerns . One report had a local councilman being put in a headlock after one particularly provoking speech ( though one ISC official called it merely a " hug for the TV cameras " ) . In December 2006 , ISC dropped their pursuit of the project .

 On February 13 , 2007 , the company announced that they were looking into building a track in Colorado . The 75 @,@ 000 @-@ seat track would be built on one of two locations in Adams County , just east of Denver . The company would also be looking to use the same type of combination of public and private funds for the race track as in Kansas and Washington .

 Francis Ferko , a stockholder in Speedway Motorsports , Inc . , sued NASCAR and ISC in 2002 for violating federal antitrust laws and breach of contract for not awarding a second Winston Cup ( now Sprint Cup ) series date to Texas Motor Speedway , claiming that the second race was " promised " to the SMI track by NASCAR . After an attempt by NASCAR to get the case dismissed , another shareholder , Rusty Vaughn , joined the case as co @-@ plaintiff in 2003 . Although NASCAR CEO Brian France initially said he was going to fight the case in the courts , in April 2004 it was announced that the case had been settled out of court with Texas getting the Cup date previously belonging to North Carolina Speedway and , as part of the deal , agreeing to purchase North Carolina — which now had no dates at all — from ISC for $ 100 million . Other races on the schedule were also moved around as a result ( see NASCAR Realignment ) . 
 = = = Kentucky Speedway lawsuit = = = 
 In 2005 , Kentucky Speedway filed a similar lawsuit against ISC and NASCAR , claiming that NASCAR violated antitrust laws by not awarding them a Sprint Cup Series race , noting the close relationship between NASCAR , ISC , and the France Family . NASCAR sought to have the case thrown out by arguing that the speedway wasn 't trying to end the alleged anticompetitive practices , they were merely trying to benefit from them as well . This motion was denied , however . A motion to move the case from Kentucky to Florida – home of NASCAR and ISC – was also rejected . ISC , for its part , said it shouldn 't be involved in the case at all as it conducts no business in the state . Lawyers for Kentucky Speedway contended that the company does business online and is just as responsible for the lack of competition in granting the races as NASCAR is . 
 Initially , Kentucky had wanted the jury to force NASCAR to grant the speedway a Sprint Cup Series event but in 2007 they changed their demand to instead force the France family to sell either NASCAR or ISC . The track is also demanding that NASCAR develop objective standards for the awarding of their race events and damages of $ 200 million . In January 2008 , the court dismissed the lawsuit , saying that the plaintiffs had failed to make their case . Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court 's decision . 
 In 2011 , Kentucky Speedway , now owned by SMI , received a date , the Quaker State 400 , on the Cup Series schedule . 
 = London Underground departmental stock = 
 Departmental locomotives on the London Underground consist of vehicles of a number of types which are used for engineering purposes . These include battery locomotives , diesel locomotives , electric locomotives , sleet locomotives , pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars . Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere . Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service , but continue to be used by the engineering department . Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system , while ballast motor cars are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains . 
 The first ballast motor cars were former trailer cars built for the Central London Railway in 1900 , which were converted to motor cars for trials of the first multiple system to be used in Britain , and were retained for departmental use after 1903 . These were followed by French and Hungarian Gate stock cars , built in 1906 , which were converted in the 1920s and 1930s . The next batch consisted on 14 standard stock cars converted in 1953 . Rolling stock reorganisation and replacement in the 1970s on the District and Metropolitan lines resulted in a number of surface stock cars being used for pilot motor duties . Subsequently motor cars of 1938 stock and 1960 stock were used for this purpose , and complete 4 @-@ car units of 1962 stock . 
 The London Underground has also owned several departmental self @-@ powered vehicles designed for other duties . These include a tunnel cleaning train , consisting of two 1938 stock motor cars and three purpose @-@ built cars , which act like a giant vacuum cleaner , and can hold 6 tons of dust before the filter tanks need to be emptied . Three <unk> & <unk> track tamping machines were purchased in 1980 , and two Unimog road @-@ rail vehicles were obtained in 1983 and 1986 , for use as depot shunters . 
 = = Early ballast motor cars = = 
 When the Central London Railway opened in 1900 , it used camel @-@ back electric locomotives hauling six @-@ car trains . The locomotives weighed 44 tons and were largely unsprung , causing severe vibration problems in properties near the line . In an effort to resolve the problem , four of the coaches were fitted with motors , in the first trial in Britain of the Sprague @-@ Thomson @-@ Houston multiple unit control system . The trials were a success , and multiple unit trains were running by 1903 . Two of the trial cars , numbers 201 and 202 , were retained and became the first ballast motor cars to work on the Underground . They worked in this form until about 1910 , when batteries were fitted . They were renumbered L22 and <unk> in 1929 , and were scrapped in 1936 and 1937 . 
 The next batch of ballast motor cars were French @-@ built gate stock cars , originally constructed in 1906 , but converted in the early 1920s to run with the 1920 air @-@ door stock . 20 motor cars were converted , but were replaced by more modern cars in 1930 . Although 12 of the displaced cars were scrapped , six were kept as ballast motor cars , becoming numbers <unk> to <unk> in the service fleet . The final two were further converted to run as single cars on the Aldwych shuttle . During the Second World War they were used as pilot motor cars for refreshment trains on the Piccadilly line , which supplied food to people sleeping on the stations to escape from the bombing of the city . They returned to the Aldwych shuttle between 1946 and 1949 , but were again used as pilot motor cars after that , transferring cars between the engineering works at Acton and various depots . They were both coupled to a flat wagon for a period , and were used to transfer stores from Acton Works to Northfields depot , and also took stores to Croxley Green and Queens Park depots on the Bakerloo line . 
 Four Hungarian @-@ built gate stock motor cars were used as ballast motor cars , and were numbered <unk> to <unk> . The final one was stored in 1955 , in the hope that it would be restored and preserved , but by 1960 , the project appeared to be too costly , and so the gate end of the car was cut off , and the rest of it was scrapped . After refurbishment , the gate was displayed at the London Transport Museum . A further four Hungarian motor cars from the Piccadilly line were used as pilot motor cars during the reconstruction of the Hampstead line in 1922 , and were numbered <unk> to L20 . Once a spur between the Hampstead line and the Piccadilly line at Kings Cross station was opened on 27 March 1927 , it became much easier to transfer ballast motor cars between lines . The 14 departmental vehicles which were operational in 1934 continued to be used until 1953 , by which time their age made maintenance very difficult . They were replaced over the next two years and scrapped . 
 = = Standard stock cars = = 
 In 1953 , fourteen standard stock motor cars were withdrawn from passenger service , and were converted to ballast motor cars , with the final one completed in early 1955 . All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923 , four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co . At least three of them were chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage . They were numbered <unk> to <unk> , and were painted grey . In 1957 , they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon . <unk> was the first to be scrapped , after a collision in 1963 . At the time , the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959 / 62 Stock , and so rather than repair it , it was replaced by a 1927 motor car . The replacement also carried the number <unk> . A 1931 motor car was used to replace <unk> when it was badly damaged in 1967 , but in this case it carried a new number , becoming <unk> . During the 1970s , the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn . The last two to be used were <unk> and <unk> , which performed leaf @-@ clearing duties in late 1977 , and all had been scrapped by September 1978 . 
 While single passenger cars were sometimes moved around the system , either between depots or to Acton Works , these movements were infrequent , and when they were necessary , standard stock motor cars borrowed from the passenger fleet were normally used . Following the introduction of the 1959 passenger stock , single cars and parts of units were moved around much more frequently , and normal passenger motor cars could not be used to perform this task , as the equipment they needed to operate was spread around the unit , rather than confined to the motor car . Eight Standard Stock motor cars , dating from 1927 and 1934 , were therefore allocated as pilot motor cars . In 1967 , they were painted maroon , numbered <unk> to <unk> , and became part of the ballast motor fleet . Four were withdrawn in 1971 without performing this work , however . Following withdrawal , <unk> was shipped to the Isle of Wight , to replace a car on the Island Line which had been damaged . The remaining four cars worked as two pairs , and were still working as pilot motor cars in 1987 , but had been withdrawn by 1993 . 
 = = Surface stock cars = = 
 From time to time , the Underground has needed to move surface stock cars around the system , and several motor cars have been set aside as pilot motor cars for this purpose . In 1971 , the trains on the District line were rearranged into 7 @-@ car units , and in 1974 , District line stock was removed from the East London line . This resulted in a large number of spare cars , which were transferred to Ruislip Depot for eventual scrapping . One <unk> stock motor car and one <unk> stock motor car were allocated as pilot motor cars for this task in 1967 , but did not receive departmental numbers . They also toured the system with a gauging car , to check clearances . They were joined by four <unk> stock motor cars in 1971 , which were renumbered <unk> to <unk> in 1972 . <unk> of the scrap cars and the new stock being delivered in Ruislip Depot between 1970 and 1972 was handled by six pilot motor cars , two each drawn from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> stock . Four were scrapped in 1972 , and the final two in 1974 . <unk> and <unk> were painted yellow in 1983 , They were subsequently repainted in red , and their departmental numbers were replaced by their original passenger car numbers . Following withdrawal , they have been retained by the London Transport Museum . 
 When delivery of <unk> stock began in 1977 , two pairs of CO / CP stock motor cars were used as pilot motor cars to shunt the new stock at Ruislip Depot , and to marshall the scrap stock displaced by the new units . The C77 stock could be driven under its own power to Hammersmith Depot , as it was commissioned at Ruislip . The D78 stock was different , in that delivery was still to Ruislip , but the commissioning took place at Ealing Common Depot , and therefore pilot motor cars were needed to transfer the stock . Two pairs of CO / CP stock motor cars were allocated to do this in 1979 , with a further three pairs joining them in 1980 . New trains were transferred with a pilot motor car at each end , as were trains that were withdrawn for scrapping . The pilot motor cars carried large stencils at both ends , so that they would not accidentally be scrapped until their duties were complete . Three pairs of R stock motor cars were used as pilot motor cars after the R stock was scrapped . Most of the surface stock pilot motor cars were scrapped when the deliveries were complete , although one each of the CO / CP and R stock cars have been privately preserved . 
 = = Tube stock cars = = 
 Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 stock to be withdrawn , and several cars were converted for use as ballast motor cars . The task was more complicated than for earlier stock , as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars . The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors , and the couplings were changed from <unk> to Ward type . The first four were numbered <unk> to <unk> , and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972 . Another six were converted , two in 1975 , two in 1976 , and the final two in 1977 , which were numbered <unk> to <unk> . <unk> and <unk> were converted in 1978 , and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment . Another four were added in the same year , numbered <unk> to <unk> . Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs , some engineering trains had a ballast motor car at one end and a battery locomotive at the other . One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools , although they were less powerful , and could only work when the traction current was switched on . By 2002 , all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn . 
 Two of the 1960 stock cars were converted to work as pilot motor cars in 1987 . The conversion was carried out at British Rail Engineering Limited 's works at Derby . They were numbered <unk> and <unk> , and were used to haul a track recording car around the system . The recording car is numbered <unk> , and was converted from a 1973 @-@ built trailer car . 
 27 cars of 1962 stock , supplemented by three cars of 1959 stock , were retained after most of that stock was withdrawn . These were formed into seven 4 @-@ car units , which were used as pilot motor units , while the remaining two cars were used for training by the Emergency Response Unit of the British Transport Police . Two units were fitted with Automatic Train Protection ( ATP ) equipment to allow them to work on the Central line , two were based at Ruislip Depot , and two were owned by <unk> . The seventh unit was stored at Ruislip by 2002 , waiting for disposal . The units were not renumbered in the engineering series and continued to carry their passenger fleet numbers . One of the driving motor cars based at Ruislip was repainted in olive green . 
 = = Other self @-@ powered vehicles = = 
 London Underground has owned a small number of departmental vehicles which were not ballast motor or pilot motor cars . Between 1935 and 1950 , the District line had a weed @-@ killing train , initially consisting of a 1905 @-@ built B stock driving motor car and a control trailer . The two cars were kept at Ealing Common depot , but the control trailer was scrapped in 1937 and replaced by a second motor car , to provide more power . Weed @-@ killing duties were not carried out during the Second World War , and the vehicles were not refurbished subsequently . They were scrapped in 1950 . 
 In 1977 , a tunnel @-@ cleaning train was completed . This consisted of two 1938 driving motor cars , and three purpose @-@ built vehicles . The middle vehicle of the five contains a fan unit , which supplies large volumes of low pressure air to a series of nozzles , which disturb the dust on the tunnel walls and track . The cars on either side of it draw the dust @-@ laden air into filter chambers , and are fitted with conveyors for discharging the dust at depots . To enable the train to operate sufficiently slowly for the cleaning process to be effective , a hydraulic drive was fitted to one of the motor cars , with settings to allow speeds of 0 @.@ 5 mph ( 0 @.@ 8 km / h ) , 1 @.@ 5 mph ( 2 @.@ 4 km / h ) , 4 @.@ 5 mph ( 7 @.@ 2 km / h ) and 6 mph ( 9 @.@ 7 km / h ) . Up to 6 tons of dust can be held in the filter bags , and the units are fitted with carbon dioxide and water mist fire fighting equipment , because of the combustible nature of fine dust particles . There were teething problems when the train began work in 1978 , but by 1980 , these had been resolved . 
 In 2002 , the company also owned three <unk> & <unk> track maintenance machines , which were built in 1980 . One was fitted with ATP equipment to allow it to work on the Central line . They had previously owned six other tamping machines , which were acquired between 1959 and 1975 . The 1959 model was scrapped in 1970 , and the oldest four of the others were withdrawn in 1984 and 1985 . One of the machines built in 1967 went to the Southern Steam Trust at Swanage , and another , built in 1973 , was acquired by the Severn Valley Railway . 
 In 1983 and 1986 , London Underground purchased two Unimog road @-@ rail vehicles , which were used as depot shunters . They are fitted with small railway wheels just outside the road tyres , which can be lowered when working in railway mode , and ensure that the road wheels run along the top of the rails . They are numbered <unk> and <unk> . They previously owned a Unimog tractor @-@ trailer pair of vehicles , purchased in 1982 , which were used for leaf @-@ clearing duties . <unk> on the tractor unit were used to suck up the leaves , which were then stored in a 570 @-@ cubic @-@ foot ( 16 m3 ) bin mounted in the trailer . 
 = 1997 – 98 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 1997 – 98 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season was fairly quiet and had the latest start in 30 years . The first tropical disturbance originated on January 16 , although the first named storm , Anacelle , was not upgraded until February 8 , a record late start . The last storm to dissipate was an unusually late tropical depression in late July . Many of the storms suffered from the effects of wind shear , which contributed to there being only one tropical cyclone – equivalent to a minimal hurricane . The season also occurred during a powerful El Niño . 
 Tropical Depression A1 , the first of the season , moved throughout most of Mozambique in January , causing landslides and flooding . One landslide affected <unk> District , where many houses were swept into a river . Landslides killed between 87 and 143 people in the country . In February , Cyclone Anacelle buffeted several islands with gusty winds after becoming the strongest storm of the season , reaching maximum sustained winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Although Anacelle was the first named storm of the season , another tropical depression preceded it that crossed Madagascar several times . The depression eventually became Tropical Storm Beltane , and lasted 17 days . Beltane caused flooding across Madagascar due to heavy rainfall , which killed one person and left locally heavy crop damage . There were several other disturbances in February , including Cindy which dissipated 50 days after it originated , as well as a disturbance that brought heavy rainfall to Réunion and Mauritius . The rest of the season was fairly quiet , mostly with short @-@ lived tropical disturbances or storms . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 During the year , the Météo @-@ France office on Réunion ( MFR ) issued warnings for tropical systems in the region as the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre . In the year , MFR tracked tropical cyclones south of the equator from the coast of Africa to 90 ° E. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issued warnings in an unofficial capacity . 
 The season had the latest start in 30 years , with the first depression forming in January . The first storm , Anacelle , was not named until February 8 , which retains the record for the latest date of the first named storm . For the early portion of the season , there were unusually quiet conditions across much of the basin , along with higher than normal pressure . The intertropical convergence zone ( ITCZ ) associated with the monsoon only became active in February , allowing tropical cyclogenesis to occur more frequently . There were six tropical storms during the season , of which only one attained tropical cyclone status ; these are below the averages of 9 and 4 , respectively . No storms attained intense tropical cyclone status . The season 's low activity contrasted that of the previous season , which was much more active . There were 18 days in which a storm was active , the lowest since 1982 – 83 . An ongoing El Niño was evident during the season . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Depression A1 = = = 
 The first system of the season originated out of a circulation that persisted in the northern Mozambique Channel on January 15 . Convection developed around the center near Grande Comore , meriting its classification Tropical Disturbance 1 . Moving southwestward , the system organized into a tropical depression on January 17 , developing a curved band of convection . Further intensification was halted as the system moved ashore Mozambique near Angoche . The depression turned to the south over land , remaining over inland Mozambique for several days . On January 18 , the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 13S , estimating winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) , despite the storm being 55 km ( 35 mi ) inland . The agency quickly downgraded the storm to tropical depression status , but briefly re @-@ upgraded it on January 19 as the system crossed over the extreme western Mozambique Channel . The agency again downgraded it after the storm moved ashore . By contrast , the MFR assessed that the system remained a tropical depression and placed the circulation farther inland . On January 20 , the depression turned to the southeast over open waters , influenced by a trough to the south . Despite warmer waters , the system was unable to re @-@ intensify much due to the presence of wind shear , although the JTWC again upgraded the system to tropical storm status for a third and final time . The depression approached tropical storm intensify after developing increased convection over the center , but it weakened again on January 22 . On the next day , the system dissipated just off the southern coast of Madagascar . 
 In its formative stages , the depression dropped beneficial rainfall in the Comoros , reaching 163 mm ( 6 @.@ 4 in ) at Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport . While the depression was over land , the plume of warm air from the open waters sustained heavy convection over the circulation , which dropped heavy rainfall across eastern Mozambique . The rains caused landslides and flooding in the country , which disrupted transport in three provinces , damaging several bridges . The most significant landslide occurred in <unk> District at nighttime , which swept houses into a river ; about 2 @,@ 500 people were left homeless in the village . There were 73 confirmed fatalities , with another 70 people missing and presumed killed . However ; the International Disaster Database ( EM @-@ DAT ) later placed the total number of casualties at 87 . Rainfall also extended into Malawi , where villages were flooded and crops were damaged . While the system was accelerating to the southeast away from Mozambique , it produced gale force winds on Europa Island . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Beltane = = = 
 A northerly flow produced a low pressure area on February 1 in the central Mozambique Channel . Influenced by the monsoon trough , the system developed a distinct circulation on February 3 near Juan de Nova Island , becoming a tropical disturbance and bringing gusts of 50 km / h ( 30 mph ) to the island . The convection organized around the circulation while moving eastward . Conditions were favorable for further strengthening , although the system made landfall in western Madagascar between Maintirano and Morondava on February 5 . After progressing slightly inland , the disturbance looped and turned to the south . The circulation became difficult to locate , but surface observations helped track the circulation southward through the country . Late on February 8 , the system reached the open waters south of Madagascar and quickly redeveloped convection southeast of the center , displaced by wind shear , and it was reclassified as a subtropical depression . The JTWC briefly classified it as Tropical Cyclone 21S on February 9 with winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . 
 A building ridge to the south turned the system northeastward on February 10 and later to the northwest , bringing it back over southwestern Madagascar . On February 11 , the circulation again reentered the Mozambique Channel , and subsequently the thunderstorms rebuilt over the poorly defined center . A trough behind the ridge allowed the system to turn to the southwest and later southeast . An increase in convection on February 15 organized into a curved band , and MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Beltane on the next day off the west coast of Madagascar . The JTWC also classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 23S on February 16 , possibly due to the extended duration between issuing advisories . Strong wind shear stripped the convection from the center as Beltane approached southwestern Madagascar on February 17 . Another building ridge turned the weakened depression to the northwest across the Mozambique Channel , finally dissipating on February 20 near the mouth of the Zambezi . The remnants later moved across Mozambique accompanied by locally heavy rainfall . 
 Due to its trajectories across Madagascar , Beltane brought heavy rainfall to the country . The persistent precipitation damaged crops , up to 100 % in some areas , and forced thousands to evacuate their houses . Floodwaters covered the village of Vohipeno , killing one person . Several roads and bridges were also washed away . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Anacelle = = = 
 On February 5 , the ITCZ spawned an area of convection about 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) southwest of Diego Garcia . The system slowly organized , aided by warm waters and weakening wind shear . On February 6 , it developed into a tropical disturbance , and became Tropical Storm Anacelle two days later . Also on February 8 , the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 20S . The storm initially moved westward due to a ridge to the north , although the motion shifted to the southwest on February 9 due to a trough and the influence of the system that would become Tropical Storm Beltane . Anacelle developed an eye feature on February 10 , indicating that it attained tropical cyclone status , or winds of at least 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Around that time , Anacelle passed just west of St. Brandon . On February 11 , the cyclone passed about 100 km ( 60 mi ) east of Mauritius . Shortly thereafter , Anacelle attained peak winds while presenting a 30 km ( 19 mi ) eye . It reached peak winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) , according to MFR , while the JTWC estimated peak winds of 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) . An approaching trough weakened the cyclone and steered it southeastward , causing the eye to disappear . On February 13 , Anacelle became extratropical , although the remnants continued southeastward , passing near Île Amsterdam on the next day and re @-@ intensifying on February 15 in the southern Indian Ocean . 
 While passing near St. Brandon , Anacelle produced peak winds of 101 km / h ( 63 mph ) , with gusts to 151 km / h ( 94 mph ) . Later , the storm produced gusty winds of less than 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) on Mauritius , along with 125 mm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) of rainfall at Port Louis . The extratropical remnants also brought gale force winds to Île Amsterdam . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Donaline = = = 
 A large area of low pressure between the Chagos Archipelago and the Mascarene Islands spawned a small tropical disturbance on March 4 . Moving southeastward , the system slowly developed as wind shear in the region slowly decreased . Despite only being a tropical depression , it was named Donaline on March 5 . On the next day , the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 26S . Increased convection organized into a central dense overcast , and Donaline intensified into a minimal tropical storm , reaching peak winds of 75 km / h ( 55 mph ) according to the MFR . In contrast , the JTWC estimated peak winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . The wind shear returned , causing weakening and dislocating the circulation from the convection . On March 10 , Donaline became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front two days later . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Elsie = = = 
 On March 7 , a low pressure area persisted west of the Cocos Islands in the Australian basin . It drifted westward , entering the south @-@ west Indian Ocean on March 9 as a tropical disturbance . It remained weak , with little convection over the center . Outflow gradually increased , although satellite imagery was limited in the region to only one image per day . Late on March 12 , the satellite imagery indicated a well @-@ defined tropical storm with curved convection , and the MFR immediately upgraded it to Severe Tropical Storm Elsie , estimating peak winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . By contrast , the JTWC estimated winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , having classified it as Tropical Cyclone <unk> that day . By that time , the storm was moving steadily to the southwest due to a trough in the region related to the remnants of Donaline . Increased wind shear caused steady weakening , removing the circulation from the convection on February 14 . On the next day , Elsie weakened to tropical depression status as it curved southward . A building ridge to the south turned the system to the east , gradually looping back to the northwest . Elsie eventually dissipated on March 20 . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Fiona = = = 
 While Elsie was weakening and turning to the south , another system was forming near St. Brandon . Convection associated with the monsoon trough persisted on March 13 , becoming a tropical disturbance two days later . The ridge steered the system to the southwest toward <unk> , and conditions were expected to allow for intensification . As a result , the Mauritius Meteorological Service named the disturbance as Fiona on March 16 . On the next day , Fiona intensified into a tropical depression , reaching peak winds of only 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . Also on March 17 , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 28S . Around this time , Fiona passed about 200 km ( 120 mi ) southeast of St. Brandon . After peaking , the convection decreased due to wind shear , causing the winds to fluctuate . On March 20 , the circulation became exposed from the thunderstorms and approached 80 km ( 45 mi ) east of Mauritius , producing wind gusts of 70 km / h ( 44 mph ) . The next day , Fiona dissipated into an approaching cold front . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Gemma = = = 
 After an extended period of inactivity , the ITCZ produced two areas of convection – one was located about 550 km ( 340 mi ) south @-@ southwest of Diego Garcia , and the other was located 900 km ( 560 mi ) east @-@ southeast of that system . Both were classified as tropical disturbances on April 7 and subsequently interacted with each other . The eastern system , classified as Tropical Cyclone <unk> , quickly dissipated due to strong wind shear and was absorbed into the western system . The disturbance continued to organize and developed a central dense overcast over the center , becoming Tropical Storm Gemma on April 8 . A ridge and a trough steered the storm to the southeast and later to the east . On April 9 , Gemma attained peak winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) , according to the MFR , while the JTWC estimated 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) winds . As with most other storms in the year , increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken . The weaker system isolated it from the upper @-@ level steering , causing the circulation to loop southwestward . On April 16 , Gemma dissipated far to the east of Rodrigues . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 In addition to the named systems , there were nine tropical depressions or disturbances tracked by the MFR , and several by other agencies . 
 On January 2 , the tropical depression that was once Cyclone Selwyn crossed 90 ° E from the Australian region , but dissipated the next day . 
 On February 8 , a tropical low formed just north of Western Australia from the remnants of Cyclone Katrina , which earlier formed off the east coast of Australia . The low moved generally westward due to a strong ridge to the south . Given the name Victor , the storm intensified to a peak of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) before weakening steadily due to increased wind shear . On February 14 , the storm weakened to tropical depression status . Victor crossed into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean on February 16 with a well @-@ defined circulation but little convection . Despite being downgraded to a tropical disturbance , the system was named Cindy by the Mauritius Meteorological Service on February 16 . The system continued gradually weakening while turning more to the southwest , dissipating on February 19 . This marked a 50 day period in which the same system was active . 
 After Cyclone Anacelle became extratropical , an area of convection developed about 700 km ( 430 mi ) northeast of Rodrigues on February 14 . The circulation moved southwestward , organizing into Tropical Disturbance D1 on February 16 . Later that day , it was upgraded to tropical depression status after the convection organized into a central dense overcast , and on the same day the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 24S . Increased wind shear weakened the depression as a trough turned it more to the southeast . On February 19 , the trough absorbed the system . 
 After the disturbance dissipated , a large low pressure area persisted east of Madagascar with several associated circulations . On February 24 , Tropical Disturbance D2 passed about 160 km ( 100 mi ) west of Réunion , and continued to the southeast , passing south of Mauritius . Wind shear stripped the convection from the center and caused it to dissipate . Over a nine @-@ day period , the system dropped nearly 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) of rainfall in portions of Réunion , including nearly 700 mm ( 28 in ) at Salazie on February 24 ; at that station , 255 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) of precipitation fell in just three hours . Gusts reached 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) in some locations . The storm caused flooding and landslides on the island as well as power outages . Rainfall also reached 240 millimetres ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) on Mauritius . Residents were generally caught off guard by the storm due to the lack of warnings . Tropical Disturbance D3 also developed before March . 
 Although Tropical Storm Gemma was the final named storm , there were four subsequent tropical disturbances . The first formed toward the end of April after Gemma dissipated in the same general region . Named Tropical Cyclone <unk> by the JTWC , it moved westward throughout its duration but failed to intensify due to wind shear . On April 22 , the system dissipated , never having developed beyond tropical disturbance status . The last disturbance of the year formed on July 20 about 1480 km ( 920 mi ) east of Diego Garcia . The system moved generally southwestward , dissipating on July 23 due to wind shear . At the time , the tropical cyclone year for the basin lasted from August 1 to July 31 of the following year , although the JTWC considers the start of the tropical cyclone year to begin on July 1 . As a result , the MFR considered the system Tropical Disturbance H4 while the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 01S . 
 = = Storm names = = 
 A tropical disturbance is named when it reaches moderate tropical storm strength . If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55 ° E , then the Sub @-@ regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm . If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between 55 ° E and 90 ° E , then the Sub @-@ regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius assigns the appropriate name to the storm . A new annual list is used every year so no names are retired . 
 = Kangiten = 
 Kangi @-@ ten ( Japanese : <unk> , " God of Bliss " ) is a god ( deva or ten ) in Shingon and Tendai schools of Japanese Buddhism . He is generally considered the Japanese Buddhist form of the Hindu elephant @-@ headed god of wisdom , Ganesha and is sometimes also identified with the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara . He is also known as <unk> @-@ ten , Shō @-@ ten ( <unk> , " sacred god " or " noble god " ) , Daishō @-@ ten ( " great noble god " ) , Daishō Kangi @-@ ten ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> , " venerable god " ) , Kangi <unk> @-@ ten ( <unk> ) , <unk> @-@ sama , Vinayaka @-@ ten , Binayaka @-@ ten ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> @-@ ten ( <unk> ) . 
 Kangiten has many aspects and names , associated with Vajrayana ( Esoteric Buddhist , Tantric , <unk> ) schools , Shingon being one of them . Although Kangiten is depicted with an elephant 's head like Ganesha as a single male deity , his most popular aspect is the Dual ( <unk> ) Kangiten or the Embracing Kangiten depicted as an elephant @-@ headed male @-@ female human couple standing in an embrace . 
 = = Names = = 
 Kangiten inherits many names and characteristics from the Hindu god Ganesha . He is known as Bināyaka @-@ ten , derived from the epithet Vinayaka ; <unk> or Gaṇapati ( Ganapati is a popular epithet of Ganesha ) and <unk> ( Ganesha ) . Like Ganesha , Bināyaka is the remover of obstacles , but when propitiated , he bestows material fortunes , prosperity , success and health . In addition , Bināyaka is said to be of evil nature , creator of discord and dispute and leading people towards immoral ways . 
 Shō @-@ ten or <unk> indicates his association with good luck and fortune . 
 The name " Kangi @-@ ten " , generally implied to the Tantric embracing deity icons , is venerated as giver of joy and prosperity . The Dual Kangiten icon called Soshin Kangi @-@ ten ( " dual @-@ bodied god of bliss " ) is a unique feature of Shingon Buddhism . It is also called Soshin Binayaka in Japanese , Kuan @-@ Shi ten in Chinese and <unk> in Sanskrit . 
 = = Iconography and depictions = = 
 Kangiten is often represented as an elephant @-@ headed male and female pair , standing embracing each other in sexual union . The genders of the pair is not explicit , but hinted in the iconography . The female wears a crown , a patched monk 's robe and a red surplice , while the male wears a black cloth over his shoulder . He has a long trunk and tusks , while she has short ones . He is reddish @-@ brown in colour and she is white . She usually rests her feet on his , while he rests his head on her shoulder . A variant form called " Shoten Fondly Smiling " form , both of them gaze into each other 's eyes , smiling intently . She wears loose garments , while he wears tight ones . Sometimes , they are cloaked in a single garment . In another variant , " Embracing Shoten Looking Over the Shoulder " , as the name suggests , the couple look over each other 's shoulders . The iconography represents unity of opposites ( <unk> oppositorum ) . Though they are separate figures with contrasting iconographies and genders , however they share the common name " Kangiten " and are engrossed in an intimate embrace , indicating their <unk> . The non @-@ dual is further stressed by sexual indicators like the feet @-@ on @-@ feet or the single garment . 
 Shoten may be also depicted as male alone . The deity figure ( s ) is / are portrayed as elephant @-@ headed , with two , four , six , eight or twelve arms . However , his images are rarely displayed in public . When depicted as a male , Shoten is generally four @-@ armed , holding a radish and a sweet ( <unk> ) . He may also hold a mace , a sword , a cup of ambrosia or have two of his front arms folded . The six @-@ armed aspect of Kangiten is described carrying a knife , a fruit bowl , a discus in his left hands and a club , a noose and his broken tusk in his right . 
 Vinayaka are also depicted in two most important Shingon mandalas , Vajra @-@ <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> . The mandalas generally have more than 1 Vinayaka figures . The Vinayakas are elephant @-@ headed , carry emblems such as radish and axe and are seated on lotus pedestals ( padmasana ) , the sign of divinity . The Vinayakas are generally positioned as guardians of the directions and serve as protectors against demons and evil . The central figure of the mandalas is Vairocana , one of the Five Great Buddhas , whose incarnation the Vinayakas are considered in this configuration . 
 Kangiten may also be depicted symbolically by symbolic syllable called <unk> or bija or by symbols such as an umbrella , garland or bow and arrow in mandalas . 
 = = Origins and texts = = 
 Kangiten first emerged as a minor deity in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon in the eighth @-@ ninth centuries CE , possibly under the influence of <unk> ( 774 – 835 ) , the founder of Shingon Buddhism . The Hindu Ganesha icon travelled to China , where it was incorporated in Buddhism , then journeyed further to Japan . Kangiten 's early role in Shingon , like most other Hindu deities assimilated in Buddhism , is of a minor guardian of the twin mandalas . Later on , Kangiten emerged as <unk> , an independent deity . Kangiten appears in numerous Japanese <unk> guides , compiled in Heian period ( 794 – 1185 ) . While it includes rituals and iconographic forms like the early Chinese texts , it introduces origin myths of the deity to justify the Buddhist nature of the Hindu Ganesha . 
 Early images show him as with two or six arms . The paintings and gilt @-@ bronze images of the Dual Kangiten with explicit sexual connotations emerged in the late Heian period , under the Tantric influence of Tibetan Buddhism where such sexual imagery ( <unk> @-@ Yum ) was common . The rare Japanese sexual iconography was hidden from public eye , to abide with Confucian ethics . Kangiten has now become an important deity in Shingon . 
 The origins of the Dual Kangiten have perplexed scholars for years ; there is no concrete evidence about the inception of this form . It is first found in Chinese texts , related to Chinese Tantric Buddhism , which was centred on the Buddha Vairocana and propagated by the three great masters Śubhakarasiṃha , <unk> , and Amoghavajra . The <unk> translated to Chinese by the monk <unk> ( <unk> ) in 654 CE describes a ritual to worship the Dual Kangiten ; the same ritual was replicated by Amoghavajra ( 705 – 774 ) in his ritual text <unk> Kangi Soshin Binayaka ho . Amoghavajra describes Soshin Kangiten as a deva , who grants one 's desires and a <unk> , the protector against evil and calamity . It details rituals and mantras to gain favour of the Dual Kangiten as well as the six @-@ armed Shoten . In another text by Amoghavajra , Soshin Kangiten is called a bodhisattva . This text categorizes the worshippers into three : the highest can learn inner secrets , the middle can read this text and the lowest should just accompany a higher worshipper in rituals . It describes rituals to gain four siddhis ( " powers " ) , namely of " protection , of gain , of love and of subjugation " . Rituals to appease Kangiten are described to gain three material things : kingship , prosperity and sufficient food and clothing . The text especially prescribes wine , the " water of bliss " as an offering to Kangiten . A minor text " Ritual of Sho Kangiten " ( 861 ) by <unk> @-@ jo @-@ je Chieh @-@ lo describes the mandalas of Kangiten . 
 <unk> ( trad . 572 – 727 ) has written two texts ( dated c . 693 – 713 ) that narrate about Vinayaka . In one of the texts , Vinayaka teaches a host of deities and demons a one @-@ syllable mantra , followed by a description of a ritual dedicated to the Dual Kangiten , which is also found in Amoghavajra 's <unk> Kangi Soshin Binayaka ho . Vinayaka 's demon followers promise the deity to grant of wishes of beings , who repeat the one @-@ syllable mantra . In the longer version of the previous text , <unk> elaborates of the Vinayaka story and enlists many rituals to propitiate the Dual Kangiten as well as the four @-@ armed form of the deity . It also has rituals to entice , gain wisdom , destroy foes etc . Besides the usual list of rituals , mantras and iconographical descriptions of the deity , Śubhakarasiṃha ( early 8th century ) in text , predating Amoghavajra but post @-@ dating <unk> composed in c . 723 @-@ 36 , equates Kangiten to Shiva and associates " the Hindu king " Vinayaka with Avalokiteshvara ( Kannon ) . 
 The Dual Kangiten may also have been by the Hindu Tantric portrayal of Ganesha with consorts . 
 = = Legends = = 
 Numerous Japanese Buddhist canons narrate tales about the evil nature of Vināyaka . The <unk> as well as Śubhakarasiṃha 's early Chinese text describes that King Vinayaka ( Binayaka ) was the son of Uma ( hi ) ( identified with the Hindu Parvati , mother of Ganesha ) and Maheshvara , the Buddhist equivalent of Shiva , father of Ganesha . Uma produces 1500 children from her either side ; from her left a host of evil Vinayakas , headed by Vinayaka ( Binayaka ) and from her right , benevolent virtuous hosts headed by the manifestation of Avalokiteshvara – Senanayaka ( " Lord of the army [ of gods ] " , identified with the Hindu god of war Skanda , the brother of Ganesha ) , the antithesis of Vinayaka . Senanayaka would take many births as the elder brother ( as in the Hindu tradition ) or wife of <unk> to defeat him . Then Śubhakarasiṃha 's text says that as wife , Senanayaka embraces Vinayaka leading to the icon of the Dual Kangiten . In the Japanese pantheon , Kangiten is considered as the brother of Ida @-@ ten , <unk> with Skanda . 
 Another legend narrates that the king of <unk> only ate beef and radishes . When these became rare , he started feasting on human corpses and finally living beings , turning into the great demon @-@ king Vinayaka , who commanded an army of <unk> . The people prayed to the Avalokiteshvara , who took the form of a female <unk> and seduced Vinayaka , filling him with joy ( <unk> ) . Thus , he , in union with her , became the Dual Kangiten . 
 The <unk> tells that <unk> , Maheshvara 's consort , had a son named Shoten , who was banished from heaven , due to his evil and violent nature . A beautiful goddess named <unk> ( <unk> ) , took the form of a terrible demoness and married Shoten , leading him to good ways . Another tale narrates that Kangiten was the evil daughter of <unk> , driven out from heaven . She took refuge at Mount Binayaka and married a fellow male @-@ Binayaka , resulting in the Dual Kangiten icon . Japanese variants of the legend of the Dual Kangiten emphasize that union of Vinayaka ( the male ) and <unk> ( the female ) transforms an evil obstacle creator into a reformed individual . 
 = = Worship = = 
 Kangiten is considered to be endowed with great power . Kangiten is regarded as protector of temples and worshipped generally by gamblers , actors , geishas and people in the business of " pleasure " . Mantras are often prescribed in ritual texts to appease the deity and even to drive away this obstacle @-@ maker . Rice wine ( sake ) , radishes and " bliss @-@ buns " ( <unk> @-@ dan ) are offered to the god . 
 While Kangiten is worshipped throughout Japan , <unk> @-@ ji on the summit of Mount <unk> is his most important and active temple . Though the temple is believed to have been founded in the sixth century , it came in the limelight in the 17th century when the monk <unk> ( 1629 – 1716 ) made the temple 's <unk> , a Heian period , gilt @-@ bronze image of the Dual Kangiten , the centre of attraction . In the Genroku era ( 1688 – 1704 ) , Osaka merchants , especially vegetable @-@ oil sellers , joined Kangiten 's cult , attributing their success to his worship . Business people still continue to worship him at the sanctuary and figurines of the Dual Kangiten are found in shops around the temple . The central Dual Kangiten icon is kept under a phallic cover called the linga @-@ <unk> , when not being worshipped . 
 Besides Shingon worship , as of 1979 , Kangiten 's worship was recorded in at least 243 Japanese shrines .

The sketch is a satire of the 1969 cancellation of Star Trek : The Original Series . The set design featured an effective replica of the bridge of the U.S.S Enterprise . Dress rehearsal was difficult , with the writer doubting whether Belushi would be able to pull off an effective parody of William Shatner 's performance as Captain James Kirk .

 The sketch became an instant cult classic hit among Star Trek and science fiction fans . The 1977 book Saturday Night Live edited by Anne <unk> and John Head included a copy of a note from Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry praising the comedic bit . The sketch was released on a 1985 Saturday Night Live compilation VHS that featured The Best of John Belushi , and re @-@ released with the same title in DVD format in 2011 . In his book <unk> author Michael Dunne called the comedic bit among the most well @-@ known of all Saturday Night Live routines . The Chicago Sun @-@ Times referred to it as an intelligent satire of Star Trek . The Los Angeles Times placed the parody among the program 's top ten sketches of all @-@ time . On the series ' 40th anniversary , Tulsa World listed the sketch as one of the television show 's most iconic . 
 The New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless and captured Shatner 's essence while adding simultaneously his own layer of weariness to the character . The Hollywood Reporter interviewed Tom Hanks and Elliott Gould in 2015 ; Gould called the sketch a favorite , while Hanks placed it among the best five of all time . In ranking every single Saturday Night Live cast member by talent in 2015 , Rolling Stone called the Captain Kirk parody one of Belushi 's most memorable and wrote that it was evidence of the actor 's youthful innocence . 
 = = Plot synopsis = = 
 The sensors of the starship U.S.S. Enterprise pick up a strange alien spacecraft following it in hot pursuit . Mr. Spock , played by Chevy Chase , identifies it as a 1968 Chrysler Imperial with a tinted windshield and retractable headlights . 
 Captain Kirk , played by John Belushi , orders the ship to outrun the strange craft . Unable to do so , he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft . Unfortunately , all of the ship 's equipment fails for no reason and the Enterprise 's systems break down . Suddenly , Dr. Leonard McCoy , played by Dan Aykroyd , runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship . He says they did not beam aboard , but merely walked out from behind the curtains . 
 It turns out that the aliens are NBC executive Herb Goodman , played by Elliott Gould , and his associate Curtis , played by Garrett Morris . They announce that the Star Trek series has been cancelled . Captain Kirk orders the crew to fire their hand phasers at the aliens but nothing happens . Mr. Spock assumes that the aliens have a type of weapons de @-@ activator and tries to employ his famous Vulcan nerve pinch on him , but that does not work either . The executive confiscates Mr. Spock 's pointed ears . Spock then mind @-@ melds with Goodman only to discover that , as he describes it , his brain is devoid of substance and contains only a few rodents . 
 Other NBC executives and staff show up and dismantle the Enterprise set . 
 Other crew members accept the cancellation , but Shatner and Nimoy try to hang on to their Star Trek personae as Kirk and Spock . However , Nimoy is eventually reduced to a sobbing , nervous wreck , and is carried off the set . Shatner remains defiantly in the Captain 's chair , as Herb Goodman mentions a phone call from a margarine company . Finally , the set is completely dismantled , and still in his chair , Shatner , as Captain Kirk , makes a final entry into his log recalling his previous three years of space exploration , concluding : " And except for one television network , we have found intelligence everywhere in the galaxy . " Raising his hand in the Vulcan salute , he goes on , " Live long and prosper " . Then he brings his fingers together , his hand still raised , and adds , " Promise " .

 The twelve @-@ minute sketch was written by Michael O 'Donoghue who wanted to create a scene that would showcase the acting talents of John Belushi . O 'Donoghue had been the one who had initially persuaded producer Lorne Michaels to hire Belushi for the new Saturday Night Live program . O 'Donoghue and Belushi recognized that the original Star Trek series itself was not a ratings success during its initial run , but had become much more successful during syndication . Belushi enjoyed the Star Trek series and wanted the part of Captain Kirk . He demonstrated his intense desire to get the role by trimming his sideburns to closely resemble Kirk 's facial appearance in the original series . They worked together on the sketch for thirty @-@ days and scheduled it for the final episode of the 1976 season of the show when it would be hosted by Elliott Gould .

 The production values for the set were quite good . The production staff had reproduced an effective @-@ looking replica of the bridge of the U.S.S Enterprise . As the scene began , the viewscreen of the ship depicted the U.S.S Enterprise being pursued by a type of automobile commonly manufactured in the United States . 
 = = = Dress rehearsal = = = 
 Dress rehearsal for the sketch went poorly . During rehearsal , Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying the character of James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner . Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up so that he would look the part . Sketch writer O 'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience . He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek , and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop , but O 'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi would not be able to pull off a comedic performance on this occasion . 
 Donoghue complained directly to Belushi that he thought his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement . Further , actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock ; he did not like the idea of playing second @-@ fiddle to Belushi . During all of the rehearsals , Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character 's role and dominate the scene . Just prior to the actual on @-@ air performance of the sketch , O 'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody . Belushi 's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives so much that they had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether .

 " The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise " first aired during episode 22 of the first season of The NBC variety show , Saturday Night Live on May 29 , 1976 . 
 Immediately upon the conclusion of the sketch , writer Michael O 'Donoghue knew it was an instant success . He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set , off @-@ camera . He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly . As soon as Belushi left the set , O 'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug . On reflection , after the live performance , O 'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk . Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances . 
 In their book Saturday Night : A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live , authors Doug Hill and Jeff <unk> wrote that the sketch was writer Michael O 'Donoghue 's signature success on the television program . In addition , they noted that the staff of Saturday Night Live felt the sketch was among the best routines on the program . 
 After Belushi 's sudden death by drug overdose in 1982 , Judith Jacklin Belushi , the actor 's widow , began to think about putting together a video to commemorate him . The sketch was included on the 1985 Saturday Night Live release of 16 sketches featuring Belushi called The Best of John Belushi , produced by Lorne Michaels and Judith Jacklin Belushi , sold by Warner Home Video in VHS format . 
 Together , Lorne Michaels , Belushi 's brother Jim Belushi , and Judith Jacklin Belushi , reviewed the actor 's comedic sketches from Saturday Night Live to select what were generally considered his best works . In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News on the 1985 VHS release , Belushi 's widow commented she was not sure if her husband had a particular sketch he liked the most , but that he considered the Star Trek parody among his favorites . The Best of John Belushi edition in VHS format sold approximately 200 @,@ 000 copies . It reached number three on Billboard 's Top Videocassettes Sales Chart in February 1986 . 
 The DVD edition of the collected shorts video release by Saturday Night Live was released in 2011 , again under the title The Best of John Belushi .

 Writing for American Humor , academic Robert G. Pielke observed that the sketch was a very well @-@ done , and moving , reflection on NBC management 's fealty to Nielsen ratings and profit . Pielke went on to analyze the sketch and characterized it as an example of Saturday Night Live resisting conformist authority . He commented that an injustice had been wrought by NBC the company , whereas the NBC executives who came to shut down Star Trek were simply pawns in the process . He posited that the U.S.S. Enterprise crew members were against cancelling the television program because their self @-@ worth had become tied to it . Pielke noted that within the confines of the sketch 's plot itself , as each crew member realized there was no option other than cancellation , they each showed their actual identity and humanity . 
 Pielke praised the final scene of the sketch as evocative of the original series and an indictment of capitalism . He wrote that Belushi finished off the sketch with a moving rendition of the introduction to the original Star Trek series , while modifying it slightly to emphasize that NBC 's greed had ended the Enterprise mission . 
 Mother Jones magazine additionally commented upon the key theme of satire over conflict between the critical success of Star Trek and the decision to cancel the program by the studio executives . The magazine noted that writer Michael O 'Donoghue 's work for the sketch was among the highest caliber scripts he had written for Saturday Night Live . Mother Jones found it ironic that in the sketch the Enterprise was defeated not by its traditional enemies such as the Klingons , but by a stupid NBC executive in charge of the network 's programming schedule . 
 Upon re @-@ release of the sketch on the Saturday Night Live compilation DVD titled The Best of John Belushi , Jon Corey wrote for Inside Pulse that the sketch was still one of ten best ever on Saturday Night Live . He pointed out the irony that it was not Khan Noonien Singh or the Klingons that defeated the Enterprise , but an enemy much more powerful — NBC executives . Nick Hartel reviewed the DVD release for DVD Talk , and commented that the sketch 's satire succeeded because it was a surreal form of meta @-@ comedy that dared to criticize NBC management . 
 The New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane reflected on the sketch and Belushi 's performance in 2013 . Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise . He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 would be hard @-@ pressed to imagine a future , thirty @-@ seven @-@ years later , where " Star Trek " was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture . Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk . He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody , while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character . Lane wondered how the " Star Trek " franchise could ever come back from the total deconstruction the SNL skit presented .

 The sketch became an instant cult classic hit among Star Trek and science fiction fans . Captain Kirk actor William Shatner was asked which Star Trek parody was his favorite : Belushi 's impression of himself , or the later satire wherein Shatner appeared on Saturday Night Live in a sketch telling Star Trek fans known as Trekkies to " Get a life " . Shatner said he preferred Belushi 's impression to his own later appearance on the comedy television program . Shatner commented : " I like Belushi 's work as Kirk better than my own " . 
 DeForest Kelley , the actor who portrayed physician Leonard McCoy on Star Trek , was a personal favorite of John Belushi . Belushi had offices on the same lot as Kelley . Kelley overheard Belushi discussing the Saturday Night Live parody of Star Trek with William Shatner , and mentioned to both of them that he had not yet seen the sketch . Belushi immediately escorted Kelley to his office on the lot and had him watch it on videotape . 
 Kelley thoroughly enjoyed it , especially Belushi 's impression of Captain Kirk . He later remarked that he had trouble going back to act on the Star Trek set in a scene opposite Shatner because he could not stop laughing remembering the Saturday Night Live parody and Belushi 's portrayal . Belushi later gave Kelley a signed videotape of the sketch ; he had written " Live Long and Prosper " on the tape . Kelley sent the videotape to close friends when Belushi died because he did not want to hold on to the memento which brought up sad memories of his loss . 
 The 1977 book Saturday Night Live , edited by Anne <unk> and John Head , included a rough version of the plot of the comedic bit , as well as a message from Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in which he effusively praised the sketch . 
 Roddenberry had sent a letter to Elliot Gould on June 3 , 1976 , in which he thanked the actor for the parody and said he would show it to members of the actual Star Trek cast . Roddenberry called the sketch creatively designed with the light comedic touch necessary to pull off an effective satire . Elliott Gould later told The Hollywood Reporter that the success of the sketch inspired Roddenberry to create the first feature film version of his series : Star Trek : The Motion Picture .

 = The Human Centipede ( First Sequence ) = 
 The Human Centipede ( First Sequence ) is a 2009 Dutch film written , directed , and co @-@ produced by Tom Six . The film tells the story of a German surgeon who kidnaps three tourists and joins them surgically , mouth to anus , forming a " human centipede " , a conjoined triplet . It stars Dieter Laser as the creator of the centipede , Dr. Josef Heiter , with Ashley C. Williams , Ashlynn Yennie , and Akihiro Kitamura as his victims . According to Six , the concept of the film arose from a joke he made with friends about punishing a child molester by stitching his mouth to the anus of a " fat truck driver " . Inspiration for the film also came from Nazi medical experiments carried out during World War II , such as the crimes of Josef Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp . 
 When approaching investors prior to filming , Six did not mention the mouth @-@ to @-@ anus aspect of the plot , fearing it would put off potential backers . The financiers of The Human Centipede did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete . The film received generally mixed reviews from mainstream film critics , but it won several accolades at international film festivals . The film was released in the United States on a limited theatrical release on 30 April 2010 . A sequel , entitled Full Sequence , also written and directed by Six , was released in 2011 .

 Lindsay ( Ashley C. Williams ) and Jenny ( Ashlynn Yennie ) , two American tourists in Germany , are drugged and involuntarily detained by crazed surgeon Dr. Josef Heiter ( Dieter Laser ) when they seek help at his house after they get a flat tire . The women awake in a makeshift medical ward . They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver after Heiter informs him he is " not a match " . Heiter secures a new male captive , Japanese tourist Katsuro ( Akihiro Kitamura ) . The doctor explains that he is a world @-@ renowned expert at separating Siamese twins , but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together . He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth @-@ to @-@ anus , so that they share a single digestive system . 
 After Lindsay tries to escape and fails , Heiter explains that he had previously experimented with creating what he called a " three @-@ dog " , also joined mouth @-@ to @-@ anus . However , the three @-@ dog died shortly after surgery . Heiter tells Lindsay that one dog tried to escape and that dog became the middle , thus this caused the most pain to the dog and as punishment for her escape attempt , she will become the middle part of his centipede . Heiter performs the surgery , placing Katsuro at the front , Lindsay in the middle and Jenny at the rear . He removes the front teeth of both women and mutilates the buttocks of both Katsuro and Lindsay in order to provide easier access to the <unk> , to which he hideously stitches and grafts their mouths . During his procedure , he severs the ligaments within his victims ' knees to prevent leg extension , forcing his victims to crawl . He then connects his victims together in a straight line with their mouths surgically attached to the anus of the victim in front of them . 
 Once the operation is complete , Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet , often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious . When Katsuro defecates , Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight . However , he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro ( who , as the front part of the centipede , has his mouth free and is still able to speak ) and the realization that Jenny is dying from septicemia . When two detectives , Kranz ( Andreas <unk> ) and Voller ( Peter Blankenstein ) , visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists , Heiter comes up with an idea to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation ; a four @-@ segment centipede . He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious . After being given the water , the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home . While the detectives leave Heiter 's home , the victims attempt to escape . Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process . Their attempt to escape ultimately fails . Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly , then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard . 
 Upon returning to Heiter 's home , the detectives forcefully conduct separate searches as an injured Heiter hides near his swimming pool . Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter 's victims . Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging , and Heiter stabs him with the scalpel pulled from his leg during Katsuro 's attack . Upon finding Voller dead , Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller 's sidearm . Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head before dying . Back in the house , Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies . Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house , trapped between her deceased fellow captives . Her fate is left unknown . The film ends with the sounds of her sobbing while the camera pans to the roof of the house . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Dieter Laser as Dr Josef Heiter , a retired surgeon who specialised in the separation of conjoined twins , but in retirement is more interested in joining creatures together . Casting for the role of Heiter took place in Berlin , and Six intended to cast Laser before he had even read for the part , after Six saw a DVD of one of Laser 's previous films . Laser had previously appeared in over 60 mostly German @-@ language films , including Der <unk> and Baltic Storm . Upon meeting him in Berlin , Six gave Laser a shot @-@ by @-@ shot explanation of Heiter 's scenes , and Laser , impressed by Six 's dedication and passion , agreed to take part in the film . Laser contributed considerably to the development of Heiter 's character . For example , because Heiter views the " centipede " as his pet , Laser felt that it was important that Heiter appeared naked during a scene in which he swam in full view of his victims , because Laser said " you aren 't ashamed to be naked " around a pet . 
 Ashley C. Williams as Lindsay , an American tourist and the central section of the centipede . Auditioning for the roles of Jenny and Lindsay took place in New York City . Six said during the auditioning process , many actresses walked out of readings in disgust after hearing the full nature of the role . Others thought they would be able to take on the role , but found it was " too much " for them once they got onto their hands and knees behind another actor . Williams expressed concerns about the nudity expected of her in the film , but took the role when she was assured it would be modest and of a non @-@ sexual nature . 
 Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny , the rear section of the centipede . As with Williams , The Human Centipede was Yennie 's first major film role . Yennie was one of several actresses to audition for the role , as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on @-@ screen chemistry with Williams . Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming . Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six , sister of Tom Six and the film 's producer , and did not meet Tom Six , who had viewed tapes of her reading , until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands . Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story , referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation . She also said the story was so realistic it scared her . 
 Akihiro Kitamura as Katsuro , a Japanese tourist and front section of the centipede . Having already acted in or written for a number of films and television shows ( including popular American television series Heroes ) , Kitamura was a relatively experienced actor compared to other cast members . He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director saw him on television and recommended him for the role . The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced . 
 Rene de Wit as Truck Driver , one of Heiter 's victims . De Wit had previously worked with Six in his 2008 film I Love Dries . 
 Andreas <unk> as Detective Kranz , a police officer . 
 Peter Blankenstein as Detective Voller , a police officer .

 The inspiration for the film 's plot came from a joke that writer / director Tom Six once made to his friends about punishing a child molester they saw on TV by stitching his mouth to the anus of an overweight truck driver . Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film , and he began to develop the idea . He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of David Cronenberg and Japanese horror films . Six has said he prefers horror films that are more realistic over " unbelievable " monster films , and said that he gets " a rash from too much political correctness . " Major influences for The Human Centipede were Pier Paolo Pasolini 's controversial 1975 Italian drama film Salò , or the 120 Days of Sodom , which was notable for its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence , sadism , and sexual depravity , as was the work of Japanese director Takashi Miike . Six has also expressed his love of the works of David Lynch . Further inspiration came from Six 's previous work as a director on the Dutch series of Big Brother , where he had been able to observe people who " did crazy things when they were alone and thought they were not ( being ) watched . " 
 Six has stated that The Human Centipede is , to an extent , a reflection on fascism . Dieter Laser , who played the antagonist Dr Heiter , said during the promotion of the film that he felt the guilt of Nazi actions during the war had haunted ordinary Germans for generations , and that as a German whose father participated in the war , he often felt " like a child whose father is in jail for murder . " The inclusion of a German villain came from this , with Six citing both the German invasion of the Netherlands during World War II and the Nazi medical experiments as inspiration . Laser stated in an interview with Clark Collis for Entertainment Weekly that he considered the film a " grotesque [ parody ] about the Nazi psyche " . Heiter 's name was an amalgamation of several Nazi war criminals , his surname ( literally meaning " cheerful " in German ) a combination of the names of Nazi doctors Fetter and Richter , and his first name coming from Josef Mengele , who carried out experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz concentration camp . World War II also played an influence on the nationality of the other main characters who were American and Japanese . Six includes many horror film clichés in the first act , such as a broken @-@ down car , lack of phone signal and very naïve victims . Six did this in an attempt to lull audiences into thinking they are watching a conventional horror film , therefore making Dr Heiter 's treatment of his victims more shocking . 
 Six placed a Japanese male at the front of the centipede for two reasons : first to create a language barrier between the doctor and the centipede . Throughout the film the characters ( with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English ) speak in their native languages only ( subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary ) . Katsuro , as the front part of the centipede , can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay . Secondly , Katsuro 's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film . Six stated in the director 's commentary for The Human Centipede that he has a personal fear of hospitals and doctors , so he stretched out the scene where Heiter explains how he will create the centipede and the subsequent procedure to create his " own nightmare . " 
 While seeking funding for the film , Six pitched the idea of a surgeon who sewed people together . He did not initially reveal that the victims would be joined mouth @-@ to @-@ anus , as he believed this idea would stand no chance of receiving investments . His backers felt that the idea of a surgeon sewing people together was original and Six received funding . However , they did not learn the exact details of the film until it had been completed . Six claimed that they were very happy with the finished film . Before signing on , the actors were given an outline of the storyboard rather than a complete script . They were also shown sketches of how the centipede would be formed . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Although The Human Centipede is set in Germany , principal photography took place in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries ' similar landscapes . Heiter 's home , where most of The Human Centipede takes place , was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team . The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film , but by other houses . This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot . Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming , for example , a cinema room was converted to form Heiter 's basement operating theatre , with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital . The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six , which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house . The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam . The film was shot almost entirely in sequence , which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film . The opening scene , which only featured Laser and de Wit , was shot on the last day of filming . 
 Laser remained in character as Heiter throughout the filming process , often shouting at the rest of the cast on set , but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation . He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself , eating mostly fruit . He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character 's outfits from his personal wardrobe . Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore , which was bought by Laser , was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors . Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film . For example , when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims , Katsuro 's dialogue was improvised , which pleased Laser . During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura ( Katsuro ) , leading to a fight on set between the actors . The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming , in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him . Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay , which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue . 
 The Nazi influence behind Heiter led to the use of classical music when the doctor is " training " his centipede . The music was deliberately played at low quality to simulate the music coming from a loudspeaker , in much the same way as music was sometimes played in Nazi concentration camps . Many of the sound effects in The Human Centipede were created by manipulating meat . For example , the sound of a nose being broken was made by snapping bones within cuts of raw meat . Due to the discomfort of spending long periods on their hands and knees , the actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of each day of filming . Yennie stated that she and Williams experienced jaw pain from holding a bit in their mouths during filming , but overall she did not feel that the physical side of filming had been excessively difficult . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 The Human Centipede contains relatively few gory images ; little of the surgical procedure is depicted directly , no excrement is shown on screen , and according to Kim Newman in Empire , it is " never quite as outrageous as it threatens to be . " Six stated that he wanted the film to be as authentic as possible and claimed to have consulted a Dutch surgeon during the creation and filming process , resulting in the film being " 100 % medically accurate . " Six said that the surgeon initially wanted nothing to do with his film , as he felt Six was " crazy " and the idea had " nothing to do with medical science . " However , the surgeon changed his mind and decided that he in fact liked the idea , and so came up with a method of creating a human centipede . Six has claimed that the central and rear members of the centipede could survive for years by supplementing their diet with an IV drip . The special effects team was led by a father and son team , Rob <unk> and son Erik . They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon . The actors who made up the centipede wore hardened underwear , compared by Yennie to shorts , which had a rubber grip for the actors to wear for the actor behind on which to bite , creating the illusion of the mouth @-@ to @-@ anus connection . Six kept secret how the centipede would be formed as long as possible , and Yennie claimed that even her make @-@ up artist did not know , asking Yennie what kind of " suit " the actors would be wearing . 
 When Heiter is operating on his victims , Jenny 's teeth were digitally removed in post @-@ production . However , other effects were relatively simple to create . Heiter 's " three dog " was created by <unk> an image of three Rottweilers to create an image of dogs joined together . Colour grading was used extensively throughout the production of The Human Centipede . For example , at the end of the film when Lindsay is left between the dead bodies of Jenny and Katsuro , their skin tones were lightened to further emphasise that they were dead and Lindsay was still alive . 
 The rain when Jenny and Lindsay 's car breaks down was added digitally in post @-@ production . The filmmakers had not been granted permission to film at the roadside location , but went ahead against the authorities ' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene . When Heiter 's window is repaired after Lindsay 's escape attempt , the use of a tracking shot through the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass . The film contains a large number of long tracking shots ; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films .

 During promotion for The Human Centipede , press materials claimed that the film was " 100 % medically accurate " . Six and the producers frequently stated that the film had been described as " the most horrific film ever made , " and many writers , such as Karina Longworth of LA Weekly magazine and Jay Stone of the Calgary Herald described the film as torture porn . Roger Ebert , writing in the Chicago Sun @-@ Times stated that he felt the film had been " deliberately intended to inspire incredulity , nausea and hopefully outrage . " However , writing in The Guardian , David Cox noted that he had been unable to trace the source of this quote as the " most horrific film ever made " and had contacted Six to attempt to ascertain the origin of this judgement . Six claimed that the statement had originally been made by The Sun newspaper in the United Kingdom . However , Cox was unable to trace any article making this claim . When asked by Cox as to what Six regarded as the " most horrific " film , Six stated he in fact believed it to be Pier Paolo Pasolini 's Salò , or the 120 Days of Sodom .

 The Human Centipede was released in the United States without an MPAA rating . It was released theatrically in New York City on 30 April 2010 and had a limited release in the US shortly afterward , distributed by IFC Films . Throughout 2009 , the film was included in several film festivals around the world including the London <unk> Film Festival , Leeds International Film Festival , Sitges Film Festival , and Screamfest Horror Film Festival . Six remarked on how many film festival audiences reacted strongly to the film , sometimes almost vomiting in the cinema aisles . To Six 's amusement , Spanish audiences often found the film funny , and laughed throughout screenings . Six claimed that the " buzz " surrounding the film led to several studios approaching him to discuss its distribution . IFC Films has a history of releasing unconventional horror films , having previously distributed the Norwegian Nazi @-@ zombie feature Dead Snow and the 2009 release Antichrist . The Human Centipede 's US gross was $ 181 @,@ 467 , and worldwide takings amounted to $ 252 @,@ 207 . 
 The film was passed uncut by the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) and released with an 18 certificate , receiving a limited release in the UK on 20 August 2010 . It was distributed by Bounty Films .

 The Human Centipede received mixed reviews . Review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 49 % ' Rotten ' rating , based upon 91 reviews , with an average rating of 5 @.@ 1 out of 10 ; the general consensus states : " Grotesque , visceral and hard to ( ahem ) swallow , this surgical horror doesn 't quite earn its stripes because the gross @-@ outs overwhelm and devalue everything else . " At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film received an average score of 33 based on 15 reviews . 
 Giving the film three stars out of five , Empire writer Kim Newman stated that " underneath an extremely repulsive concept , this is a relatively conventional horror movie . " Variety Magazine writer Peter <unk> criticised the film 's lack of any form of social commentary , stating that it could not " be bothered to expand upon its unpleasant premise , inviting audiences to revel in its sick humor by favoring Dr. Heiter ... and characterizing the victims as shallow expendables . " Writing in Entertainment Weekly , Clark Collis was broadly positive about Dieter Laser 's performance as the Doctor , and praised Six 's direction , saying Six " has put together his nightmare yarn with <unk> care and precision . " Collis said The Human Centipede was " without question one of the most disgusting horror films ever made . " Writing in The Guardian , Peter Bradshaw gave the film three out of five , saying that whilst " entirely deplorable and revolting " the film was " sort of brilliant " . Total Film writer Jamie Russell gave the film four stars out of five , calling it " Shocking , funny , disturbing ... a throwback to the glory days of Cronenberg . " 
 Sukhdev Sandhu in The Daily Telegraph was generally negative about the film , stating , " The Human Centipede has its moments , but they 're largely obscured by umpteen holes in the plot as well as by reams of exposition " and that it was " an ultimately underwhelming affair that 's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves . " The New York Times review by Jeannette <unk> noted that whether the film was " a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics , the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads , both of whose voices could strip paint . " Writing in the Chicago Sun Times , Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating ( not to be confused with awarding it zero stars ) , stating , " I am required to award stars to movies I review . This time , I refuse to do it . The star rating system is unsuited to this film . Is the movie good ? Is it bad ? Does it matter ? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don 't shine . " 
 Critics and a doctor have dismissed Six 's claim that the film was " 100 percent medically accurate " as " ludicrous " and " rubbish " . Dr John Cameron , speaking to TV3 News in New Zealand gave an interview about the feasibility of a human centipede , stating how he believed it would be difficult for a join between different people to heal and form a connection , and how the centipede would quickly die from lack of nutrition . John Martin , a former Hollywood film executive and CEO of Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas said Six 's claims of 100 percent medical accuracy should be viewed with reference to the kind of shock gimmicks that film producers had long used to attract attention . Martin compared Six 's claims to those of Kroger Babb and William Castle who had also made " grand promises " about what they were putting on screen in a bid to lure audiences .

 Despite mixed reviews , the film won several awards in 2009 during advance screenings at various international horror film festivals , including Best Picture / Movie at Fantastic Fest ( Austin , Texas ) , Screamfest Horror Film Festival ( Los Angeles ) , and the Sainte Maxime International Horror Film Festival .

 While promoting The Human Centipede , Six stated that he had started work on a sequel to First Sequence , titled The Human Centipede 2 ( Full Sequence ) . Shooting on a similar budget to the first film , Six stated the sequel would be a much more graphic and disturbing film ; First Sequence being " My Little Pony compared with part two . " Yennie stated at the May 2010 Weekend of Horrors that the sequel would contain " the blood and shit " that viewers did not see in the first film . The plot of Full Sequence involved a centipede made from 12 people , featured a largely British cast and was given the tag @-@ line " 100 % medically inaccurate " . 
 The plot of Full Sequence involves a man who after becoming sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of First Sequence decides to create his own human centipede . The film had been planned for a DVD release in the United Kingdom . However , upon submitting the film to the BBFC for classification , the film was rejected due to content that was " sexually violent and potentially obscene " . The BBFC 's report criticised the film as making " little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film as anything other than objects to be brutalised , degraded and mutilated for the amusement and arousal of the central character , as well as for the pleasure of the audience " and that the film was potentially in breach of the Obscene Publications Act , meaning its distribution in the UK would be illegal . Bounty Films , the UK distributor , appealed the decision , and the film was eventually passed with an 18 certificate in October 2011 . To achieve the 18 rating , thirty @-@ two cuts were made from the film , removing two minutes and thirty @-@ seven seconds from the original version .

 A number of parodies of the film have been made . A pornographic parody , directed by Lee Roy Myers and titled The Human <unk> , was released in September 2010 .

The South Park episode " <unk> " saw character Kyle Broflovski unwittingly agreeing to become a part of a " Human <unk> " after failing to read the full details of an Apple user license agreement .

 Porcupine is the third studio album by the English post @-@ punk band Echo & the Bunnymen . First released on 4 February 1983 , it became the band 's highest charting release when it reached number two on the UK Albums Chart despite initially receiving poor reviews . It also reached number 137 on the American Billboard 200 , number 85 on the Canadian RPM 100 Albums and number 24 on the Swedish chart . In 1984 the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry . Porcupine included the singles " The Back of Love " and " The Cutter " . 
 The album was recorded at Trident Studios in London , Rockfield Studios in South Wales and Amazon Studios in Liverpool . It was produced by Ian Broudie , who was credited as " <unk> " and who had co @-@ produced the band 's first album , 1980 's Crocodiles , and their second single , " Rescue " . After being rejected by the band 's label , the album was re @-@ recorded with Shankar providing strings . It was originally released as an LP in 1983 before being reissued on CD in 1988 . The album was again reissued on CD in 2003 , along with the other four of the band 's first five studio albums , having been remastered and expanded . A VHS video called Porcupine – An Atlas Adventure was also released containing six promotional videos of tracks from the album .

 Following the release of Heaven Up Here in 1981 , Echo & the Bunnymen had difficulty writing new material for their next album despite rehearsing five days each week at The Ministry , their rehearsal room in Liverpool . While lead singer Ian McCulloch still wanted them to be the best band in the world , bass player Les Pattinson was expressing his weariness with the music industry , drummer Pete de Freitas produced and played drums on Liverpool band The Wild Swans ' debut single " Revolutionary Spirit " , and lead guitarist Will Sergeant recorded a solo album of instrumental music called Themes for ' Grind ' ( 1982 ) . 
 On 27 January 1982 Echo & the Bunnymen recorded their fourth session for British disc jockey John Peel 's radio show on BBC Radio 1 . Of the tracks recorded , " Smack in the Middle " was renamed and became " Higher Hell " on the album , while " Taking Advantage " was renamed " The Back of Love " and became the band 's third single which was also included on the album . Ian Broudie , who had co @-@ produced 1980 's Crocodiles and who was Sergeant 's flat @-@ mate , was chosen to produce " The Back of Love " and the band 's third album , whose working title was The Happy Loss . The single , which became the band 's first UK Top 20 hit single , was recorded in early 1982 at Trident Studios in Soho , London . This was unusual as the band 's manager , Bill Drummond , had previously been keen to keep the band away from the temptations of London . The recording session for " The Back of Love " went well , but the relationship between the band members was strained , with them either not speaking to each other or , when they did , arguing . Drummond was aware of the tensions within the band and so arranged a tour in Scotland for April 1982 . This was done in an effort to make the band work harder , write some songs , and to communicate with each other . Drummond 's plan failed to work as following the tour there was still tension between the band members . Two other album tracks – " Clay " and " My White Devil " – were first played during the tour of Scotland . 
 Following the release of " The Back of Love " on 21 May 1982 , the band spent the summer , first playing at the inaugural WOMAD festival , and then playing at various European music festivals . After the summer the band resumed recording the album at Rockfield Studios in South Wales – which had been used for the band 's first two albums – and also at Amazon Studios in Liverpool . Recording the album was a slow process , de Freitas said , " Porcupine was very hard to actually write and record [ ... ] Heaven Up Here was pure confidence , we did it really quickly ; we had a great time doing it – but this one was like we had to drag it out of ourselves . " McCulloch later said that when recording the album , the mood between the band members was " horrible " . 
 When presented with the finished album , WEA rejected it as " too uncommercial " . The band agreed to re @-@ record the album , despite Sergeant 's complaints . Using the original version of the album as a blueprint , the follow @-@ up recording sessions went more smoothly . Drummond brought Shankar back to add strings to the other tracks on the album . It was these sessions that produced the band 's next single , " The Cutter " , which was released in January 1983 and went on to become the band 's first Top 10 hit .

 After Echo & the Bunnymen had finished recording Porcupine they played a free show in early November 1982 for 20 @,@ 000 people at Sefton Park in Liverpool . Following this , WEA asked for three music videos and album art for the new album . The band 's lighting engineer Bill Butt was chosen to direct the videos and Brian Griffin was chosen to take the photographs for the album 's cover – as he had done for the band 's two previous albums . With a budget of £ 16 @,@ 000 Butt decided that it would be possible to get the photographs for the album cover and also to produce a half @-@ hour film . Deciding that he wanted the videos to reflect the frigid feel of the music on the album , Butt chose to shoot the videos in Scotland . However , it was not certain that there would be enough snow in Scotland during November so Iceland was chosen as the location to shoot the videos . 
 Filming took place on and near the frozen <unk> waterfall near Reykjavík . Feeling it was a dangerous process , McCulloch said in 1993 , " If we had slipped there wasn 't anything for hundreds of feet below us . " In 2001 Griffin said , " [ ... ] the sun barely appeared the whole time we were there . To walk , stand up , or just think seemed a massive effort . " Despite the danger the filming proved its worth when the British music magazine Q said in 2001 , " The Porcupine cover is the epitome of rock band as heroic archetype – young men on some ill @-@ defined but glorious mission , one easily as timeless as the stars and the sea . " The filming was finished in December 1982 with the band performing songs from the album at their rehearsal room at The Ministry . Butt interspersed this with clips from the 1929 Russian documentary The Man With the Movie Camera and he also projected psychedelic watercolour effects onto the band . A VHS video was subsequently released by Castle <unk> in 1983 called Porcupine – An Atlas Adventure which contained the six music videos – " In Bluer Skies " , " The Cutter " , " My White Devil " , " Porcupine " , " Heads Will Roll " and " The Back of Love " . 
 Describing the album cover , journalist Dave Rimmer wrote in British music magazine Smash Hits , " Iceland does seem an appropriate location for this group . It 's isolated , cold , bleak and fits perfectly with the moody image they 've attracted to themselves . "

 After WEA rejected the first version of the album , Shankar – who had played strings on " The Back of Love " – was brought back by Drummond to add strings to the remainder of the album in an effort to give it a brighter production and to build on the success of the strings used on the single . When recording " The Cutter " , Sergeant had asked Shankar if he could suggest the melody from Cat Stevens ' 1967 hit " Matthew and Son " . 
 In 1984 McCulloch said , " I think Porcupine was a classic autobiographical album , the most honest thing that I 'd ever written or sung . " Talking about how the album made him feel , he went on to say , " I found the material from it really heavy to play – like , really oppressive . That 's the only reason why I didn 't like the album . The songs were great but it didn 't make me happy . " He also said , " A lot of songs are about coming to terms with the opposites in me . "

 Porcupine was first released as an LP by Korova in the United Kingdom on 4 February 1983 . It was subsequently released in the United States by Sire Records on 23 February 1983 . The original album had ten tracks with five tracks on each side . Like Echo & the Bunnymen 's previous album , the album cover was designed by Martyn Atkins and the photography was by Brian Griffin . The album was released on CD on 7 April 1988 . 
 Along with the other four of the band 's first five albums , Porcupine was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 – these releases were marketed as 25th anniversary editions . Seven bonus tracks were added to the album : " Fuel " was the second B @-@ side track on the 12 @-@ inch version of " The Back of Love " ; alternate versions of " The Cutter " , " My White Devil " , " Porcupine " , " Ripeness " and " Gods Will Be Gods " which were all early versions recorded during the album 's sessions ; and " Never Stop ( Discotheque ) " the 12 @-@ inch version of the non @-@ album single which was released after Porcupine . The alternate versions of " My White Devil " , " Porcupine " and " Ripeness " had all previously been unissued . The reissued album was produced by Andy Zax and Bill Inglot . 
 There were two tracks from the original Porcupine album which had been released as singles . The first of these was " The Back of Love " which had been released on 21 May 1982 . The second single was " The Cutter " which was released on 14 January 1983 . " Never Stop ( Discotheque ) " , which was originally a non @-@ album single when it was released on 8 July 1983 , was subsequently included on the 2003 remastered version of the album as a bonus track .

 Following the release of Porcupine in 1983 , NME reviewer Barney Hoskyns gave the album a negative review . Hoskyns wrote , " Porcupine is the distressing occasion of an important and exciting rock group becoming ensnared by its own strongest points , a dynamic force striving fruitlessly to escape the brilliant track that trails behind it . " Hoskyns likened the sound of the album to the band " turning on their own greatest ' hits ' and savaging them " . Hoskyns also criticised McCulloch 's lyrics and the general mood of the album , noting , " Only on ' Porcupine ' itself do the various strains of despair coalesce " , and dismissed the entire second side of the album , saying it " horrifies the more for its uniform lack of inspiration , for the fact that every number cops direct from earlier songs without preserving anything of their energy or invention " . Record reviewer Wayne King similarly commented that the album reused many motifs , such as Ian McCullough 's octave jumps , from their previous albums . While he praised the opening tracks " The Cutter " and " Back of Love " , he remarked that Porcupine as a whole was not nearly as good an album as Echo and the Bunnymen 's live performances showed they were capable of . 
 In a review of the original release on Allmusic , Porcupine was described as a " solid outing " , a " noticeably better listen than its predecessor , Heaven Up Here " and " well worth hearing " . When reviewing the remastered 2003 version the review was expanded to add that new release was " a very well done expansion of an already fine album " . Blender magazine described the album in a review on their website as " impossibly exciting pop @-@ rock " and Pitchfork called the album " the band 's definitive statement " and described the track " The Back of Love " as " the astonishing highlight of the group 's career " . The album appeared in the 1983 end of year critics ' lists for both Melody Maker , where it was listed at number nine , and NME , where it was listed at number 32 . The album is also listed in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die . 
 The album reached number 2 on the UK Albums Chart , number 137 on the American Billboard 200 , number 85 on the Canadian RPM 100 Albums , and number 24 on the Swedish albums chart . Having sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies of the album in the UK , Echo & they Bunnymen were awarded with a gold disc by the British Phonographic Industry . Of the singles from the album , " The Back of Love " reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and " The Cutter " reached number 8 . " The Back of Love " also became the band 's first single to make the Irish Singles Chart when it reached number 24 , while " The Cutter " reached number 10 . The single " Never Stop ( Discotheque ) " reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart and number 8 on the Irish Singles Chart .

 = The Get Up Kids = 
 The Get Up Kids are an American rock band from Kansas City , Missouri . Formed in 1995 , the band was a major player in the mid @-@ 1990s emo scene , otherwise known as the " second wave " of emo music . As they gained prominence , they began touring with bands such as Green Day and Weezer before becoming headliners themselves , eventually embarking on international tours of Japan and Europe . They founded Heroes & Villains Records , an imprint of the successful indie rock label Vagrant Records . While the imprint was started to release albums by The Get Up Kids , it served as a launching pad for several side @-@ projects such as The New Amsterdams and Reggie and the Full Effect . 
 The Get Up Kids were viewed throughout their existence as a prototypical emo band , having been major players in the Midwest emo movement of the mid @-@ 1990s . Their second album Something to Write Home About remains their most widely acclaimed album , and is considered to be one of the quintessential albums of the second @-@ wave emo movement . However , like many early emo bands , The Get Up Kids , sought to dissociate themselves with the term , as it was considered dismissive to be seen as an " emo band . " The band departed heavily from their established style with the release of their 2002 album On a Wire , which saw the band take on a much more layered , alternative rock sound . Years later , guitarist Jim Suptic even apologized for having the influence they did on many of the modern third @-@ wave emo bands , commenting that " [ t ] he punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different . It 's like glam rock now ... If this is the world we helped create , then I apologize . " 
 Due to internal conflicts , the band broke up in 2005 . Three years later , the band reunited to support the tenth anniversary re @-@ release of Something to Write Home About , and soon afterward entered the studio to write new material . In early 2010 , the band released Simple Science , their first release in six years , followed in 2011 by the full @-@ length There Are Rules .

 While in high school , Ryan Pope , Rob Pope , and Jim Suptic formed a short @-@ lived band called Kingpin . Matt Pryor had been writing songs since he was a teenager , and was playing in a band called Secret Decoder Ring . Following the demise of the two bands in 1995 , The Get Up Kids were formed . The band originally planned on calling themselves " The Suburban Get Up Kids " , until reasoning that there were fewer band names beginning with the letter ' G ' than there are with the letter ' S ' , and that therefore they were more likely to be noticed in a record store if their name began with a ' G ' . The band was formed on October 14 , 1995 on Suptic 's 18th birthday . 
 At the time the lineup consisted of Pryor on guitar and lead vocals , Suptic on guitar , Rob Pope on bass , and Thomas Becker on drums . However , Becker soon left for college in California , and was replaced by Nathan Shay , who was attending school with Suptic at the Kansas City Art Institute . In 1995 , Pryor , Suptic , and friend Kevin <unk> saved money to self @-@ release " Shorty / The Breathing Method " , their first 7 @-@ inch . However , due to an unwillingness to tour , Shay was replaced by Robert 's younger brother Ryan in April 1996 . The band became increasingly popular in the burgeoning underground Midwestern music scene , forming strong relationships with bands such as Rocket Fuel Is The Key , Coalesce and Braid . After the " Shorty " 7 @-@ inch , the band released " A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts " on Contrast Records . Encouraged by interest stirred by the band 's first 7 @-@ inch , they recorded their first EP , Woodson . Two songs of which were released by Contrast Records as a 7 @-@ inch titled " A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts " or more commonly known as " The <unk> 7 " , with Doghouse Records releasing a CD @-@ EP version which included the songs from both Woodson and A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts as well as the two song Woodson 7 " . After Woodson , Doghouse approached the band with a two @-@ album contract , offering them $ 4 @,@ 000 to record their first full @-@ length album . 
 = = = Four Minute Mile ( 1997 – 1998 ) = = = 
 After signing to Doghouse , the band drove to Chicago to record their debut full @-@ length album with producer Bob Weston of Shellac . The album was recorded in only two days , with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got out of school and finishing in the early hours of Sunday morning . Two months after recording the album , the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan 's high school graduation . 
 It was on that tour that the band met James Dewees , the new drummer for Coalesce while the bands were playing together in Wilkes @-@ Barre , Pennsylvania . After the show , the members of the two bands became close friends , eventually leading them to record a split 7 @-@ inch produced by Ed Rose entitled " The Get Up Kids / Coalesce " . For the split , each band covered one of the other 's songs in their own style . Coalesce did a post @-@ hardcore cover of " Second Place " , and The Get Up Kids recorded a power @-@ pop rendition of " Harvest of Maturity " . 
 A few months later , the band released their debut full @-@ length record Four Minute Mile , bringing a great deal of attention from critics , fans and labels alike . The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour of Europe and the band rapidly created an overseas fanbase . 
 While the band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention , they became unhappy with Doghouse Records ' ability to keep up with the increasing popularity of the band . The Get Up Kids announcement to leave Doghouse Records brought interest from prominent record labels including Sub Pop , Geffen and Mojo Records . The band made a decision to sign to Mojo , but before the contracts were signed , they began to have second thoughts . The main issue was over the label 's insistence on owning merchandising rights , a large source of the band 's income . Moreover , the band was insulted the label requested they re @-@ record " Don 't Hate Me " from Four Minute Mile for their next record , feeling that the label believed it was " the best that [ they could ] write " . Before the deal with Mojo was official , the band met Rich Egan , founder of Los Angeles @-@ based Vagrant Records . He convinced the band to sign to Vagrant instead , offering them $ 50 @,@ 000 to record a second album , as well as their own imprint , Heroes & Villains Records . 
 = = = Something to Write Home About ( 1999 – 2001 ) = = = 
 In 1998 , James Dewees recorded his first solo album under the pseudonym Reggie and the Full Effect . While Dewees wrote the songs himself , he asked Matt Pryor and Rob Pope to help record some of the instrumentals . The resulting album , Greatest Hits 1984 @-@ 1987 leaned heavily on the use of synthesizer keyboards for its sound . Their work together on the Reggie and the Full Effect album led Pryor to invite Dewees to collaborate with The Get Up Kids on Red Letter Day , a five @-@ track EP produced by Ed Rose to fulfill their two @-@ record deal with Doghouse . The cleaner , more focused sound of the EP provided the chance to experiment with the inclusion of keyboards and acts as a sonic bridge between the raw sound of Four Minute Mile and the more dynamic , produced style of their next studio album . 
 After the release of Red Letter Day , Dewees became a full @-@ time member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex <unk> . Before the album went into production , Vagrant Records co @-@ owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents , who had mortgaged their house in order to fund the production of the album . On September 21 , 1999 , the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records . The album 's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles . Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band 's only ' true ' emo album , as the album 's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre . Furthermore , the album single @-@ handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country , selling over 140 @,@ 000 copies after its release . Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo , but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it . The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands . At the same time , the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene 's DIY ethic . 
 The Get Up Kids toured relentlessly for almost three years in promotion of the record . As well as touring Europe , Japan , and Australia , they shared bills with acts such as Green Day , The Anniversary , Koufax , Hot Rod Circuit , Jebediah , Weezer and Ozma . Their 2000 tour with The Anniversary and Koufax was sponsored by Napster . Their fanbase kept expanding through word of mouth . Venues booked months in advance could no longer hold the demand by the time the band arrived in town and fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform . To capitalize on anticipation for the band 's next album , Vagrant Records released a rarities compilation Eudora in 2001 . Eudora consisted of alternate takes , covers , and B @-@ sides since the band 's formation . Likewise , Doghouse released a re @-@ mastered edition of Four Minute Mile and a compilation entitled The EPs : Woodson and Red Letter Day , combining the two Doghouse @-@ owned EPs on one compact disc .

 After three years of touring for Something to Write Home About , the band was beginning to feel burned @-@ out , and wished to depart from the upbeat power @-@ pop sound with which they had become associated . They also wanted to find a new producer to challenge them creatively , approaching Nigel Godrich and Gil Norton with offers , although both declined . Finally , the band settled on Scott Litt , best known for his work with R.E.M. and Nirvana . The band 's third studio album , On a Wire was released on May 14 , 2002 , debuting a more measured , alternative style . Just as Something to Write Home About alienated some fans with its more produced sound , On a Wire was criticized by fans who were disappointed with the album 's softer musical direction . Specifically , the reviewer for Alternative Press wrote " Unfortunately , the visceral energy of their early days is lost in their newfound maturity . " 
 While many fans were upset with this sudden change of direction , the album was generally well received by mainstream publications . Entertainment Weekly was highly positive , writing that " This is the group at their best . " In his review of the album , Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote " On a Wire quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them . <unk> vocals , racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing , spacious guitars and prominent keyboards . . . The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves . What they find is often subtle , less visceral but far more tender . " The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band 's popularity as a whole . The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released , only to find that they had far less support from both their fans and their record label . Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About , Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio , Dashboard Confessional , and Saves the Day . The Get Up Kids were no longer the label 's top priority , and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of On a Wire . In an interview with Alternative Press , lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on On a Wire seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About , allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned . In an interview , Pryor confessed that he did not think that " anyone , including Vagrant , gave that record a chance " . Even though they had avoided the term since its inception , it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term " emo " , a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop @-@ oriented acts . Pryor commented on the album , saying " We really didn 't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not , we were really confident that we were going to kill this ' emo ' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust . " 
 = = = Guilt Show ( 2003 – 2004 ) = = = 
 In 2003 the band began recording their fourth studio album . The album would be the first recorded in Black Lodge Studios in Eudora , Kansas , a studio renovated and owned by the Pope brothers and producer Ed Rose . The writing process for the album was different from their past efforts , as most of the songs were written by only three of the band members . In the early stages of writing , Jim Suptic was on his honeymoon . James Dewees was involved in a difficult divorce , and much of his creative efforts inspired by those events went into the fourth Reggie and the Full Effect album Songs Not to Get Married To . While this led to a less collaborative effort than in the past , it gave the Pope brothers a more substantial role in writing than ever before . In an interview with Alternative Press , Pryor confirmed the song " Never Be Alone " was written by Rob Pope about his 2003 divorce from The Anniversary keyboardist Adrianne Verhoeven . 
 This fractured approach to the writing process began to strain relationships in the band , at one point leading Suptic to consider quitting the band . Pryor drew lyrical inspiration from the lives of friends and people he knew , extracting stories of abuse , betrayal and guilt . The album 's lyrics also delve into incidents of adultery ( " Wouldn 't Believe It " , " How Long Is Too Long " ) and the album 's first single " The One You Want " is said to be about a woman who Pryor says " Sucks the soul out of people " . 
 In March 2004 , the band released their fourth studio album Guilt Show , produced by Ed Rose . Sonically , the album combined the more measured , sophisticated sound of On a Wire with the frenetic style of their earlier work . Guilt Show , which was titled after a misreading of a flier saying " Quilt show " , was very well received both critically and commercially . The more pop @-@ driven tone of the album reunited the band with many fans who were disenchanted after On a Wire , while also staying close enough to the evolution of the last album to interest newer fans and critics . However , their return was overshadowed by the booming popularity of other contemporary emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional , who invited the band to open for them on the 2004 Honda Civic Tour . 
 = = = Breakup and solo activity ( 2004 – 2008 ) = = = 
 Over the course of the tour with Dashboard Confessional , relationships between the band members continued to decline . The band 's live shows had deteriorated , and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times . Matt Pryor 's wife had recently given birth to their first child , and being away from his family had made him irritable and standoffish . After the Honda Civic tour ended , the band embarked on their world tour , including stops throughout Europe , Japan and Australia . However , their live performance hit an all @-@ time low , with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs . 
 At one tour date in England , the tensions came to a head when Ryan Pope confronted Pryor over his recent despondence , leading to a band meeting where Pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment to the rest of the group . After some discussion , the band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band . Once the tour ended , the band went on an unofficial hiatus , not playing as a group until the next January , when they played a show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence , Kansas to celebrate the band 's tenth anniversary . The show was recorded and released the following May as the band 's first live album , Live ! @ The Granada Theater . 
 On Tuesday , March 8 , 2005 , The Get Up Kids announced that after ten years , they were calling it quits . They embarked on a national farewell tour , ending the band after a sold @-@ out show on July 2 , 2005 in their hometown of Kansas City , Missouri at the Uptown Theater . 
 After the band 's split , the Pope brothers took over management of Black Lodge Studios , the recording studio that the band formed with the recording of Guilt Show , alongside longtime producing partner Ed Rose . The brothers joined Koufax for a short stint , before splitting for different projects . Rob was a founding member of Lawrence , Kansas group White Whale , releasing the 2006 album WWI to moderate acclaim before becoming a full @-@ time member of Spoon , while Ryan became the drummer for the Lawrence @-@ based experimental rock band The Roman Numerals . 
 Matt Pryor continued as part of The New Amsterdams , an acoustic alt @-@ country group he had formed in 2000 , expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving @-@ door lineup . In 2007 he formed The Terrible Twos , a children 's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records . Regarding the decision to make a children 's album directly after the split , Pryor said " I wanted to do it anyway because I have kids and I want to write songs for them , but nobody is going to be like ' this isn 't as good as the old stuff . ' It 's immune to punk criticism . " In July 2008 , he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of Confidence Man , an alt @-@ country release similar in sound to The New Amsterdams . After his second album , May Day , Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding The New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career , concluding the band 's tenure with the release of <unk> , a B @-@ sides recording . 
 Jim Suptic went on to form Blackpool Lights with former members of <unk> and The Creature Comforts . The band released their debut album This Town 's Disaster in 2006 , consisted largely of songs Suptic wrote for The Get Up Kids but never recorded . The album was released on Curb Appeal Records , an independent label Suptic founded with former Get Up Kids collaborator and local musician Alex <unk> . The label released albums by Smoking Popes and The New Amsterdams , but dissolved sometime in 2008 . The exact reasons why were never revealed , but Suptic said only that it " blew up in [ his ] face . " After the closure of the label , Suptic began working at Home Depot to support his family . 
 After the breakup of The Get Up Kids , James Dewees toured with New Found Glory as their touring keyboardist , having been featured on their 2003 album Catalyst . While he was touring , his ongoing struggles with alcohol and drug abuse worsened . After moving to New York City , he began to attend rehab , a process which would inspire the fifth Reggie and the Full Effect album , Last Stop : Crappy Town . After another brief tour opening for Hellogoodbye in 2006 , he joined My Chemical Romance as their full @-@ time touring keyboardist .

 In late August and September 2008 , while Dewees was touring with Reggie and the Full Effect , he began making hints that The Get Up Kids would be reuniting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the band 's second album Something to Write Home About . The reunion was finally confirmed by a post on the official music blog of The Kansas City Star , confirming rumors that the band would be playing a surprise reunion show at The Record Bar in Kansas City on November 16 , 2008 . According to the article , the band had made the decision over the summer and had Dewees intentionally leak the information to gauge fan interest . 
 The reunion show was officially announced on Friday , November 14 , along with the official confirmation of the album re @-@ release and a 2009 national tour . The tenth anniversary edition of the album includes a code to download bonus demo tracks from the original recording of Something To Write Home About from the Vagrant Records website , and a DVD containing a band retrospective and other content , including archive footage , and their live performance from March 13 , 2009 at Liberty Hall in Lawrence . The show took place Sunday , November 16 , 2008 at the record bar in Kansas City . The band played their album Something To Write Home About from beginning to end , as well as a six song encore . 
 In the summer of 2009 , they returned to Black Lodge studios to record their first new material in five years , recording twelve tracks intended to be released as three EPs over the course of a year . On April 13 , 2010 the band released the first EP Simple Science on Flyover Records . 
 After the release of Simple Science , the band decided to combine the remaining tracks — along with three more newly recorded songs — into a new full @-@ length album , There Are Rules . They also confirmed that the album would not be released on Vagrant Records , who had released their previous three albums , but on their own Quality Hill Records . The album was produced by Ed Rose and mixed by Bob Weston , who produced the band 's debut album . There Are Rules was released on January 25 , 2011 , and was supported by a co @-@ headlining tour with Saves The Day . 
 = = Influence = = 
 The Get Up Kids have had a lasting impact on the music scene , having been cited as inspirations to several prominent bands and artists . Blink @-@ 182 bassist and singer Mark Hoppus is a vocal fan , having proposed to his wife to The Get Up Kids song " I 'll Catch You . " They were also a major influence on the rest of the band , even at their peak popularity around the release of Take Off Your Pants and Jacket . The members of Fall Out Boy cite The Get Up Kids ' influence , particularly their album Four Minute Mile . In a 2005 interview with Alternative Press , Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz stated that the band had a huge influence on him and the other members of Fall Out Boy . " There should be a How To Be a Pop @-@ Punk Kid starter kit with bands like Get Up Kids , so kids would know whose shoulders bands like us are standing on . Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids . " 
 New Jersey based act Midtown has stated in interviews that they were heavily influenced by The Get Up Kids , among other groups . The Early November band members were all fans of , and influenced by , The Get Up Kids . The Early November song " Baby Blue " includes the line " I don 't want you to love me anymore " , a direct reference to the Get Up Kids song " No Love " both lyrically and melodically . The band Hellogoodbye have been vocal fans of the band and while on tour with Reggie and the Full Effect in 2007 , two years after the breakup of The Get Up Kids , Hellogoodbye invited James Dewees and Matt Pryor onstage with them , and proceeded to back them in a cover of The Get Up Kids ' song " Action & Action " . The Canadian post @-@ hardcore band Silverstein has cited the Get Up Kids as a major influence , and covered their song Coming Clean for a split 7 " with August Burns Red in 2013 . Claudio Sanchez of Coheed and Cambria cited Something to Write Home About as one of the albums that the band listened to and during the recording of their breakout album In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth : 3 . 
 Despite their lasting influence on modern music , the band has attempted to disassociate themselves with many of the bands they inspired . Following the band 's reformation , guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound , in which he said , " The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different . It 's like glam rock now . We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place ... If this is the world we helped create , then I apologise . " He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgements they have received , though explaining " the problem is most of [ the bands they inspired ] aren 't very good . "

 Upon its release , This Is It received mixed to positive reviews from music critics . Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson of Entertainment Weekly , praised the album and gave it an overall rating of a B + . Vozick @-@ Levinson described the album 's track " This Is It " as being an " uplifting ballad " and felt that " if you 're feeling generous " you can " count the minimally distinguishable " orchestra version of " This Is It " having thought of it as being a " decent if slight addition to Jackson 's songbook . " Vozick @-@ Levinson stated that while the album 's second disc only contains four tracks that were unreleased , that included a " fairly unremarkable " spoken @-@ word poem , after hearing Jackson " work out the vocal harmonies " for " Beat It , " he in particular , felt that This Is It was " well worth the price of admission ( or at least a healthy chunk of it ) . " Brian Linder of IGN described This Is It as a " freshly designed " release of a greatest hits album , and that the album 's tracks of an all @-@ vocal arrangement of " Beat It " was " particularly awesome " and the acoustic version of " She 's Out of My Life " allows Jackson 's " vocals to shine without the distraction of dated ' 70s musical underpinnings . " Linder did note that he felt that the album was both a " fitting tribute " to Jackson and a " crass , commercial double @-@ dip . " 
 Will Hines of Consequence of Sound gave This Is It a rating of four and a half out of five stars . Hines commented that : " On one level [ of the album ] , it 's an attempt to focus and draw attention to what Michael Jackson lived for , and not what he did . On a more superficial level , this is Sony milking his legacy . Any true MJ fan will already own 90 % of the songs that make up this two @-@ disc set . It is , however , that 10 % which justifies this album ’ s existence . " 
 Negative reviews from critics were mainly centered around them feeling that the album was released only for profit . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave This Is It two and a half out of five stars . Erlewine commented that , " an important thing to remember when considering the soundtrack to This Is It : this entire film and CD project was never supposed to happen " . He noted that Jackson 's death had " created considerable demand " for his final rehearsal footage and that This Is It was an " accompaniment " to the film . Andy Gill of The Independent strongly criticized This Is It describing it as being a " shoddy apology for an album " and felt that it was made just for a profit , commenting , 
 As a cash @-@ in attempt to scrape as much money from fans ' memories with as little outlay as possible , however , it rivals RCA 's ruthless ( and still ongoing ) reconfigurations of Elvis Presley 's back catalogue . But then , what should one expect from Jackson 's executors ? His own father 's immediate reaction to Michael 's death seemed to involve the promotion of his own label , while his brothers quickly grabbed the opportunity to scour through a box of tapes and find a tepid old track not previously deemed worthy of release and add their own vocals to it ( before taking the trouble to find out it was co @-@ written by Paul Anka , who understandably sought remuneration for his work ) . Who , exactly , stands to gain from this ? Not the fans , that 's for sure . In the four months since his death , Sony and Motown / Universal between them have issued no fewer than five posthumous album packages : The Collection , Hello World , The Stripped Mixes , The Remix Suite , and now This Is It . That 's a busy promotion schedule for a dead man . At some point , presumably , he will be left to rest in peace .

 The 2nd Commando Regiment is an elite special forces unit of the Australian Army , and is one of three combat @-@ capable units within Special Operations Command . The regiment was established on 19 June 2009 when the 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando ) was renamed . It is based at Holsworthy , New South Wales . The 2nd Commando Regiment often trains and deploys with the Special Air Service Regiment , is highly regarded by coalition special operation forces abroad , and has been involved in operations in East Timor , Iraq and Afghanistan , where it was used in a direct action warfighting role . It has also been involved in a number of domestic security operations including the 2006 Commonwealth Games and the 2014 G20 Leaders Summit . 
 = = Role = = 
 Part of Special Operations Command ( SOCOMD ) , the 2nd Commando Regiment is one of three combat @-@ capable units within SOCOMD and operates in conjunction with other SOCOMD units , services and interagency organisations in joint and combined operations . According to the Department of Defence the role of the regiment is to conduct special recovery and strike operations , being created " to conduct offensive and recovery operations beyond the range and capability of other ADF elements " . Formed to complement the Special Air Service Regiment ( SASR ) , it is designed to be a " self @-@ contained flexible and rapidly deployable force " and is structured for both domestic counter @-@ terrorism and other special operations . The regiment is capable of operating in the air , land and sea environment and is tasked with conducting advanced force operations and direct action missions in Australia and overseas . In its domestic counter @-@ terrorism role it provides the basis for Tactical Assault Group ( East ) , which is tasked with conducting high @-@ risk missions beyond the capability of civilian authorities to respond to . Meanwhile , as a result of the decision to no longer maintain a conventional parachute capability , after 3 RAR was reorganised as a light infantry battalion in 2011 this role has also been provided by the 2nd Commando Regiment . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 In 1995 , as part of an expansion of the number of Australian Army infantry battalions , the 2nd / 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment — then operating as a standard light infantry battalion — was delinked into separate battalions which resumed their original identities as the 2nd and 4th Battalions . The decision was then taken that the 4th Battalion would become a Regular Army commando unit and on 1 February 1997 the unit was renamed to 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando ) . The unit would be structured for both conventional operations and domestic counter @-@ terrorism , with an initial establishment of a battalion headquarters , Tactical Assault Group ( East ) , two commando companies , logistic support company , logistic support company , operational support company and a signal squadron . Regular serving members were given the opportunity to undertake special forces training provided by the Commando Training Wing of the Reserve 1st Commando Regiment , or elect to be posted to a conventional forces unit . No General Reserve positions existed in the new structure , and reserve members discharged or posted to reserve units . 
 The initial years were busy with the unit creating a structure and recruiting members suitable for commando training , while conducting sub @-@ unit and unit training activities . B Company was raised in 1998 , followed by C Company in 1999 , both of which took 24 months to reach full maturity . In 2000 , elements were involved in the evacuation of Australian nationals from the Solomon Islands in June . While later that year the regiment provided a second Tactical Assault Group ( TAG ) to augment that provided by the SASR in support of security arrangements for the Sydney Olympic Games . A period of rapid capability development , equipment acquisition and training subsequently followed . The unit that was developed as a result is highly regarded by coalition special operation forces abroad , and has conducted operations in East Timor , Iraq and Afghanistan . It has also been awarded a number of citations for bravery and meritorious service . 
 On 19 June 2009 , the battalion was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment . Regardless , the name 4 RAR remains on the Army 's order of battle and its history , colours and traditions have been preserved , ready to be re @-@ raised as a regular infantry battalion in the future if required . All awards and battle honours received during the time as 4 RAR ( <unk> ) were passed onto the 2nd Commando Regiment , while those awarded before the transformation to a commando battalion were retained by 4 RAR . Along with the renaming , a new badge was chosen to reflect the history and traditions of the Independent Companies that served during the Second World War by including the distinctive " double diamond " unit colour patch shape in the regimental badge along with the traditional commando knife . The unit 's motto is <unk> <unk> , which is Latin for " Without Warning " . Qualified commandos are awarded the Sherwood green commando beret . Distinctive commando parachute wings are worn , depicting a parachute backed by a pair of black drooping wings on a green background . The Australian Army Stiletto dagger is also worn on ceremonial occasions .

 The 2nd Commando Regiment , then known as 4 RAR ( <unk> ) , was deployed as a part of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( UNTAET ) in 2001 . When notified to replace 1 RAR in East Timor , 4 RAR had not long previously been raised as a commando battalion , developing special forces capabilities to supplement those of the SASR . With the commitment to East Timor continuing , however , 4 RAR was re @-@ roled as a light infantry battalion for deployment to East Timor as <unk> IV . This involved reorganising from the existing two commando @-@ companies structure to a light infantry battalion with four companies and a growth in the unit from 220 to 670 personnel . This saw B and C Company remain commando @-@ qualified and A and D Companies filled with Regular infantry soldiers posted in to the unit , with its strength growing to 1 @,@ 100 men . The unit arrived in East Timor in April under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff <unk> , taking over Area of Operations ( AO ) Matilda in the northern border region . 
 During its time deployed as a part of UNTAET , the battalion established a security partnership with the East Timorese , focusing strongly on languages and maintaining the relationships previous Australian battalions had established , as well as transferring new technologies to the local security forces . This " intelligence @-@ led " but " people @-@ focused " approach saw the battalion group conduct the majority of its operations in close proximity to the Tactical Coordination Line ( TCL ) on the border with Indonesian West Timor . The battalion saw few contacts while in East Timor . These included a TCL violation on 5 May 2001 which was intercepted by a section from D Company , an outbreak of violence involving a grenade attack by militia members at the <unk> markets on 29 May which resulted in several people killed and about 50 wounded , and shallow cross @-@ border militia raids in June , including an attack on a section patrol from A Company . The battalion was withdrawn and replaced in October 2001 . 
 = = = Expansion and domestic security = = = 
 Following the battalion 's return from East Timor it was again restructured to resume its role as a two @-@ company commando battalion . However , in 2001 the Australian Government directed the permanent establishment of a second TAG to be based on the east coast of Australia . A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002 . Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the Bali bombings in October that year , further resources became available . The battalion was subsequently involved in security operations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting ( CHOGM ) in Queensland in 2002 . Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter , the MV Pong Su — which was suspected of drug smuggling — off Newcastle on 20 April 2003 . In 2005 , a fourth commando company was subsequently raised , with D Company being formed . Later , the battalion was tasked with supporting the security arrangements for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne . In 2014 , elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the G20 Leaders Summit held in the city on 15 and 16 November . 
 = = = Iraq = = = 
 The battalion provided a commando force element as part of the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , known as Operation Falconer . A reinforced commando platoon formed an element of the Australian Special Forces Task Group ( SFTG ) , which also included 1 Squadron , SASR , a troop from the Incident Response Regiment , and three CH @-@ 47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment . The commandos formed the " quick reaction " element for the task group . The SFTG operated in western Iraq where it was successful in securing its area of operations , including the huge Al Asad Air Base . After the invasion was complete , the 40 @-@ man commando element provided security to humanitarian assistance missions and other security operations , later providing close protection for Australian officials in Baghdad as part of Operation Catalyst . In 2004 , claims appeared in the media that Australian special forces were involved in counter @-@ insurgency operations inside Iraq , although this was denied by the government . The last commando element was withdrawn in 2006 . 
 = = = Timor Leste = = = 
 Later , in May 2006 a commando company group was deployed to Timor Leste as part of Operation Astute , after relations between the East Timorese government and military forces broke down . The commandos operated alongside the SASR as part of the Special Forces Component and were tasked with advanced force operations in preparation for the arrival of follow @-@ on forces , focusing on Dili Airport . In March 2007 , the commandos , along with elements of the SASR , took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader , Alfredo Reinado . After the battle , the commandos and SASR elements were withdrawn at the request of the East Timorese government in order to start negotiations with the rebels . 
 = = = Afghanistan = = = 
 Meanwhile , in August 2005 an Australian Special Forces Task Group ( SFTG ) was deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Slipper , operating in the southern province of Uruzgan . The SFTG , based on similar structure deployed during Operation Falconer , was made up of elements from the SASR , a commando company and a troop from the Incident Response Regiment . Two CH @-@ 47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were deployed to Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG . A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt . During this deployment the Commandos were involved in Operation Perth which resulted in the death of over 150 Taliban and al @-@ Qaeda fighters in nine days of fierce fighting in the Chora district of Uruzgan Province . The SFTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in September 2006 and replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry . During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days and involved in 139 contacts and sustained 11 soldiers wounded . 
 A 300 @-@ strong Special Operations Task Group ( SOTG ) was subsequently deployed to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007 , including a commando company group , elements of the SASR , and an integral combat service support team . In the latter part of 2008 the commando company conducted a disruption operation in Helmand province as part of Operation Eagle 's Summit , which was a major coalition operation conducted in support of the transport and installation of an additional turbine for the <unk> Dam hydroelectric facility . In March and April 2009 , SOTG killed 80 Taliban fighters in a major four @-@ week operation in Helmand Province , without suffering any casualties . Further operations undertaken include the Battle of <unk> in April 2010 , and the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in June 2010 , which resulted in heavy insurgent casualties . The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of a drawdown of Australian forces , although some special forces remained after this date as part of the small Australian force maintained in the country . The Regiment lost 12 personnel killed while deployed to Afghanistan , along with one killed during a pre @-@ deployment exercise . 
 The Regiment served in 20 SOTG rotations in Afghanistan , with deployments ranging from about four to six , seven , and eight months . For its actions , the Regiment was collectively awarded the Unit Citation for Gallantry and the Meritorious Unit Citation . On 26 March 2013 , it was announced that Special Operations Command would receive the first battle honour awarded to an Australian Army unit for actions since the end of the Vietnam War for its performance during the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in Afghanistan from May to June 2010 . The battle honour , titled " Eastern Shah Wali Kot " , was awarded in recognition of the operational actions of the SASR and 2nd Commando Regiment from Australian Special Operations Task Group Rotation XII . A number of the regiment 's personnel have also received individual decorations for their actions in Afghanistan . A posthumous Victoria Cross for Australia was awarded to Cameron Baird for actions in Uruzgan Province in June 2013 . In addition , as of October 2010 six Distinguished Service Crosses , eleven Distinguished Service Medals , seven Medals for Gallantry and three Stars of Gallantry had been awarded to 2nd Commando Regiment personnel for service in Afghanistan . 
 = = = Military intervention against ISIL = = = 
 In September 2014 , as part of Operation Okra the Australian Army deployed a Special Operations Task Group ( SOTG ) of approximately 200 personnel to the United Arab Emirates in preparation for operations to assist and advise Iraqi Security Forces following an offensive by Islamic State forces . The soldiers were expected to be deployed to Iraq when a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments . The majority of the SOTG was reported to be made up of C Company , 2nd Commando Regiment . It began moving into Iraq in early November .

 Any member of the Australian Defence Force may apply for entry into the 2nd Commando Regiment . Applicants may also be accepted via the Special Forces Direct Recruitment Scheme ( DRS ) , where selected and screened civilians undertake an accelerated 80 @-@ day infantry training program prior to commencing the Special Forces selection process . If a candidate fails any part of the selection course they will be returned to their unit , or transferred to one of the infantry battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment if they are a DRS candidate . Candidates must complete the Special Forces Screen Test and if successful move onto the six @-@ week Commando Selection and Training Course ( <unk> ) conducted at the Special Forces Training Centre ( <unk> ) , in Singleton , New South Wales . Further training then is undertaken during Commando Initial Employment Training , also known as the " Reinforcement Cycle " . Upon successful completion of all courses soldiers are posted into one of the Commando Companies where further specialist training occurs . 
 = New York State Route 321 = 
 New York State Route 321 ( NY 321 ) is a state highway in Onondaga County , New York , in the United States . The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) in the village of Skaneateles . Its northern terminus is at an intersection with NY 5 in Bennetts Corners , a hamlet within the town of Camillus . NY 321 is predominantly a north – south highway ; however , a portion of the route through the towns of Elbridge and Camillus follows an east – west alignment . The portion of NY 321 in Camillus between Forward Road and NY 5 is maintained by Onondaga County as part of County Route 66 ( CR 66 ) , a route that continues north of NY 5 to Memphis . 
 The majority of NY 321 's routing was originally designated as part of NY 26 in 1924 . NY 26 continued east to the village of Camillus by way of Forward Road and modern NY 174 . All of NY 26 north of Skaneateles was renumbered to NY 321 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . It initially overlapped NY 174 from Forward Road to Camillus ; however , this concurrency was eliminated in the 1960s . NY 321 was rerouted to follow Bennetts Corners Road in the 1980s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 321 begins at an intersection with US 20 ( West Genesee Street ) in the Onondaga County village of Skaneateles . The highway , at first , heads northward , intersecting with local streets in the village . After leaving the village and entering the town of the same name , the highway intersects with the Old Seneca Turnpike ( CR 133 ) . NY 321 continues northward , then veers east as it crosses into the town of Elbridge . 
 In Elbridge , NY 321 intersects with several county routes , including Halfway Road ( CR 107 ; former NY 368 ) , a connector highway leading to the hamlet of Halfway . Soon afterwards , NY 321 turns to the northeast , heading towards NY 5 . The highway intersects Forward Road ( unsigned NY 931F ) just inside the Camillus town line soon after the turn . Forward Road , a local road that passes through a mixture of open fields and forests , serves as a connector between NY 321 and NY 174 . 
 Past Forward Road , NY 321 becomes concurrent with CR 66 as maintenance of the roadway shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation to Onondaga County . The state designation comes to an end at NY 5 in the hamlet of Bennetts Corners west of the village of Camillus shortly after ; however , CR 66 continues onward . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The town of Skaneateles was incorporated in the 1800s to help build highways in the area . The highways that were proposed were to be built with stone and other materials . Construction began in 1911 on a highway between the Skaneateles – Elbridge town line and the hamlet of Martisco within the town of Camillus . It was accepted into the New York state highway system on September 17 , 1912 . An extension of the road south into the town of Skaneateles to the village of the same name was constructed in late 1912 and early 1913 and added to the state highway system in September 1913 . 
 When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , the Skaneateles – Martisco highway was included as part of NY 26 , a route extending from Ithaca to Syracuse by way of Skaneateles . North of Martisco , NY 26 followed Ninemile Creek to the village of Camillus , where it intersected NY 5A ( later NY 5 ) . 
 = = = NY 321 designation = = = 
 NY 26 was split into several different routes as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The segment of former NY 26 between US 20 in Skaneateles and NY 5 in Camillus was renumbered to NY 321 . It initially overlapped with NY 174 from Martisco to Camillus . The overlap remained in place until the 1960s when NY 321 was truncated to the southern end of the concurrency in Martisco . 
 In the early 1950s , the portion of NY 321 south of Forward Road was co @-@ designated as part of NY 20SY , a largely alternate routing of US 20 between Skaneateles and Manlius via Syracuse . Past Sweets Corners , NY 20SY continued north on a previously unnumbered roadway to NY 5 at Bennetts Corners , where it joined NY 5 east into Camillus . The NY 20SY designation was removed c . 1962 , leaving Bennetts Corners Road from Forward Road to NY 5 as an unnumbered roadway once again . 
 NY 321 was rerouted in the late 1980s to follow Bennetts Corners Road to NY 5 . This part of NY 321 overlapped CR 66 , a highway that began at the junction of Forward and Bennetts Corners Roads and ended in the hamlet of Memphis , and thus became maintained by Onondaga County . The former routing of NY 321 along Forward Road is now designated as NY 931F , an unsigned reference route 1 @.@ 16 miles ( 1 @.@ 87 km ) in length .

 The entire route is in Onondaga County . 
 = 2015 Tour of Qatar = 
 The 2015 Tour of Qatar was the 14th edition of the Tour of Qatar cycling stage race . It was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation ( ASO ) , the organisers of the Tour de France . The race was rated as a <unk> event , the second highest rating an event can receive , and was part of the 2015 UCI Asia Tour . 
 The 2015 race consisted of six stages . It started in Dukhan on 8 February 2015 and finished on 13 February in Doha , the capital city of Qatar . The Tour of Qatar puts unusual demands on riders : it has no significant climbs , but almost every stage is affected by strong crosswinds . These conditions make the race ideal preparation for the spring classics season , so many prominent classics riders were present . The flat stages , suitable for sprinters , and individual time trial meant that specialists in these disciplines also chose to ride in Qatar . 
 The race was won by Dutch rider Niki Terpstra of Etixx – Quick @-@ Step . It was the second successive year that Terpstra won the race after his victory in 2014 and the fourth successive victory for Etixx – Quick @-@ Step . It was the eighth victory for the team in Qatar . Terpstra took the lead of the race with victory in the third stage of the race , the individual time trial , and held the lead of the race to the finish . Maciej Bodnar ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) took second place , six seconds behind Terpstra ; Alexander Kristoff won stages 2 , 4 and 5 on the way to finishing third , nine seconds off the overall lead . 
 In the race 's other classifications , Kristoff won the silver jersey of the points classification , thanks to his three stage wins . Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) was the winner of the pearl white jersey of the young riders classification as he was the highest placed rider born after 1 January 1990 . The team classification was won by Etixx – Quick @-@ Step . 
 = = Preview = = 
 The Tour of Qatar is one of the early races in the season , coming in the middle of three races in the Middle East ( alongside the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Oman ) that see high levels of participation from the top European teams . The race is particularly popular as a preparation race for riders aiming for the spring classics . The significant challenge in the Tour of Qatar is the strong winds across the desert , which frequently cause the peloton to split into echelons . As well as attracting the top classics riders , the flat nature of the course means many stages can be won by sprinters ; the individual time trial also attracts many of the time trial specialists , who have a chance of overall victory . 
 Etixx – Quick @-@ Step had dominated the race since it began . This included winning the last three editions ( with Tom Boonen , Mark Cavendish and Niki Terpstra ) . Boonen had won the overall race on four previous occasions , as well as winning 22 stages . Boonen and Terpstra were both among the favourites for the overall victory , along with world time @-@ trial champion Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) . 
 Marcel Kittel ( Giant – Alpecin ) was the most prominent sprinter to travel to Qatar , alongside Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) , and several others . 
 = = Teams = = 
 18 teams have been selected to take part in the event , including 13 UCI WorldTeams . Each team was permitted to include between five and eight riders . 15 teams had the full allowance of eight riders ; 3 teams had seven @-@ man teams . The race therefore began with 141 riders . 9 of these withdrew during the course of the event ; 132 finished the final stage . 
 = = Stages = = 
 The 2015 event had a very similar format to the previous year 's race . It consisted of six stages , of which five were flat stages and one was an individual time trial . The individual time trial , on the third day of racing , used precisely the same course as the corresponding stage in 2014 . 
 = = = Stage 1 = = = 
 The race began with a 136 km ( 85 mi ) route from Dukhan in the west of Qatar to the <unk> Beach Resort , Mesaieed . The route was flat and , as normal in the Tour of Qatar , the principal difficulty was caused by crosswinds . 
 The initial breakaway was formed early in the race by Luca <unk> ( Bardiani – CSF ) and Jarl <unk> ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) . They built a lead that reached seven minutes by the half @-@ way point . Midway through the stage , a change in direction meant the peloton was now racing in crosswinds , and Etixx – Quick @-@ Step along with Trek Factory Racing attacked . They formed echelons and split the peloton . Riders such as Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) , Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) and Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) were left adrift from the front group , but another turn into a headwind meant the groups could come back together . 
 Shortly before the second intermediate sprint , Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) were involved in a crash , but were both able to remount and rejoin the peloton . After Nikias Arndt ( Giant – Alpecin ) won that sprint , Greg Van Avermaet made a short @-@ lived attack before a more determined effort from Lars Boom and Lieuwe Westra ( both Astana ) and Matti Breschel ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) . Though they achieved a lead of nearly a minute , the attack was ultimately unsuccessful , due to crosswinds and a combination of Etixx – Quick @-@ Step , Trek Factory Racing and Bora – Argon 18 riding at a high tempo . 
 In the final 10 km ( 6 mi ) , the peloton split again . The main field was reduced to 51 riders , with Marcel Kittel ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Wiggins , Edvald Boasson Hagen ( MTN – Qhubeka ) , Luca Paolini ( Team Katusha ) and Filippo Pozzato ( Lampre – Merida ) among the notable riders to lose time . 
 In the final kilometre , José Joaquín Rojas ( Movistar Team ) attached himself to the back of the Etixx – Quick @-@ Step leadout train . He opened his sprint with 300 m ( 1 @,@ 000 ft ) remaining , taking other riders by surprise , and was able to hold them off and take the victory . This was Rojas ' first victory since the 2014 Vuelta a Castilla y León . 
 Boonen finished second in the sprint , with Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) third . 
 = = = Stage 2 = = = 
 The second stage took the riders 187 @.@ 5 km ( 117 mi ) from Al <unk> , south of Doha , to Al Khor <unk> . 
 Early in the stage , Etixx – Quick @-@ Step launched an attack , quickly splitting the pack in crosswinds to create a lead group of 30 riders . Riders left behind included the race leader , José Joaquín Rojas ( Movistar Team ) , Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) , Marcel Kittel ( Giant – Alpecin ) and Lars Boom ( Astana ) . The lead group , however , failed to establish a lead of more than half a minute and work from BMC Racing Team and MTN – Qhubeka brought the field back together after 60 km ( 37 mi ) , when the wind changed to a tailwind . 
 At this point a five @-@ man breakaway formed , including Michael Mørkøv ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) , Johann Van Zyl ( MTN – Qhubeka ) , Jelle Wallays ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , and Mathew Hayman ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) , establishing a lead of nearly four minutes . 
 At the next change of direction , Etixx – Quick @-@ Step again attacked in the crosswinds . The breakaway was caught after 124 km ( 77 mi ) , with the peloton again splitting . Wiggins , Kittel and Fabian Cancellara ( Trek Factory Racing ) had all been dropped . Soon afterwards , further attacks from Etixx – Quick @-@ Step removed Rojas and Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) from the leading group . Tom Boonen won the second intermediate sprint , earning three bonus seconds . 
 With 5 km ( 3 mi ) remaining , the leading group was reduced to 15 riders . In the final kilometre , Andrea Guardini and Niki Terpstra had formed a small gap , but Alexander Kristoff bridged up to the pair and launched his sprint with 500 m ( 1 @,@ 640 ft ) remaining . Kristoff was able to win the stage ahead of Guardini , with Van Avermaet in third . 
 Due to the 10 @-@ second time bonus for winning the stage , Kristoff took over the overall lead of the race , one second ahead of Boonen , who moved into the lead of the points competition . Several riders who had been contenders for the overall victory , including Wiggins and Cancellara , finished over nine minutes behind Kristoff , eliminating them from contention for overall victory . 
 = = = Stage 3 = = = 
 The third stage of the race was a 10 @.@ 9 km ( 7 mi ) individual time trial at Lusail . The course followed a route that went past the Lusail Iconic Stadium , Lusail Sports Arena and Lusail International Circuit . 
 The riders were not allowed to use time trial bicycles as would normally be allowed in an individual time trial ; conventional road bicycles were to be used instead . 
 Favourites for the stage victory included current world champion Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) , four @-@ time world champion Fabian Cancellara ( Trek Factory Racing ) , Matthias Brändle ( IAM Cycling ) and Niki Terpstra ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) . Wiggins was wearing the rainbow jersey of the world time @-@ trial champion in a race for the first time and was riding a road bike with modifications for better aerodynamics . 
 The first fast time was set by Lars Boom , who took 14 ' 33 " to complete the course , before Matthias Brändle took over the lead with a time of 14 ' 22 " . Wiggins briefly took the lead with a time of 14 ' 13 " , but soon afterwards Cancellara went one second faster . Terpstra , however , rode eight seconds quicker to win the stage and take over the gold jersey of overall leader . 
 The race leader after stage 2 , Alexander Kristoff , finished 44 seconds behind Terpstra , 36 seconds off the overall lead . Other riders to lose significant time were Tom Boonen and Peter Sagan . Boonen retained his silver jersey , but Sagan lost his white jersey as leader of the young riders classification to Luke Rowe ( Team Sky ) . 
 = = = Stage 4 = = = 
 The fourth stage of the race was a 165 @.@ 5 km ( 103 mi ) route from Al <unk> to the city of Mesaieed . With the wind generally coming from the south , the riders were riding into a headwind most of the day . 
 Due to the strong winds , the stage started 40 minutes before the scheduled time , as the race organisers were worried about the possibility of sandstorms and of slow racing leading to a late finish . Despite the headwind , three riders formed a breakaway . They were Jaco Venter ( MTN – Qhubeka ) , Dimitry Gruzdev ( Astana ) , and Jarl <unk> ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) . The three riders built a lead that reached nearly four minutes . 
 Etixx – Quick @-@ Step , riding for race leader Niki Terpstra , controlled the breakaway through most of the day . They were supported towards the end of the race by FDJ . Unlike the earlier road stages , the lack of crosswinds meant that there were no echelons or significant splits in the peloton . The breakaway was caught with 19 km ( 12 mi ) remaining . 
 In the final kilometres of the stage , several teams tried to ride at the front , including MTN – Qhubeka , Movistar Team , FDJ , Tinkoff – Saxo and Orica – GreenEDGE . The strong pace caused several riders to crash , including Lars Boom ( Astana ) , Theo Bos ( MTN – Qhubeka ) and Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) . All were unhurt and able to finish the stage . 
 Despite the presence of Marcel Kittel , the team 's principal sprinter , Giant – Alpecin were riding in support of Nikias Arndt . Kittel took a turn in his lead @-@ out train ; since he was in poor form following a period of illness , he had requested the team support Arndt instead . 
 In the final kilometre , the Katusha team moved to the front before Kristoff again started his sprint early ; again , the other sprinters were unable to catch him and he crossed the finish line first . He was only slightly ahead of Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , who was so close at the finish line that Kristoff was unsure whether he had won . Arndt was third after Giant – Alpecin had done excellent work in the last kilometre . 
 There was a small split in the peloton at the end of the race . Several riders lost five seconds , including Terpstra , Ian Stannard ( Team Sky ) , Luke Rowe ( Team Sky ) , Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) and Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) . Kristoff moved up into fifth place in the overall standings thanks to this split and the time bonus for winning the stage . He also took over leadership of the silver jersey of the points classification . Terpstra retained his overall lead , while Rowe remained the leader of the young riders classification . 
 = = = Stage 5 = = = 
 Stage 5 was a 153 km ( 95 mi ) route starting at Al Zubarah Fort . The riders first travelled east towards Al <unk> , before returning to Al Zubarah . The route then took them north @-@ east along the coast , before finishing with two laps of a circuit in Madinat ash Shamal . 
 Etixx – Quick @-@ Step once again attacked early in the stage , breaking the peloton into echelons in the opening kilometres . Maciej Bodnar ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , in second place overnight , was among the riders who failed to make the lead group . The gap between the groups never extended much beyond half a minute and , after around 60 km ( 37 mi ) of racing , Bodnar 's group was able to rejoin the lead group and the racing , which had been frenetic until that point , calmed down . 
 At that point a breakaway formed , made up of Ben Hermans ( BMC Racing Team ) , Marco Haller ( Team Katusha ) , Jelle Wallays ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , Dmitriy Gruzdev ( Astana ) and Mathew Hayman ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) . The five riders at one point had a lead of over two and a half minutes . Hayman won both intermediate sprints and at one point was virtual leader of the race , before the peloton behind took up the chase in earnest . The breakaway was caught with 13 km ( 8 mi ) remaining . 
 In the final six kilometres , Team Katusha and BMC Racing Team attacked and forced another split in the peloton . Tom Boonen was among two Etixx – Quick @-@ Step riders in the 10 @-@ man front group , but Niki Terpstra , the race leader , was not . Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) and Maciej Bodnar were in the lead group , which built a lead of 15 seconds . Terpstra would have lost the race lead , but Etixx – Quick @-@ Step were able to bring the groups back together . After the race , it was revealed that the three Tinkoff – Saxo riders in the leading group were not aware that Terpstra had been dropped and , with team radios banned , directeur sportif Bjarne Riis was not able to inform them . 
 As they approached the finishing line , Kristoff again opened his sprint early and was able to hold off the rest of the field for his third stage victory of the race . Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) finished second and Nikias Arndt , again sprinting for Giant – Alpecin in place of Marcel Kittel , finished third . Sagan therefore moved into first place in the young riders competition , overtaking Luke Rowe ( Team Sky ) . 
 Thanks to the time bonus on the finish line , Kristoff was now in third place overall , just 11 seconds behind Terpstra . This meant that Kristoff could win the overall victory in the race if he was able to win the final stage and take time bonuses at the intermediate sprints . 
 Following the stage , the race organisers announced that Lars Boom ( Astana ) had been disqualified from the race . His bike had developed a puncture about 20 km ( 12 mi ) from the finish and he had attempted to regain contact with the peloton by chasing in the slipstream of his team car . 
 = = = Stage 6 = = = 
 The final stage of the 2015 Tour of Qatar started where stage 1 had finished , at the <unk> Beach Resort south of Mesaieed . It took the riders north to Doha . In Doha , the riders rode to the Doha <unk> , where they completed ten laps of a 5 @.@ 7 km ( 3 @.@ 5 mi ) finishing circuit . 
 After the previous stage , Niki Terpstra ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) had indicated that his team would happily allow a breakaway to win the stage in order to deny Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) the possibility of taking overall victory with the aid of the bonus seconds for the stage win and intermediate sprints . A break was allowed to go away early , formed of Marcus Burghardt ( BMC Racing Team ) , Preben Van Hecke ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , Nicola Boem and Stefano <unk> ( both Bardiani – CSF ) . They were able to build a lead of over two minute , but Team Katusha took up the chase to support Kristoff in seeking bonus seconds . 
 The two intermediate sprints were both located on the finish line of the finishing circuit , on the fourth and seventh lap . Burghardt , Van Hecke , and Boem were caught first , while <unk> was caught on lap 4 . Etixx – Quick @-@ Step attempted to place riders in the sprint to prevent Kristoff winning the bonus seconds ; they succeeded in winning the sprint with Tom Boonen , but Matteo Trentin was beaten by Kristoff to second place . Kristoff therefore won two bonus seconds , placing him nine seconds behind Terpstra . With a ten @-@ second bonus available to the stage winner , Kristoff was now within reach of the overall win . 
 Etixx – Quick @-@ Step then sent their rider Iljo Keisse into a breakaway alongside Gijs van Hoecke ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , with the intent of preventing Kristoff winning any more bonus seconds . Keisse won the intermediate sprint with van Hoecke second ; they then allowed the peloton – led by Katusha – to catch them . 
 In the final kilometres of the stage , Team Katusha , who had done most of the work throughout the day , were unable to maintain their position at the head of the peloton . After the stage , Kristoff admitted that his team was tired from their work during the week . Fabian Cancellara put in an attack in the final five kilometres , but was brought back by the peloton led in particular by IAM Cycling and Astana . In the final kilometre , Tinkoff – Saxo came to the front in support of Peter Sagan . 
 Sam Bennett ( Bora – Argon 18 ) was given a strong lead @-@ out by his teammates . He was then able to follow Andrea Guardini ( Astana ) , who launched his sprint with 200 m ( 660 ft ) to go . Bennett was then able to come past and take his first win of 2015 , which he later described as the biggest of his career so far . 
 Kristoff finished 19th ; he therefore failed to gain the bonus seconds he needed for overall victory and finished nine seconds behind Terpstra . Terpstra therefore won the Tour of Qatar for the second successive season . Kristoff won the silver jersey of the points competition , thanks to his three stage wins , while Sagan won the young riders competition . Etixx – Quick @-@ Step won the teams competition . 
 = = Classification leadership table = = 
 In the 2015 Tour of Qatar , three different jerseys were awarded . The first of these was the general classification . It was calculated by adding together the times recorded in each stage of the race , then making adjustments to take account of bonus seconds won for stage victories and intermediate sprints in the road stages ( the winner of the individual time trial did not receive bonus seconds ) . The winner of each stage received a ten @-@ second bonus ; the rider coming second received a six @-@ second bonus ; the third rider across the line received a four @-@ second bonus . Similarly , the winner , second @-@ placed and third @-@ placed riders in intermediate sprints won three- , two- and one @-@ second bonuses respectively . If two riders were tied on the same time , the precise time ( to one @-@ hundredths of a second ) recorded in the time trial would have been used to separate the riders . The leader of the general classification wore a gold jersey and the winner of the competition is considered the overall winner of the race . 
 The points classification was determined by adding together the points that each rider won on each stage . Points were awarded for coming in the top ten in the stage ( the winner won 15 points ; the tenth @-@ placed rider won one point ) . Points were also awarded for coming in the top three in the intermediate sprints that took place on each road stage ( three points for the winner , two for the second @-@ placed rider and one for the third ) . The leader of the points classification was awarded a silver jersey . 
 The third classification was the young rider classification . This was open to riders born on or after 1 January 1990 . The first eligible rider in the general classification was considered the leader of the young rider classification and was awarded a pearl white jersey . 
 Finally , there was a classification for teams . After each stage , the times of the first three riders on each team were added together . The team with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the team classification . 
 = Spinal cord injury = 
 A spinal cord injury ( SCI ) is damage to the spinal cord that causes changes in its function , either temporary or permanent . These changes translate into loss of muscle function , sensation , or autonomic function in parts of the body served by the spinal cord below the level of the lesion . Injuries can occur at any level of the spinal cord and can be classified as complete injury , a total loss of sensation and muscle function , or incomplete , meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past the injured area of the cord . Depending on the location and severity of damage along the spinal cord , the symptoms can vary widely , from pain or numbness to paralysis to incontinence . The prognosis also ranges widely , from full recovery in rare cases to permanent tetraplegia ( also called quadriplegia ) in injuries at the level of the neck , and paraplegia in lower injuries . Complications that can occur in the short and long term after injury include muscle atrophy , pressure sores , infections , and respiratory problems . 
 In the majority of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents , gunshots , falls , or sports injuries , but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection , insufficient blood flow , and tumors . Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment , societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic , and improvements to equipment . Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable , SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century . Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage . Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury , from bed rest to surgery . In many cases , spinal cord injuries require substantial , long @-@ term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation , especially if they interfere with activities of daily living . Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation , engineered materials for tissue support , and wearable robotic exoskeletons . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Spinal cord injury can be traumatic or nontraumatic , and can be classified into three types based on cause : mechanical forces , toxic , and ischemic ( from lack of blood flow ) . The damage can also be divided into primary and secondary injury : the cell death that occurs immediately in the original injury , and biochemical cascades that are initiated by the original insult and cause further tissue damage . These secondary injury pathways include the ischemic cascade , inflammation , swelling , cell suicide , and neurotransmitter imbalances . They can take place for minutes or weeks following the injury . 
 At each level of the spinal column , spinal nerves branch off from either side of the spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae , to innervate a specific part of the body . The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome , and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a <unk> . The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below . Injuries can be cervical 1 – 8 ( C1 – C8 ) , thoracic 1 – 12 ( T1 – T12 ) , lumbar 1 – 5 ( L1 – L5 ) , or sacral ( S1 – S5 ) . A person 's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function . Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage ( in thoracic , lumbar , or sacral injuries ) , and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected ( cervical damage ) . 
 SCI is also classified by the degree of impairment . The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury ( <unk> ) , published by the American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) , is widely used to document sensory and motor impairments following SCI . It is based on neurological responses , touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome , and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body . Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0 – 5 according to the table on the right , and sensation is graded on a scale of 0 – 2 : 0 is no sensation , 1 is altered or decreased sensation , and 2 is full sensation . Each side of the body is graded independently . 
 = = = Complete and incomplete injuries = = = 
 In a " complete " spinal injury , all functions below the injured area are lost , whether or not the spinal cord is severed . An " incomplete " spinal cord injury involves preservation of motor or sensory function below the level of injury in the spinal cord . To be classed as incomplete , there must be some preservation of sensation or motion in the areas innervated by S4 to S5 , e.g. voluntary external anal sphincter contraction . The nerves in this area are connected to the very lowest region of the spinal cord , and retaining sensation and function in these parts of the body indicates that the spinal cord is only partially damaged . Incomplete injury by definition includes a phenomenon known as sacral sparing : some degree of sensation is preserved in the sacral dermatomes , even though sensation may be more impaired in other , higher dermatomes below the level of the lesion . <unk> sparing has been attributed to the fact that the sacral spinal pathways are not as likely as the other spinal pathways to become compressed after injury due to the lamination of fibers within the spinal cord . 
 = = = Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality = = = 
 Spinal column injury is trauma that causes fracture of the bone or instability of the ligaments in the spinal column ; this can coexist with or cause injury to the spinal cord , but each injury can occur without the other . Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality ( <unk> ) exists when SCI is present but there is no evidence of spinal column injury on radiographs . Abnormalities might show up on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , but the term was coined before MRI was in common use . 
 = = = Central cord syndrome = = = 
 Central cord syndrome , almost always resulting from damage to the cervical spinal cord , is characterized by weakness in the arms with relative sparing of the legs , and spared sensation in regions served by the sacral segments . There is loss of sensation of pain , temperature , light touch , and pressure below the level of injury . The spinal tracts that serve the arms are more affected due to their central location in the spinal cord , while the corticospinal fibers destined for the legs are spared due to their more external location . The most common of the incomplete SCI syndromes , central cord syndrome usually results from neck hyperextension in older people with spinal stenosis . In younger people , it most commonly results from neck flexion . The most common causes are falls and vehicle accidents ; however other possible causes include spinal stenosis and impingement on the spinal cord by a tumor or vertebral disk . 
 = = = Anterior cord syndrome = = = 
 Anterior cord syndrome , due to damage to the front portion of the spinal cord or reduction in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery , can be caused by fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks . Below the level of injury , motor function , pain sensation , and temperature sensation are lost , while sense of touch and proprioception ( sense of position in space ) remain intact . These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function . 
 = = = Brown @-@ Séquard syndrome = = = 
 Brown @-@ Séquard syndrome occurs when the spinal cord is injured on one side much more than the other . It is rare for the spinal cord to be truly <unk> ( severed on one side ) , but partial lesions due to penetrating wounds ( such as gunshot or knife wounds ) or fractured vertebrae or tumors are common . On the ipsilateral side of the injury ( same side ) , the body loses motor function , proprioception , and senses of vibration and touch . On the contralateral ( opposite side ) of the injury , there is a loss of pain and temperature sensations . 
 = = = Posterior cord syndrome = = = 
 Posterior cord syndrome , in which just the dorsal columns of the spinal cord are affected , is usually seen in cases of chronic myelopathy but can also occur with infarction of the posterior spinal artery . This rare syndrome causes the loss of proprioception and sense of vibration below the level of injury while motor function and sensation of pain , temperature , and touch remain intact . Usually posterior cord injuries result from insults like disease or vitamin deficiency rather than trauma . <unk> dorsalis , due to injury to the posterior part of the spinal cord caused by syphilis , results in loss of touch and proprioceptive sensation . 
 = = = Conus medullaris and cauda equina syndromes = = = 
 Conus medullaris syndrome is an injury to the end of the spinal cord , located at about the T12 – L2 vertebrae in adults . This region contains the S4 – S5 spinal segments , responsible for bowel , bladder , and some sexual functions , so these can be disrupted in this type of injury . In addition , sensation and the Achilles reflex can be disrupted . Causes include growths , physical trauma , and ischemia . 
 Cauda equina syndrome ( CES ) results from a lesion below the level at which the spinal cord splits into the cauda equina , at levels L2 – S5 below the conus medullaris . Thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not the cord itself ; however it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at the same time due to their proximity . CES can occur by itself or alongside conus medullaris syndrome . It can cause low back pain , weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs , loss of sensation , bowel and bladder dysfunction , and loss of reflexes . Unlike in conus medullaris syndrome , symptoms often occur on only one side of the body . The cause is often compression , e.g. by a ruptured intervertebral disk or tumor . Since the nerves damaged in CES are actually peripheral nerves because they have already branched off from the spinal cord , the injury has better prognosis for recovery of function : the peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for healing than the central nervous system . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Signs ( observed by a clinician ) and symptoms ( experienced by a patient ) vary depending on where the spine is injured and the extent of the injury . A section of skin innervated through a specific part of the spine is called a dermatome , and injury to that part of the spine can cause pain , numbness , or a loss of sensation in the related areas . <unk> , a tingling or burning sensation in affected areas of the skin , is another symptom . A person with a lowered level of consciousness may show a response to a painful stimulus above a certain point but not below it . A group of muscles innervated through a specific part of the spine is called a <unk> , and injury to that part of the spinal cord can cause problems with movements that involve those muscles . The muscles may contract uncontrollably ( spasticity ) , become weak , or be completely paralysed . Spinal shock , loss of neural activity including reflexes below the level of injury , occurs shortly after the injury and usually goes away within a day . 
 The specific parts of the body affected by loss of function are determined by the level of injury . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The effects of injuries at or above the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord ( lower back and pelvis ) include decreased control of the legs and hips , genitourinary system , and anus . People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles . Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region . It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury , as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder , including fecal and urinary incontinence . It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty , leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine . One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism , an erection of the penis . 
 = = = Thoracic = = = 
 In addition to the problems found in lower @-@ level injuries , thoracic ( chest height ) spinal lesions can affect the muscles in the trunk . Injuries at the level of T1 to T8 result in inability to control the abdominal muscles . Trunk stability may be affected ; even more so in higher level injuries . The lower the level of injury , the less extensive its effects . Injuries from T9 to T12 result in partial loss of trunk and abdominal muscle control . Thoracic spinal injuries result in paraplegia , but function of the hands , arms , and neck are not affected . 
 One condition that occurs typically in lesions above the T6 level is autonomic dysreflexia ( AD ) , in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels , high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke . It results from an overreaction of the system to a stimulus such as pain below the level of injury , because inhibitory signals from the brain cannot pass the lesion to dampen the excitatory sympathetic nervous system response . Signs and symptoms of AD include anxiety , headache , nausea , ringing in the ears , blurred vision , flushed skin , and nasal congestion . It can occur shortly after the injury or not until years later . 
 Other autonomic functions may also be disrupted . For example , problems with body temperature regulation mostly occur in injuries at T8 and above . Another serious complication that can result from lesions above T6 is neurogenic shock , which results from an interruption in output from the sympathetic nervous system responsible for maintaining muscle tone in the blood vessels . Without the sympathetic input , the vessels relax and dilate . <unk> shock presents with dangerously low blood pressure , low heart rate , and blood pooling in the limbs — which results in insufficient blood flow to the spinal cord and potentially further damage to it . 
 = = = Cervical = = = 
 Spinal cord injuries at the cervical ( neck ) level result in full or partial tetraplegia ( also called quadriplegia ) . Depending on the specific location and severity of trauma , limited function may be retained . 
 Additional signs and symptoms of cervical injuries include low heart rate , low blood pressure , problems regulating body temperature , and breathing dysfunction . If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing , the person may not be able to breathe without the help of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilator . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Spinal cord injuries are most often caused by physical trauma . Forces involved can be <unk> ( forward movement of the head ) ; hyperextension ( backward movement ) ; lateral stress ( sideways movement ) ; rotation ( twisting of the head ) ; compression ( force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis ) ; or distraction ( pulling apart of the vertebrae ) . Traumatic SCI can result in contusion , compression , or stretch injury . 
 In the US , Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of SCIs ; second are falls , then violence such as gunshot wounds , then sports injuries . In some countries falls are more common , even surpassing vehicle crashes as the leading cause of SCI . The rates of violence @-@ related SCI depend heavily on place and time . Of all sports @-@ related SCIs , shallow water dives are the most common cause ; winter sports and water sports have been increasing as causes while association football and trampoline injuries have been declining . Hanging can cause injury to the cervical spine , as may occur in attempted suicide . Military conflicts are another cause , and when they occur they are associated with increased rates of SCI . Another potential cause of SCI is iatrogenic injury , caused by an improperly done medical procedure such as an injection into the spinal column . 
 SCI can also be of a nontraumatic origin . <unk> lesions cause anywhere from 30 to 80 % of all SCI ; the percentage varies by locale , influenced by efforts to prevent trauma . Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries . In developed countries , the most common cause of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases , followed by tumors ; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis . SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease , and spinal cord vascular disease . Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord , and intervertebral disks can herniate . Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels , as in arteriovenous malformation , or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord . When systemic blood pressure drops , blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced , potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord . Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI , as can vertebral <unk> and ischemia . Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord , as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis , herpes zoster or herpes simplex , meningitis , myelitis , and syphilis . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Vehicle @-@ related SCI is prevented with measures including societal and individual efforts to reduce driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol , distracted driving , and drowsy driving . Other efforts include increasing road safety ( such as marking hazards and adding lighting ) and vehicle safety , both to prevent accidents ( such as routine maintenance and <unk> brakes ) and to mitigate the damage of crashes ( such as head restraints , air bags , seat belts , and child safety seats ) . Falls can be prevented by making changes to the environment , such as <unk> materials and grab bars in bathtubs and showers , railings for stairs , child and safety gates for windows . Gun @-@ related injuries can be prevented with conflict resolution training , gun safety education campaigns , and changes to the technology of guns ( such as trigger locks ) to improve their safety . Sports injuries can be prevented with changes to sports rules and equipment to increase safety , and education campaigns to reduce risky practices such as diving into water of unknown depth or head @-@ first tackling in association football . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 A radiographic evaluation using an X @-@ ray , CT scan , or MRI can determine if there is damage to the spinal column and where it is located . X @-@ rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column , but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage . Thus when X @-@ ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms , CT or MRI scans are used . CT gives greater detail than X @-@ rays , but exposes the patient to more radiation , and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments ; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail . Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury . 
 Neurological evaluations to help determine the degree of impairment are performed initially and repeatedly in the early stages of treatment ; this determines the rate of improvement or deterioration and informs treatment and prognosis . The ASIA Impairment Scale outlined above is used to determine the level and severity of injury . 
 = = Management = = 
 = = = <unk> treatment = = = 
 The first stage in the management of a suspected spinal cord injury is geared toward basic life support and preventing further injury : maintaining airway , breathing , and circulation and immobilizing the spine . In the emergency setting , anyone who has been subjected to forces strong enough to cause SCI is treated as though they have instability in the spinal column and is immobilized to prevent damage to the spinal cord . Injuries or fractures in the head , neck , or pelvis as well as penetrating trauma near the spine and falls from heights are assumed to be associated with an unstable spinal column until it is ruled out in the hospital . High @-@ speed vehicle crashes , sports injuries involving the head or neck , and diving injuries are other mechanisms that indicate a high SCI risk . Since head and spinal trauma frequently coexist , anyone who is unconscious or has a lowered level of consciousness as a result of a head injury is immobilized . A rigid cervical collar is applied to the neck , and the head is held immobile with blocks on either side and the person is strapped to a backboard . <unk> devices are used to move people without moving the spine if they are still inside a vehicle or other confined space . 
 Modern trauma care includes a step called clearing the cervical spine , ruling out spinal cord injury if the patient is fully conscious and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol , displays no neurological deficits , has no pain in the middle of the neck and no other painful injuries that could distract from neck pain . If these are all absent , no immobilization is necessary . If an unstable spinal column injury is moved , damage may occur to the spinal cord . Between 3 and 25 % of SCIs occur not at the time of the initial trauma but later during treatment or transport . While some of this is due to the nature of the injury itself , particularly in the case of multiple or massive trauma , some of it reflects the failure to immobilize the spine adequately . 
 SCI can impair the body 's ability to keep warm , so warming blankets may be needed . 
 = = = Early hospital treatment = = = 
 Initial care in the hospital , as in the prehospital setting , aims to ensure adequate airway , breathing , cardiovascular function , and spinal immobilization . Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a life @-@ threatening injury . Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit , especially injuries to the <unk> spinal cord . Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons . 
 If the systolic blood pressure falls below 90 mmHg within days of the injury , blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced , resulting in further damage . Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter , intravenous fluids , and vasopressors , and to treat cases of shock . Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury . The treatment for shock from blood loss ( hypovolemic shock ) is different from that for neurogenic shock , and could harm people with the latter type , so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock . However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time . Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia ( insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream ) , which could deprive the spinal cord of much @-@ needed oxygen . People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate ; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing . 
 Swelling can cause further damage to the spinal cord by reducing the blood supply and causing ischemia , which can give rise to an ischemic cascade with a release of toxins that damages neurons . Thus treatment is often geared toward limiting this secondary injury . People are sometimes treated with drugs to reduce swelling . The corticosteroid drug methylprednisolone is commonly used within eight hours of the injury , but its use is controversial because of side effects . Studies have shown high dose methylprednisolone may improve outcomes if given within 6 hours of injury . However , the improvement shown by clinical trials has been inconclusive , and comes at the cost of increased risk of serious infection or sepsis , gastrointestinal bleeding , and pneumonia . Thus organizations that set clinical guidelines have increasingly stopped recommending methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute SCI . 
 Surgery may be necessary , e.g. to relieve excess pressure on the cord , to stabilize the spine , or to put vertebrae back in their proper place . In cases involving instability or compression , failing to operate can lead to worsening of the condition . Surgery is also necessary when something is pressing on the cord , such as bone fragments , blood , material from ligaments or intervertebral discs , or a lodged object from a penetrating injury . Although the ideal timing of surgery is still debated , studies have found that earlier surgical intervention ( within 24 hours of injury ) is associated with better outcomes . Sometimes a patient has too many other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early . Surgery is controversial because it has potential complications ( such as infection ) , so in cases where it is not clearly needed ( e.g. the cord is being compressed ) , doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of the patient 's condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits . In cases where a more conservative approach is chosen , bed rest , cervical collars , immobilizing devices , and optionally traction are used . Surgeons may opt to put traction on the spine to remove pressure from the spinal cord by putting dislocated vertebrae back into alignment , but herniation of intervertebral disks may prevent this technique from relieving pressure . Gardner @-@ Wells tongs are one tool used to exert spinal traction to reduce a fracture or dislocation and to immobilize the affected areas . 
 = = = Rehabilitation = = = 
 SCI patients often require extended treatment in specialized spinal unit or an intensive care unit . The rehabilitation process typically begins in the acute care setting . Usually the inpatient phase lasts 8 – 12 weeks and then the outpatient rehabilitation phase lasts 3 – 12 months after that , followed by yearly medical and functional evaluation . Physical therapists , occupational therapists , recreational therapists , nurses , social workers , psychologists and other health care professionals work as a team under the coordination of a <unk> to decide on goals with the patient and develop a plan of discharge that is appropriate for the person ’ s condition . 
 In the acute phase physical therapists focus on the patient ’ s respiratory status , prevention of indirect complications ( such as pressure ulcers ) , maintaining range of motion , and keeping available musculature active . 
 For people whose injuries are high enough to interfere with breathing , there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery . Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively , allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs . As SCI patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume , physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques ( e.g. apical breathing , glossopharyngeal breathing ) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals . Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations , postural drainage , respiratory muscle training , and assisted cough techniques . Patients are taught to increase their intra @-@ abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions . The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in the rhythm of the cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions . Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing . Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction include respiratory muscle pacing , use of a constricting abdominal binder , ventilator @-@ assisted speech , and mechanical ventilation . 
 The amount of functional recovery and independence achieved in terms of activities of daily living , recreational activities , and employment is affected by the level and severity of injury . The Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) is an assessment tool that aims to evaluate the function of patients throughout the rehabilitation process following a spinal cord injury or other serious illness or injury . It can track a patient 's progress and degree of independence during rehabilitation . People with SCI may need to use specialized devices and to make modifications to their environment in order to handle activities of daily living and to function independently . Weak joints can be stabilized with devices such as ankle @-@ foot orthoses ( <unk> ) and knee @-@ <unk> , but walking may still require a lot of effort . Increasing activity will increase chances of recovery . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Spinal cord injuries generally result in at least some incurable impairment even with the best possible treatment . The best predictor of prognosis is the level and completeness of injury , as measured by the ASIA impairment scale . The neurological score at the initial evaluation done 72 hours after injury is the best predictor of how much function will return . Most people with ASIA scores of A ( complete injuries ) do not have functional motor recovery , but improvement can occur . Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function . Chances of recovering the ability to walk improve with each AIS grade found at the initial examination ; e.g. an ASIA D score confers a better chance of walking than a score of C. The symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary and it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of the outcome . A person with a mild , incomplete injury at the T5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe , complete injury at exactly the same place . Of the incomplete SCI syndromes , Brown @-@ Séquard and central cord syndromes have the best prognosis for recovery and anterior cord syndrome has the worst . People with nontraumatic causes of SCI have been found to be less likely to suffer complete injuries and some complications such as pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis , and to have shorter hospital stays . Their scores on functional tests were better than those of people with traumatic SCI upon hospital admission , but when they were tested upon discharge , those with traumatic SCI had improved such that both groups ' results were the same . In addition to the completeness and level of the injury , age and concurrent health problems affect the extent to which a person with SCI will be able to live independently and to walk . However , in general people with injuries to L3 or below will likely be able to walk functionally , T10 and below to walk around the house with bracing , and C7 and below to live independently . 
 One important predictor of motor recovery in an area is presence of sensation there , particularly pain perception . Most motor recovery occurs in the first year post @-@ injury , but modest improvements can continue for years ; sensory recovery is more limited . Recovery is typically quickest during the first six months . Spinal shock , in which reflexes are suppressed , occurs immediately after the injury and resolves largely within three months but continues resolving gradually for another 15 . 
 Sexual dysfunction after spinal injury is common . Problems that can occur include erectile dysfunction , loss of ability to ejaculate , insufficient lubrication of the vagina , and reduced sensation and impaired ability to orgasm . Although sexual dysfunction is very common after SCI , many people learn ways to adapt their sexual practices so they can lead satisfying sex lives . 
 Although life expectancy has improved with better care options , it is still not as good as the uninjured population . The higher the level of injury , and the more complete the injury , the greater the reduction in life expectancy . Mortality is very elevated within a year of injury . 
 = = Complications = = 
 Complications of spinal cord injuries include pulmonary edema , respiratory failure , neurogenic shock , and paralysis below the injury site . In the long term , the loss of muscle function can have additional effects from disuse , including atrophy of the muscle . <unk> can lead to pressure sores , particularly in bony areas , requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours ( in the acute setting ) to relieve pressure . In the long term , people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure . Another complication is pain , including <unk> pain ( indication of potential or actual tissue damage ) and neuropathic pain , when nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals in the absence of noxious stimuli . Spasticity , the uncontrollable <unk> of muscles below the level of injury , occurs in 65 – 78 % of chronic SCI . It results from lack of input from the brain that <unk> muscle responses to stretch reflexes . It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy . Spasticity increases the risk of contractures ( shortening of muscles , tendons , or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb ) ; this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day . Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure . Loss of bone density ( bone demineralization ) , thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles , can increase the risk of fractures . Conversely , a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas , called <unk> ossification . It occurs below the level of injury , possibly as a result of inflammation , and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27 % of people . 
 People with SCI are at especially high risk for respiratory and cardiovascular problems , so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them . Respiratory problems ( especially pneumonia ) are the leading cause of death in people with SCI , followed by infections , usually of pressure sores , urinary tract infections and respiratory infections . Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath , fever , and anxiety . 
 Another potentially deadly threat to respiration is deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) , in which blood forms a clot in immobile limbs ; the clot can break off and form a pulmonary embolism , lodging in the lung and cutting off blood supply to it . DVT is an especially high risk in SCI , particularly within 10 days of injury , occurring in over 13 % in the acute care setting . Preventative measures include anticoagulants , pressure hose , and moving the patient 's limbs . The usual signs and symptoms of DVT and pulmonary embolism may be masked in SCI cases due to effects such as alterations in pain perception and nervous system functioning . 
 Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) is another risk that may not display the usual symptoms ( pain , urgency and frequency ) ; it may instead be associated with worsened spasticity . The risk of UTI , likely the most common complication in the long term , is heightened by use of indwelling urinary catheters . <unk> may be necessary because SCI interferes with the bladder 's ability to empty when it gets too full , which could trigger autonomic dysreflexia or damage the bladder permanently . The use of intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder at regular intervals throughout the day has decreased the mortality due to kidney failure from UTI in the first world , but it is still a serious problem in developing countries . 
 An estimated 24 – 45 % of people with SCI suffer disorders of depression , and the suicide rate is as much as six times that of the rest of the population . The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury . In young people with SCI , suicide is the leading cause of death . Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self @-@ care is neglected . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Worldwide , the incidence ( number of new cases ) since 1995 of SCI ranges from 10 @.@ 4 to 83 people per million per year . This wide range of numbers is probably partly due to differences among regions in whether and how injuries are reported . In North America , about 39 people per every million incur SCI traumatically each year , and in Western Europe the incidence is 16 per million . In the United States , the incidence of spinal cord injury has been estimated to be about 40 cases per 1 million people per year or around 12 @,@ 000 cases per year . In China , the incidence is approximately 60 @,@ 000 per year . The estimated prevalence ( number of people living with SCI ) in the world ranges from 236 to <unk> per million . Estimates vary widely due to differences in how data are collected and what techniques are used to extrapolate the figures . Little information is available from Asia , and even less from Africa and South America . In Western Europe the estimated prevalence is 300 per million people and in North America it is 853 per million . It is estimated at 440 per million in Iran , 526 per million in Iceland , and 681 per million in Australia . In the United States there are between 225 @,@ 000 and 296 @,@ 000 individuals living with spinal cord injuries , and different studies have estimated prevalences from 525 to 906 per million . 
 SCI is present in about 2 % of all cases of blunt force trauma . Anyone who has undergone force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is at high risk for other injuries also . In 44 % of SCI cases , other serious injuries are sustained at the same time ; 14 % of SCI patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma . Other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma , abdominal trauma , pelvic fractures , and long bone fractures . 
 Males account for four out of five traumatic spinal cord injuries . Most of these injuries occur in men under 30 years of age . The average age at the time of injury has slowly increased from about 29 years in the 1970s to 41 . Rates of injury are at their lowest in children , at their highest in the late teens to early twenties , then get progressively lower in older age groups ; however rates may rise in the elderly . In Sweden between 50 and 70 % of all cases of SCI occur in people under 30 , and 25 % occur in those over 50 . While SCI rates are highest among people age 15 – 20 , fewer than 3 % of SCIs occur in people under 15 . Neonatal SCI occurs in one in 60 @,@ 000 births , e.g. from breach births or injuries by forceps . The difference in rates between the sexes diminishes in injuries at age 3 and younger ; the same number of girls are injured as boys , or possibly more . Another cause of pediatric injury is child abuse such as shaken baby syndrome . For children , the most common cause of SCI ( 56 % ) is vehicle crashes . High numbers of adolescent injuries are attributable in a large part to traffic accidents and sports injuries . For people over 65 , falls are the most common cause of traumatic SCI . The elderly and people with severe arthritis are at high risk for SCI because of defects in the spinal column . In nontraumatic SCI , the gender difference is smaller , the average age of occurrence is greater , and incomplete lesions are more common . 
 = = History = = 
 SCI has been known to be devastating for millennia ; the ancient Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus from 2500 BC , the first known description of the injury , says it is " not to be treated " . Hindu texts dating back to 1800 BC also mention SCI and describe traction techniques to straighten the spine . The Greek physician Hippocrates , born in the fifth century BC , described SCI in his Hippocratic Corpus and invented traction devices to straighten dislocated vertebrae . But it was not until Aulus Cornelius Celsus , born 30 BC , noted that a cervical injury resulted in rapid death that the spinal cord itself was implicated in the condition . In the second century AD the Greek physician Galen experimented on monkeys and reported that a horizontal cut through the spinal cord caused them to lose all sensation and motion below the level of the cut . The seventh @-@ century Greek physician Paul of Aegina described surgical techniques for treatment of broken vertebrae by removing bone fragments , as well as surgery to relieve pressure on the spine . Little medical progress was made during the Middle Ages in Europe ; it was not until the Renaissance that the spine and nerves were accurately depicted in human anatomy drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and Andreas Vesalius . 
 In 1762 a surgeon named Andre Louis removed a bullet from the lumbar spine of a patient , who regained motion in the legs . In 1829 the surgeon Gilpin Smith performed a successful <unk> that improved the patient 's sensation . However , the idea that SCI was untreatable remained predominant until the early 20th century . In 1934 , the mortality rate in the first two years after injury was over 80 % , mostly due to infections of the urinary tract and pressure sores . It was not until the latter half of the century that breakthroughs in imaging , surgery , medical care , and rehabilitation medicine contributed to a substantial improvement in SCI care . The relative incidence of incomplete compared to complete injuries has improved since the mid @-@ 20th century , due mainly to the emphasis on faster and better initial care and stabilization of spinal cord injury patients . The creation of emergency medical services to professionally transport people to the hospital is given partial credit for an improvement in outcomes since the 1970s . Improvements in care have been accompanied by increased life expectancy of people with SCI ; survival times have improved by about 2000 % since 1940 . 
 = = Research directions = = 
 Scientists are investigating various avenues for treatment of spinal cord injury . Therapeutic research is focused on two main areas : neuroprotection and <unk> . The former seeks to prevent the harm that occurs from secondary injury in the minutes to weeks following the insult , and the latter aims to reconnect the broken circuits in the spinal cord to allow function to return . <unk> drugs target secondary injury effects including inflammation , damage by free radicals , excitotoxicity ( neuronal damage by excessive glutamate signaling ) , and apoptosis ( cell suicide ) . Several potentially neuroprotective agents that target pathways like these are under investigation in human clinical trials . 
 Cell transplantation is an important avenue for SCI research : the goal is to replace lost spinal cord cells , allow reconnection in broken neural circuits by regrowing axons , and to create an environment in the tissues that is favorable to growth . A key avenue of SCI research is research on stem cells , which can differentiate into other types of cells — including those lost after SCI . Types of cells being researched for use in SCI include embryonic stem cells , neural stem cells , mesenchymal stem cells , olfactory <unk> cells , Schwann cells , activated macrophages , and induced pluripotent stem cells . Hundreds of stem cell studies have been done in humans , with promising but inconclusive results . 
 Another type of approach is tissue engineering , using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues . <unk> being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or <unk> and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose . They fall into two categories : <unk> and nanofibers . These materials can also be used as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues . 
 One avenue being explored to allow paralyzed people to walk and to aid in rehabilitation of those with some walking ability is the use of wearable powered robotic exoskeletons . The devices , which have motorized joints , are put on over the legs and supply a source of power to move and walk . Several such devices are already available for sale , but investigation is still underway as to how they can be made more useful . 
 = Bill Newton = 
 William Ellis ( Bill ) Newton , VC ( 8 June 1919 – 29 March 1943 ) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British and Commonwealth armed forces . He was honoured for his actions as a bomber pilot in Papua New Guinea during March 1943 when , despite intense anti @-@ aircraft fire , he pressed home a series of attacks on the Salamaua Isthmus , the last of which saw him forced to ditch his aircraft in the sea . Newton was still officially posted as missing when the award was made in October 1943 . It later emerged that he had been taken captive by the Japanese , and executed by beheading on 29 March . 
 Raised in Melbourne , Newton excelled at sport , playing cricket at youth state level . He joined the Citizen Military Forces in 1938 , and enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in February 1940 . Described as having the dash of " an Errol Flynn or a Keith Miller " , Newton served as a flying instructor in Australia before being posted to No. 22 Squadron , which began operating Boston light bombers in New Guinea late in 1942 . Having just taken part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , he was on his fifty @-@ second mission when he was shot down and captured . Newton was the only Australian airman to receive a Victoria Cross for action in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II , and the sole Australian to be so decorated while flying with an RAAF squadron . 
 = = Family , education and sport = = 
 Born in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda on 8 June 1919 , Bill Newton was the youngest child of dentist Charles Ellis Newton and his second wife Minnie . His three older half @-@ siblings from Charles ' earlier marriage included two brothers , John and Lindsay , and a sister , Phyllis . Bill entered Melbourne Grammar School in 1929 , but two years later switched to the nearby St Kilda Park Central School as the family income was reduced through the impact of the Great Depression . In 1934 , aged fifteen , he was able to return to Melbourne Grammar where , despite struggling with his schoolwork , he completed his Intermediate certificate . He gave up further study when his father died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty @-@ one , and began working in a silk warehouse . 
 Considered while at school to be a future leader in the community , Newton was also a talented all @-@ round sportsman , playing cricket , Australian rules football , golf and water polo . A fast bowler in cricket , he was friends with Keith Miller , and collected the Victorian Cricket Association ( VCA ) Colts bowling trophy for 1937 – 38 , while Miller collected the equivalent batting prize . In January 1938 , Newton dismissed Test batsman Bill Ponsford — still the only Australian to twice score 400 in a first @-@ class innings — for four in a Colts game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . The following year , he gained selection in the Victorian Second XI . He opened the bowling against the New South Wales Second XI — his first and only match — taking a total of 3 / 113 including the wickets of Ron Saggers and Arthur Morris who , like Miller , went on to become members of the Invincibles . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Newton had been a sergeant in his cadet corps at school , and joined the Citizens Military Force on 28 November 1938 , serving as a private in the machine @-@ gun section of the 6th Battalion , Royal Melbourne Regiment . Still employed in the silk warehouse when World War II broke out in September 1939 , he resigned to join the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) on 5 February 1940 . He had earlier attempted to enlist when he turned eighteen in 1937 , but his mother refused to give her permission ; with Australia now at war , she acquiesced . His brothers — dentists by profession , like their father — also enlisted in the armed forces , John as a surgeon lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy and Lindsay as a captain in the Army Medical Corps . 
 Newton undertook his initial training with No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School in Parafield , South Australia , flying De Havilland Tiger Moths , and with No. 21 ( City of Melbourne ) Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , flying CAC Wirraways . He was awarded his wings and commissioned as a pilot officer on 28 June 1940 . Following advanced training on Avro Ansons with No. 1 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook in September , he was selected to become a flight instructor . He completed the requisite course at Central Flying School in Camden , New South Wales , and was promoted to flying officer on 28 December . He subsequently began training students under the Empire Air Training Scheme at No. 2 Service Flying Training School near Wagga Wagga , under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger . 
 In October 1941 , Newton transferred to No. 5 Service Flying Training School at Uranquinty . He found instruction frustrating , as he longed for a combat assignment . His fortunes changed in February 1942 , when he was selected for the navigation course on Ansons at the General Reconnaissance School based at Laverton . From there he was sent to No. 1 Operational Training Unit at Sale , Victoria , for conversion to Lockheed Hudson twin @-@ engined light bombers during March and April . 
 Promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 April 1942 , Newton was posted the following month to No. 22 ( City of Sydney ) Squadron , based at RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales . Previously equipped with Hudsons , the unit had just begun converting to the more advanced Douglas Boston when Newton arrived . A comrade described him as a " big brash , likeable man who could drink most of us under the table , was a good pilot , good at sports , and had a way with girls " . No. 22 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine patrols off Sydney from July to September , before moving north to Townsville , Queensland . In November , it was deployed to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea , under the control of No. 9 Operational Group RAAF . 
 = = New Guinea campaign = = 
 Newton undertook the first of his fifty @-@ two operational sorties on 1 January 1943 , under the leadership of his commanding officer , Squadron Leader Keith Hampshire . During February , Newton flew low @-@ level missions through monsoon conditions and hazardous mountain terrain , attacking Japanese forces ranged against Allied troops in the Morobe province . In early March , he took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , one of the key engagements in the South West Pacific theatre , bombing and strafing Lae airfield to prevent its force of enemy fighters taking off to intercept Allied aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet . Newton gained a reputation for driving straight at his targets without evasive manoeuvre , and always leaving them in flames ; this earned him the nickname " The <unk> " . The Japanese gunners , however , reportedly knew him as " Blue Cap " , from his habit of wearing an old blue cricket cap on operations . In spite of the hazards of the air war in New Guinea , he was quoted as saying , " The troops on the ground should get two medals each , before any airman gets one " . 
 = = = Attacks on Salamaua = = = 
 On 16 March 1943 , Newton led a sortie on the Salamaua Isthmus in which his Boston was hit repeatedly by Japanese anti @-@ aircraft fire , damaging fuselage , wings , fuel tanks and undercarriage . In spite of this he continued his attack and dropped his bombs at low level on buildings , ammunition dumps and fuel stores , returning for a second pass at the target in order to strafe it with machine @-@ gun fire . Newton managed to get his crippled machine back to base , where it was found to be marked with ninety @-@ eight bullet holes . Two days later , he and his two @-@ man crew made a further attack on Salamaua with five other Bostons . As he bombed his designated target , Newton 's plane was seen to burst into flames , raked by cannon fire from the ground . Attempting to keep his aircraft aloft as long as possible to get his crew away from enemy lines , he was able to ditch in the sea approximately 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) offshore . 
 The Boston 's navigator , Sergeant Basil Eastwood , was killed in the forced landing but Newton and his wireless operator , Flight Sergeant John Lyon , survived and managed to swim ashore . Several of the other aircraft in the flight circled the area ; one returned to base straight away to inform Hampshire , and the remainder were later forced to depart through lack of fuel . Newton and Lyon originally made their way inland with the help of natives , aiming to contact an Australian Coastwatcher , but subsequently returned to the coast . There they were captured by a Japanese patrol of No. 5 Special Naval Landing Force . The two airmen were taken to Salamaua and interrogated until 20 March , before being moved to Lae where Lyon was bayoneted to death on the orders of Rear Admiral <unk> Fujita , the senior Japanese commander in the area . Newton was brought back to Salamaua where , on 29 March 1943 , he was ceremonially beheaded with a Samurai sword by Sub @-@ Lieutenant <unk> <unk> , the naval officer who had captured him . <unk> was killed in the Philippines soon after , and Fujita committed suicide at the end of the war . 
 = = = Revelations and reactions = = = 
 It was initially believed that Newton had failed to escape from the Boston after it ditched into the sea , and he was posted as missing . Squadron Leader Hampshire had immediately dispatched a sortie to recover the pair that were last seen swimming for shore , but no sign of them was found . Two weeks later , he wrote a letter to Newton 's mother in which he described her son 's courage and expressed the hope that he might yet be found alive . Hampshire concluded , " Bill is one of those rare fellows I shall miss for a long time , and if it is to be , remember for an age " . The details of his capture and execution were only revealed later that year in a diary found on a Japanese soldier . Newton was not specifically named , but circumstantial evidence clearly identified him , as the diary entry recorded the beheading of an Australian flight lieutenant who had been shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire on 18 March 1943 while flying a Douglas aircraft . The Japanese observer described the prisoner as " composed " in the face of his impending execution , and " unshaken to the last " . After the decapitation , a seaman slashed open the dead man 's stomach , declaring " Something for the other day . Take that . " 
 General Headquarters South West Pacific Area , while releasing details of the execution on 5 October , initially refused to name Newton . Aside from the lack of absolute certainty as to identification , Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock , Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command , contended that naming him would change the impact of the news upon Newton 's fellow No. 22 Squadron members " from the impersonal to the closely personal " and hence " seriously affect morale " . News of the atrocity provoked shock in Australia . In an attempt to alleviate anxiety among the families of other missing airmen , the Federal government announced on 12 October that the relatives of the slain man had been informed of his death . 
 = = = Victoria Cross = = = 
 Newton was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 16 – 18 March , becoming the only Australian airman to earn the decoration in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II , and the only one while flying with an RAAF squadron . The citation , which incorrectly implied that he was shot down on 17 March rather than the following day , and as having failed to escape from his sinking aircraft , was promulgated in the London Gazette on 19 October 1943 : 
 Air Ministry , 19th October , 1943 . 
 The KING has been graciously pleased , on the advice of Australian Ministers , to confer the VICTORIA CROSS on the undermentioned officer in recognition of most conspicuous bravery : — 
 Flight Lieutenant William Ellis <unk> ( Aus . 748 ) , Royal Australian Air Force , No. 22 ( R.A.A.F. ) Squadron ( missing ) . 
 Flight Lieutenant Newton served with No. 22 Squadron , Royal Australian Air Force , in New Guinea from May , 1942 , to March , 1943 , and completed 52 operational sorties . 
 Throughout , he displayed great courage and an iron determination to inflict the utmost damage on the enemy . His splendid offensive flying and fighting were attended with brilliant success . <unk> evasive tactics when under the heaviest fire , he always went straight to his objectives . He carried out many daring machine @-@ gun attacks on enemy positions involving low @-@ flying over long distances in the face of continuous fire at point @-@ blank range . 
 On three occasions , he dived through intense anti @-@ aircraft fire to release his bombs on important targets on the Salamaua Isthmus . On one of these occasions , his starboard engine failed over the target , but he succeeded in flying back to an airfield 160 miles away . When leading an attack on an objective on 16th March , 1943 , he dived through intense and accurate shell fire and his aircraft was hit repeatedly . Nevertheless , he held to his course and bombed his target from a low level . The attack resulted in the destruction of many buildings and dumps , including two 40 @,@ 000 @-@ gallon fuel installations . Although his aircraft was crippled , with fuselage and wing sections torn , petrol tanks pierced , main @-@ planes and engines seriously damaged , and one of the main tyres flat , Flight Lieutenant Newton managed to fly it back to base and make a successful landing . 
 Despite this harassing experience , he returned next day to the same locality . His target , this time a single building , was even more difficult but he again attacked with his usual courage and resolution , flying a steady course through a barrage of fire . He scored a hit on the building but at the same moment his aircraft burst into flames . 
 Flight Lieutenant Newton maintained control and calmly turned his aircraft away and flew along the shore . He saw it as his duty to keep the aircraft in the air as long as he could so as to take his crew as far away as possible from the enemy 's positions . With great skill , he brought his blazing aircraft down on the water . Two members of the crew were able to extricate themselves and were seen swimming to the shore , but the gallant pilot is missing . According to other air crews who witnessed the occurrence , his escape @-@ hatch was not opened and his dinghy was not inflated . Without regard to his own safety , he had done all that man could do to prevent his crew from falling into enemy hands . 
 Flight Lieutenant Newton 's many examples of conspicuous bravery have rarely been equalled and will serve as a shining inspiration to all who follow him . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Buried initially in an unmarked bomb crater in Salamaua , Newton 's body was recovered and re @-@ interred in Lae War Cemetery after Salamaua 's capture by Allied troops in September 1943 . In early 1944 , the recently constructed No. 4 Airfield in Nadzab was renamed Newton Field in his honour . For many years , the story of Newton 's death was intertwined with that of an Australian commando , Sergeant Len <unk> , who had also been captured in New Guinea . A famous photograph showing <unk> about to be executed with a katana was discovered by American troops in April 1944 and was thought to have depicted Newton in Salamaua . However , no photograph of the airman 's execution is known to exist . 
 Newton 's mother Minnie was presented with her son 's Victoria Cross by the Governor @-@ General , the Duke of Gloucester , on 30 November 1945 . She donated it to the Australian War Memorial , Canberra , where it remains on display with his other medals . Newton is also commemorated on Canberra 's Remembrance Driveway . In the 1990s , his friend Keith Miller successfully fought to ensure that the Victoria Racing Club abandoned a plan to rename the William Ellis Newton Steeplechase — run on Anzac Day — after a commercial sponsor . Later in the decade , Miller also publicly questioned Australia Post 's exclusion of Newton from a series of stamps featuring notable Australians such as cricketer Sir Donald Bradman . A plaque dedicated to No. 22 Squadron was unveiled at the Australian War Memorial by the Chief of Air Force , Air Marshal Angus Houston , on 16 March 2003 , the sixtieth anniversary of Newton 's attack on Salamaua .
