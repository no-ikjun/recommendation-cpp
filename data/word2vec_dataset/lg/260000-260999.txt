 The next year , in 1994 she surpassed this achievement , by becoming the first person to free climb the entire route in a single 24 @-@ hour period . Usually the climb takes four to six days ( Hill had previously done it in four ) and most climbers are aid climbing ; that is , most climbers allow themselves to use mechanical aids to assist their climbing rather than just their own skill and bodies . 
 Hill wanted to join her effort with that of making a film that " would convey the history and spirit of climbing " . Hill started endurance training in the spring for her summer ascent of the The Nose , aiming to be able to on @-@ sight a 5.13b after climbing all day . She trained in Provence and tested herself against Mingus in the Verdon Gorge , making the first on @-@ sight free ascent of the route without a fall while simultaneously being the first woman to on @-@ sight a <unk> 
 In her autobiography , Hill explains how she had " underestimated " how complicated climbing The Nose in a day would be with a film crew . Endless complications arose , such as the American coproducer backing out at the last minute , the soundman and cameraman refusing to rappel down the summit because they were afraid , and minor technical problems such as dead batteries . Hill herself had to coordinate many of the logistics because the producer had abandoned the project . Her first attempt to free climb The Nose in a day was plagued with problems . She ran out of chalk after 22 pitches , very nearly ran out of water and was taxed by the intense heat . She tried again soon after . On September 19 at 10pm , she and her partner Steve Sutton , began the ascent again , this time without a film crew . After 23 hours , she had free climbed the entire route . In his book on the changing culture of Yosemite climbers , Joseph Taylor explains that Hill 's ascent of The Nose demonstrates how climbing in the Yosemite Valley had altered from its origins in 1960s counterculture to become a " consumable experience " . Hill staged what he describes as a " spectacle " , filming the event " to capture the spontaneity of her one @-@ day ascent " , but she was only successful when not surrounded by a film crew . 
 The " Free Nose " and the " Free Nose in a day " remained unrepeated over 10 years after Hill 's first ascents — despite numerous attempts by some of the best big wall climbers in the world . Over time , a consensus grade of 5.14a / b has emerged for the most difficult pitch , known as pitch 27 or Changing Corners , a fact which cements her Free Nose ascents as two of the most impressive achievements in climbing history . At the time , climbing legend Yvon Chouinard called it " the biggest thing that has ever been done on rock " and Alexander Huber later wrote that this climb " passed men 's dominance in climbing and left them behind " . He also regarded her statement upon completing the climb of " It goes , boys ! " as reasonable although other climbers regarded it as provocative . The Nose saw a second free ascent in 1998 , when Scott Burke summitted after 261 days of effort . Then , on October 14 , 2005 , the team of Tommy Caldwell and Beth Rodden also free climbed The Nose , and on October 16 , 2005 , Caldwell did it in less than 12 hours .

 In 1995 , Hill joined The North Face climbing team and was paid to travel around the world to climb . She first visited Kyrgyzstan 's <unk> Valley to climb with Alex Lowe , Kitty Calhoun , Jay Smith , Conrad Anker , Greg Child , Dan Osman , and Chris Noble . They camped for a month and were cut off from the world , without even a radio . In her autobiography , Hill writes that " such isolation made me feel vulnerable " . Hill was not used to mountain climbing ( as opposed to rock climbing ) and the unpredictability of it unnerved her , with its increased risk of storms and rock slides . Furthermore , she liked focusing on the style of ascending rather than just summitting ; she realized on this trip that her style of free climbing was not conducive to summitting or mountain climbing . Rather than pursue ever higher climbs , therefore , she chose to climb in new places , such as Morocco , Vietnam , Thailand , Scotland , Japan , Madagascar , Australia , and South America ; many of these climbs were filmed and helped promote climbing in general . 
 Hill started offering climbing camps in five locations in the United States in 2005 , with plans for more . For US $ 2 @,@ 000 , participants received five days of an " immersive adventure camp " , including one @-@ on @-@ one coaching from Hill and other famous climbers . As of 2012 Hill was living in Boulder , Colorado and still travelling widely . From Boulder she runs a small business offering climbing courses and also works as a technical adviser for various climbing gear companies . As of 2013 , Hill was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company . While Hill used to easily obtain sponsorships , in 2010 she said in an interview that she was " too old " to obtain shoe sponsorships . 
 = = = Gender politics = = = 
 Hill repeatedly tells a story from when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree : she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not . " I thought , well , why would you expect that you automatically could do it ? Just because I was a small girl , was I not to be able to do it ? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn 't be capable of doing . I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do . It shouldn 't be a matter of if they 're a man or a woman . It shouldn 't be a matter of one 's sex . " 
 Long an advocate for gender equality in climbing , Hill has argued that men and women can climb the same routes : " I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men , and if the women can 't do the climbs , then they shouldn 't be competing " . For example , she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions . However , Hill later revised her view , noting that while she could and did compete with men " spectators want to see people get to the top . And since most women aren 't climbing at the same level as the top men , it 's necessary to design a route that 's a little easier for women " . In answer to a question about whether or not women " will ever equal or surpass men in climbing " , Hill gave a detailed response , focused on body composition , size , and psychology , explaining that climbing " favors people with high strength @-@ to @-@ weight ratios [ s ] " , less body fat , and greater height , articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women " have the advantage of being relatively light , with the capacity for tremendous endurance " . She explained that " theoretically somebody as short as me could be the best in the world because it doesn 't depend so much on height now ... And it 's a psychological thing more than a physical thing . " 
 Hill experienced discrimination throughout her climbing career and in an interview with John <unk> in Climbing , she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing , this was a problem for her . She pointed to sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that " there 's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing , no matter what your ability is " . Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles , which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing . She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the " tomboy " she wanted to be . Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people 's expectations of what women can do . 
 Hill has been credited with bringing many women into rock climbing . The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport , in part because more women were visible in it and in part because Title IX funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools . In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers , Hill responded that she felt " responsible to communicate something that touches people , that inspires them , that gives them a sense of passion " . Climber John Long explains that Hill " was a prodigy and everyone knew as much ... Twenty years ago , no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys , so when Lynn began dusting us off — which she did with maddening frequency — folks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations . Some diehards refused to believe a woman , and a five @-@ foot article at that , could possibly be so good . Out at Josh , it was said Lynn shone owing to quartz monzonite 's superior friction , which catered to her bantam weight . In Yosemite , her success apparently hinged on midget hands , which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks . On limestone , she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two . In the desert Southwest , she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes — or maybe shape @-@ shifters . Even after a heap of World Cup victories , it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One , and perhaps her legacy was never established , once and for all , till she free climbed the Nose . " 
 = = Media = = 
 Hill has participated in various television productions , such as Survival of the Fittest , which she won four seasons in a row , from 1980 to 1984 ; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross @-@ country running . It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete . The inaugural year of the competition , the first prize for the men in the competition was US $ 15 @,@ 000 and for the women , US $ 5 @,@ 000 . Angered , Hill asked for parity , arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six , the women should at least be awarded $ 10 @,@ 000 . She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors , negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again . In her autobiography , Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women 's half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her . She " became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was , and of how my passion had led me very much into a man 's world " . During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on The Guinness Game , That 's Incredible ! , and Ripley 's Believe it or Not . She describes her feat of climbing over a hot @-@ air balloon at 6 @,@ 000 feet for That 's Incredible ! as " perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did " . Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing . 
 In 1999 , Hill appeared in Extreme , an IMAX film on adventure sports . For that production , she and Nancy Feagin had been filmed the previous May crack climbing in Indian Creek Valley in Utah . She also appeared in Vertical Frontier , a documentary about competitive climbing in California 's Yosemite Valley . 
 In 2002 , Hill collaboratively wrote an autobiography , Climbing Free : My Life in the Vertical World , with mountaineer and writer Greg Child , published by W.W. Norton & Company . As she describes the process , " He would take my writings and organize them , and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements . He emphasized that telling the story is what 's important , so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say , and figure out who my audience was . " Hill explained in an interview that writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them . She wanted to " convey the history and culture of free climbing " , specifically how it became as specialized as it is today . She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer , both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman : " And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently . I think the book is important from that stand point [ sic ] , because I am a woman , and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing , or the history of climbing , out there . " Writing about climbing in the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s was dominated by men . As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains , the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40 % of climbers . It was not until 1990 that the first women @-@ centric climbing books appeared . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Hill met fellow Gunks climber Russ <unk> on her first trip to New York and by 1984 he had become " her constant companion " . On October 22 , 1988 , the two married ; however , their relationship ended in March 1991 in part because Hill wanted children and because the couple rarely saw each other . At the same time , Hill moved to <unk> , France , to pursue her climbing career ; she settled there because of the world @-@ class climbing areas in the <unk> region and the many friends she had there . While living and climbing in Europe , Hill became fluent in both French and Italian . 
 Hill met her partner as of 2004 , chef Brad Lynch , on a climbing trip in Moab , Utah , and at the age of 42 , she gave birth to a son . Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it . As she said in one interview , " I feel that right now , it doesn 't have to be all about me and my experiences . I was ready to begin a new role ; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother . It 's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made . "

 = 1861 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1861 Atlantic hurricane season occurred during the first year of the American Civil War and had some minor impacts on associated events . Eight tropical cyclones are believed to have formed during the 1861 season ; the first storm developed on July 6 and the final system dissipated on November 3 . Six of the eight hurricanes attained Category 1 hurricane status or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , of which three produced hurricane @-@ force winds in the United States . No conclusive damage totals are available for any storms . Twenty @-@ two people died in a shipwreck off the New England coast , and an undetermined number of crew members went down with their ship in the July hurricane . Based on maximum sustained winds , the first and third hurricanes are tied for the strongest of the year , although the typical method for determining that record — central barometric air pressure — is not a reliable indicator due to a general lack of data and observations . 
 Four tropical storms from 1861 had been previously identified by scholars and hurricane experts , but three more were uncovered in modern @-@ day reanalysis . Known tracks for most of the systems are presumed to be incomplete , despite efforts to reconstruct the paths of older tropical cyclones . Three systems completely avoided land . They all had an effect on shipping , in some cases inflicting severe damage on vessels . A storm in September , referred to as the " <unk> Storm " , hugged the East Coast of the United States and produced rainy and windy conditions both along the coast and further inland . The last storm of the season followed a similar track , and affected a large Union fleet of ships sailing to South Carolina for what would become the Battle of Port Royal . Two vessels were sunk and several others had to return home for repairs . Ultimately the expedition ended in a Union success . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 = = Methodology = = 
 Prior to the advent of modern tropical cyclone tracking technology , notably satellite imagery , many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed , and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught . As a result , information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete . Modern @-@ day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms . In many cases , the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path . Judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships , and their location in relation to the storm , it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm 's center of circulation for a given point in time . This is the manner in which three of the eight known storms in the 1861 season were identified by hurricane expert José Fernández Partagás 's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910 . Partagás also extended the known tracks of most of the other tropical cyclones previously identified by scholars . The information Partagás and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database ( HURDAT ) , with some slight adjustments . HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity , although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed , listings on some storms are incomplete . 
 Although extrapolated peak winds based on whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1861 , estimated minimum barometric air pressure listings are only present for the three storms that directly affected the United States . Two hurricanes during the year made landfall on the mainland United States , and as they progressed inland , information on their meteorological demise was limited . As a result , the intensity of these storms after landfall and until dissipation is based on an inland decay model developed in 1995 to predict the deterioration of inland hurricanes . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Hurricane One = = = 
 The first tropical cyclone and hurricane of the 1861 season is believed to have formed on July 6 , immediately east of the Leeward Islands . A 1938 publication documented the storm 's effects on Guadeloupe and St. Kitts , and given a lack of prior reports on the cyclone , modern @-@ day reassessments concluded that it was relatively weak when it affected those islands . After crossing the northern Leeward Islands , the tropical storm broadly curved toward the northwest , likely intensifying into the equivalence of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale on July 9 . The majority of the storm 's track in the western Atlantic was unknown until it was reconstructed based on reports from , and the effects on , three ships in its vicinity . 
 On July 10 — when the storm was approaching or at its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) — the Bowditch encountered severe hurricane conditions which destroyed both of her masts and washed her entire crew overboard . Her captain was able to climb back aboard , where he survived for over a week with no food or water until he was rescued by a schooner . The Echo and Creole both sustained significant damage , and the crew and captain of the latter ship had to be rescued after she began taking on water . The extent of the damage to the three ships served as the basis for evaluating the storm 's intensity in Partagás 's paper . The hurricane ultimately passed between Bermuda and the United States before dissipating after July 12 . 
 = = = Hurricane Two = = = 
 A month after the dissipation of the first hurricane , another tropical storm formed north of Hispaniola on August 13 . Ludlum ( 1963 ) described the " Key West Hurricane " between August 14 and 16 , and it was determined that the system had , in fact , surpassed the threshold for hurricane status based on wind observations from two ships . The storm skirted the north coast of Cuba as it moved west @-@ northwest and passed through the Florida Straits . On or around August 15 , Havana , Cuba experienced heavy rainfall . Although the cyclone did not directly make landfall , it delivered hurricane @-@ force winds to southern Florida . It turned more toward the northwest as it entered the Gulf of Mexico , where it began to gradually weaken . It is listed as having dissipated on August 17 in the northern Gulf . 
 The hurricane damaged or wrecked numerous vessels . Six ships were wrecked or grounded in the Bahamas , and the crews of at least two , the John Stanley and the Linea , had to be rescued . The steamship Santiago de Cuba left port on August 4 , and began to encounter squally conditions later that afternoon . Heavy seas and a strong gale inflicted some damage on the vessel . Several ships along the eastern coast of Cuba were wrecked during the storm , leading to great uncertainty and concern regarding the fate of the Santiago . At least three vessels were lost or grounded along the Florida Keys . 
 = = = Hurricane Three = = = 
 The first storm to be uncovered in modern @-@ day reanalysis existed in late August , and ties the July hurricane for the strongest system of the season in terms of maximum sustained winds . Its track is known between August 25 and August 30 , during which time it progressed generally northeasterly from a point northeast of the island of Bermuda to the central northern Atlantic . On August 30 , the Harvest Queen recorded a barometer of 28 @.@ 30 inHg ( 958 hPa ) on August 30 ; this report was a strong indication that the storm had attained hurricane intensity , although the system was likely undergoing its transition into an extratropical cyclone at the time . 
 = = = Hurricane Four = = = 
 The subsequent hurricane was also previously unrecognized until contemporary research , although the majority of its track remains unknown . The only indication that a tropical cyclone existed was the ship David G. Wilson , which was dismasted by a severe storm on September 17 . As no other information is available on the hurricane , it is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a single point in the central Atlantic ( at 28 @.@ 5 ° N , 50 ° W ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Five = = = 
 The first storm to directly strike the mainland United States was first detected on September 27 , off the east coast of the Florida peninsula . The storm is estimated to have been a minimal hurricane based on observations from the ship Virginia Ann . Several other vessels encountered the storm along its track , including the steamship Marion , which experienced hours of violent winds , torrential rainfall , and frequent thunder and lightning . The hurricane curved north , then northeast , striking North Carolina that same day before speeding northeastward as it hugged the United States East Coast . Its track is only known through 1200 UTC on September 28 . Ludlum ( 1963 ) refers to the hurricane as the " <unk> Storm " , and describes its area of impact as the " entire coast " . 
 In the aftermath of the Battle of Carnifex Ferry in present @-@ day West Virginia , Rutherford B. Hayes of the 23rd Ohio Infantry was camped south of the battle site , where he wrote about a " very cold rain @-@ storm " in a September 27 letter to his wife Lucy . Conditions at the time were characterized by leaking tents and temperatures getting " colder and colder " . Hayes wrote , " We were out yesterday P.M. very near to the enemy 's works ; were caught in the first of this storm and thoroughly soaked . I hardly expect to be dry again until the storm is over . " Strong winds buffeted the Burlington , New Jersey , area from early evening to midnight on September 27 , uprooting trees and causing some damage to property . Further north , Boston , Massachusetts , experienced intense winds and light rainfall for about five hours starting at midnight , with no initial reports of significant destruction . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Six = = = 
 Two tropical systems are known to have existed during the month of October . The first was originally documented by Partagás ( 1995 ) , who detected it based on a faulty report of a violent gale from a ship , the Mariquita . The report was said to have been from October 16 , but given her arrival date in New York City four days later and her location at the time of her encounter with the storm , she probably encountered the cyclone much earlier in the month . The violent south @-@ southwesterly gale lasted 15 hours when the vessel was probably located at 20 @.@ 5 ° N , 47 ° W. The storm was initially assigned a single set of coordinates for October 6 , and no attempt was made to reconstruct its track due to a lack of certain data on it . However , it was noted that a ship further north on October 9 experienced a heavy gale . Based on the likely correlation between the two ship reports , the storm 's track was extended four days to late on October 9 in the Atlantic hurricane database . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Seven = = = 
 A 1960 publication mentioned a tropical storm near Cape Hatteras , North Carolina sometime in October 1861 without specifying a date . Newspaper reports indicate that ships mainly north of the Cape Hatteras area encountered strong northerly gales for several days starting on October 7 , and winds in New York City persisted from October 7 to October 10 with a northerly component . Partagás ( 1995 ) noted , " These findings do not seem to support a tropical system but the author made the decision of retaining the storm [ ... ] due to the lack of solid evidence against its existence . " However , little is known about the system , and its inclusion in the hurricane database is limited to a single point at 35 @.@ 3 ° N , 75 @.@ 3 ° W. 
 = = = Hurricane Eight = = = 
 The final storm of the season followed a generally north @-@ northeasterly course from the Gulf of Mexico northward along the U.S. East Coast between November 1 and November 3 , dissipating over New England . The storm crossed southern Florida , and based on observations from Hatteras Inlet , North Carolina , and observations from the ship Honduras , it is believed to have attained hurricane intensity . The hurricane made landfall in eastern North Carolina and proceeded up the coast before crossing eastern Long Island and coming ashore in southern New England . Its demise on November 3 marked the end of the 1861 Atlantic hurricane season ; the next tropical storm would not form in the Atlantic until June 1862 . Two storm systems affected the region in the week following October 28 , both of which influenced a Civil War expedition which was " the largest fleet of war ships and transports ever assembled " . 
 The first storm , which is not recognized as a tropical cyclone , disrupted the initial assembly of the fleet on October 28 . However , the fleet set sail the next day on its mission to attack Confederate forces ( its destination was " supposedly a military secret " ) . On November 2 , the expedition encountered the second storm — the tropical hurricane — which wreaked havoc on the organization of the fleet and sunk two of its vessels . There was knowledge at the time of the series of storm systems , but few details on the condition and fate of the fleet , sparking great concern . Some of the other ships were forced to return home for repairs , but the majority rode out the storm successfully . The expedition proceeded onward and seized Port Royal Sound at the Battle of Port Royal . As described by Ludlum ( 1963 ) , the hurricane is known as the Expedition Hurricane due to its influence on the fleet . 
 However , the hurricane also had a significant impact on land . Earlier in the year , Union forces had captured the fort guarding Hatteras Inlet at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries . In the early morning hours of November 2 , high seas began to overwash Hatteras Island , " completely covering all dry land except the position of the fort itself " . After four hours , water began to subside . Extremely high tides associated with the cyclone continued up the coast as far north as Portland , Maine . Storm tides at various points , including New York City , Newport , Rhode Island , and Boston , reached levels unseen for at least 10 years and up to 46 years . In New York , the storm persisted for 20 hours starting early on November 2 ; rising waters inundated wharves along the East and Hudson Rivers . Floodwaters flowed up to five blocks inland , and a popular bar located in a hotel became isolated by the flooding . In response , a man transported customers to and from the bar on his private boat at a cost of two cents per ride . Strong winds in Brooklyn brought down trees and telegraph wires . 
 Infrastructure throughout the Tri @-@ State area suffered . Parts of the New Jersey Railroad line were undermined , and the Shore Line Railway at Bridgeport was inundated . Flooding was also prominent in the New Jersey Meadowlands and along the Newark Turnpike and Plank Road , which was left temporarily impassable . Further east , the hurricane triggered coastal flooding along the shores of Long Island , while northeasterly winds blew several ships ashore along the northern coast of Long Island . The eastern side of the hurricane blasted the southeastern New England coast between November 2 and November 3 , damaging over 250 vessels at Provincetown , Massachusetts , and running aground 20 others . Water from the Massachusetts Bay surged into the village of Wareham . In downtown Boston , the storm began late on November 2 and lasted until late the next morning , although the highest tides did not occur until after conditions had already cleared . Twenty @-@ two occupants of the ship <unk> drowned when the vessel sank after striking a rock during the worst of the storm . At the time , she was located 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east of the Boston Light . 
 = Hebron Church ( Intermont , West Virginia ) = 
 Hebron Church ( also historically known as Great Capon Church , Hebron Lutheran Church , and Hebron Evangelical Lutheran Church ) is a mid @-@ 19th century Lutheran church in Intermont , Hampshire County , in the U.S. state of West Virginia . Hebron Church was founded in 1786 as Great Capon Church by German settlers in the Cacapon River Valley , making it the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley . The congregation worshiped in a log church , which initially served both Lutheran and Reformed denominations . Its congregation was originally German @-@ speaking ; the church 's documents and religious services were in German until 1821 , when records and sermons transitioned to English . 
 The church 's congregation built the present Greek Revival @-@ style 1 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ story church building in 1849 , when it was renamed Hebron on the Cacapon . The original log church was moved across the road and subsequently used as a sexton 's house , Sunday school classroom , and public schoolhouse ( attended by future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump ) . 
 To celebrate the congregation 's 175th anniversary in 1961 , Hebron Church constructed a brick community and religious education building designed to be architecturally compatible with the 1849 brick church . As of October 2015 , the church continues to be used by the West Virginia @-@ Western Maryland Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America . Hebron Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 16 , 2014 for its architectural distinction as a local example of vernacular Greek Revival church architecture in the Potomac Highlands .

 Hebron Church is on the plain of a predominantly rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County , in the Cacapon River Valley . Baker Mountain , a forested , narrow anticlinal mountain ridge , rises west of the church , and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise east of the valley . The Cacapon River , just southeast of the church , is hidden from the church and cemetery by mature foliage . George Washington National Forest , encompassing the forested area east of the Cacapon River , is east of the church . 
 The National Register of Historic Places listing for Hebron Church includes the brick church and cemetery . They are accessible from WV 259 by a semicircular asphalt driveway , separated from the church and cemetery by a wrought iron fence and lined with large , old @-@ growth maple trees along the property 's northwestern perimeter . A paved brick walkway leads from the gate to the northwestern façade and two main entrances of the church . The church is surrounded on its northeastern , southeastern , and southwestern sides by a cemetery which is still in use . The cemetery contains over 600 gravestones , several yuccas , a hemlock tree , and a boxwood . A modern brick community building , within the historic boundary south of the church and cemetery , is used for church activities .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The land on which Hebron Church and its cemetery are located was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary , a land grant from Charles II of England to seven of his supporters in 1649 which was renewed by an official patent in 1688 . One of these seven supporters , Thomas Colepeper , 2nd Baron Colepeper , acquired the entire area in 1681 ; his grandson , Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron , inherited it in 1719 . Under Fairfax 's ownership , the Cacapon River Valley was predominantly inhabited by English @-@ speaking settlers as early as the late 1730s ; most came from Pennsylvania and New Jersey . As settlement progressed during the second half of the 18th century , the fertile land of Hampshire County ( including the Cacapon River Valley ) also attracted German settlers from Pennsylvania and elsewhere in Virginia before and after the American Revolutionary War ( 1775 – 1783 ) . 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 As the population of German settlers in the region began to increase , the desire for Lutheran religious services and education also grew . Ministers , including Henry Muhlenberg disciple Christian Streit , began to establish congregations in the largest communities of western Virginia . Muhlenberg was a German pastor , requested by colonists in Pennsylvania , who served as a missionary there from 1742 until his death in 1787 ; he is considered the patriarch of the Lutheran Church in the United States . Johannes <unk> and Muhlenberg 's son , Peter , reportedly visited the Cacapon River Valley between 1763 and 1776 ( before Hebron Church 's founding ) . Streit , charged with ministering to a Lutheran congregation in Winchester , settled there on July 19 , 1785 . 
 Hebron Church , originally known as the Great Capon Church , was established by early German settlers in 1786 as a united German congregation of the Reformed and Lutheran denominations . The congregation was also known as the German Churches , since it served both denominations . In its earliest days , the church was served by pastors connected with congregations in the Shenandoah Valley . Streit incorporated the church into his circuit shortly after its founding , regularly traveling to the Cacapon River Valley for baptisms and weddings , but his ministry did not extend west of Cooper Mountain . According to the oldest extant church record , six people were confirmed in the Lutheran Synod and nine confirmed in the German Reformed Church in November 1786 . On September 23 , 1787 , seven more people were confirmed in the Lutheran Synod ; the church 's enrollment then began to increase . 
 Early religious services were held in the log church on land deeded to Reformed trustee Jacob Huber and Lutheran trustee John Nicholas Schweitzer , both of whom were church elders in 1786 . The deed conveying the land to the trustees specified that it was to be used for a German church and burial yard . The united congregation became Hebron Church , the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley . 
 While the Reformed and Lutheran congregations used the log church , they were ministered by two pastors . Abraham Gottlieb Deschler ministered to the Lutherans and Jacob <unk> ( or <unk> ) ministered to the Reformed congregation until the latter dissolved around 1813 . Although the church served both denominations , it was later served by one minister ( Reformed or Lutheran ) . Originally a German @-@ speaking congregation , its documents and religious services were in German until 1821 ( an early transition to English for a German denomination in the United States ) . By that time , under the pastorship of Abraham Reck ( 1812 – 21 ) , the congregation was known as Capon Church . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The congregation of Great Capon Church built the present one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ story Lutheran church building in 1849 , when it was briefly renamed Hebron on the Cacapon after Hebron ( the city associated with Judah , Abraham , and Isaac ) . The church was later known simply as Hebron Church . 
 The brick church was constructed east of the original log structure , which was west of the present community building . The 1849 church was originally topped by a wooden shake roof , and its windows had double @-@ hung wooden sashes . Its pews were built by Alfred Brill , Jacob <unk> and Frederick Secrist with lumber milled by Brill . The church was constructed under the ministry of H. J. Richardson ( 1848 – 53 ) . 
 The log church was moved from its original location in the south corner of the cemetery to a hill across the road from the brick church . It was used as a sexton 's house for the church , and was a Sunday school classroom for about 30 years . In addition to religious instruction , the log building was a public schoolhouse . Future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump and his brother , judge Garnett Kerr Kump , received part of their primary education in the schoolhouse . By 1885 , a Mr. Miller was teaching business principles at the school . The log building succumbed to the elements , and no longer exists . 
 = = = Later history = = = 
 Peter Miller ministered to the congregation at Hebron Church four times , for a total of 25 years , between 1858 and 1918 . Licensed in 1858 and ordained in 1860 , Miller engaged in missionary work for rural congregants in the Capon and North River Parish of Hampshire and Hardy counties for 60 years . He established many of the area 's Lutheran churches and , according to the North Carolina Synod of the Lutheran Church in America , was " an outstanding figure in this large , mountainous , thinly populated territory , who for sixty years almost continuously was recognized as everybody 's pastor . " By 1867 , the church membership was 106 , its largest congregation to date . 
 On October 13 , 1879 , a post office was established near Hebron Church to serve the adjacent community ( then known as Mutton Run ) . In December 1884 , the church roof caught fire from an adjacent flue , burning a hole through the sanctuary 's ceiling which was soon repaired . On August 11 – 15 , 1886 , Hebron Church celebrated its centennial . During the celebration , Miller read a complete history of the German churches in the region . The centennial was reportedly the first of any Lutheran congregation in the southern United States . 
 The wrought @-@ iron fence along the church driveway was installed in April 1895 , replacing a picket fence . In 1905 , the church 's wood roof was replaced with a metal one , the present stained @-@ glass windows were installed , its interior and woodwork were painted and new lamps were installed for better illumination . The stained @-@ glass windows were supplied by Madison Alling of Newark , New Jersey in memory of his father , who summered at nearby Capon Springs Resort . Alling also provided four hanging lamps and <unk> for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork . Anton <unk> of Wheeling , West Virginia funded the metal roof and the sanctuary 's painting and decoration . 
 On June 11 , 1915 , the post office changed its name to Intermont ( after the Intermountain Construction Company ) , operating until its closure on January 29 , 1972 . The unincorporated community around Hebron Church continues to be known as Intermont , after the former post office . By 1921 , the Winchester and Western Railroad had been constructed to the east of Hebron Church by the Intermountain Construction Company to connect Wardensville with Winchester and develop the area 's timber , mining , and fruit industries . 
 In 1932 , the church 's piano was donated by George E. Brill of Baltimore . Hebron Church celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1936 , during the pastorate of Lawrence P. Williamson ( 1930 – 37 ) . On October 29 , 1961 , in celebration of the church 's 175th anniversary , the congregation dedicated a new brick community and religious @-@ education building designed to be architecturally compatible with the 1849 brick church . The new building , which hosted community gatherings , events and Sunday school , was built just south of the brick church at the edge of the cemetery ( where the old log church was originally located ) . Walter A. Sigman ( 1960 – 65 ) was pastor when the community building was dedicated .

 In 2008 , a survey of historic properties in the county was undertaken by the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History . Following this survey , he Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place these identified structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places . Preparation of the necessary documentation for Hebron Church , French 's Mill , Yellow Spring Mill , and the Nathaniel and Isaac Kuykendall House began in April 2013 , when Governor Earl Ray Tomblin awarded $ 10 @,@ 500 to the Hampshire County Commission . The cost of the commission 's documentation of the history and significance of the four properties was $ 15 @,@ 000 , of which the county paid $ 4 @,@ 500 . 
 All four properties were accepted for the NRHP on December 16 , 2014 , with Hebron Church a unique local example of Greek Revival church architecture in the Potomac Highlands . Because the church 's original architectural design , workmanship , and building materials are extant , architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi assessed the church as providing " insight into the construction techniques of a mid @-@ 19th @-@ century ecclesiastical building . " Hebron Church is one of six extant , rural pre @-@ Civil War church buildings in Hampshire County ; the other five are <unk> Presbyterian Church ( 1825 ) , Mount Bethel Church ( 1837 ) , Old Pine Church ( 1838 ) , Capon Chapel ( c . 1852 ) , and North River Mills United Methodist Church ( 1860 ) . 
 As of October 2015 , the church 's congregation is part of the Potomac Conference in the West Virginia @-@ Western Maryland Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America . <unk> by David A. <unk> , Hebron Church has 22 baptized members , 19 confirmed members and an average attendance of six .

 Since the church 's founding in 1786 , the following pastors have ministered to the congregation at Hebron Church : 
 † Reformed pastors ; the remaining pastors were Lutheran . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 According to Sandra Scaffidi , Hebron Church 's architecture exemplifies a " local interpretation " of the Greek Revival architectural style , which was popular at the time of its construction . With its simple wooden doors , returning eaves and symmetrical front gable design , Hebron Church is representative of a vernacular interpretation of Greek Revival architecture . Only one other church building in eastern Hampshire County , Timber Ridge Christian Church in High View , was built of brick . The overall plan of Hebron Church exemplifies traditional Lutheranism , with the sanctuary 's one @-@ room floor plan enabling the congregation to be near its minister and easily participate in worship . Scaffidi wrote , " The Greek Revival front @-@ gable form of the Hebron Church reflects the early settlers ' desire to worship in a modest , uncluttered fashion . " 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The 1849 church is a small , one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ story , front @-@ gable building . The main façade ( northwestern elevation ) has two main entrances , enclosed by white @-@ painted wood , recessed panel doors , and capped by white @-@ painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks . The church 's exterior is brickwork , laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five @-@ course American bond on the northeastern , southeastern and southwestern elevations . Two blue @-@ gray stained glass windows ( installed in 1905 ) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances , each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks . The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns , exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design . In the top of the gable , a square date stone engraved " 1849 " is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture . Although the church is now topped by a metal standing @-@ seam roof , it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes . 
 On the church 's northeastern elevation there are three large , symmetrical stained @-@ glass windows , each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash . Like the main façade 's doorways and windows , the sills , lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained @-@ glass windows are white @-@ painted stone . Below the windows is an exposed coursed @-@ stone foundation with five tie @-@ rod masonry anchor plates . A small brick chimney is present on this elevation . The church 's southwestern elevation also has a coursed @-@ stone foundation , with five tie @-@ rod anchor plates , banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained @-@ glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white @-@ painted stone sills , lintels and lintel corner blocks . On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line . <unk> are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations . The church 's southeastern ( rear ) elevation has an exposed coursed @-@ stone foundation 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) high , due to its location on sloping ground . At the center of this elevation is a protruding , gabled brick extension for the interior altar , with symmetrical stained @-@ glass windows on both sides . The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing . An 1895 wrought @-@ iron fence encloses the property 's northwestern perimeter , and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The church interior has an open floor plan , with a sanctuary measuring 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) wide and 43 feet ( 13 m ) long . The floor plan is an open nave , with two aisles partitioning three sections of rectangular wooden pews . Although the pews had been painted white , they have been restored to their original wood finish . The sanctuary 's interior walls are plaster , and the floors are sheathed in wide wooden planks . The nave is topped by a ceiling fabricated on tongue and groove wooden planks painted white . Three large stained @-@ glass windows , framed by wooden molding and recessed approximately 6 inches ( 15 cm ) , are symmetrically located on the northeastern and southwestern walls . The lower portion of each window contains a memorial dedication , which opens into its lower hopper sash . On the northwestern side of the interior are the two main entry doors , which access an unadorned narthex . Two tapered @-@ square pilasters support an upper gallery loft , possibly used by slaves during religious services . The gallery is fronted by a solid balustrade , accented with dentil molding and recessed wooden panels . 
 At the southeastern end of the sanctuary , the altar is atop a decagonal platform about 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) above the floor and accessible by a pair of four @-@ step staircases . On the elevated platform is also a table holding a Bible . A recessed rectangular apse , flanked by a pair of fluted , engaged columns , is behind the altar . A painting of Jesus hangs in the center of the apse , with an American flag to its immediate north . An organ and a piano are north of the altar , with a baptismal font south of it . The altar platform and aisles are carpeted red . The sanctuary 's northern and southern elevations exposed brick chimneys connected to gas heating units , which were installed around 1970 . A brass chandelier with clear glass hurricane globes is suspended in the center of the sanctuary ; on the northern and southern elevations , two brass electric lanterns are adjacent to the stained @-@ glass windows . 
 The upper gallery on the northwestern side of the church is accessed by a twelve @-@ step wooden spiral staircase , and has an unfinished wooden floor . Four wooden pews have white @-@ painted sides and unfinished seats and rails . The gallery 's ceiling height is about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) at its tallest and about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) at its shortest , due to the sloping wooden floor . Two stained @-@ glass windows , which cannot be opened , are along the northwest wall . A small closet , accessible through a wooden door with two parallel vertical panels and original latch hardware , is at the base of the staircase . The church 's original plasterwork and a 10 @-@ inch ( 25 cm ) vertically @-@ cut wooden board , suggesting half @-@ timbering , are visible in the closet . 
 = = = Community building = = = 
 The church 's community building , a non @-@ contributing structure within the historic boundary , is southwest of the church . The building is a venue for Sunday school classes and community gatherings . The front gable building , completed in 1961 , is sheathed in brickwork . Similar to the church , the building is built into a gently @-@ sloping bank with its one @-@ story elevation at grade facing west toward WV 259 . Its two @-@ story eastern elevation is at the foot of the hillside . 
 The building 's western façade has a central entryway with double doors , topped by a six @-@ light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters . Its gable , sheathed in aluminum siding , incorporates a gabled pediment and the building 's perimeter is surrounded by a wide , flat frieze . The building 's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12 @-@ over @-@ 12 double @-@ hung sashes on brick window sills . Its basement level has one entrance , flanked by wooden double @-@ hung sash windows and four casement windows . The northeastern elevation has three stained @-@ glass windows on the main level , with three wooden eight @-@ over @-@ eight double @-@ hung sash windows ; a single wooden six @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung sash window is in the gable . The building is roofed with asphalt shingles , and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation 's roof line . Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16 @-@ over @-@ 16 double @-@ hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level , in addition to two wooden four @-@ over @-@ four sash windows . 
 = = = Cemetery = = = 
 Hebron Church is surrounded on three sides by a cemetery , consisting of about 700 granite , marble , slate and wooden gravestones laid in semi @-@ regular rows running northeast to southeast . The cemetery also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community building . Its interments date from about 1806 to the present ; early gravestones have deteriorated beyond recognition , and may be older than 1806 . Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the cemetery 's southeastern section , with simpler markers than the cemetery 's other gravestones . Although its gravestones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks , the cemetery 's earliest gravestones were simple wooden boards . Several gravestones are ornately carved , including one modeled on a tree stump . The cemetery is active , with the most recent burials at the property 's northern end . Dr. William Blum , Sr. , an <unk> at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing , is interred at the cemetery . 
 = Toledo War = 
 The Toledo War ( 1835 – 36 ) , also known as the Michigan – Ohio War , was an almost bloodless boundary dispute between the U.S. state of Ohio and the adjoining territory of Michigan . 
 Originating from conflicting state and federal legislation passed between 1787 and 1805 , the dispute resulted from poor understanding of geographical features of the Great Lakes at the time . Varying interpretations of the law caused the governments of Ohio and Michigan to both claim sovereignty over a 468 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 210 km2 ) region along the border , now known as the Toledo Strip . When Michigan petitioned for statehood in 1835 , it sought to include the disputed territory within its boundaries ; Ohio 's congressional delegation was in turn able to stall Michigan 's admission to the Union . 
 Beginning in 1835 , both sides passed legislation attempting to force the other side 's capitulation . Ohio 's governor Robert Lucas and Michigan 's 24 @-@ year @-@ old " Boy Governor " Stevens T. Mason were both unwilling to cede jurisdiction of the Strip , so they raised militias and helped institute criminal penalties for citizens submitting to the other 's authority . The militias were mobilized and sent to positions on opposite sides of the Maumee River near Toledo , but besides mutual taunting there was little interaction between the two forces . The single military confrontation of the " war " ended with a report of shots being fired into the air , incurring no casualties . 
 During the summer of 1836 , Congress proposed a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and approximately three @-@ quarters of the Upper Peninsula . The compromise was considered a poor outcome for Michigan ; nearly all of the Upper Peninsula was still Indian territory at the time . Voters in a state convention in September soundly rejected the proposal . 
 In December 1836 , the Michigan government , facing a dire financial crisis and pressure from Congress and President Andrew Jackson , called another convention ( called the " Frostbitten Convention " ) which accepted the compromise that resolved the Toledo War . The later discovery of copper and iron deposits and the plentiful timber in the Upper Peninsula more than offset Michigan 's economic loss in surrendering Toledo . 
 = = Origins = = 
 In 1787 , the Congress of the Confederation enacted the Northwest Ordinance , which created the Northwest Territory in what is now the upper Midwestern United States . The Ordinance specified that the territory was eventually to be divided into " not less than three nor more than five " future states . It was determined that the north @-@ south boundary for three of these states was to be " an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan " ( now known to be approximately 41 @.@ 62 ° N , near Marquette Park , Gary , Indiana ) . 
 At the time , the actual location of this extreme was unknown . The most highly regarded map of the time , the " Mitchell Map " , placed it at a latitude near the mouth of the Detroit River ( approximately 42 @.@ 05 ° N ) . This meant that the entire shoreline of Lake Erie west of Pennsylvania would have belonged to the state that was to become Ohio . When Congress passed the Enabling Act of 1802 , which authorized Ohio to begin the process of becoming a U.S. state , the language defining Ohio 's northern boundary differed slightly from that used in the Northwest Ordinance : the border was to be " an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan , running east ... until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line [ with Canada ] , and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid " . 
 Because the territorial boundary line between the U.S. and Canada ran through the middle of Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River , combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan , the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio 's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River , and possibly even of the Detroit River . Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania , and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan , Huron , and Superior . 
 During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802 , the delegates allegedly received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than had previously been believed ( or mapped ) . Thus , it was possible that an east – west line extending east from Lake Michigan 's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay , or worse , might not intersect the lake at all ; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended , the more land Ohio would lose , perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania . 
 Addressing this contingency , the Ohio delegates included a provision in the draft Ohio constitution that if the trapper 's report about Lake Michigan 's position was correct , the state boundary line would be angled slightly northeast so as to intersect Lake Erie at the " most northerly cape of the Miami [ Maumee ] Bay . " This provision would guarantee that most of the Maumee River watershed and all of the southern shore of Lake Erie west of Pennsylvania would fall in Ohio . The draft constitution with this proviso was accepted by the United States Congress , but before Ohio 's admission to the Union in February 1803 , the proposed constitution was referred to a Congressional committee . The committee 's report stated that the clause defining the northern boundary depended on " a fact not yet ascertained " ( the latitude of the southern extreme of Lake Michigan ) , and the members " thought it unnecessary to take it [ the provision ] , at the time , into consideration . " 
 When Congress created the Michigan Territory in 1805 , it used the Northwest Ordinance 's language to define the territory 's southern boundary , which therefore differed from that in Ohio 's state constitution . This difference , and its potential ramifications , apparently went unnoticed at the time , but it established the legal basis for the conflict that would erupt 30 years later . 
 = = Creation of the Toledo Strip = = 
 The location of the border was contested throughout the early 19th century . Residents of the Port of Miami — which would later become Toledo — urged the Ohio government to resolve the border issue . The Ohio legislature , in turn , passed repeated resolutions and requests asking Congress to take up the matter . In 1812 , Congress approved a request for an official survey of the line . Delayed because of the War of 1812 , it was only after Indiana 's admission to the Union in 1816 that work on the survey commenced . U.S. Surveyor General Edward Tiffin , who was in charge of the survey , was a former Ohio governor . As a result , Tiffin employed surveyor William Harris to survey not the Ordinance Line , but the line as described in the Ohio Constitution of 1802 . When completed , the " Harris Line " placed the mouth of the Maumee River completely in Ohio . When the results of the survey were made public , Michigan territorial governor Lewis Cass was unhappy , since it was not based on the Congressionally approved Ordinance Line . In a letter to Tiffin , Cass stated that the Ohio @-@ biased survey " is only adding strength to the strong , and making the weak still weaker . " 
 In response , Michigan commissioned a second survey that was carried out by John A. Fulton . The Fulton survey was based upon the original 1787 Ordinance Line , and after measuring the line eastward from Lake Michigan to Lake Erie , it found the Ohio boundary to lie south of the mouth of the Maumee River . The region between the Harris and Fulton survey lines formed what is now known as the " Toledo Strip . " This ribbon of land between northern Ohio and southern Michigan spanned a region five to eight miles ( 8 to 13 km ) wide , over which both jurisdictions claimed sovereignty . While Ohio refused to cede its claim , Michigan quietly occupied it for the next several years , setting up local governments , building roads , and collecting taxes throughout the area . 
 = = = Economic significance = = = 
 The land known as the Toledo Strip was and still is a commercially important area . Prior to the rise of the railroad industry , rivers and canals were the major " highways of commerce " in the American Midwest . A small but important part of the Strip — the area around present day Toledo and Maumee Bay — fell within the Great Black Swamp , and this area was nearly impossible to navigate by road , especially after spring and summer rains . Draining into Lake Erie , the Maumee River was not necessarily well @-@ suited for large ships , but it did provide an easy connection to Indiana 's Fort Wayne . At the time , there were plans to connect the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes through a series of canals . One such canal system approved by the Ohio legislature in 1825 was the Miami and Erie Canal that included a connection to the Ohio River and an outflow into Lake Erie via the Maumee River . 
 During the conflict over the Toledo Strip , the Erie Canal was built , linking New York City and the Eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes at Buffalo . The canal , finished in 1825 , immediately became a major route for trade and migration . Corn and other farm products ( from the Midwest ) were able to be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River . In addition , the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished , making existing port cities such as Buffalo boomtowns . 
 The success of the Erie Canal inspired many other canal projects . Because the western end of Lake Erie offered the shortest overland route to the frontiers of Indiana and Illinois , Maumee Harbor was seen as a site of immediate importance and great value . Detroit was twenty miles ( 32 km ) up the Detroit River from Lake Erie , and faced the difficult barrier of the Great Black Swamp to the south . Because of this , Detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals , and later railroads , than was Toledo . From this perspective on the rapidly developing Midwest of the 1820s and 1830s , both states had much to gain by controlling the land in the Toledo Strip . 
 In addition , the Strip west of the Toledo area is a prime location for agriculture , because of its well @-@ drained , fertile loam soil . The area had for many years been characterized by high per @-@ acre <unk> of corn and wheat . Michigan and Ohio both wanted what seemed strategically and economically destined to become an important port and a prosperous region . 
 = = Prelude to conflict = = 
 In 1820 – 21 , the federal land surveys had reached the disputed area from two directions , progressing southward from a baseline in Michigan and northward from one in Ohio . For unknown reasons , Surveyor General Tiffin ordered the two surveys to close on the Northwest Ordinance ( Fulton ) line , rather than Harris ' line , perhaps lending implicit support to Michigan 's claims over Ohio 's . Thus , townships that were established north of the line assumed they were part of Michigan Territory . By the early 1820s , the growing territory reached the minimum population threshold of 60 @,@ 000 to qualify for statehood . However , when Michigan sought to hold a state constitutional convention in 1833 , Congress rejected the request because of the still disputed Toledo Strip . 
 Ohio asserted that the boundary was firmly established in its constitution and thus Michigan 's citizens were simply intruders ; the state government refused to negotiate the issue with the Michigan Territory . The Ohio Congressional delegation was active in blocking Michigan from attaining statehood , lobbying other states to vote against Michigan . In January 1835 , frustrated by the political stalemate , Michigan 's acting territorial Governor Stevens T. Mason called for a constitutional convention to be held in May of that year despite Congress ' refusal to approve an enabling act authorizing such a state constitution . 
 In February 1835 , Ohio passed legislation that set up county governments in the Strip . The county in which Toledo sat would , later in 1835 , be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas , a move that further exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan . Also , during this period , Ohio attempted to use its power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set the state border to be the Harris Line . 
 Michigan , led by the young and hot @-@ headed Mason , responded with the passage of the Pains and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed ; the act made it a criminal offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip , under penalty of a fine up to $ 1 @,@ 000 , up to five years imprisonment at hard labor , or both . Acting as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the territory , Mason appointed Brigadier @-@ General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia , with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers . Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own , and he soon sent forces to the Strip area . The Toledo War had begun . 
 Former United States President John Quincy Adams , who at the time represented Massachusetts in Congress , backed Michigan 's claim . In 1833 , when Congress rejected Michigan 's request for a convention , Adams summed up his opinion on the dispute : " Never in the course of my life have I known a controversy of which all the right was so clearly on one side and all the power so overwhelmingly on the other . " 
 = = War = = 
 Acting as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of Ohio 's militia , Governor Lucas — along with General John Bell and about 600 other fully armed militiamen — arrived in Perrysburg , Ohio , ten miles ( 16 km ) southwest of Toledo , on March 31 , 1835 . Shortly thereafter , Governor Mason and General Brown arrived to occupy the city of Toledo proper with around 1 @,@ 000 armed men , intending to prevent Ohio advances into the Toledo area as well as stopping further border marking from taking place . 
 = = = Presidential intervention = = = 
 In a desperate attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the resulting political crisis , U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General , Benjamin Butler , for his legal opinion on the border dispute . At the time , Ohio was a growing political power in the Union , with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators . In contrast , Michigan , still being a territory , had only a single non @-@ voting delegate . Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections , and it would have been devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio 's electoral votes . Therefore , Jackson calculated that his party 's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio . 
 The response that Jackson received from Butler was unexpected : the Attorney General held that until Congress dictated otherwise , the land rightfully belonged to Michigan . This presented a political dilemma for Jackson that spurred him to take action that would greatly influence the outcome of the " war " . 
 On April 3 , 1835 , Jackson sent two representatives from Washington , D.C. , Richard Rush of Pennsylvania and Benjamin Chew Howard of Maryland , to Toledo to arbitrate the conflict and present a compromise to both governments . The proposal , presented on April 7 , recommended that the re @-@ survey to mark the Harris Line commence without further interruption by Michigan , and that the residents of the affected region be allowed to choose their own state or territorial governments until the Congress could definitively settle the matter . 
 Lucas reluctantly agreed to the proposal , and began to disband his militia , believing the debate to be settled . Three days later , elections in the region were held under Ohio law . However , Mason refused the deal and he continued to prepare for possible armed conflict . 
 During the elections , Ohio officials were harassed by Michigan authorities and the area residents were threatened with arrest if they submitted to Ohio 's authority . On April 8 , 1835 , the Monroe County , Michigan sheriff arrived at the home of Major Benjamin F. Stickney , an Ohio partisan . In the first contact between Michigan partisans and the Stickney family , the sheriff arrested two Ohioans under the Pains and Penalties Act on the basis that the men had voted in the Ohio elections . 
 = = = Battle of Phillips Corners = = = 
 Following the election , Lucas believed that the commissioners ' actions had alleviated the situation and he once again sent out surveyors to mark the Harris Line . The project went without serious incident until April 26 , 1835 , when the surveying group was attacked by fifty to sixty members of General Brown 's militia in what is now called the " Battle of Phillips Corners " . The battle 's name is sometimes used as a synonym for the entire Toledo War . 
 Surveyors wrote to Lucas afterwards that while observing " the blessings of the Sabbath , " Michigan militia forces advised them to retreat . In the ensuing chase , " nine of our men , who did not leave the ground in time after being fired upon by the enemy , from thirty to fifty shots , were taken prisoners and carried away into [ Tecumseh ] . " While the details of the attack are disputed — Michigan claimed it fired no shots and had only discharged a few musket rounds in the air as the Ohio group retreated — the battle further infuriated both Ohioans and Michiganders and brought the two sides to the brink of all @-@ out war . 
 = = = Bloodshed in the summer of 1835 = = = 
 In response to allegations that Michigan 's militia fired upon Ohioans , Lucas called a special session of Ohio 's legislature on June 8 , 1835 to pass several more controversial acts , including the establishment of Toledo as the county seat of Lucas County , the establishment of a Court of Common Pleas in the city , a law to prevent the forcible abduction of Ohio citizens from the area , and a budget of $ 300 @,@ 000 to implement the legislation . Michigan 's territorial legislature responded with a budget appropriation of $ 315 @,@ 000 @.@ 00 to fund its militia . 
 In May and June 1835 , Michigan drafted a State Constitution , with provisions for a bicameral legislature , a supreme court , and other components of a functional state government . However , Congress was still not willing to allow Michigan 's entry into the Union , and President Jackson vowed to reject Michigan 's statehood until the border issue and " war " were resolved . 
 Lucas ordered his adjutant general , Samuel C. Andrews , to conduct a count of the militia , and was told that 10 @,@ 000 volunteers were ready to fight . That news became exaggerated as it traveled north , and soon thereafter the Michigan territorial press dared the Ohio " million " to enter the Strip as they " welcomed them to hospitable graves . " 
 In June 1835 , Lucas dispatched a delegation consisting of U.S. Attorney Noah Haynes Swayne , former Congressman William Allen , and David T. Disney to Washington D.C. to confer with President Andrew Jackson . The delegation presented Ohio 's case and urged the President to act swiftly to address the situation . 
 Throughout the summer of 1835 , both governments continued their practice of one @-@ upmanship , and constant skirmishes and arrests occurred . Citizens of Monroe County joined together in a posse to make arrests in Toledo . Partisans from Ohio , angered by the harassment , targeted the offenders with criminal prosecutions . Lawsuits were not only rampant , they served as a basis for retaliatory lawsuits from the opposite side . Partisans from both sides organized spying parties to keep track of the sheriffs of Wood County , Ohio and Monroe County , Michigan who were entrusted with the security of the border . 
 On July 15 , 1835 , tensions and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled . Monroe County , Michigan , Deputy Sheriff Joseph Wood went into Toledo to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney , but when Stickney and his three sons resisted , the whole family was subdued and taken into custody . During the scuffle , Two Stickney , son of the major , stabbed Wood with a pen knife and fled south into Ohio . Wood 's injuries were not life @-@ threatening . When Lucas refused Mason 's demand to extradite Two Stickney back to Michigan for trial , Mason wrote to President Jackson for help , suggesting that the matter be referred to the United States Supreme Court . At the time of the conflict , however , it was not established that the Supreme Court could resolve state boundary disputes , and Jackson declined the offer . Looking for peace , Lucas began making his own efforts to end the conflict , again through federal intervention via Ohio 's congressional delegation . 
 In August 1835 , at the strong urging of Ohio 's Congressmen , President Jackson removed Mason as Michigan 's Territorial Governor and appointed John S. ( " Little Jack " ) Horner in his stead . Before his replacement arrived , Mason ordered 1 @,@ 000 Michigan militiamen to enter Toledo and prevent the symbolically important first session of the Ohio Court of Common Pleas . While the idea was popular with Michigan residents , the effort failed : the judges held a midnight court before quickly retreating south of the Maumee River , where Ohio forces were positioned . 
 = = = Frostbitten Convention and the end of the Toledo War = = = 
 Mason 's successor Horner proved to be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short . Residents disliked him so much they burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital . In the October 1835 elections , voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor . The same election saw Isaac E. <unk> chosen as Michigan 's first U.S. Representative to Congress . Because of the dispute , however , Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him instead as a non @-@ voting delegate . The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November , Lucius Lyon and John Norvell , were treated with even less respect , being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery . 
 On June 15 , 1836 , Jackson signed a bill that allowed Michigan to become a state , but only after it ceded the Toledo Strip . In exchange for this concession , Michigan would be granted the western three @-@ quarters of what is now known as the Upper Peninsula ( the easternmost portion had already been included in the state boundaries ) . Because of the perceived worthlessness of the Upper Peninsula 's remote wilderness , a September 1836 special convention in Ann Arbor , Michigan , rejected the offer . 
 As the year wore on , Michigan found itself deep in a financial crisis and was nearly bankrupt , because of the high militia expenses . The government was spurred to action by the realization that a $ 400 @,@ 000 surplus ( $ 231 million in 2015 ) in the United States Treasury was about to be distributed to the 25 states , but not to territorial governments . Michigan would have been ineligible to receive a share of the money . 
 The " war " unofficially ended on December 14 , 1836 , at a second convention in Ann Arbor . Delegates passed a resolution to accept the terms set forth by the Congress . However , the calling of the convention was itself not without controversy . It had only come about because of an <unk> of private summonses , petitions , and public meetings . Since the legislature did not approve a call to convention , some said the convention was illegal . Whigs boycotted the convention . As a consequence , the resolution was rejected and ridiculed by many Michigan residents . Congress questioned the legality of the convention , but accepted the results of the convention regardless of its concerns . Because of these factors , as well as because of the notable cold spell at the time , the event later became known as the Frostbitten Convention . 
 On January 26 , 1837 , Michigan was finally admitted to the Union as the 26th state , without the Toledo Strip . 
 = = Subsequent history = = 
 The Toledo strip became a permanent part of Ohio , while the Upper Peninsula was considered a worthless wilderness by almost all familiar with the area . The vast mineral riches of the land were unknown until the discovery of copper in the Keweenaw Peninsula and iron in the Western Upper Peninsula ; this discovery led to a mining boom that lasted long into the 20th century . The economic gain of these resources more than offset any loss Michigan sustained from surrendering Toledo . 
 Differences of opinion about the exact boundary location continued until a definitive re @-@ survey was performed in 1915 . Re @-@ survey protocol would ordinarily require the surveyors to follow the Harris line exactly , but in this case , the surveyors deviated from the line in places . This prevented the situation of certain residents near the border being subject to changes in state residence , or land owners having parcels on both sides of the border . The 1915 survey was delineated by 71 granite markers , 12 inches ( 30 cm ) wide by 18 inches ( 45 cm ) high . Upon completion , the two states ' governors , Woodbridge Nathan Ferris of Michigan and Frank B. Willis of Ohio , shook hands at the border . 
 Traces of the original Ordinance Line can still be seen in northwestern Ohio and northern Indiana . The northernmost boundaries of Ottawa and Wood counties follow it , as well as many township boundaries in Fulton and Williams counties . Many old north @-@ south roads are offset as they cross the line , forcing traffic to jog east while traveling north . The line is identified on USGS topographical maps as the " South [ Boundary ] Michigan Survey " , and on Lucas County and Fulton County , Ohio road maps as " Old State Line Road . " 
 While the border on land was firmly set in the early 20th century , the two states were still in disagreement on the path of the border to the east , in Lake Erie . In 1973 , the two states finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters . In Michigan v. Ohio , the court upheld a special master 's report and ruled that the boundary between the two states in Lake Erie was angled to the northeast , as described in Ohio 's state constitution , and not a straight east – west line . One consequence of the court decision was that tiny Turtle Island just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan , was split between the two states . 
 This decision was the last border adjustment , putting an end to years of debate over the official boundary line . In modern times , although a general rivalry between Michiganders and Ohioans persists , overt conflict between the states is restricted primarily to the Michigan – Ohio State rivalry in American football and to a lesser degree between the rivalry between the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians in American League baseball ; the Toledo War is cited as the origins of the animosity represented in today 's rivalry . 
 = Commissioner 's Trophy ( MLB ) = 
 The Commissioner 's Trophy is presented each year by the Commissioner of Baseball to the Major League Baseball team that wins the World Series . Recent trophy designs contain flags representing each team in North America 's top two leagues , the National League and the American League . The two participating teams in that year 's World Series were previously represented by two press pins set on the base of the trophy . It is the only championship trophy of the four major sports in North America that is not named after a particular person ( contrasting with the National Hockey League 's Stanley Cup , the National Football League 's Vince Lombardi Trophy , and the National Basketball Association 's Larry O 'Brien Trophy ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Although it did not receive its current name until 1985 , the trophy was first awarded in 1967 , when the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox . Before that year , the champion of the World Series did not receive an official trophy . A new Commissioner 's Trophy is created each year , much like the Lombardi Trophy and the O 'Brien Trophy ; in contrast , the Stanley Cup is passed from champion to champion . Before 1997 , the trophy was presented to the winners in their locker room ; starting with that season , the presentation happened on the field if the champion clinched the title in their home stadium . Since its inception , the only year that the Commissioner 's Trophy has not been awarded was 1994 , when the players ' strike ended the season on August 11 , resulting in the cancellation of the entire post @-@ season . The New York Yankees have won the most Commissioner 's Trophies ( seven World Series wins since 1967 ) . The St. Louis Cardinals hold the record for the most trophies won in the National League ( four wins ) .

 The current trophy was redesigned in 1999 for the 2000 World Series and made by Tiffany & Co . The original trophy was designed by Lawrence <unk> , of Owatonna , Minnesota . The trophy is 24 inches ( 61 cm ) tall , excluding the base , and has a diameter of 11 inches ( 28 cm ) . It weighs approximately 30 pounds ( 14 kg ) and is made of sterling silver . The trophy features 30 gold @-@ plated flags , one for each of the Major League teams , which rise above a silver baseball covered with latitude and longitude lines that symbolize the world . The baseball also contains 24 @-@ karat <unk> baseball stitches .

 = Blood Money ( video game ) = 
 Blood Money is a side @-@ scrolling shooter video game developed by DMA Design . It was published by Psygnosis in 1989 for the Amiga , Atari ST and DOS , and in 1990 for the Commodore 64 . The game is set in four different locations on a planet , where players are tasked with attacking the enemies and defeating the bosses . 
 The game began development immediately after Menace , and borrowed similar gameplay elements . The development team used advanced hardware to develop Blood Money , utilising improved graphical and technological processes . The game was inspired by the presentation of Mr. Heli , and the animations of Blood Money would later inspire the development of Lemmings . The game was released to positive reviews ; praise was given to the game 's graphics and gameplay . The game was also commercially successful , selling over 40 @,@ 000 copies . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Blood Money is a horizontal side @-@ scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics . Players move through four stages on the planet , taking control of a different vehicle in each level : a helicopter in the metal world , a submarine in a water world , a spacesuit in an ice world , and a fighter jet in a fire world . Each vehicle features unique weaponry , which players use to attack all advancing enemies . Players can upgrade their vehicle with power @-@ ups , which grant them additional weapons and upgrades , such as support missiles and neutron bombs . The vehicles ' energy acts as players ' health , and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls . When all energy is lost , players lose a life ; three lives are provided at the beginning of the game , and additional lives can be collected as players progress through the levels . When all three lives are lost , the game ends and players are sent to the title screen . The first two levels may be selected from the beginning of the game ; after one level is complete , players can select any remaining world without restrictions . At the end of each level , players must defeat a boss . 
 = = Development = = 
 Following the successful release of Menace in 1988 , David Jones began developing Blood Money on 4 January 1989 , on the <unk> 386 @-@ DX computer that publisher Psygnosis granted him , alongside a Personal Development System . Jones saw Blood Money as a " further development " of the concept used in Menace . Jones was heavily inspired by the " cuteness " of Mr. Heli ( 1987 ) during the development of Blood Money . The game 's cover art was designed by British artist Peter Andrew Jones for the novel Protector ( 1973 ) by Larry Niven , and was adapted for the game 's cover . 
 With Blood Money , Jones was determined to utilise the full colour range of the Amiga , opting to use the blitter as opposed to the hardware scrolling ; the blitter allowed graphics to be drawn quickly . Tony Smith , who had worked on Menace , produced the graphics for Blood Money , while Jones began work on a new scrolling system . While developing his own game , Talisman , Mike Dailly created a compact method to move enemies on @-@ screen , which Jones incorporated into Blood Money . The game 's animations fascinated Jones ' friend Gary Timmons , who then began experimenting with Deluxe Paint ; his work on the program led to his employment at DMA Design , and inspired some of the animations used in DMA 's next game , Walker ( 1993 ) . The game 's introduction required a star field , which Jones took from a quick demonstration that Dailly had been working on . 
 The game was ported to the PC by Tim Ansell of Creative Assembly , and to Atari ST by Jones ' friend Wayne Smithson , while Dailly began porting the game to the Commodore 64 following the Personal Computer World Show in September 1989 . Dailly used the code from the Talisman demo , and wrote a new sprite system . He also re @-@ worked the multi @-@ directional scrolling , and wrote his own tape loading routines , wanting one that allowed players to play a simple game while Blood Money loaded . Smith designed the graphics for the port , and became confused by the limitations of the hardware : he had to draw double pixels in Deluxe Paint , and was limited to sixteen colours . Dailly finished developing the Commodore 64 version of Blood Money on 12 March 1990 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Blood Money received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release , particularly for its gameplay , graphical design , and sound . Gary Barrett of ST / Amiga Format wrote that the game is the best shoot ' em up game on the Amiga . Zzap ! 64 listed Blood Money as the best Amiga game of the 1980s , and ST Format named it the second @-@ best shoot ' em up game of 1990 . The game sold 40 @,@ 000 copies , which is double the sales of Menace . 
 Stuart Wynne of Zzap ! 64 found the game " superb to play " , while Robin Hogg of the same publication wrote that it " measures up " to the game 's " brilliant " graphics . The One found the game to be among the " most challenging and technically accomplished " shoot ' em ups , while ACE called it " compelling " . Conversely , Mike Pattenden of CU Amiga criticised the difficulty , noting its lack of rewards . 
 Critics praised the game 's graphical qualities . Paul Glancey of Computer and Video Games lauded the game 's opening sequence , and called the sprites among " the best designed and most fluidly animated " in an Amiga game . The Games Machine found the graphics " utterly impressive " , and Barrett of ST / Amiga Format wrote that the game is " in a class of its own " , praising the sprite animations . Zzap ! 64 's Hogg commended the animation and backgrounds . Conversely , CU Amiga 's Pattenden felt that the graphics lack depth . 
 The game 's use of sound received positive reactions . Phil King of Zzap ! 64 was impressed by the soundtrack , particularly praising the introductory music . The Games Machine echoed similar remarks , writing that the game features " excellent " sound , and Glancey of Computer and Video Games wrote that the sound chip was " put ... to <unk> ' good use " . Barrett of ST / Amiga Format preferred the sound effects over the music , though felt that they were inferior to those in Menace . Pattenden of CU Amiga felt that the sound is " a poor tune and some average effects " , while ACE called it " a little weedy " . 
 = Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics = 
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland competed as Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China . The United Kingdom was represented by the British Olympic Association ( BOA ) , and the team of selected athletes was officially known as Team GB . Britain is one of only five NOCs to have competed in every modern Summer Olympic Games since 1896 . The delegation of 547 people included 311 competitors – 168 men , 143 women – and 236 officials . The team was made up of athletes from the whole United Kingdom including Northern Ireland ( whose people may elect to hold Irish citizenship and are able to be selected to represent either Great Britain or Ireland at the Olympics ) . Additionally some British overseas territories compete separately from Britain in Olympic competition . 
 Great Britain 's medal performance at the 2008 Summer Olympics was its best in a century ; only its performance at the 1908 Summer Olympics , which Britain hosted in London , resulted in more gold medals being awarded . The total medal count , 47 , is also the third highest Great Britain has ever achieved , with only the 1908 and the 2012 Games resulting in more medals . 
 Great Britain finished 4th overall in the medal tables , a target previously set by UK Sport , the public body responsible for distributing funding to elite sport , for the 2012 Games . UK Sport considered whether to target 3rd place in the 2012 Games , which was hosted by the United Kingdom in London . 
 Because London was the host city of the 2012 Summer Olympics , a segment of their culture was performed during the closing ceremony .

 In June 2008 , UK Sport , which distributes National Lottery funding to elite sport , published its expectations for the Games . It identified 41 potential medals to target and expected to win 35 of them , including 10 to 12 gold medals and to finish 8th in the overall medal table . Team GB exceeded the gold medal expectations on 19 August when Paul Goodison earned Britain 's 13th gold medal in the men 's Laser class . The minimum medal target , of 35 medals , was passed on 20 August when they claimed their 36th medal — a bronze in the women 's RS : X , won by Bryony Shaw . The total medal target was equalled when canoeist Tim Brabants took gold in the men 's 1000 m K @-@ 1 claiming Britain 's 41st physical medal ( three further medals were guaranteed in boxing at the time ) . They later exceeded the total number of targeted medals when Heather Fell secured the silver in women 's modern pentathlon . 
 It should be noted that the medals claimed were not all ones that had been targeted , with Team GB falling short of targets in some disciplines whilst exceeding them in others . Nine out of seventeen disciplines met their targets . The British cyclists , for example doubled their medal target on 19 August when Victoria Pendleton won Britain 's 12th cycling medal , a gold in the women 's sprint . A further two medals were already guaranteed at this stage in the men 's individual sprint , where gold and silver were soon won by Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny respectively . In all Team GB won seven of the ten gold medals up for grabs at the velodrome . The swimmers also managed to double the targeted number of medals in their sport when David Davies won the team 's sixth swimming medal — a silver medal in the men 's 10 km open water marathon on 21 August . Despite the men 's and women 's archery teams having come second and third respectively at the 2007 world championships , British archers were unable to win either of their targeted medals . This led to criticism of the tactics used by head coach Peter Suk from members of the team .

Under the rules of the BOA , Chambers had been banned from future Games after testing positive for the steroid THG in 2003 . His appeal to overturn that ban , on the grounds that it was an unfair restraint of trade , failed and he was omitted from the squad . The team included former Olympic medal winners Marlon Devonish and Kelly <unk> , as well as former Olympic individual finalists Joanne Pavey , Paula Radcliffe , Helen Clitheroe and Tasha Danvers . Women 's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe faced a battle to be fit for the Games due to a stress fracture in her left thigh . She eventually proved fit enough to start the race but struggled to finish in 23rd position . 
 A total of four medals were won , one gold , two silver and one bronze . UK Athletics performance director Dave Collins stood down after the Games . This was due in part to the team 's failure to meet the UK Sport target of winning five medals ,

 The result of the uneven bars final , in which Britain 's Beth Tweddle placed 4th , was called into question after documents were found that seemed to say that Chinese gymnasts He Kexin and Yang <unk> were only 14 , and therefore under the age required to compete , at the time of the games . An investigation into their ages was launched by the IOC to determine whether it was necessary to disqualify them , thus Tweddle 's standing could have been changed to 2nd , giving her a silver medal . After a five and a half week investigation the Chinese athletes were cleared and the original results allowed to stand .

 The award of the 2012 Summer Olympics to London has brought the question of British participation in the football tournaments to the fore , given that there is traditionally no single British national football team . The British Olympic Association initially refused to rule out the possibility of entry for 2008 , but were unable to come to an agreement with the Scottish Football Association . The 2007 European Under @-@ 21 Championship , which served as the European qualifying tournament for the men 's competition , saw the England U @-@ 21 team reach the semifinals , which would have meant a place at the Olympics . Because at the Olympics the team is representative of the entire UK , England were thus prevented from taking this place , with instead a play @-@ off taking place between Portugal and Italy . A similar situation occurred with the England Women 's team who , by virtue of being one of the top three European sides at the 2007 World Cup , would have been granted a place at the Olympics . Instead , there was a play @-@ off between Denmark and Sweden .

 Angelina Jolie Pitt ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ; née Voight ; June 4 , 1975 ) is an American actress , filmmaker , and humanitarian . She has received an Academy Award , two Screen Actors Guild Awards , and three Golden Globe Awards , and has been cited as Hollywood 's highest @-@ paid actress . Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father , Jon Voight , in Lookin ' to Get Out ( 1982 ) . Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low @-@ budget production Cyborg 2 ( 1993 ) , followed by her first leading role in a major film , Hackers ( 1995 ) . She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace ( 1997 ) and Gia ( 1998 ) , and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl , Interrupted ( 1999 ) . 
 Jolie 's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft : Tomb Raider ( 2001 ) established her as a leading Hollywood actress . She continued her successful action @-@ star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith ( 2005 ) , Wanted ( 2008 ) , and Salt ( 2010 ) , and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart ( 2007 ) and Changeling ( 2008 ) , which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress . Beginning in the 2010s , she expanded her career into directing , screenwriting , and producing , starting with the wartime dramas In the Land of Blood and Honey ( 2011 ) and Unbroken ( 2014 ) . Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent ( 2014 ) . 
 Jolie is also known her humanitarian work , for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary <unk> of the Order of St Michael and St George ( <unk> ) , among other honors . She promotes various causes , including conservation , education , and women 's rights , and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry . Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton , she has been married to actor Brad Pitt since 2014 . They have six children together , three of whom were adopted internationally . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Born in Los Angeles , California , Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand . She is the sister of actor James Haven and niece of singer @-@ songwriter Chip Taylor . Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell . On her father 's side , Jolie is of German and Slovak descent , and on her mother 's side , she is of primarily French @-@ Canadian , Dutch , and German ancestry . Like her mother , Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois , although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th @-@ century Hurons . 
 After her parents ' separation in 1976 , Jolie and her brother lived with their mother , who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children . As a child , she often watched films with her mother and it was this , rather than her father 's successful career , that inspired her interest in acting , though at age five she had a bit part in Voight 's Lookin ' to Get Out ( 1982 ) . When Jolie was six years old , Bertrand and her live @-@ in partner , filmmaker Bill Day , moved the family to Palisades , New York ; they returned to Los Angeles five years later . Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute , where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions . 
 Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School , where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area 's affluent families , because her mother survived on a more modest income . She was teased by other students , who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces . Her early attempts at modeling , at her mother 's insistence , proved unsuccessful . She then transferred to Moreno High School , an alternative school , where she became a " punk outsider , " wearing all @-@ black clothing , going out moshing , and experimenting with knife play with her live @-@ in boyfriend . She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director , taking at @-@ home courses to study embalming . At age 16 , after the relationship had ended , Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment , before returning to theater studies , though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation , " I am still at heart — and always will be — just a punk kid with tattoos . " 
 As a teenager , Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people , and as a result she self @-@ harmed , later commenting , " For some reason , the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain , maybe feeling alive , feeling some kind of release , it was somehow therapeutic to me . " She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder , and began experimenting with drugs ; by age 20 , she had used " just about every drug possible , " particularly heroin . Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide — at age 19 and again at 22 , when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her . When she was 24 , she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center 's psychiatric ward . Two years later , after adopting her first child , Jolie found stability in her life , later stating , " I knew once I committed to Maddox , I would never be self @-@ destructive again . " 
 Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father , which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old . She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press . They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft : Tomb Raider ( 2001 ) , but their relationship again deteriorated . Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname " Voight " in favor of her middle name , which she had long used as a stage name ; the name change was granted on September 12 , 2002 . Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood , in which he claimed Jolie had " serious mental problems . " At that point , her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight . They did not speak for six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years , but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand 's death from ovarian cancer on January 27 , 2007 , before going public with their reconciliation three years later .

 = = = 1991 – 97 : Early work = = = 
 Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16 , but initially found it difficult to pass auditions , often being told that her demeanor was " too dark . " She appeared in five of her brother 's student films , made while he attended the USC School of Cinema @-@ Television , as well as in several music videos , namely Lenny Kravitz 's " Stand by My Woman " ( 1991 ) , Antonello Venditti 's " Alta <unk> " ( 1991 ) , The Lemonheads 's " It 's About Time " ( 1993 ) , and Meat Loaf 's " Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through " ( 1993 ) . She began to learn from her father , as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them . Their relationship during this time was less strained , with Jolie realizing that they were both " drama queens . " 
 Jolie began her professional film career in 1993 , when she played her first leading role in the straight @-@ to @-@ video science @-@ fiction sequel Cyborg 2 , as a near @-@ human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination . She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year . Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence ( 1995 ) , she starred in her first Hollywood picture , Hackers ( 1995 ) . The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote , " Kate stands out . That 's because she scowls even more sourly than [ her co @-@ stars ] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see @-@ through top . " Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office , but developed a cult following after its video release . 
 After starring in the modern @-@ day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is ( 1996 ) , Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon ( 1996 ) , of which The Hollywood Reporter said , " Jolie , an actress whom the camera truly adores , reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello 's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her . " In Foxfire ( 1996 ) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them . Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance , " It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character , but Jolie , Jon Voight 's knockout daughter , has the presence to overcome the stereotype . Though the story is narrated by Maddy , Legs is the subject and the catalyst . " 
 In 1997 , Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God , set in the Los Angeles underworld . The film was not well received by critics ; Chicago Sun @-@ Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie " finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive ; she seems too nice to be [ a mobster 's ] girlfriend , and maybe she is . " Her next work , as a <unk> in the CBS miniseries True Women ( 1997 ) , was even less successful ; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer , Robert Strauss dismissed her as " horrid , a fourth @-@ rate Scarlett O 'Hara " who relies on " gnashed teeth and overly <unk> lips . " Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones 's " Anybody Seen My Baby ? " as a stripper who leaves mid @-@ performance to wander New York City . 
 = = = 1998 – 2000 : Breakthrough = = = 
 Jolie 's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT 's George Wallace ( 1997 ) , about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace , played by Gary Sinise . Jolie portrayed Wallace 's second wife , Cornelia , a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film . George Wallace was very well received by critics and won , among other awards , the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film . Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance . 
 Jolie 's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO 's Gia ( 1998 ) . The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi 's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin , and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid @-@ 1980s . Vanessa Vance of <unk> retrospectively noted , " Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia , and it 's easy to see why . Jolie is fierce in her portrayal — filling the part with nerve , charm , and desperation — and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed . " For the second consecutive year , Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award . She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award . 
 In accordance with Lee Strasberg 's method acting , Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films , and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with . While shooting Gia , she told her husband , Jonny Lee Miller , that she would not be able to phone him : " I 'd tell him : ' I 'm alone ; I 'm dying ; I 'm gay ; I 'm not going to see you for weeks . ' " After Gia wrapped , she briefly gave up acting , because she felt that she had " nothing else to give . " She separated from Miller and moved to New York , where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting . Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia , Jolie resumed her career . 
 Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell 's Kitchen ( 1998 ) , Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart ( 1998 ) , part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery , Gillian Anderson , and Ryan Phillippe . The film received predominantly positive reviews , and Jolie was praised in particular ; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote , " Jolie , working through an overwritten part , is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she 's willing to gamble . " She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review . 
 In 1999 , Jolie starred in the comedy @-@ drama Pushing Tin , alongside John Cusack , Billy Bob Thornton , and Cate Blanchett . The film met with mixed reception from critics , and Jolie 's character — Thornton 's seductive wife — was particularly criticized ; writing for The Washington Post , Desson Howe dismissed her as " a completely ludicrous writer 's creation of a free @-@ spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die , wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home . " Jolie then co @-@ starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector ( 1999 ) , playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington 's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer . The film grossed $ 151 @.@ 5 million worldwide , but was critically unsuccessful . Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded , " Jolie , while always delicious to look at , is simply and woefully miscast . " 
 Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl , Interrupted ( 1999 ) , an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen 's memoir of the same name . While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her , the film instead marked Jolie 's final breakthrough in Hollywood . She won her third Golden Globe Award , her second Screen Actors Guild Award , and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress . For Variety , Emanuel Levy noted , " Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant , irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna 's rehabilitation . " 
 In 2000 , Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster , Gone in 60 Seconds , which became her highest @-@ grossing film to that point , earning $ 237 @.@ 2 million internationally . She had a minor role as the mechanic ex @-@ girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage ; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that " all she does in this movie is stand around , cooling down , modeling those fleshy , pulsating muscle @-@ tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth . " Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl , Interrupted . 
 = = = 2001 – 04 : Mainstream recognition = = = 
 Although highly regarded for her acting abilities , Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience , but Lara Croft : Tomb Raider ( 2001 ) made her an international superstar . An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames , the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist @-@ adventurer Lara Croft . Although the film generated mostly negative reviews , Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance ; Newsday 's John Anderson commented , " Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and <unk> . " The film was an international hit , earning $ 274 @.@ 7 million worldwide , and launched her global reputation as a female action star . 
 Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail @-@ order bride in Original Sin ( 2001 ) , the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike . The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie 's decision to follow her Oscar @-@ winning performance with " soft @-@ core nonsense . " The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It ( 2002 ) , though equally unsuccessful , marked an unusual choice for Jolie . Salon 's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women 's role , noting that her performance " doesn 't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing ' Satisfaction . ' " Despite her lack of box office success , Jolie remained in demand as an actress ; in 2002 , she established herself among Hollywood 's highest @-@ paid actresses , earning $ 10 – $ 15 million per film for the next five years . 
 Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft Tomb Raider : The Cradle of Life ( 2003 ) , which was not as lucrative as the original , earning $ 156 @.@ 5 million at the international box office . She also starred in the music video for Korn 's " Did My Time " , which was used to promote the sequel . Her next film was Beyond Borders ( 2003 ) , in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen . Though unsuccessful with audiences , the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes . Beyond Borders was a critical failure ; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie 's ability to " bring electricity and believability to roles , " but wrote that " the limbo of a hybrid character , a badly written cardboard person in a fly @-@ infested , blood @-@ and @-@ guts world , completely defeats her . " 
 The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie . She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer . The film received mixed reviews ; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded , " Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done , but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour . " Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow , a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen , and voiced her first family film , the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale . Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone 's Alexander , about the life of Alexander the Great , was met with mixed reception , particularly concerning her Slavic accent . Commercially , the film failed in North America , which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander 's bisexuality , but it succeeded internationally , for a total revenue of $ 167 @.@ 3 million .

 In 2005 , Jolie returned to major box office success with the action @-@ comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith , in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins . The film received mixed reviews , but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads ; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted , " While the story feels haphazard , the movie gets by on gregarious charm , galloping energy and the stars ' thermonuclear screen chemistry . " With box office takings of $ 478 @.@ 2 million worldwide , Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh @-@ highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie 's highest @-@ grossing live @-@ action film for the next decade . 
 Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro 's The Good Shepherd ( 2006 ) , Jolie starred as <unk> Pearl in the documentary @-@ style drama A Mighty Heart ( 2007 ) . Based on Pearl 's memoir of the same name , the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband , The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl , in Pakistan . Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role , the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface . The resulting performance was widely praised ; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as " well @-@ measured and moving , " played " with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent . " She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award . Jolie also played a shape @-@ shifting seductress , Grendel 's mother , in the epic Beowulf ( 2007 ) , created through motion capture . The film was critically and commercially well received , taking in revenues of $ 196 @.@ 4 million worldwide . 
 By 2008 , Jolie was considered the highest @-@ paid actress in Hollywood , earning $ 15 – $ 20 million per film . While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years , Jolie 's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $ 20 million plus a percentage . She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted ( 2008 ) , which proved an international success , earning $ 341 @.@ 4 million worldwide . The film received predominantly favorable reviews ; writing for The New York Times , Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was " perfectly cast as a super @-@ scary , seemingly amoral assassin , " adding that " she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats . " 
 Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood 's drama Changeling ( 2008 ) . Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders , the film centers on Christine Collins , who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles , only to realize the boy is an imposter . Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted , " Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm , the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril . " She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award , a Screen Actors Guild Award , a BAFTA Award , and an Academy Award for Best Actress . Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda ( 2008 ) , the first work in a major family franchise , later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 ( 2011 ) and Kung Fu Panda 3 ( 2016 ) . 
 After her mother 's death in 2007 , Jolie began appearing in fewer films , later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother 's acting ambitions . Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt ( 2010 ) , in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent . Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star , agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role . With revenues of $ 293 @.@ 5 million , Salt became an international success . The film received generally positive reviews , with Jolie 's performance in particular earning praise ; Empire critic William Thomas remarked , " When it comes to selling incredible , crazy , death @-@ defying antics , Jolie has few peers in the action business . " 
 Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist ( 2010 ) . The film was a critical failure , though Roger Ebert defended Jolie 's performance , stating that she " does her <unk> " and " plays her femme fatale with flat @-@ out , drop @-@ dead sexuality . " Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office , the film went on to gross a respectable $ 278 @.@ 3 million worldwide , cementing Jolie 's appeal to international audiences . She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance , which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high @-@ profile presence at the awards ceremony .

 After directing the documentary A Place in Time ( 2007 ) , which was distributed through the National Education Association , Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey ( 2011 ) , a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner , set during the 1992 – 95 Bosnian War . She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors , after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador . To ensure authenticity , she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia — including stars Goran Kostić and Zana <unk> — and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay . Upon release , the film received mixed reviews ; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote , " Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly , even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what 's onscreen . " The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film , and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war . 
 After a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year absence from the screen , Jolie starred in Maleficent ( 2014 ) , a live @-@ action re @-@ imagining of Disney 's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty . Critical reception was mixed , but Jolie 's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise ; The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the " heart and soul " of the film , adding that she " doesn 't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent — she infuses it , wielding a magnetic and effortless power . " In its opening weekend , Maleficent earned nearly $ 70 million at the North American box office and over $ 100 million in other markets , marking Jolie 's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films , genres usually dominated by male actors . The film went on to gross $ 757 @.@ 8 million worldwide , becoming the fourth @-@ highest grossing film of the year and Jolie 's highest @-@ grossing film ever . 
 Jolie next completed her second directorial venture , Unbroken ( 2014 ) , about World War II hero Louis <unk> ( 1917 – 2014 ) , a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp . Based on Laura Hillenbrand 's biography of the same name , the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O 'Connell . After a positive early reception , Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender , but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition , though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute . In a typical review , Variety 's Justin Chang noted the film 's " impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint " , but deemed it " an extraordinary story told in dutiful , unexceptional terms . " Financially , Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend , eventually earning over $ 163 million worldwide . 
 Jolie 's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea ( 2015 ) , in which she starred opposite her husband , Brad Pitt , marking their first collaboration since 2005 's Mr. & Mrs. Smith . Based on her screenplay , the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie , who drew inspiration from her own mother 's life . Critics , however , dismissed it as a " vanity project , " as part of an overall poor reception . Writing for The Washington Post , Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion , stating , " By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous , as are its stars . But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness , sprinkled with stilted sentiments . " Despite starring two of Hollywood 's leading actors , the film received only a limited release . 
 First They Killed My Father , Jolie 's adaptation of <unk> Ung 's memoir of the same name , is scheduled to debut on Netflix in late 2016 . In addition to directing the film , she co @-@ wrote its screenplay with her friend Ung , a human rights activist who survived Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge regime . Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney 's sequel .

 Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft : Tomb Raider ( 2001 ) in war @-@ torn Cambodia , an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world . Upon her return home , she contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) for information on international trouble spots . To learn more about the conditions in these areas , she began visiting refugee camps around the world . In February 2001 , she went on her first field visit , an 18 @-@ day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania ; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed . 
 In the following months , Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan , where she donated $ 1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal , the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual . She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits . Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27 , 2001 . 
 Over the next decade , she went on more than 40 field missions , meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries . In 2002 , when asked what she hoped to accomplish , she stated , " Awareness of the plight of these people . I think they should be commended for what they have survived , not looked down upon . " To that end , her 2001 @-@ 02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels , which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders . 
 Jolie aimed to visit what she termed " forgotten emergencies , " crises that media attention had shifted away from . She became noted for travelling to war zones , such as Sudan 's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict , the Syrian @-@ Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War , where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi @-@ national forces , and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan , where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit . To aid her travels , she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world ; she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus <unk> and Cessna 208 Caravan single @-@ engine aircraft . 
 On April 17 , 2012 , after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador , Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres , the first to take on such a position within the organization . In her expanded role , she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level , with a focus on major refugee crises . In the months following her promotion , she made her first visit as Special Envoy — her third over all — to Ecuador , where she met with Colombian refugees , and she accompanied Guterres on a week @-@ long tour of Jordan , Lebanon , Turkey , and Iraq , to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria . Since then , Jolie has gone on a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf . 
 = = = Conservation and community development = = = 
 In an effort to connect her Cambodian @-@ born son with his heritage , Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003 . The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang , adjacent to <unk> national park in the Cardamom mountains , which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species . She purchased the park 's 60 @,@ 000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son , the Maddox Jolie Project . In recognition of her conservation efforts , King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31 , 2005 . 
 In November 2006 , Jolie expanded the scope of the project — renamed the Maddox Jolie @-@ Pitt Foundation ( MJP ) — to create Asia 's first Millennium Village , in accordance with UN development goals . She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise , noted economist Jeffrey Sachs , at the World Economic Forum in Davos , where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006 . Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special , The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa , which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya . By mid @-@ 2007 , some 6 @,@ 000 villagers and 72 employees — some of them former poachers employed as rangers — lived and worked at MJP , in ten villages previously isolated from one another . The compound includes schools , roads , and a soy milk factory , all funded by Jolie . Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters . 
 After filming Beyond Borders ( 2003 ) in Namibia , Jolie became patron of the <unk> Wildlife Foundation , a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert . She first visited the <unk> farm during production of the film , which features vultures rescued by the foundation . In December 2010 , Jolie and her partner , Brad Pitt , established the Shiloh Jolie @-@ Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the <unk> Wildlife Sanctuary , a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari . In name of their Namibian @-@ born daughter , they have funded large @-@ animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic , housing , and a school for the San Bushmen community at <unk> . Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie @-@ Pitt Foundation , established in September 2006 . 
 = = = Child immigration and education = = = 
 Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations , including the " <unk> Alien Child Protection Act of 2005 . " She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards , explaining , " As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington , that 's the way to move the ball . " Since October 2008 , she has co @-@ chaired Kids in Need of Defense ( KIND ) , a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S. Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation , by 2013 , KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children . Jolie had previously , from 2005 to 2007 , funded the launch of a similar initiative , the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants ' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children . 
 Jolie has also advocated for children 's education . Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative 's annual meeting in September 2007 , she has co @-@ chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict , which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict @-@ affected regions . In its first year , the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children , youth affected by the Darfur conflict , and girls in rural Afghanistan , among other affected groups . The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations ' Center for Universal Education — founded by the partnership 's co @-@ chair , noted economist Gene Sperling — to establish education policies , which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies , G8 development agencies , and the World Bank . Since April 2013 , all proceeds from Jolie 's high @-@ end jewelry collection , Style of Jolie , have benefited the partnership 's work . 
 Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at <unk> refugee camp in northwestern Kenya , which opened in 2005 , and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements <unk> and <unk> <unk> in eastern Afghanistan , which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively . In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia , Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005 . In February 2006 , she opened the Maddox <unk> Children 's Center , a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV , in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh . In <unk> , Ethiopia , the birthplace of her eldest daughter , she funds a sister facility , the Zahara Children 's Center , which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis . Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee . 
 = = = Human rights and women 's rights = = = 
 After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) in June 2007 , she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports , including " Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities . " In January 2011 , she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship , a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries . Its member attorneys , called Jolie Legal Fellows , have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution . 
 Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government , which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency . In May 2012 , she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative ( PSVI ) with Foreign Secretary William Hague , who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey ( 2011 ) . PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co @-@ operation . Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting , where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration , and before the UN security council , which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date . In June 2014 , she co @-@ chaired the four @-@ day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict , the largest @-@ ever meeting on the subject , which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations . 
 Through her work on the PSVI , Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and <unk> <unk> , who served as special advisers to Hague . Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton <unk> , a partnership dedicated to women 's rights and international justice , among other causes . In May 2016 , Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university 's Centre on Women , Peace and Security , which she had launched with Hague the previous year . 
 = = = Recognition and honors = = = 
 Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work . In August 2002 , she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service 's Immigration and Refugee Program , and in October 2003 , she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association . She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA @-@ USA in October 2005 , and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007 . In October 2011 , UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long @-@ serving staff , in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador . 
 In November 2013 , Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award , an honorary Academy Award , from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . In June 2014 , she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George ( <unk> ) for her services to the UK 's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones . Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary <unk> during a private ceremony the following October .

 Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14 . Her mother allowed them to live together in her home , of which Jolie later said , " I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room . She made the choice , and because of it , I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way . " She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity , and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16 . 
 During filming of Hackers ( 1995 ) , Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller , her first lover since the relationship in her early teens . They were not in touch for many months after production ended , but eventually reconnected and married soon after on March 28 , 1996 . She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T @-@ shirt , upon which she had written the groom 's name in her blood . Jolie and Miller separated in September 1997 and divorced on February 3 , 1999 . They remained on good terms , and Jolie later explained , " It comes down to timing . I think he 's the greatest husband a girl could ask for . I 'll always love him , we were simply too young . " 
 Jolie began a relationship with model @-@ actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire ( 1996 ) . She later said , " I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn 't married my husband . I fell in love with her the first second I saw her . " According to Shimizu , their relationship lasted many years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people , though it had ended by 2005 . In 2003 , when asked if she was bisexual , Jolie responded , " Of course . If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow , would I feel that it 's okay to want to kiss and touch her ? If I fell in love with her ? Absolutely ! Yes ! " 
 After a two @-@ month courtship , Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5 , 2000 , in Las Vegas . They met on the set of Pushing Tin ( 1999 ) , but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern , while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton , her co @-@ star in Playing God ( 1997 ) . As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love — most famously wearing one another 's blood in vials around their necks — their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media . Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002 , but abruptly separated three months later . Their divorce was finalized on May 27 , 2003 . When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage , Jolie stated , " It took me by surprise , too , because overnight , we totally changed . I think one day we had just nothing in common . And it 's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don 't know yourself yet . " 
 In early 2005 , Jolie was involved in a well @-@ publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the reason for the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston . She and Pitt were alleged to have started an affair during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith ( 2005 ) . Jolie stated on several occasions that this was not true , but also said that they " fell in love " on the set ; she explained in 2005 , " To be intimate with a married man , when my own father cheated on my mother , is not something I could forgive . I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that . I wouldn 't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife . " Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006 , when Jolie confirmed that she was pregnant with Pitt 's child . They announced their engagement in April 2012 , after seven years together , and married on August 23 , 2014 , at their estate Château Miraval in Correns , France . Jolie took on Pitt 's name following their marriage . As a couple , they are dubbed " Brangelina " by the entertainment media , and are the subject of worldwide media coverage . 
 = = = Children = = = 
 On March 10 , 2002 , Jolie adopted her first child , seven @-@ month @-@ old Maddox <unk> , from an orphanage in Battambang , Cambodia . He was born as Rath <unk> on August 5 , 2001 , in a local village . After twice visiting Cambodia , while filming Lara Croft : Tomb Raider ( 2001 ) and on a UNHCR field mission , Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband , Billy Bob Thornton , where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him . The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking . Although Jolie 's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering , her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful . Once the process was finalized , she took custody of him in Namibia , where she was filming Beyond Borders ( 2003 ) . Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together , but she adopted Maddox alone , and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later . 
 Jolie adopted a daughter , six @-@ month @-@ old Zahara Marley , from an orphanage in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , on July 6 , 2005 . Zahara was born as <unk> on January 8 , 2005 , in <unk> . Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan , based on official testimony from her grandmother , but her birth mother later came forward in the media . She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick , and said she thought Zahara was " very fortunate " to have been adopted by Jolie . Jolie was accompanied by her partner , Brad Pitt , when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara . She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia , having first visited the country earlier that year . After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children , she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie @-@ Pitt , which was granted on January 19 , 2006 . Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after . 
 In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship , Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child . On May 27 , 2006 , she gave birth to a daughter , Shiloh Nouvel , in Swakopmund . They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity , rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs . People and Hello ! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $ 4 @.@ 1 and $ 3 @.@ 5 million respectively , a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time , with all proceeds donated to UNICEF . 
 On March 15 , 2007 , Jolie adopted a son , three @-@ year @-@ old Pax Thien , from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam . He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29 , 2003 , in HCMC , where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth . After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006 , Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent , because Vietnam 's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co @-@ adopt . After their return to the U.S. , she petitioned the court to change her son 's surname from Jolie to Jolie @-@ Pitt , which was approved on May 31 . Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21 , 2008 . 
 At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008 , Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins . For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice , France , reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade . She gave birth to a son , Knox Léon , and a daughter , Vivienne Marcheline , on July 12 , 2008 . The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello ! for a reported $ 14 million — the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken . All proceeds were donated to the Jolie @-@ Pitt Foundation . 
 = = = Cancer prevention treatment = = = 
 On February 16 , 2013 , at age 37 , Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87 % risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene . Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations : her mother , actress Marcheline Bertrand , had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer , while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer . Her aunt , who had the same BRCA1 defect , died from breast cancer three months after Jolie 's operation . Following the mastectomy , which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent , Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts . Two years later , in March 2015 , after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer , she underwent a preventive oophorectomy , as she had a 50 % risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly . Despite hormone replacement therapy , the surgery brought on premature menopause . 
 After completing each operation , Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op @-@ eds published by The New York Times , with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices . She detailed her diagnosis , surgeries , and personal experiences , and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children . Jolie further wrote , " On a personal note , I do not feel any less of a woman . I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity . " 
 Jolie 's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing . Her decision was met with praise from various public figures , while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at @-@ risk women . Dubbed " The Angelina Effect " by a Time cover story , Jolie 's influence led to a " global and long @-@ lasting " increase in BRCA gene testing : the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK , parts of Canada , and India , as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S. Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase , the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same , meaning Jolie 's message had reached those most at risk . In her first op @-@ ed , Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs , which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court , in a June 2013 ruling , invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics .

 = = = Public profile = = = 
 As the daughter of actor Jon Voight , Jolie appeared in the media from an early age . After embarking on her own career , she earned a reputation as a " wild child , " which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s . Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives , experiences with drugs , and her sex life , particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism . In 2000 , when asked about her outspokenness , she stated , " I say things that other people might go through . That 's what artists should do — throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand . " Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie , upon winning her Oscar , kissed her brother on the lips and said , " I 'm so in love with my brother right now . " She dismissed the rumors , saying , " It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus , " and explained that , as children of divorce , she and James relied on one another for emotional support . 
 Jolie 's reputation began to change positively after she , at age 26 , became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , later commenting , " In my early 20s I was fighting with myself . Now I take that punk in me to Washington , and I fight for something important . " Owing to her extensive activism , her Q Score — the industry 's measure of celebrities ' likability — nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006 . Her recognizability grew accordingly ; by 2006 , she was familiar to 81 % of Americans , compared to 31 % in 2000 . She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media , without employing a publicist or an agent . Her Q Score remained above average even when , in 2005 , she was accused of ending Brad Pitt 's marriage to Jennifer Aniston , at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker , mother , sex symbol , and humanitarian . A decade later , Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016 . 
 Jolie 's general influence and wealth are extensively documented . In a 2006 global industry survey by <unk> in 42 international markets , Jolie , together with Pitt , was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide . She was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008 , and in 2011 had an endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton reportedly worth $ 10 million — a record for a single advertising campaign . Jolie was among the Time 100 , a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time , in 2006 and 2008 . She was named the world 's most powerful celebrity in Forbes 's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009 , and , though ranked lower overall , was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013 . Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood 's highest @-@ paid actress in 2009 , 2011 , and 2013 , with estimated annual earnings of $ 27 million , $ 30 million , and $ 33 million respectively . 
 = = = Appearance = = = 
 Jolie 's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal . Many media outlets , including Vogue , People , and Vanity Fair , have cited her as the world 's most beautiful woman , while others such as Esquire , FHM , and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive ; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women . Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos , eyes , and in particular her full lips , which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas 's chin or Bette Davis 's eyes . Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb " quod me <unk> me <unk> " ( what nourishes me destroys me ) , the Tennessee Williams quote " A prayer for the wild at heart , kept in cages " , four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection , a twelve @-@ inch tiger , and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children . Over time , she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos , including " Billy Bob " , the name of her second husband . 
 Professionally , Jolie 's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance . Some of her most commercially successful films , including Lara Croft : Tomb Raider ( 2001 ) and Beowulf ( 2007 ) , overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal , with Empire stating that her " pneumatic figure , " " feline eyes , " and " bee @-@ stung lips " have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences . Conversely , Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie 's " dark and intense sexuality " has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in , rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women 's roles , while Clint Eastwood , who directed her Oscar @-@ nominated performance in Changeling ( 2008 ) , opined that having " the most beautiful face on the planet " sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences . 
 Beyond her career , Jolie 's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large . In 2002 , AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie , which she considered a new development in American culture , adding that " there are many beautiful women in Hollywood , and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does . " Jolie 's physical attributes became highly sought @-@ after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery ; by 2007 , she was considered " the gold standard of beauty , " with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s . After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American physical ideal , compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991 , writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having " branched out beyond the Barbie @-@ doll ideal and embraced something quite different . " In 2013 , Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal , and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty .

 Apollo 11 was the first spaceflight that landed humans on the Moon . Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on July 20 , 1969 , at 20 : 18 UTC . Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC ; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and collected 47 @.@ 5 pounds ( 21 @.@ 5 kg ) of lunar material for return to Earth . The third crew member , Michael Collins , piloted the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rendezvousing with Columbia in lunar orbit . 
 Launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 , Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a Command Module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that landed back on Earth ; a Service Module ( SM ) , which supported the Command Module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a Lunar Module ( LM ) that had two stages – a lower stage for landing on the Moon , and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V 's upper stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility . They stayed a total of about 21 @.@ 5 hours on the lunar surface . The astronauts used Eagle 's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the Command Module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth . They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 . 
 Broadcast on live TV to a world @-@ wide audience , Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as " one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . " Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the U.S. President John F. Kennedy in a speech before the U.S. Congress : " before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth . "

 Apollo 11 was the second all @-@ veteran multi @-@ person crew ( the first being Apollo 10 ) in human spaceflight history . A previous solo veteran flight had been made on Soyuz 1 in 1967 by Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov . 
 Collins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot ( CMP ) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by Jim Lovell , his backup for that flight . After Collins was medically cleared , he took what would have been Lovell 's spot on Apollo 11 ; as a veteran of Apollo 8 , Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11 's backup crew and promoted to backup commander .

 In early 1969 , Anders accepted a job with the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date . At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch ( at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed ) and would later join Lovell 's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP .

 After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy , assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to Manned Spacecraft Center director George M. Low to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft . During early mission planning , the names <unk> and Haystack were used and put in the news release , but the crew later decided to change them . 
 The Command Module was named Columbia after the <unk> , the giant cannon shell " spacecraft " fired by a giant cannon ( also from Florida ) in Jules Verne 's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon . The Lunar Module was named Eagle for the national bird of the United States , the bald eagle , which is featured prominently on the mission insignia . 
 = = = Insignia = = = 
 The Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins , who wanted a symbol for " peaceful lunar landing by the United States " . He chose an eagle as the symbol , put an olive branch in its beak , and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance . NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too " warlike " and after some discussion , the olive branch was moved to the claws . The crew decided the Roman numeral XI would not be understood in some nations and went with " Apollo 11 " ; they decided not to put their names on the patch , so it would " be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing " . All colors are natural , with blue and gold borders around the patch . 
 When the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971 , the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side . The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979 , ten years after the Apollo 11 mission .

 In addition to many people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site , millions watched the event on television , with NASA Chief of Public Information Jack King providing commentary . President Richard M. Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House . 
 A Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A , part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16 , 1969 at 13 : 32 : 00 UTC ( 9 : 32 : 00 a.m. EDT local time ) . It entered Earth orbit , at an altitude of 100 @.@ 4 nautical miles ( 185 @.@ 9 km ) by 98 @.@ 9 nautical miles ( 183 @.@ 2 km ) , twelve minutes later . After one and a half orbits , the S @-@ IVB third @-@ stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans @-@ lunar injection ( TLI ) burn at 16 : 22 : 13 UTC . About 30 minutes later the command / service module pair separated from this last remaining Saturn V stage and docked with the Lunar Module still nestled in the Lunar Module Adaptor . After the Lunar Module was extracted , the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon , while the third stage booster flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into orbit around the Sun . 
 On July 19 at 17 : 21 : 50 UTC , Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit . In the thirty orbits that followed , the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility ( Mare <unk> ) about 12 miles ( 19 km ) southwest of the crater Sabine D ( <unk> , <unk> ) . The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extravehicular activity ( EVA ) challenges . 
 = = = Lunar descent = = = 
 On July 20 , 1969 , the Lunar Module Eagle separated from the Command Module Columbia . Collins , alone aboard Columbia , inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged . 
 As the descent began , Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were " long " ; they would land miles west of their target point . 
 Five minutes into the descent burn , and 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) above the surface of the Moon , the LM navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected " 1202 " and " 1201 " program alarms . Inside Mission Control Center in Houston , Texas , computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent , and this was relayed to the crew . The program alarms indicated " executive overflows " , meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them . 
 Due to an error in the checklist manual , the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position . This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer . The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15 % of its time . The computer ( or rather the software in it ) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing . It then sent out an alarm , which meant to the astronaut , I 'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I 'm going to keep only the more important tasks ; i.e. , the ones needed for landing ... Actually , the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions . A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software . The software 's action , in this case , was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re @-@ establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn 't recognized this problem and taken recovery action , I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was . 
 = = = Landing = = = 
 When Armstrong again looked outside , he saw that the computer 's landing target was in a boulder @-@ strewn area just north and east of a 300 @-@ meter ( 980 ft ) diameter crater ( later determined to be West crater , named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse ) . Armstrong took semi @-@ automatic control and , with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data , landed at 20 : 17 : 40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left . 
 Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions , and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning . This was later found to be the result of greater propellant ' slosh ' than expected , uncovering a fuel sensor . On subsequent missions , extra anti @-@ slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this . 
 Throughout the descent , Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong , who was busy piloting the LM . A few moments before the landing , a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67 @-@ inch ( 170 cm ) probes hanging from Eagle 's footpads had touched the surface , and he said : " Contact light ! " Three seconds later , Eagle landed and Armstrong said " Shutdown . " Aldrin immediately said " Okay , engine stop . ACA – out of detent . " Armstrong acknowledged " Out of detent . Auto " and Aldrin continued " Mode control – both auto . Descent engine command override off . Engine arm – off . 413 is in . " 
 Charles Duke , CAPCOM during the landing phase , acknowledged their landing by saying " We copy you down , Eagle . " 
 Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin 's completion of the post landing checklist with " Engine arm is off " , before responding to Duke with the words , " Houston , Tranquility Base here . The Eagle has landed . " Armstrong 's unrehearsed change of call sign from " Eagle " to " Tranquility Base " emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful . Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control : " Roger , <unk> — Tranquility , we copy you on the ground . You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue . We 're breathing again . Thanks a lot . " 
 Two and a half hours after landing , before preparations began for the EVA , Aldrin radioed to Earth : 
 " This is the LM pilot . I 'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in , whoever and wherever they may be , to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way . " 
 He then took communion privately . At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O 'Hair ( who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis ) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space . As such , Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon . Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church , and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church , the Rev. Dean Woodruff . Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of <unk> magazine and in his book Return to Earth . Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20 . 
 The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five @-@ hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning . However , they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early , thinking that they would be unable to sleep . 
 = = = Lunar surface operations = = = 
 The astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package ( <unk> ) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle 's twin triangular windows , which gave them a 60 ° field of view . Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled . Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System ( PLSS ) . According to veteran Moon @-@ walker John Young , a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack , so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress . 
 Several books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon . 
 At 02 : 39 UTC on Monday July 21 , 1969 , Armstrong opened the hatch , and at 02 : 51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface . The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet . Climbing down the nine @-@ rung ladder , Armstrong pulled a D @-@ ring to deploy the Modular Equipment <unk> Assembly ( MESA ) folded against Eagle 's side and activate the TV camera , and at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface . The first landing used slow @-@ scan television incompatible with commercial TV , so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor , significantly reducing the quality of the picture . The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia . Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia . Despite some technical and weather difficulties , ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth . Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available , recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re @-@ use at NASA . 
 While still on the ladder , Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM Descent Stage bearing two drawings of Earth ( of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres ) , an inscription , and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon . The inscription read : 
 Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon , July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind . 
 After describing the surface dust as " very fine @-@ grained " and " almost like a powder , " six and a half hours after landing , Armstrong stepped off Eagle 's <unk> and declared , " That 's one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . " 
 Armstrong intended to say " That 's one small step for a man " , but the word " a " is not audible in the transmission , and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast . When later asked about his quote , Armstrong said he believed he said " for a man " , and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the " a " in square brackets . One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words " for a " together ; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth , partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory . More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the " a " may have been spoken but obscured by static . 
 About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon 's surface , Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick . He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh . This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM . 
 Twelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected , Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface , and described the view with the simple phrase , " Magnificent desolation . " 
 In addition to fulfilling President Kennedy 's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s , Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system ; therefore , Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post @-@ landing condition . He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep , then mounted it on a tripod 68 feet ( 21 m ) from the LM . The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA . 
 Armstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity , one @-@ sixth of Earth 's , was " even perhaps easier than the simulations ... It 's absolutely no trouble to walk around . " Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around , including two @-@ footed kangaroo hops . The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards , but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance . <unk> became the preferred method of movement . The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead . The fine soil was quite slippery . Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle 's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit , though the helmet was warmer in sunlight , so he felt cooler in shadow . 
 The astronauts planted a specially designed U.S. flag on the lunar surface , in clear view of the TV camera . Some time later , President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone @-@ radio transmission which Nixon called " the most historic phone call ever made from the White House . " Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call , but Frank Borman , who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11 , convinced Nixon to keep his words brief , to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy 's legacy . Armstrong thanked the President , and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment : 
 Nixon : Hello , Neil and Buzz . I 'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House . And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made . I just can 't tell you how proud we all are of what you 've done . For every American , this has to be the proudest day of our lives . And for people all over the world , I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is . Because of what you have done , the heavens have become a part of man 's world . And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility , it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth . For one priceless moment in the whole history of man , all the people on this Earth are truly one : one in their pride in what you have done , and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth . 
 Armstrong : Thank you , Mr. President . It 's a great honor and privilege for us to be here , representing not only the United States , but men of peace of all nations , and with interest and curiosity , and men with a vision for the future . It 's an honor for us to be able to participate here today . 
 The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow , slowing work somewhat . As they worked , the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits , the integrated thermal meteoroid garment . 
 They deployed the <unk> , which included a passive seismograph and a Lunar Ranging <unk> ( <unk> ) . Then Armstrong walked 196 feet ( 60 m ) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes . He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes – the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11 . The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles . Many of the surface activities took longer than expected , so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes . 
 Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> was named after Armstrong , Aldrin , and Collins . 
 During this period , Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down . He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out . However , as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk , Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15 @-@ minute extension . In a 2010 interview , Armstrong , who had walked a maximum of 196 feet ( 60 m ) from the LM , explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk 's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts ' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon . 
 = = = Lunar ascent and return = = = 
 Aldrin entered Eagle first . With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21 @.@ 55 kilograms ( 47 @.@ 5 lb ) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor . Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve , and Aldrin tossed the bag down ; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder 's third rung and climbed into the LM . After transferring to LM life support , the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks , lunar overshoes , one Hasselblad camera , and other equipment . They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep . 
 President Nixon 's speech writer William Safire had prepared In Event of Moon Disaster for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon . The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon 's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman , in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster . According to the plan , Mission Control would " close down communications " with the LM , and a clergyman would " commend their souls to the deepest of the deep " in a public ritual likened to burial at sea . The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke 's First World War poem , " The Soldier " . The plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts ' wives . 
 While moving within the cabin , Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon . There was concern this would prevent firing the engine , stranding them on the Moon . Fortunately , a felt @-@ tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch . Had this not worked , the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine . 
 After about seven hours of rest , the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight . Two and a half hours later , at 17 : 54 UTC , they lifted off in Eagle 's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit . 
 After more than 21 ½ total hours on the lunar surface , they had left behind scientific instruments that included a <unk> array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes . They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch , and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk . The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower , Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world . The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress , a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation , and the names of NASA 's past and present top management . ( In his 1989 book , Men from Earth , Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin . ) Also , according to Deke Slayton 's book Moonshot , Armstrong carried with him a special diamond @-@ studded astronaut pin from Slayton . 
 Film taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag , planted some 25 feet ( 8 m ) from the descent stage , whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine . Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple : " The ascent stage of the LM separated ... I was concentrating on the computers , and Neil was studying the attitude indicator , but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over . " Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least 100 feet ( 30 m ) from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust . 
 After rendezvous with Columbia , Eagle 's ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21 , 1969 , at 23 : 41 UTC . Just before the Apollo 12 flight , it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon . Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle 's orbit had decayed , resulting in it impacting in an " uncertain location " on the lunar surface . The location is uncertain because the Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned , and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non @-@ uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time . NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon . 
 On July 23 , the last night before splashdown , the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented : 
 ... The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery , every piece of which worked flawlessly ... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly . All this is possible only through the blood , sweat , and tears of a number of a people ... All you see is the three of us , but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others , and to all of those , I would like to say , " Thank you very much . " 
 Aldrin added : 
 This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon ; more , still , than the efforts of a government and industry team ; more , even , than the efforts of one nation . We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown ... Personally , in reflecting on the events of the past several days , a verse from Psalms comes to mind . " When I consider the heavens , the work of Thy fingers , the Moon and the stars , which Thou hast ordained ; What is man that Thou art mindful of him ? " 
 Armstrong concluded : 
 The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort ; next with the American people , who have , through their will , indicated their desire ; next with four administrations and their Congresses , for implementing that will ; and then , with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft , the Saturn , the Columbia , the Eagle , and the little EMU , the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface . We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft ; who did the construction , design , the tests , and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft . To those people tonight , we give a special thank you , and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight , God bless you . Good night from Apollo 11 . 
 On the return to Earth , a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed , potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return . A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director , Charles Force , had his ten @-@ year @-@ old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease . Greg later was thanked by Armstrong .

 On July 24 , the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module Columbia just before dawn local time ( 16 : 51 UTC ) at 13 ° 19 ′ N 169 ° 9 ′ W , in the Pacific Ocean 2 @,@ 660 km ( 1 @,@ 440 nmi ) east of Wake Island , 380 km ( 210 nmi ) south of Johnston Atoll , and 24 km ( 13 nmi ) from the recovery ship , USS Hornet . 
 At 16 : 44 UTC the drogue parachutes had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully . During splashdown , the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts . " Everything 's okay . Our checklist is complete . Awaiting swimmers " , was Armstrong 's last official transmission from the Columbia . A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting . Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction . Though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote , it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site . Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments ( <unk> ) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the Hornet . Additionally , astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the Command Module wiped with <unk> to remove any lunar dust that might be present . The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk . 
 A second Sea King helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one , where a NASA flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the 0 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 930 m ) trip back to the Hornet . 
 After touchdown on the Hornet , the astronauts exited the helicopter , leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen . The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay # 2 where the astronauts walked the 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) to the Mobile Quarantine Facility ( MQF ) where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine . This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions , Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 , before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped . 
 President Richard Nixon was aboard Hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth . He told the astronauts , " As a result of what you 've done , the world has never been closer together before . " After Nixon departed , the Hornet was brought alongside the five @-@ ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship 's crane , placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF . The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where the Command Module and MQF were airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center . 
 In accordance with the recently passed Extra @-@ Terrestrial Exposure Law , the astronauts were placed in quarantine for fear that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks . However , after almost three weeks in confinement ( first in their trailer and later in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center ) , the astronauts were given a clean bill of health . On August 10 , 1969 , the astronauts exited quarantine . 
 = = = Celebration = = = 
 On August 13 , they rode in parades in their honor in New York , Chicago , and Los Angeles . On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official State Dinner to celebrate the flight , attended by members of Congress , 44 governors , the Chief Justice of the United States , and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel . President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom . This celebration was the beginning of a 45 @-@ day " Giant Leap " tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom . Many nations honored the first manned Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins . 
 On September 16 , 1969 , the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill . They presented two US flags , one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate , that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them . 
 = = Moon race = = 
 The Soviet Union was secretly attempting to compete with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile , they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes . On July 13 , three days before Apollo 11 's launch , they launched Luna 15 , which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11 . During descent , a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the surface . The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent , and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 .

 The Command Module is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum , Washington , D.C. It is in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance , sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer , the Spirit of St. Louis , the Bell X @-@ 1 , the North American X @-@ 15 , Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7 , and Gemini 4 . Armstrong 's and Aldrin 's space suits are displayed in the museum 's Apollo to the Moon exhibit . The quarantine trailer , the flotation collar , and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian 's Steven F. Udvar @-@ Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia . 
 In 2009 , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon , for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules , scientific instruments , and foot trails made by the astronauts . 
 In March 2012 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F @-@ 1 engines that launched Apollo 11 into space . The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean 's surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning . His team brought at least one of the five engines to the surface . In July 2013 , it was confirmed through serial numbers ( 2044 ) that F @-@ 1 engine parts brought up from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean were from the Apollo 11 launch .

 = HMS Hogue ( 1900 ) = 
 HMS Hogue was a Cressy @-@ class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy around 1900 . Upon completion she was assigned to the Channel Fleet and the China Station . In 1906 she became a training ship for the North America and West Indies Station before being placed in reserve in 1908 . Recommissioned at the start of World War I , she played a minor role in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a few weeks after the beginning of the war . Hogue was sunk by the German submarine U @-@ 9 , together with two of her sister ships , on 22 September 1914 . Unlike her sisters , only 48 of her crew were killed in the attack . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Hogue was designed to displace 12 @,@ 000 long tons ( 12 @,@ 000 t ) . The ship had an overall length of 472 feet ( 143 @.@ 9 m ) , a beam of 69 feet 6 inches ( 21 @.@ 2 m ) and a deep draught of 26 feet 9 inches ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She was powered by two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft , which produced a total of 21 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 15 @,@ 660 kW ) using steam provided by 30 Belleville boilers . The engines were designed to give a maximum speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) , although Hogue reached 22 @.@ 06 knots ( 40 @.@ 86 km / h ; 25 @.@ 39 mph ) with 21 @,@ 432 indicated horsepower ( 15 @,@ 982 kW ) on her sea trials . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 600 t ) of coal and her complement ranged from 725 to 760 officers and enlisted men . 
 Her main armament consisted of two breech @-@ loading ( BL ) 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 234 mm ) Mk X guns in single gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . They fired 380 @-@ pound ( 170 kg ) shells to a range of 15 @,@ 500 yards ( 14 @,@ 200 m ) . Her secondary armament of twelve BL 6 @-@ inch Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships . Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather . They had a maximum range of approximately 12 @,@ 200 yards ( 11 @,@ 200 m ) with their 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shells . A dozen quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats , eight on casemates on the upper deck and four in the superstructure . The ship also carried three 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . 
 The ship 's waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of 6 inches ( 152 mm ) and was closed off by 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) transverse bulkheads . The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick . The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from 1 – 3 inches ( 25 – 76 mm ) and the conning tower was protected by 12 inches ( 305 mm ) of armour .

 Hogue , named after the 1692 Battle of La Hogue , was laid down on 14 July 1898 by Vickers , Sons & Maxim at their Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness shipyard and launched on 13 August 1900 . She arrived at Plymouth to begin fitting out in September 1901 , and commenced her sea trials in early December . Hogue was completed on 19 November 1902 and assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1904 . On 11 March she collided with the merchant ship SS Meurthe off Europa Point . Later that year she was transferred to the China Station after a refit . 
 Two years later Hogue became the boys ' training ship for the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station . She was reduced to reserve at Devonport in 1908 and then assigned to the reserve Third Fleet at the Nore the next year . On 26 November 1909 a coal bunker explosion killed two crewmen . The ship received a lengthy refit at Chatham Dockyard in 1912 – 13 and was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron shortly after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 . 
 The squadron was tasked with patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea in support of a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France . During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August , the ship was part of Cruiser Force ' C ' , in reserve off the Dutch coast , and saw no action . Hogue did , however , tow the heavily damaged light cruiser Arethusa , flagship of the commander of the Harwich Force , Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt , back to port after the battle was over . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 On the morning of 22 September , Hogue and her sisters , Aboukir and Cressy , were on patrol without any escorting destroyers as they had been forced to seek shelter from bad weather . The three sisters were in line abreast , about 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) apart , at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . They were not expecting submarine attack , but they had lookouts posted and had one gun manned on each side to attack any submarines sighted . The weather had moderated earlier that morning and Tyrwhitt was en route to reinforce the cruisers with eight destroyers . 
 U @-@ 9 , commanded by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen , had been ordered to attack British transports at Ostend , but had been forced to dive and take shelter from the storm . On surfacing , she spotted the British ships and moved to attack . She fired one torpedo at 06 : 20 at Aboukir that struck her on the starboard side ; the ship 's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men . Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06 : 55 . As Hogue approached her sinking sister , Captain Wilmot Nicholson realized that it had been a submarine attack and signalled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water . Having stopped and lowered all her boats , Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06 : 55 . The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U @-@ 9 to broach the surface and Hogue 's gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again . The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed as all of her watertight doors had been open and sank at 07 : 15 . 
 Cressy attempted to ram the submarine , but did not hit anything and resumed her rescue efforts until she too was torpedoed at 07 : 20 . She too took on a heavy list and then capsized before sinking at 07 : 55 . Several Dutch ships began rescuing survivors at 08 : 30 and were joined by British fishing trawlers before Tyrwhitt and his ships arrived at 10 : 45 . The combined total from all three ships was 837 men rescued and 62 officers and 1 @,@ 397 enlisted men lost . Of these , Hogue lost a total of 48 men . 
 In 1954 the British government sold the salvage rights to all three ships to a German company and they were subsequently sold again to a Dutch salvage company which began salvaging the wrecks ' metal in 2011 . 
 = HMS Zubian = 
 HMS Zubian was a First World War Royal Navy Tribal @-@ class destroyer constructed from the forward end of HMS Zulu and the rear and mid sections of HMS Nubian . These two destroyers had been badly damaged in late 1916 , and rather than scrapping both hulls at the height of World War I , the Admiralty ordered that they be rebuilt as the composite Zubian and put back into service . She was commissioned into the fleet in June 1917 . The name Zubian is a portmanteau of the names of the original ships . 
 Zubian saw extensive service in the final two years of the war as part of the Dover Patrol . She sank the German U @-@ boat UC @-@ 50 in February 1918 , while she was on patrol in the English Channel . In late April , she participated in the First Ostend Raid as an escort for the bombardment force . After the war , Zubian was sold for scrap and broken up by December 1919 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Zubian was 85 @.@ 4 metres ( 280 ft ) long overall , with a beam of 8 @.@ 2 m ( 27 ft ) and a draught of 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) . She displaced 1 @,@ 040 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 020 long tons ; 1 @,@ 150 short tons ) . The ship 's propulsion system consisted of three Parsons steam turbines , which were powered by six oil @-@ fired Thornycroft boilers . These provided 14 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 10 @,@ 000 kW ) and a top speed of 33 knots ( 61 km / h ; 38 mph ) . She was armed with two QF 4 @-@ inch Mk V guns and two 18 in ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes . One gun was mounted on the forecastle and the other on the stern , with the two torpedo tubes amidships . Her crew numbered 68 officers and enlisted . 
 = = Service history = = 
 In late 1916 , two British destroyers of the 6th Flotilla in the Dover Patrol — Nubian and Zulu — were badly damaged by German attacks in the English Channel . Nubian 's bow had been destroyed by a torpedo from a German torpedo boat on 26 October , while Zulu had her stern blown off by a mine in the Channel on 8 November , and was towed to Calais . Both wrecks were then towed to Chatham Dockyard , where a complete destroyer was constructed by joining the <unk> of Zulu with the stern of Nubian , and despite a 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 89 mm ) difference in beam , the unique operation was successful . The ship was renamed Zubian by Admiral Reginald Bacon , the commander of the Dover Patrol . The hybrid destroyer was commissioned on 7 June 1917 . The choice of name caused confusion among the German Imperial Admiralty Staff , who knew of no such ship under construction . 
 Zubian joined the 6th Flotilla and served there until the end of the war . During this period , Zubian and the rest of the Flotilla rotated through nighttime patrols of the Dover Strait in groups of four , supported by flotilla leaders ; these patrols were intended to catch German torpedo boats that were conducting night bombardments of Allied positions in the Channel . On 4 February 1918 , she encountered the mine @-@ laying U @-@ boat UC @-@ 50 in the Dover Strait ; the U @-@ boat was surfaced about 400 yards ( 370 m ) off Zubian 's port bow with her radio antennae up . Zubian attempted to ram the submarine but the Germans managed to submerge . The destroyer then dropped depth charges over the submerged U @-@ boat and a significant amount of oil and wreckage was observed thereafter . Zubian marked the location with a buoy and an hour later , the patrol vessel HMS <unk> dropped additional depth charges there . <unk> later located an object that divers confirmed was UC @-@ 50 . 
 Zubian also participated in the First Ostend Raid two months later on the night of 23 – 24 April . The attack was intended to close the German @-@ held ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge , which were being used as bases for the U @-@ boats . Zubian was assigned to the bombardment force , and along with the destroyers Mentor and Lightfoot , provided the close escort for a group of six monitors . The bombardment unit was covered by the Harwich Force in the Channel . The bombardment force was tasked with suppressing the German coastal defences , while a pair of old cruisers attempted to steam into the harbour entrances , where they would be sunk as blockships . The effort failed when both cruisers ran aground far outside of the harbour . 
 Worn out by heavy wartime use , Zubian was sold in the immediate post @-@ war draw down and broken up for scrap by December 1919 .

 The song was met with a mixed reaction from music critics ; some were complimentary of her decision to work with Hit @-@ Boy and Rich Homie Quan , while others felt that Carey was trying too hard to appeal to a mass audience by doing so . Electro pop band Purple Crush also claimed that Carey used the hook from their 2013 song of the same name . Following the release of the album , " Thirsty " debuted on the South Korean International Gaon Single Chart at number 78 due to strong digital download sales . The song was included on Carey 's 2014 tour , The Elusive Chanteuse Show .

 " Thirsty " is a " club @-@ friendly " R & B song with an influence of hip hop music , which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 26 seconds . " Thirsty " is about how Carey 's lover has a thirst for fame which causes her to drown in her own misery . Billy Johnson , Jr. for Yahoo ! Music described the track as " [ dissing ] those desperate for attention . " The singer is " taking center stage as she takes aim at a <unk> " as she performs her " nonchalant " verses over a " skittering " minimal synth beat . The songs begins with the sound of a drink being poured into a glass , after which the instrumental begins to play and Carey sings line " You used to be Mr. All About Me , now you 're just thirsty for celebrity " in her upper register , then continues to ask her suitor " Why you try so damn hard ? " During the chorus , Carey repeatedly sings the hook " Uh , you 're <unk> @-@ tay / Uh , you 're <unk> @-@ tay " . 
 Rich Homie Quan performs background chants on " Thirsty " , although he is not credited on the album track list . He does , however , appear as a featured artist on an alternate version of the song , and performs one rap verse . For his part , he adds a " comedic element " by performing the line " Somebody get this girl a class of water / I say she six nickels , not a dime past a quarter . " The minimalist synth line of " Thirsty " has garnered comparisons to that of " Niggas in Paris " , a song performed by Kanye West and Jay @-@ Z , which was also produced by Hit @-@ Boy in 2011 . Critics have noted that although it is Hit @-@ Boy 's signature style to include a " steering background " beat in his production , that " Thirsty " is too " busy " compared to " Niggas in Paris " and that it comes off as " less appealing " and " watered @-@ down " in comparison . Gerrick D. Kennedy for the Los Angeles Times wrote that " Thirsty " lacks the " heft " of a song that Hit @-@ Boy produced called " Flawless " for Beyoncé 's self @-@ titled album in 2013 .

 While some critics thought Mariah was trying too hard with " Thirsty , " the song has garnered mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics . Christina Lee for Idolator was complimentary of the song , describing it as a single which her record label most probably wanted to release from the album in the first place . She went on to say that it is " tailor @-@ made " for radio airplay " right now . " Writing for the same publication , Mike Wass wrote that he thought the solo version was better than the alternate version featuring Rich Homie Quan 's rap verse , writing " It 's an improvement on the original . Not that there 's anything wrong with the slick Hit @-@ Boy production — I just don 't like being distracted from Mimi ’ s mesmerizing vocals , not even for a verse . " 
 Writing for Yahoo ! Music , Bill Johnson , Jr. praised Carey for collaborating with Rich Homie Quan and for " working with rappers who are on the cusp of going mainstream . " He explained that it is her " consistency and emphasis " on exposing up and coming rappers who are yet to release their own album that allows her to appeal to younger audiences , noting that they both benefit from the exposure . MTV writer Nadeska Alexis commented that it was " unexpected " to hear a song whereby Carey , Hit @-@ Boy , and Rich Homie Quan featured on the same song , but continued to write that it " sounds like a blend of classic Mariah @-@ pop . " 
 Slant Magazine 's Alexa Camp described the track as a " corrective of sorts " to her 2012 urban single release " Triumphant ( Get ' Em ) " , a collaboration with Rick Ross and Meek Mill , noting that " Thirsty " is not " littered " with guest features . She continued to write that although it does not possess the memorability of some of her past releases , such as " Fantasy " or " Emotions " , it serves as " a reminder of the pop gold Mimi can mine when she 's on top of her game . " Gerrick D. Kennedy for the Los Angeles Times was less impressed with " Thirsty " , writing that although the song is not a " dud , " he believes that Carey deserves better considering that it was her " who set the blueprint for mashing ethereal pop @-@ R & B melodies with speaker @-@ rattling hip @-@ hop beats . " He continued to criticize Carey for being too " desperate " , writing : 
 Inspired by street lingo — " thirsty " for the unaware , is someone who is eager , verging on desperate — it seems laughable that Carey opted to pen such a gimmicky tune . She 's delivered some of the best pop songs of the last two dozen years , and she certainly knows her way around a club groove ( Need proof ? Spin " It 's Like That , " which is almost a decade old ) . So why do an uninspired jam about a scrub if you 're not going to deliver a sassy , melisma @-@ soaked banger like those that came so effortlessly in the past ( see " Obsessed , " " Shake It Off , " " Heartbreaker " ) ? Why not remind the many contemporaries you 've inspired , who are owning radio with more interesting spins off your blueprint , what makes you Mariah Carey ?

 A couple of days after " Thirsty " premiered , Los Angeles based pop duo Purple Crush posted a picture on their Instagram account which showed a picture of themselves on the left and a picture of Carey on the right , claiming that the song bares similarities to a single they released of the same name in 2013 . Mike Wass from Idolator noted that the only similarity appears to be the name of the song and two words used in the hook .

 = Homer the Great = 
 " Homer the Great " is the twelfth television episode of The Simpsons ' sixth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 8 , 1995 . In the episode , Homer discovers that Lenny and Carl are members of the ancient secret society known as the Stonecutters . Gaining membership through Grampa , Homer takes great pleasure in the society 's many privileges and events . During a celebratory dinner , he unwittingly destroys the Stonecutters ' " Sacred Parchment " . Homer is stripped of his membership until it is discovered that he is " The Chosen One " who will lead the Stonecutters to glory . 
 The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jim Reardon . Patrick Stewart guest stars as " Number One " , the leader of the Springfield chapter of the Stonecutters . It features cultural references to Freemasonry and films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Emperor . Since airing , the episode has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics and has been called " one of the better episodes of the series " by Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood in their book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide . The song " We Do " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for " Outstanding Music And Lyrics " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer notices that his colleagues Lenny and Carl are enjoying inexplicable privileges such as free soft drinks , massage chairs , and great parking spots at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant . He discovers they are part of an ancient secret society known as the Stonecutters . To join , one must either be the son of a Stonecutter or save the life of a Stonecutter . Homer complains about not being let in and reveals to Marge his past experience being excluded from clubs : when he was young , a group of children formed the " No <unk> Club " and did not allow him to join , while letting in another boy named Homer <unk> , claiming that the name allowed for one Homer . While extolling the Stonecutters at the dinner table , he discovers that his father is a member and is admitted . 
 After the painful and humiliating initiations required to join the Stonecutters , which is made up of many of the male characters on the show , Homer takes great pleasure in the society 's secret privileges , such as an underground byway bypassing Springfield 's traffic jams , drinking bouts and free <unk> ( in order to get from the parking lot to his workplace faster ) . During a celebratory rib dinner with his fellow Stonecutters commemorating the society 's 1500th anniversary , he unwittingly uses the society ’ s Hallowed Sacred Parchment as a napkin , tissue and cotton swab , destroying it . He is stripped of his Stonecutter robes and is sentenced to walk home naked dragging the " Stone of Shame . " Before he leaves , however , it is discovered that Homer has a birthmark in the shape of the Stonecutter emblem , identifying him as the Chosen One who , it was foretold , would lead the Stonecutters to greatness . The " Stone of Shame " is instantly removed and replaced with the ( much larger and heavier ) " Stone of Triumph . " 
 Homer is crowned the new leader of the Stonecutters . Initially enjoying himself , Homer soon feels isolated by his power when the other members treat him differently due to his new position , and asks Lisa for advice . She suggests that he ask the Stonecutters to do volunteer work to help the community , which Homer agrees to , and has the Stonecutters use their resources to help with daycare and community upkeep . This angers the Stonecutters , who misinterpret Homer 's good intentions as going mad with power . They convene their World Council and consider killing Homer before he supposedly kills anyone for disobeying his commands . Instead , Moe suggests they form a new society , the Ancient Mystic Society of No <unk> ( once again including a now adult Homer <unk> ) . 
 Homer becomes despondent about losing his secret club and replaces every member with monkeys which he gets drunk and makes act out Civil War battles . Marge consoles him by telling him he is a member of a " very exclusive club " , the Simpson family , which she and Homer wear special rings to show loyalty . The family subjects him to some hazing and paddling . 
 = = Production = = 
 Although " Homer the Great " was written by John Swartzwelder , the story was suggested by executive producer David Mirkin . Mirkin did not have enough time to write the episode and asked Swartzwelder to do it . Mirkin came up with the idea while driving home from a rewrite early in the morning and listened to a religious radio station where they were talking about Freemasonry . Mirkin decided it would make a great episode , where everyone in Springfield was a member of a Masonic society and Homer was left on the outside and felt neglected . 
 The song " We Do " was not included in the original script and was suggested by Matt Groening . It was written by the writer 's room , who threw in as many things that annoyed them as they possibly could . It was described as " one of the series ’ best musical numbers " by Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide , and was later included in the clip show " All Singing , All Dancing " . 
 The episode guest stars Patrick Stewart as Number One . Stewart said , " I think my appearance in The Simpsons and an appearance that I did on Sesame Street — in praise of the letter B — were perhaps the two most distinguished bits of work that I 've done in the US . " Mirkin has said that Patrick Stewart is " one of the best guest performances " because " he was so committed to [ the ] character . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The term " Stonecutters " and the organization 's symbol are references to Freemasonry . The Stonecutters are in possession of the Ark of the Covenant and when they burn Homer 's underwear in it , souls escape , which is a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark . When crowned " The Chosen One " , Homer , dressed in finery , enters through some curtains , a reference to the 1987 film The Last Emperor . The army of small monkeys may be a reference to the end of the film Aguirre , the Wrath of God .

 In its original American broadcast , " Homer the Great " finished 38th in the ratings for the week of January 2 to January 8 , 1995 . The episode was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week . Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . 
 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , called it " a brilliant crack at freemasonry , with all the secret signs , one @-@ upmanship , rituals and unusual membership rules . Add to this Patrick Stewart 's amazing voice and you have one of the better episodes of the series . " Patrick <unk> of MSNBC listed " Homer the Great " as his third favorite episode , calling it " as a whole [ it ] is ( almost ) unsurpassable . " Dave <unk> of the Tucson Citizen listed " Homer the Great " as his favorite episode " because it is such a wonderful satire on fraternal organizations and because of Patrick Stewart 's hilarious guest @-@ starring role as " Number One . " Total Film 's Nathan Ditum ranked Stewart 's performance as the ninth best guest appearance in the show 's history . TV Squad 's Adam Finley said the episode " does a great job of satirizing Freemasons . " Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review of the sixth season DVD : " I think it peters out a bit as it progresses ; the best moments show the influence of the Stonecutters , and the show drags a little toward the end . Nonetheless , it still offers a solid piece of work . " In 2010 , Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the fifth best in the show 's history . 
 John Swartzwelder and Alf Clausen were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for " Outstanding Music And Lyrics " for the song " We Do " . It was later included in the album Songs in the Key of Springfield . 
 = Operation Sandwedge = 
 Operation Sandwedge was a proposed clandestine intelligence @-@ gathering operation against the political enemies of the Richard Nixon presidential administration . The proposals were put together by H. R. Haldeman , John Ehrlichman and Jack Caulfield in 1971 . Caulfield , a former police officer , created a plan to target the Democratic Party and the anti @-@ Vietnam War movement , inspired by what he believed to be the Democratic Party 's employment of a private investigation firm . 
 The operation was planned to help Nixon 's 1972 re @-@ election campaign . Operation Sandwedge included proposed surveillance of Nixon 's enemies to gather information on their financial status and sexual activities , to be carried out through illegal black bag operations . 
 Control of Sandwedge was passed to G. Gordon Liddy , who abandoned it in favor of a strategy of his own devising , Operation Gemstone , which detailed a plan to break into Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex . Liddy 's plan eventually led to the downfall of Nixon 's presidency , which Caulfield believed would have been avoided had Sandwedge been acted upon .
