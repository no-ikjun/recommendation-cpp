 On 17 February 1644 , Jirgalang , who was a capable military leader but looked uninterested in managing state affairs , willingly yielded control of all official matters to Dorgon . After an alleged plot by Hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 May of that year , Hooge was stripped of his title of Imperial Prince and his co @-@ conspirators were executed . Dorgon soon replaced Hooge 's supporters ( mostly from the Yellow Banners ) with his own , thus gaining closer control of two more Banners . By early June 1644 , he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military . 
 In early 1644 , just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the Ming , peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching Beijing . On 24 April of that year , rebel leader Li Zicheng breached the walls of the Ming capital , pushing the Chongzhen Emperor to hang himself on a hill behind the Forbidden City . Hearing the news , Dorgon 's Chinese advisors Hong <unk> and Fan Wencheng ( <unk> ; 1597 – 1666 ) urged the Manchu prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as <unk> of the fallen Ming and to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing . The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Ming general Wu Sangui , who was garrisoned at Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall . Himself caught between the Manchus and Li Zicheng 's forces , Wu requested Dorgon 's help in ousting the bandits and restoring the Ming . When Dorgon asked Wu to work for the Qing instead , Wu had little choice but to accept . Aided by Wu Sangui 's elite soldiers , who fought the rebel army for hours before Dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry , the Qing won a decisive victory against Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May . Li 's defeated troops looted Beijing for several days until Li left the capital on 4 June with all the wealth he could carry . 
 = = = Settling in the capital = = = 
 After six weeks of mistreatment at the hands of rebel troops , the Beijing population sent a party of elders and officials to greet their liberators on 5 June . They were startled when , instead of meeting Wu Sangui and the Ming heir apparent , they saw Dorgon , a horseriding Manchu with his shaved forehead , present himself as the Prince Regent . In the midst of this upheaval , Dorgon installed himself in the <unk> Palace ( <unk> ) , the only building that remained more or less intact after Li Zicheng had set fire to the palace complex on 3 June . Banner troops were ordered not to loot ; their discipline made the transition to Qing rule " remarkably smooth . " Yet at the same time as he claimed to have come to avenge the Ming , Dorgon ordered that all claimants to the Ming throne ( including descendants of the last Ming emperor ) should be executed along with their supporters . 
 On June 7 , just two days after entering the city , Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital , assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead , wear a queue , and surrender , the officials would be allowed to stay at their post . He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing , threatening Qing control over the capital region . 
 Dorgon greeted the Shunzhi Emperor at the gates of Beijing on 19 October 1644 . On 30 October the six @-@ year @-@ old monarch performed sacrifices to Heaven and Earth at the Altar of Heaven . The southern cadet branch of Confucius ' descendants who held the title Wujing boshi <unk> and the sixty @-@ fifth generation descendant of Confucius to hold the title Duke Yansheng in the northern branch both had their titles reconfirmed on 31 October . A formal ritual of enthronement for Fulin was held on 8 November , during which the young emperor compared Dorgon 's achievements to those of the Duke of Zhou , a revered regent from antiquity . During the ceremony , Dorgon 's official title was raised from " Prince Regent " to " Uncle Prince Regent " ( <unk> <unk> wang <unk> ) , in which the Manchu term for " Uncle " ( <unk> ) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince . Three days later Dorgon 's co @-@ regent Jirgalang was demoted from " Prince Regent " to " Assistant Uncle Prince Regent " ( Fu zheng <unk> <unk> ) . In June 1645 , Dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as " Imperial Uncle Prince Regent " ( Huang <unk> <unk> wang <unk> ) , which left him one step short of claiming the throne for himself . 
 One of Dorgon 's first orders in the new Qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of Beijing to give it to Bannermen , including Han Chinese Bannermen . The Yellow Banners were given the place of honor north of the palace , followed by the White Banners east , the Red Banners west , and the Blue Banners south . This distribution accorded with the order established in the Manchu homeland before the conquest and under which " each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass . " Despite tax remissions and large @-@ scale building programs designed to facilitate the transition , in 1648 many Chinese civilians still lived among the newly arrived Banner population and there was still animosity between the two groups . Agricultural land outside the capital was also marked off ( <unk> <unk> ) and given to Qing troops . Former landowners now became tenants who had to pay rent to their absentee Bannermen landlords . This transition in land use caused " several decades of disruption and hardship . " 
 In 1646 , Dorgon also ordered that the civil examinations for selecting government officials be reestablished . From then on they were held regularly every three years as under the Ming . In the very first palace examination held under Qing rule in 1646 , candidates , most of whom were northern Chinese , were asked how the Manchus and Han Chinese could be made to work together for a common purpose . The 1649 examination inquired about " how Manchus and Han Chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division . " Under the Shunzhi Emperor 's reign , the average number of graduates per session of the metropolitan examination was the highest of the Qing dynasty ( " to win more Chinese support " ) , until 1660 when lower quotas were established . 
 To promote ethnic harmony , in 1648 an imperial decree formulated by Dorgon allowed Han Chinese civilians to marry women from the Manchu Banners , with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners , or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners . Only later in the dynasty were these policies allowing intermarriage rescinded . 
 = = = Conquest of China = = = 
 Under the reign of Dorgon — whom historians have variously called " the mastermind of the Qing conquest " and " the principal architect of the great Manchu enterprise " — the Qing subdued almost all of China and pushed loyalist " Southern Ming " resistance into the far southwestern reaches of China . After repressing anti @-@ Qing revolts in Hebei and Shandong in the Summer and Fall of 1644 , Dorgon sent armies to root out Li Zicheng from the important city of Xi 'an ( Shaanxi province ) , where Li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing Beijing in early June 1644 . Under the pressure of Qing armies , Li was forced to leave Xi 'an in February 1645 , and he was killed — either by his own hand or by a peasant group that had organized for self @-@ defense in this time of rampant banditry — in September 1645 after fleeing though several provinces . 
 From newly captured Xi 'an , in early April 1645 the Qing mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of Jiangnan south of the lower Yangtze River , where in June 1644 a Ming imperial prince had established a regime loyal to the Ming . Factional bickering and numerous defections prevented the Southern Ming from mounting an efficient resistance . Several Qing armies swept south , taking the key city of Xuzhou north of the Huai River in early May 1645 and soon converging on Yangzhou , the main city on the Southern Ming 's northern line of defense . Bravely defended by Shi <unk> , who refused to surrender , Yangzhou fell to Manchu artillery on 20 May after a one @-@ week siege . Dorgon 's brother Prince Dodo then ordered the slaughter of Yangzhou 's entire population . As intended , this massacre terrorized other Jiangnan cities into surrendering to the Qing . Indeed , Nanjing surrendered without a fight on 16 June after its last defenders had made Dodo promise he would not hurt the population . The Qing soon captured the Ming emperor ( who died in Beijing the following year ) and seized Jiangnan 's main cities , including Suzhou and Hangzhou ; by early July 1645 , the frontier between the Qing and the Southern Ming had been pushed south to the Qiantang River . 
 On 21 July 1645 , after Jiangnan had been superficially pacified , Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid the rest of their hair into a queue identical to those of the Manchus . The punishment for non @-@ compliance was death . This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe . For Han officials and literati , however , the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning ( because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one 's body intact ) , whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility . Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule , the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest . The defiant population of <unk> and <unk> was massacred by former Ming general Li <unk> ( <unk> ; d . 1649 ) , respectively on August 24 and September 22 . Jiangyin also held out against about 10 @,@ 000 Qing troops for 83 days . When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645 , the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu <unk> ( <unk> ; d . 1667 ) massacred the entire population , killing between 74 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 people . These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze . A few committed loyalists became hermits , hoping that for lack of military success , their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule . 
 After the fall of Nanjing , two more members of the Ming imperial household created new Southern Ming regimes : one centered in coastal Fujian around the " Longwu Emperor " Zhu <unk> , Prince of Tang — a ninth @-@ generation descendant of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang — and one in Zhejiang around " Regent " Zhu <unk> , Prince of Lu . But the two loyalist groups failed to cooperate , making their chances of success even lower than they already were . In July 1646 , a new Southern Campaign led by Prince Bolo sent Prince Lu 's Zhejiang court into disarray and proceeded to attack the Longwu regime in Fujian . Zhu <unk> was caught and summarily executed in <unk> ( western Fujian ) on 6 October . His adoptive son Koxinga fled to the island of Taiwan with his fleet . Finally in November , the remaining centers of Ming resistance in Jiangxi province fell to the Qing . 
 In late 1646 two more Southern Ming monarchs emerged in the southern province of Guangzhou , reigning under the era names of Shaowu ( <unk> ) and Yongli . Short of official costumes , the Shaowu court had to purchase robes from local theater troops . The two Ming regimes fought each other until 20 January 1647 , when a small Qing force led by Li <unk> captured Guangzhou , killed the Shaowu Emperor , and sent the Yongli court fleeing to Nanning in Guangxi . In May 1648 , however , Li mutinied against the Qing , and the concurrent rebellion of another former Ming general in Jiangxi helped Yongli to retake most of south China . This resurgence of loyalist hopes was short @-@ lived . New Qing armies managed to reconquer the central provinces of Huguang ( present @-@ day Hubei and Hunan ) , Jiangxi , and Guangdong in 1649 and 1650 . The Yongli emperor had to flee again . Finally on 24 November 1650 , Qing forces led by Shang <unk> captured Guangzhou and massacred the city 's population , killing as many as 70 @,@ 000 people . 
 Meanwhile , in October 1646 , Qing armies led by Hooge ( the son of Hong Taiji who had lost the succession struggle of 1643 ) reached Sichuan , where their mission was to destroy the kingdom of bandit leader Zhang Xianzhong . Zhang was killed in a battle against Qing forces near <unk> in central Sichuan on 1 February 1647 . Also late in 1646 but further north , forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as <unk> ( <unk> ) revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou ( Gansu ) . He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong ( <unk> ) . Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the Ming , they occupied a number of towns in Gansu , including the provincial capital Lanzhou . These rebels ' willingness to collaborate with non @-@ Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion . Both <unk> and Ding Guodong were captured and killed by Meng <unk> ( <unk> ; 1595 – 1654 ) in 1648 , and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties .

 = = = Purging Dorgon 's clique = = = 
 Dorgon 's unexpected death on 31 December 1650 during a hunting trip triggered a period of fierce factional struggles and opened the way for deep political reforms . Because Dorgon 's supporters were still influential at court , Dorgon was given an imperial funeral and was posthumously elevated to imperial status as the " Righteous Emperor " ( yi huangdi <unk> ) . On the same day of mid @-@ January 1651 , however , several officers of the White Banners led by former Dorgon supporter <unk> arrested Dorgon 's brother <unk> for fear he would proclaim himself as the new regent ; <unk> and his officers then named themselves presidents of several Ministries and prepared to take charge of the government . 
 Meanwhile , Jirgalang , who had been stripped of his title of regent in 1647 , gathered support among Banner officers who had been disgruntled during Dorgon 's rule . In order to consolidate support for the emperor in the two Yellow Banners ( which had belonged to the Qing monarch since Hong Taiji ) and to gain followers in Dorgon 's Plain White Banner , Jirgalang named them the " Upper Three Banners " ( shang san qi <unk> ; Manchu : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , which from then on were owned and controlled by the emperor . Oboi and Suksaha , who would become regents for the Kangxi Emperor in 1661 , were among the Banner officers who gave Jirgalang their support , and Jirgalang appointed them to the Council of Deliberative Princes to reward them . 
 On 1 February , Jirgalang announced that the Shunzhi Emperor , who was about to turn thirteen , would now assume full imperial authority . The regency was thus officially abolished . Jirgalang then moved to the attack . In late February or early March 1651 he accused Dorgon of usurping imperial prerogatives : Dorgon was found guilty and all his posthumous honors were removed . Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon 's clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon a growing number of followers in the Three Imperial Banners , so that by 1652 all of Dorgon 's former supporters had been either killed or effectively removed from government . 
 = = = Factional politics and the fight against corruption = = = 
 On 7 April 1651 , barely two months after he seized the reins of government , the Shunzhi Emperor issued an edict announcing that he would purge corruption from officialdom . This edict triggered factional conflicts among literati that would frustrate him until his death . One of his first gestures was to dismiss grand academician Feng Quan ( <unk> ; 1595 – 1672 ) , a northern Chinese who had been impeached in 1645 but was allowed to remain in his post by Prince Regent Dorgon . The Shunzhi Emperor replaced Feng with Chen Mingxia ( <unk> ; ca . 1601 – 1654 ) , an influential southern Chinese with good connections in Jiangnan literary societies . Though later in 1651 Chen was also dismissed on charges of influence peddling , he was reinstated in his post in 1653 and soon became a close personal advisor to the sovereign . He was even allowed to draft imperial edicts just as Ming Grand Secretaries used to . Still in 1653 , the Shunzhi Emperor decided to recall the disgraced Feng Quan , but instead of balancing the influence of northern and southern Chinese officials at court as the emperor had intended , Feng Quan 's return only intensified factional strife . In several controversies at court in 1653 and 1654 , the southerners formed one bloc opposed to the northerners and the Manchus . In April 1654 , when Chen Mingxia spoke to northern official Ning <unk> ( <unk> ; d . 1665 ) about restoring the style of dress of the Ming court , Ning immediately denounced Chen to the emperor and accused him of various crimes including bribe @-@ taking , nepotism , factionalism , and usurping imperial prerogatives . Chen was executed by strangulation on 27 April 1654 . 
 In November 1657 , a major cheating scandal erupted during the <unk> provincial @-@ level examinations in Beijing . Eight candidates from Jiangnan who were also relatives of Beijing officials had bribed examiners in the hope of being ranked higher in the contest . Seven examination supervisors found guilty of receiving bribes were executed , and several hundred people were sentenced to punishments ranging from demotion to exile and confiscation of property . The scandal , which soon spread to Nanjing examination circles , uncovered the corruption and influence @-@ peddling that was rife in the bureaucracy , and that many moralistic officials from the north attributed to the existence of southern literary clubs and to the decline of classical scholarship . 
 = = = Chinese style of rule = = = 
 During his short reign , the Shunzhi Emperor encouraged Han Chinese to participate in government activities and revived many Chinese @-@ style institutions that had been either abolished or marginalized during Dorgon 's regency . He discussed history , classics , and politics with grand academicians such as Chen Mingxia ( see previous section ) and surrounded himself with new men such as Wang Xi ( <unk> ; 1628 – 1703 ) , a young northern Chinese who was fluent in Manchu . The " Six Edicts " ( Liu yu <unk> ) that the Shunzhi Emperor promulgated in 1652 were the predecessors to the Kangxi Emperor 's " Sacred Edicts " ( 1670 ) : " bare bones of Confucian orthodoxy " that instructed the population to behave in a filial and law @-@ abiding fashion . In another move toward Chinese @-@ style government , the sovereign reestablished the Hanlin Academy and the Grand Secretariat in 1658 . These two institutions based on Ming models further eroded the power of the Manchu elite and threatened to revive the extremes of literati politics that had plagued the late Ming , when factions coalesced around rival grand secretaries . 
 To counteract the power of the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility , in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices ( <unk> ) , or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus , which were supervised by Manchus , but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu <unk> . Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon 's regency , but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang . By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again : they handled key financial and political matters , offered advice on official appointments , and even composed edicts . Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy , Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming . Despite the emperor 's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities , the Shunzhi Emperor 's favorite eunuch Wu <unk> ( <unk> ; d . 1661 ) , who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s , was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658 . The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite , which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power . The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated ( and Wu <unk> executed ) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor 's death . 
 = = = Frontiers , tributaries , and foreign relations = = = 
 In 1646 , when Qing armies led by Bolo had entered the city of Fuzhou , they had found envoys from the Ryūkyū Kingdom , Annam , and the Spanish in Manila . These tributary embassies that had come to see the now fallen Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming were forwarded to Beijing , and eventually sent home with instructions about submitting to the Qing . The King of the Ryūkyū Islands sent his first tribute mission to the Qing in 1649 , Siam in 1652 , and Annam in 1661 , after the last remnants of Ming resistance had been removed from Yunnan , which bordered Annam . 
 Also in 1646 sultan Abu al @-@ Muhammad <unk> Khan , a Mughal prince who ruled Turfan , had sent an embassy requesting the resumption of trade with China , which had been interrupted by the fall of the Ming dynasty . The mission was sent without solicitation , but the Qing agreed to receive it , allowing it to conduct tribute trade in Beijing and Lanzhou ( Gansu ) . But this agreement was interrupted by a Muslim rebellion that engulfed the northwest in 1646 ( see the last paragraph of the " Conquest of China " section above ) . Tribute and trade with Hami and Turfan , which had aided the rebels , were eventually resumed in 1656 . In 1655 , however , the Qing court announced that tributary missions from Turfan would be accepted only once every five years . 
 In 1651 the young emperor invited to Beijing the Fifth Dalai Lama , the leader of the Yellow Hat Sect of Tibetan Buddhism , who , with the military help of <unk> Mongol <unk> Khan , had recently unified religious and secular rule in Tibet . Qing emperors had been patrons of Tibetan Buddhism since at least 1621 under the reign of Nurhaci , but there were also political reasons behind the invitation . Namely , Tibet was becoming a powerful polity west of the Qing , and the Dalai Lama held influence over Mongol tribes , many of which had not submitted to the Qing . To prepare for the arrival of this " living Buddha , " the Shunzhi Emperor ordered the building of the White <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) on an island on one of the imperial lakes northwest of the Forbidden City , at the former site of <unk> Khan 's palace . After more invitations and diplomatic exchanges to decide where the Tibetan leader would meet the Qing emperor , the Dalai Lama arrived in Beijing in January 1653 . The Dalai Lama later had a scene of this visit carved in the Potala Palace in Lhasa , which he had started building in 1645 . 
 Meanwhile , north of the Manchu homeland , adventurers <unk> <unk> ( 1643 – 1646 ) and <unk> Khabarov ( 1649 – 1653 ) had started to explore the Amur River valley for <unk> Russia . In 1653 Khabarov was recalled to Moscow and replaced by <unk> Stepanov , who assumed command of Khabarov 's Cossack troops . Stepanov went south into the <unk> River , along which he exacted " yasak " ( fur tribute ) from native populations such as the <unk> and the <unk> , but these groups resisted because they were already paying tribute to the Shunzhi Emperor ( " <unk> " in Russian sources ) . In 1654 Stepanov defeated a small Manchu force that had been despatched from <unk> to investigate Russian advances . In 1655 another Qing commander , the Mongol <unk> ( d . 1669 ) , defeated Stepanov 's forces at fort <unk> on the Amur , but this was not enough to chase the Russians . In 1658 , however , Manchu general <unk> ( 1599 – 1659 ) attacked Stepanov with a fleet of 40 or more ships that managed to kill or capture most Russians . This Qing victory temporarily cleared the Amur valley of Cossack bands , but Sino @-@ Russian border conflicts would continue until 1689 , when the signature of the Treaty of Nerchinsk fixed the borders between Russia and the Qing . 
 = = = Continuous campaigns against the Southern Ming = = = 
 Though the Qing under Dorgon 's leadership had successfully pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China , Ming <unk> was not dead yet . In early August 1652 , Li <unk> , who had served as general in Sichuan under bandit king Zhang Xianzhong ( d . 1647 ) and was now protecting the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming , retook Guilin ( Guangxi province ) from the Qing . Within a month , most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side . Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in Huguang and Guangdong in the next two years , Li failed to retake important cities . In 1653 , the Qing court put Hong <unk> in charge of retaking the southwest . Headquartered in Changsha ( in what is now Hunan province ) , he patiently built up his forces ; only in late 1658 did well @-@ fed and well @-@ supplied Qing troops mount a <unk> campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan . In late January 1659 , a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan , sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby Burma , which was then ruled by King <unk> Min of the <unk> dynasty . The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662 , when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui , the former Ming general whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the Qing conquest of China . 
 Zheng Chenggong ( " Koxinga " ) , who had been adopted by the Longwu Emperor in 1646 and ennobled by Yongli in 1655 , also continued to defend the cause of the Southern Ming . In 1659 , just as the Shunzhi Emperor was preparing to hold a special examination to celebrate the glories of his reign and the success of the southwestern campaigns , Zheng sailed up the Yangtze River with a well @-@ armed fleet , took several cities from Qing hands , and went so far as to threaten Nanjing . When the emperor heard of this sudden attack he is said to have slashed his throne with a sword in anger . But the siege of Nanjing was relieved and Zheng Chenggong repelled , forcing Zheng to take refuge in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian . Pressured by Qing fleets , Zheng fled to Taiwan in April 1661 but died that same summer . His descendants resisted Qing rule until 1683 , when the Kangxi Emperor successfully took the island . 
 = = = Personality and relationships = = = 
 After Fulin came to rule on his own in 1651 , his mother the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang arranged for him to marry her niece , but the young monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653 . The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan , this time matching her son with her own grand @-@ niece . Though Fulin also disliked his second empress ( known posthumously as Empress <unk> ) , he was not allowed to demote her . She never bore him children . Starting in 1656 , the Shunzhi Emperor lavished his affection on Consort <unk> , who , according to Jesuit accounts from the time , had first been the wife of another Manchu noble . She gave birth to a son ( the Shunzhi Emperor 's fourth ) in November 1657 . The emperor would have made him his heir apparent , but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name . 
 The Shunzhi Emperor was an open @-@ minded emperor and relied on the advice of Johann Adam Schall von Bell , a Jesuit missionary from Cologne in the Germanic parts of the Holy Roman Empire , for guidance on matters ranging from astronomy and technology to religion and government . In late 1644 , Dorgon had put Schall in charge of preparing a new calendar because his eclipse predictions had proven more reliable than those of the official astronomer . After Dorgon 's death Schall developed a personal relationship with the young emperor , who called him " grandfather " ( <unk> in Manchu ) . At the height of his influence in 1656 and 1657 , Schall reports that the Shunzhi Emperor often visited his house and talked to him late into the night . He was excused from prostrating himself in the presence of the emperor , was granted land to build a church in Beijing , and was even given imperial permission to adopt a son ( because Fulin worried that Schall did not have an heir ) , but the Jesuits ' hope of converting the Qing sovereign to Christianity was crushed when the Shunzhi Emperor became a devout follower of Chan Buddhism in 1657 . 
 The emperor developed a good command of Chinese that allowed him to manage matters of state and to appreciate Chinese arts such as calligraphy and drama . One of his favorite texts was " Rhapsody of a Myriad Sorrows " ( Wan chou qu <unk> ) , by Gui Zhuang ( <unk> ; 1613 – 1673 ) , who was a close friend of anti @-@ Qing intellectuals Gu <unk> and Wan <unk> ( <unk> ; 1603 – 1652 ) . " Quite passionate and attach [ ing ] great importance to qing ( love ) , " he could also recite by heart long passages of the popular Romance of the Western Chamber .

 = = = Smallpox = = = 
 In September 1660 , Consort <unk> , the Shunzhi Emperor 's favourite consort , suddenly died as a result of grief over the loss of a child . Overwhelmed with grief , the emperor fell into dejection for months , until he contracted smallpox on 2 February 1661 . On 4 February 1661 , officials Wang Xi ( <unk> , 1628 – 1703 ; the emperor 's confidant ) and Margi ( a Manchu ) were called to the emperor 's bedside to record his last will . On the same day , his seven @-@ year @-@ old third son Xuanye was chosen to be his successor , probably because he had already survived smallpox . The emperor died on 5 February 1661 in the Forbidden City at the age of twenty @-@ two . 
 The Manchus feared smallpox more than any other disease because they had no immunity to it and almost always died when they contracted it . By 1622 at the latest , they had already established an agency to investigate smallpox cases and isolate sufferers to avoid contagion . During outbreaks , royal family members were routinely sent to " smallpox avoidance centers " ( <unk> <unk> ) to protect themselves from infection . The Shunzhi Emperor was particularly fearful of the disease , because he was young and lived in a large city , near sources of contagion . Indeed , during his reign at least nine outbreaks of smallpox were recorded in Beijing , each time forcing the emperor to move to a protected area such as the " Southern Park " ( <unk> <unk> ) , a hunting ground south of Beijing where Dorgon had built a " smallpox avoidance center " in the 1640s . Despite this and other precautions — such as rules forcing Chinese residents to move out of the city when they contracted smallpox — the young monarch still succumbed to that illness . 
 = = = The emperor 's forged last will = = = 
 The emperor 's last will , which was made public on the evening of 5 February , appointed four regents for his young son : Oboi , Soni , Suksaha , and <unk> , who had all helped Jirgalang to purge the court of Dorgon 's supporters after Dorgon 's death on the last day of 1650 . It is difficult to determine whether the Shunzhi Emperor had really named these four Manchu nobles as regents , because they and Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang clearly tampered with the emperor 's testament before promulgating it . The emperor 's will expressed his regret about his Chinese @-@ style ruling ( his reliance on eunuchs and his favoritism toward Chinese officials ) , his neglect of Manchu nobles and traditions , and his headstrong devotion to his consort rather than to his mother . Though the emperor had often issued self @-@ deprecating edicts during his reign , the policies his will rejected had been central to his government since he had assumed personal rule in the early 1650s . The will as it was formulated gave " the mantle of imperial authority " to the four regents , and served to support their pro @-@ Manchu policies during the period known as the Oboi regency , which lasted from 1661 to 1669 . 
 = = = After death = = = 
 Because court statements did not clearly announce the cause of the emperor 's death , rumors soon started to circulate that he had not died but in fact retired to a Buddhist monastery to live anonymously as a monk , either out of grief for the death of his beloved consort , or because of a coup by the Manchu nobles his will had named as regents . These rumors seemed not so incredible because the emperor had become a fervent follower of Chan Buddhism in the late 1650s , even letting monks move into the imperial palace . Modern Chinese historians have considered the Shunzhi Emperor 's possible retirement as one of the three mysterious cases of the early Qing . But much circumstantial evidence — including an account by one of these monks that the emperor 's health greatly deteriorated in early February 1661 because of smallpox , and the fact that a concubine and an Imperial Bodyguard committed suicide to accompany the emperor in burial — suggests that the Shunzhi Emperor 's death was not staged . 
 After being kept in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning , on 3 March 1661 the emperor 's corpse was transported in a lavish procession to Jingshan <unk> ( a hillock just north of the Forbidden City ) , after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings . Only two years later , in 1653 , was the body transported to its final resting place . Contrary to Manchu customs at the time , which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated , the Shunzhi Emperor was buried . He was interred in what later came to be known as the Eastern Qing Tombs , 125 kilometers ( 75 miles ) northeast of Beijing , one of two Qing imperial cemeteries . His tomb is part of the Xiaoling ( <unk> ) mausoleum complex ( known in Manchu as the <unk> <unk> ) , which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site .

 The fake will in which the Shunzhi Emperor had supposedly expressed regret for abandoning Manchu traditions gave authority to the nativist policies of the Kangxi Emperor 's four regents . Citing the testament , Oboi and the other regents quickly abolished the Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus . Over the next few years , they enhanced the power of the Imperial Household Department , which was run by Manchus and their <unk> , eliminated the Hanlin Academy , and limited membership in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers to Manchus and Mongols . The regents also adopted aggressive policies toward the Qing 's Chinese subjects : they executed dozens of people and punished thousands of others in the wealthy Jiangnan region for literary dissent and tax arrears , and forced the coastal population of southeast China to move inland in order to starve the Taiwan @-@ based Kingdom of Tungning run by descendants of Koxinga . 
 After the Kangxi Emperor managed to imprison Oboi in 1669 , he reverted many of the regents ' policies . He restored institutions his father had favored , including a Grand Secretariat in which Chinese officials gained an important voice in government . He also defeated the rebellion of the Three <unk> , three Chinese military commanders who had played key military roles in the Qing conquest , but had now become entrenched rulers of enormous domains in southern China . The civil war ( 1673 – 1681 ) tested the loyalty of the new Qing subjects , but Qing armies eventually prevailed . Once victory had become certain , a special examination for " eminent scholars of broad learning " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was held in 1679 to attract Chinese literati who had refused to serve the new dynasty . The successful candidates were assigned to compile the official history of the fallen Ming dynasty . The rebellion was defeated in 1681 , the same year the Kangxi Emperor initiated the use of variolation to inoculate children of the imperial family against smallpox . When the Kingdom of Tungning finally fell in 1683 , the military consolidation of the Qing regime was complete . The institutional foundation laid by Dorgon , and the Shunzhi and Kangxi emperors allowed the Qing to erect an imperial edifice of awesome proportion and to turn it into " one of the most successful imperial states the world has known . " Ironically , however , the prolonged Pax <unk> that followed the Kangxi consolidation made the Qing <unk> unprepared to face aggressive and well @-@ armed European powers in the nineteenth century .

 = Calutron = 
 A calutron is a mass spectrometer originally designed and used for separating the isotopes of uranium . It was developed by Ernest O. Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention , the cyclotron . Its name was derived from California University Cyclotron , in tribute to Lawrence 's institution , the University of California , where it was invented . <unk> were used in the industrial @-@ scale Y @-@ 12 uranium enrichment plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . The uranium @-@ 235 produced there was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 . 
 The calutron is a type of sector mass spectrometer , an instrument in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields . The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current . Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses , the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field , causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass , striking the plate at different locations . The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions . During World War II , calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high @-@ purity uranium @-@ 235 , by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes . 
 Electromagnetic separation for uranium enrichment was abandoned in the post @-@ war period in favor of the more complicated , but more efficient , gaseous diffusion method . Although most of the calutrons of the Manhattan Project were dismantled at the end of the war , some remained in use to produce isotopically enriched samples of naturally occurring elements for military , scientific and medical purposes . 
 = = Origins = = 
 News of the discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938 , and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch , was brought to the United States by Niels Bohr . Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus , he theorized that it was the uranium @-@ 235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium @-@ 238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons . To verify this Alfred O. C. Nier at the University of Minnesota used a mass spectrometer to create a microscopic amount of enriched uranium @-@ 235 in April 1940 . John R. Dunning , Aristid von Grosse and Eugene T. Booth were then able to confirm that Bohr was correct . Leo Szilard and Walter Zinn soon confirmed that more than one neutron was released per fission , which made it almost certain that a nuclear chain reaction could be initiated , and therefore that the development of an atomic bomb was a theoretical possibility . There were fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop one first , especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries . 
 At the University of Birmingham in Britain , the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists — Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls — the task of investigating the feasibility of an atomic bomb , ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar . Their March 1940 Frisch – Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium @-@ 235 was within an order of magnitude of 10 kg , which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day . The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb . Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research , so the Tizard Mission 's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments . He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British , and not as far advanced . 
 A disappointed Oliphant flew to the United States to speak to the American scientists . These included Ernest O. Lawrence at the University of California 's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley . The two men had met before the war , and were friends . Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium . Uranium @-@ 235 makes up only about 0 @.@ 72 % of natural uranium , so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90 % uranium @-@ 235 from natural uranium . The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion , but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934 : electromagnetic separation . This was the process that Nier had used . 
 The principle of electromagnetic separation was that charged ions are deflected by a magnetic field , and lighter ones are deflected more than heavy ones . The reason the Maud Committee , and later its American counterpart , the S @-@ 1 Uranium Committee , had passed over the electromagnetic method was that while the mass spectrometer was capable of separating isotopes , it produced very low yields . The reason for this was the so @-@ called space @-@ charge limitation . Positive ions have positive charge , so they tend to repel each other , which causes the beam to scatter . Drawing on his experience with the precise control of charged @-@ particle beams from his work with his invention , the cyclotron , Lawrence suspected that the air molecules in the vacuum chamber would neutralize the ions , and create a focused beam . Oliphant inspired Lawrence to convert his old 37 @-@ inch ( 94 cm ) cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation . 
 The 37 @-@ inch cyclotron at Berkeley was dismantled on 24 November 1941 , and its magnet used to create the first calutron . Its name came from California University and cyclotron . The work was initially funded by the Radiation Laboratory from its own resources , with a $ 5 @,@ 000 grant from the Research Corporation . In December Lawrence received a $ 400 @,@ 000 grant from the S @-@ 1 Uranium Committee . The calutron consisted of an ion source , in the form of a box with a slit in it and hot filaments inside . Uranium tetrachloride was ionized by the filament , and then passed through a 0 @.@ 04 @-@ by @-@ 2 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 0 by 50 @.@ 8 mm ) slot into a vacuum chamber . The magnet is then used to deflect the ion beam by 180 ° . The enriched and depleted beams went into collectors . 
 When the calutron was first operated on 2 December 1941 , just days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II , a uranium beam intensity of 5 <unk> ( μA ) was received by the collector . Lawrence 's hunch about the effect of the air molecules in the vacuum chamber was confirmed . A nine @-@ hour run on 14 January 1942 with a 50 μA beam produced 18 micrograms ( μg ) of uranium enriched to 25 % uranium @-@ 235 , about ten times as much as Nier had produced . By February , improvements in the technique allowed it to generate a 1 @,@ 400 μA beam . That month , 75 μg samples enriched to 30 % were shipped to the British and the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago . 
 Other researchers also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation . At Princeton University , a group led by Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron . Using a klystron , they were able to separate isotopes using high @-@ voltage electricity rather than magnetism . Work continued until February 1943 , when , in view of the greater success of the calutron , work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties . At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins , and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator . They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected , and , like Lawrence , deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber . In February 1942 , their team was consolidated with Lawrence 's in Berkeley . They posted their results to the Physical Review from a railroad station en route to California . Their paper was classified secret , but was published after the war . 
 = = Research = = 
 While the process had been demonstrated to work , considerable effort was still required before a prototype could be tested in the field . Lawrence assembled a team of physicists to tackle the problems , including David Bohm , Edward Condon , Donald Cooksey , A. Theodore Forrester , Irving Langmuir , Kenneth Ross MacKenzie , Frank Oppenheimer , J. Robert Oppenheimer , William E. Parkins , Bernard Peters and Joseph <unk> . In November 1943 they were joined by a British Mission headed by Oliphant that included fellow Australian physicists Harrie Massey and Eric Burhop , and British physicists such as Joan Curran and Thomas Allibone . 
 Lawrence had a much larger cyclotron under construction at Berkeley , one with a 184 @-@ inch ( 470 cm ) magnet . This was converted into a calutron that was switched on for the first time on 26 May 1942 . Like the 37 @-@ inch version , it looked like a giant C when viewed from above . The operator sat in the open end , whence the temperature could be regulated , the position of the electrodes adjusted , and even components replaced through an airlock while it was running . The new , more powerful calutron was not used to produce enriched uranium , but for experiments with multiple ion sources . This meant having more collectors , but it multiplied the throughput . 
 The problem was that the beams interfered with each other , producing a series of oscillations called hash . An arrangement was devised that minimized the interference , resulting in reasonably good beams being produced in September 1942 . Robert Oppenheimer and Stan Frankel invented the magnetic shim , a device used to adjust the homogeneity of a magnetic field . These were sheets of iron about 3 feet ( 1 m ) in width that were bolted to the top and bottom of the vacuum tank . The effect of the shims was to slightly increase the magnetic field in such a way as to help focus the ionic beam . Work would continue on the shims through 1943 . The main calutron patents were Methods of and apparatus for separating materials ( Lawrence ) , Magnetic shims ( Oppenheimer and Frankel ) , and Calutron system ( Lawrence ) . 
 Burhop and Bohm later studied the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields , today known as Bohm diffusion . Their papers on the properties of plasmas under magnetic containment would find utilization in the post @-@ war world in research into controlled nuclear fusion . Other technical problems were more mundane but no less important . Although the beams had low intensity , they could , over many hours of operation , still melt the collectors . A water cooling system was therefore added to the collectors and the tank liner . Procedures were developed for cleaning the " gunk " and " crud " from the inside of the vacuum tank . A particular problem was blockage of the slits , which caused the ionic beams to lose focus , or stop entirely . 
 The chemists had to find a way of producing quantities of uranium tetrachloride ( UCl 
 4 ) from uranium oxide . ( Nier had used uranium bromide . ) Initially , they produced it by using hydrogen to reduce uranium trioxide ( UO 
 3 ) to uranium dioxide ( UO 
 2 ) , which was then reacted with carbon tetrachloride ( CCl 
 4 ) to produce uranium tetrachloride . Charles A. Kraus proposed a better method for large @-@ scale production that involved reacting the uranium oxide with carbon tetrachloride at high temperature and pressure . This produced uranium pentachloride ( UCl 
 5 ) and phosgene ( <unk> 
 2 ) . While nowhere near as nasty as the uranium hexafluoride used by the gaseous diffusion process , uranium tetrachloride is hygroscopic , so work with it had to be undertaken in gloveboxes that were kept dry with phosphorus pentoxide ( P 
 4O 
 10 ) . The presence of phosgene , a lethal gas , required that the chemists wore gas masks when handling it . 
 Of the $ 19 @.@ 6 million spent on research and development of the electromagnetic process , $ 18 million ( 92 percent ) was spent at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley , and further work conducted at Brown University , Johns Hopkins University and Purdue University , and by the Tennessee Eastman corporation . During 1943 , the emphasis shifted from research to development , engineering , and the training of workers to operate the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . By the middle of 1944 , there were nearly 1 @,@ 200 people working at the Radiation Laboratory .

 Much of the great progress on the electromagnetic process can be attributed to Lawrence 's leadership style . His audacity , optimism and enthusiasm were contagious . His staff put in long hours , and University of California administrators sliced through red tape despite not knowing what the project was about . Government officials began to view the development of atomic bombs in time to affect the outcome of the war as a genuine possibility . Vannevar Bush , the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) , which was overseeing the project , visited Berkeley in February 1942 , and found the atmosphere there " stimulating " and " refreshing " . On 9 March 1942 , he reported to the President , Franklin D. Roosevelt , that it might be possible to produce enough material for a bomb by mid @-@ 1943 , based on new estimates from Robert Oppenheimer that the critical mass of a sphere of pure uranium @-@ 235 was between 2 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 5 kilograms . 
 The experiments with the 184 @-@ inch magnet led to the construction of a prototype calutron called the XA . This contained a rectangular , three @-@ coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side by side , with four vacuum tanks , each with a double source . At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S @-@ 1 Executive Committee , which had superseded the S @-@ 1 Uranium Committee on 19 June , there was a proposal to build the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge , where the other Manhattan Project facilities would be located , for reasons of economy and security . Lawrence lodged an objection due to his desire to have the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to Berkeley . The Shasta Dam area in California remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September 1942 , by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection . The 25 June meeting also designated Stone & Webster as the primary contractor for the design and engineering . 
 The Army assumed responsibility for the Manhattan Project on 17 September 1942 , with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , as director , although the Army did not formally take over the contracts with the University of California from the OSRD until 1 May 1943 . Major Thomas T. Crenshaw , Jr . , became California Area Engineer in August 1942 , with Captain Harold A. Fidler , who soon replaced him , as his assistant . Crenshaw established his office in the Donner Laboratory at the University of California . In September 1942 , the S @-@ 1 Executive Committee recommended that a five @-@ tank pilot plant be built along with a 200 @-@ tank section of a production plant . 
 Between October 1942 and November 1943 , Groves paid monthly visits to the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley . Reports indicated that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium @-@ producing nuclear reactor , an electromagnetic plant would take longer and require more scarce materials to build , and need more manpower and more electricity to operate . The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater . On the other hand , while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles , the electromagnetic process was proven to work , and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material . Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November , in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant . 
 The Radiation Laboratory forwarded the preliminary designs for a production plant to Stone & Webster before the end of the year , but one important issue remained unsettled . Oppenheimer contended that weapons @-@ grade uranium would have to be nearly pure uranium @-@ 235 . Edward Lofgren and Martin Kamen argued that a second stage of enrichment would be required . The two stages became known as Alpha and Beta . In March 1943 , Groves approved the construction of five Alpha and two Beta racetracks . In September , he authorized four more Alpha racetracks , which became known as Alpha II , along with two more Beta racetracks to process their product . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Construction of the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge , codenamed Y @-@ 12 , commenced 18 February 1943 . The facility would eventually comprise nine major process buildings and 200 other structures covering almost 80 acres ( 32 ha ) of floor space . The 825 @-@ acre ( 334 ha ) site in Bear Creek Valley southwest of the Oak Ridge township was selected in the hope that the surrounding ridge lines might contain a major explosion or nuclear accident . Problems with the substratum required the excavation crews to perform more blasting and excavation to provide adequate foundations for the heavy machinery in the facilities . 
 Supplies and materials of all kinds poured in : 2 @,@ 157 carloads of electrical equipment , 1 @,@ 219 of heavy equipment , 5 @,@ 389 of lumber , 1 @,@ 407 of pipe and fittings , 1 @,@ 188 of steel , 257 of valves , and 11 of welding electrodes . The racetracks required some 85 @,@ 000 vacuum tubes , the entire national output for 1943 , including that of a plant that was still under construction . Where possible , off @-@ the @-@ shelf components were used , but all too many components of the calutrons were unique . Two purchasing departments were established , one in Boston near Stone & Webster for facility equipment , and the other at Oak Ridge for construction supplies . 
 The Chief Engineer of the Manhattan District , Colonel James C. Marshall , and his deputy , Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols , discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require 5 @,@ 000 short tons ( 4 @,@ 500 tonnes ) of copper , which was in desperately short supply . However , they realized that silver could be substituted , in an 11 : 10 ratio . On 3 August 1942 , Nichols met with the Under Secretary of the Treasury , Daniel W. Bell , and asked for the transfer of silver bullion from the West Point Bullion Depository . Nichols later recalled the conversation : 
 He explained the procedure for transferring the silver and asked , " How much do you need ? " I replied , " Six thousand tons . " ' How many troy ounces is that ? " he asked . In fact I did not know how to convert tons to troy ounces , and neither did he . A little impatient , I responded , " I don 't know how many troy ounces we need but I know I need six thousand tons – that is a definite quantity . What difference does it make how we express the quantity ? " He replied rather indignantly , " Young man , you may think of silver in tons , but the Treasury will always think of silver in troy ounces . " 
 Eventually , 14 @,@ 700 short tons ( 13 @,@ 300 tonnes ; 430 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 troy ounces ) of silver were used , then worth over $ 1 billion . Nichols had to provide a monthly accounting to the Treasury . The 1 @,@ 000 @-@ troy @-@ ounce ( 31 kg ) silver bars were taken under guard to the Defense Plant Corporation in Carteret , New Jersey , where they were cast into cylindrical billets , and then to Phelps Dodge in Bayway , New Jersey , where they were extruded into strips 0 @.@ 625 inches ( 15 @.@ 9 mm ) thick , 3 inches ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) wide and 40 feet ( 12 m ) long . Some 258 carloads were shipped under guard by rail to Allis @-@ Chalmers in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , where they were wound onto magnetic coils and sealed into welded casings . Finally , they moved by unguarded flatcars to the Clinton Engineer Works . There , special procedures were instituted for handling the silver . When they had to drill holes in it , they did so over paper so that the filings could be collected . After the war , all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver . In the end , only 1 / 3,600,000th was lost . In May 1970 , the last 67 short tons ( 61 tonnes ; 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 troy ounces ) of silver was replaced with copper and returned to the Treasury . 
 The XAX racetrack with two tanks and three coils was ready to train workers in August 1943 . Bugs were discovered , but were not aggressively followed up . The first Alpha process building , 9201 @-@ 1 , was completed on 1 November 1943 . When the first racetrack was started up for testing on schedule in November , the 14 @-@ ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment by as much as 3 inches ( 8 cm ) because of the power of the magnets and had to be fastened more securely . A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out . In December Groves ordered a magnet broken open , and handfuls of rust were found inside . Moisture was also a problem in its own right , as was the winding of the wire , which was too tight . Groves ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned and rewound . Rigid standards for preparation and cleanliness were instituted to prevent a recurrence of these problems . 
 Training for the Beta tracks shifted from the XAX to the XBX training and development racetrack in November 1943 . A second Alpha I racetrack became operational in January 1944 . The first Beta racetrack and the third and first Alpha racetracks , now repaired , became operational in March 1944 , and the fourth Alpha racetrack in April 1944 . A third building , 9201 @-@ 3 , contained a fifth racetrack that incorporated some modifications , and was known as Alpha I1 ⁄ 2 . This became operational on 3 June 1944 . Work on the Alpha and Beta chemistry buildings , <unk> and 9203 , commenced in February 1943 , and was completed in September . Work on the Beta process building , 9204 @-@ 1 , began in May 1943 , and was ready for operation on 13 March 1944 , but was not completed until September 1944 . 
 Groves authorized Alpha II in September 1943 . This consisted of two new Alpha process buildings , 9201 @-@ 4 and 9201 @-@ 5 , another Beta , 9204 @-@ 2 , an extension to the Alpha chemistry building , and a new Beta chemistry building , 9206 . When 9206 opened , the old Beta chemistry building , 9203 , was converted into a laboratory . Work started on the new Alpha II process buildings on 2 November 1943 ; the first racetrack was completed in July 1944 , and all four were operational by 1 October 1944 . The Alpha II racetracks were configured in a linear layout rather than an oval , although they were still called racetracks . In all , there were 864 Alpha calutrons , arranged in nine racetracks of 96 . There were only 36 calutrons in each Beta racetrack , for a total of 288 calutrons , although only 216 of them were ever operated . 
 Work on the new Beta process building commenced on 20 October 1943 . Equipment installation began on 1 April 1944 , and it was ready for use on 10 September 1944 . A third Beta process building , 9204 @-@ 3 , was authorized in May 1944 to process the output of the K @-@ 25 gaseous diffusion plant . It was completed on 15 May 1945 . A fourth Beta process building , 9204 @-@ 4 , was authorized on 2 April 1945 and was completed by 1 December 1945 . A new group of Alpha chemistry buildings known as the <unk> group was commenced in June 1944 , but work was halted in June 1945 before they were completed . Along with these main buildings , there were offices , workshops , warehouses and other structures . There were two steam plants for heating , and a power plant for electricity .

 The Alpha racetracks were a 24 @-@ fold magnification of the XA calutron that could hold 96 calutron Alpha tanks . The calutrons were upright and arrayed facing each other in pairs of inner and outer machines . To minimize magnetic losses , and to economize on steel consumption , the assembly was curved into an oval shape that formed a closed magnetic loop 122 feet ( 37 m ) long , 77 feet ( 23 m ) wide and 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high , in the shape of a racetrack ; hence the name . The two Alpha I buildings , 9201 @-@ 1 and 9201 @-@ 2 , each contained two racetracks , with only one in the Alpha I1 ⁄ 2 , 9201 @-@ 3 . The Beta racetracks were smaller , linear in shape , and optimized for recovery rather than production , with only 36 instead of 96 process bins . The four Alpha II racetracks were also linear in configuration . They incorporated many improvements , the most important being that they had four sources instead of just two . They also had improved magnets and vacuum systems . 
 Tennessee Eastman was hired to manage Y @-@ 12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis , with a fee of $ 22 @,@ 500 per month plus $ 7 @,@ 500 per racetrack for the first seven racetracks and $ 4 @,@ 000 per additional racetrack . Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area . The typical recruit was a young woman , a recent graduate of a local high school . Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee . Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943 , where it was conducted on the XA calutron and a 1 : 16 scale model of the Alpha racetrack , and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX calutron became available . Some 2 @,@ 500 would be required once all the Alpha II calutrons were available . The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y @-@ 12 ballooned from 10 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 1944 to 25 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 1945 . For security reasons , the trainees were not informed of the purpose of the equipment they were taught to operate . 
 The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate . Then the Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education took over . Nichols compared unit production data , and pointed out to Lawrence that the young " hillbilly " girl operators were outproducing his <unk> They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost , a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors . The girls were trained like soldiers not to reason why , while " the scientists could not refrain from time @-@ consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials " . 
 For a while , the calutrons suffered from a series of debilitating breakdowns and equipment failures , exacerbated by a shortage of spare parts . Hopes that the Alpha II racetracks would be more reliable soon faded , as they were plagued by insulator failures . These problems were gradually overcome . The first shipments of enriched uranium to the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory were made in March 1944 , consisting of Alpha product enriched to 13 to 15 percent uranium @-@ 235 . While of no use in a bomb , it was urgently required for experiments with enriched uranium . The last shipment of Alpha product was on made 11 May 1944 . On 7 June 1944 , Y @-@ 12 made its first delivery of weapons @-@ grade Beta product , enriched to as high as 89 % uranium @-@ 235 . 
 A major problem was that of loss of feed material and product . Only 1 part in 5 @,@ 825 of the feed material became finished product . About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks . This problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons . Extraordinary efforts were made to recover product , including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them . Despite everything , some 17 @.@ 4 percent of Alpha product and 5 @.@ 4 percent of Beta product was lost . Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project 's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods . The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process . 
 In February 1945 , slightly enriched 1 @.@ 4 percent uranium @-@ 235 feed material began arriving from the S @-@ 50 liquid thermal diffusion plant . Shipments of product from S @-@ 50 were discontinued in April . S @-@ 50 product was fed into K @-@ 25 instead . In March 1945 , Y @-@ 12 began receiving feed enriched to 5 percent from K @-@ 25 . The output of these plants was in the form of uranium hexafluoride ( UF 
 6 ) . This was converted to uranium trioxide , which then went into the usual process for conversion to uranium tetrachloride . On 5 August 1945 , K @-@ 25 started producing feed enriched to 23 percent , enough to be fed straight into the Beta racetracks . The remaining Alpha product was then fed into K @-@ 25 . By September 1945 , the calutrons had produced 88 kilograms of product with an average enrichment of 84 @.@ 5 percent , and the Beta racetracks turned out another 953 kilograms enriched to 95 percent by the end of the year . Enriched uranium from the calutrons provided the fissile component of the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945 . 
 With the war over , the Alpha tracks began to suspend operations on 4 September 1945 , and ceased operation completely on 22 September . The last two Beta tracks went into full operation in November and December 1945 , processing feed from K @-@ 25 and the new K @-@ 27 gaseous diffusion plant . By May 1946 , studies suggested that the gaseous diffusion plants could fully enrich the uranium by themselves without accidentally creating a critical mass . After a trial demonstrated that this was the case , Groves ordered all but one Beta track shut down in December 1946 . 
 The total cost of the electromagnetic project up to the end of the Manhattan Project on 31 December 1946 was $ 673 million ( equivalent to $ 8 @.@ 16 billion in 2015 ) .

 The workforce at Y @-@ 12 dropped from a wartime peak of 22 @,@ 482 on 21 August 1945 to less than 1 @,@ 700 in 1949 . All the calutrons were removed and dismantled , except for the XAX and XBX training tracks in Building 9731 , and the Beta 3 racetracks in Building 9204 – 3 . In 1947 , Eugene Wigner , the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) , asked the Atomic Energy Commission for permission to use the Beta calutrons to produce isotopes for physics experiments . This was granted , and a wide range of isotopes was produced . Lithium @-@ 6 from the Beta calutrons was used for research into thermonuclear weapons . Many other isotopes were used for peaceful scientific and medical purposes . The Beta 3 racetracks were transferred to the ORNL in March 1950 . By the mid @-@ 1950s , the Beta calutrons had produced quantities of all the naturally occurring stable isotopes except those of Osmium , which had to wait until April 1960 . The calutrons continued to produce isotopes until 1998 . As of 2015 , they are still on standby . 
 Like the United States , the Soviet Union ( USSR ) carried out research on multiple enrichment technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project . A trial electromagnetic process was carried out in 1946 with a calutron using a magnet taken from Germany . A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk @-@ 45 in 1946 . The pilot plant , known as Plant 418 , was completed in 1948 . A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225 ° instead of 180 ° as in the American calutron . It was used to complete the uranium process after technical difficulties were encountered with the gaseous diffusion process . Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium @-@ 235 was brought to Sverdlovsk @-@ 45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent . After the problems with the gaseous diffusion process were resolved in 1950 , it was decided not to proceed with a full @-@ scale electromagnetic plant . As of 2009 , it remains operational . In 1969 , a research calutron known as S @-@ 2 was built at <unk> @-@ 16 for high @-@ efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium . 
 In 1945 , the British atomic bomb project built a 180 ° calutron , similar in design to an American Beta calutron , at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell , Oxfordshire . Owing to the success of the gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst , electromagnetic separation was not pursued by the United Kingdom , and the calutron was used to separate isotopes for research . The 180 ° design was not ideal for this purpose , so Harwell built a 90 ° calutron , <unk> , the " Heavy Elements and Radioactive Material Electromagnetic Separator " . This was inspired by France 's <unk> and PARIS separators at the Laboratoire René Bernas of the University of Paris IX in Orsay , and <unk> at the military research laboratory of the Commissariat à l <unk> <unk> et aux <unk> alternatives in Bruyères @-@ le @-@ Châtel . Israel , Japan and France also built some research calutrons , including the <unk> and <unk> separators at the <unk> Nuclear Research Center . There is also CERN 's Isotope Separator On @-@ Line Detector ( <unk> ) , which was built in 1967 . Four research and production calutrons were built at the China Institute of Atomic Energy in Beijing of identical design to those of the USSR in the early 1960s . A calutron at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics at Bidhan Nagar in India was used to produce plutonium for India 's first nuclear test on 18 May 1974 . 
 After the 1990 – 91 Gulf War , <unk> determined that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium . Iraq chose to develop the electromagnetic process over more modern , economic , and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build , with fewer technical challenges , and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls . At the time the program was discovered , Iraq was estimated to be two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons . The program was destroyed in the Gulf War . Consequently , the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear @-@ related dual @-@ use equipment , material and technology . 
 = Jessica Dubroff = 
 Jessica Whitney Dubroff ( May 5 , 1988 – April 11 , 1996 ) was a seven @-@ year @-@ old girl who was killed attempting to become the youngest person to fly a light utility aircraft across the United States . On day two of her quest , her Cessna <unk> Cardinal single engine propeller aircraft , flown by her flight instructor , crashed during a rainstorm immediately after takeoff from Cheyenne Regional Airport in Cheyenne , Wyoming , killing Dubroff , her 57 @-@ year @-@ old father , and her flight instructor . 
 Although billed by the media as a " pilot , " Dubroff did not possess a medical certificate or a student pilot certificate , since they require a minimum age of 16 , or a pilot certificate which requires a minimum age of 17 , according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) regulations . There was also no record @-@ keeping body at the time of her trip recognizing any feats by under @-@ age pilots . Nevertheless , local , national , and international news media picked up and publicized her story , and closely followed her " record attempt " until its abrupt ending . 
 The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) investigated the crash and concluded it was caused by the flight instructor 's improper decision to take off in poor weather conditions , his overloading the aircraft , and his failure to maintain airspeed , which resulted in a stall . The NTSB also determined that " contributing to the [ instructor 's ] decision to take off was a desire to adhere to an overly ambitious itinerary , in part , because of media commitments . " 
 = = " Sea to Shining Sea " flight = = 
 Dubroff was born in Hercules , California to common @-@ law couple Lisa Blair Hathaway and Lloyd Dubroff . Her parents split and her father married another woman , taking then four @-@ year @-@ old Dubroff with him to live in the San Francisco Bay Area . 
 She began taking flight lessons from flight instructor Joe Reid on her sixth birthday , and became enthusiastic about flying . Her father suggested the idea of a coast @-@ to @-@ coast flight , which Jessica readily accepted , and Reid agreed to provide flight instruction and his aircraft for the endeavor . They decided to name their flight " Sea to Shining Sea " ; Lloyd ordered custom @-@ made caps and T @-@ shirts with that logo to distribute as souvenirs during their stops . 
 Although she had received over 33 hours of flight training , seven @-@ year @-@ old Jessica did not hold an FAA medical certificate , nor any pilot or student certificate . In the U.S. , a person must be at least 16 years of age to be eligible for a student pilot certificate , and 17 for a pilot certificate . Since Dubroff was not certified to fly the plane , a rated pilot ( normally her flight instructor Reid ) had to be at the controls during all flight operations . While the coast @-@ to @-@ coast flight was promoted as a " record " attempt because of Dubroff 's young age , there was no known body recognizing record flights by under @-@ age " pilots " at the time of her flight ( The Guinness Book of Records had officially discontinued its " youngest pilot " categories seven years earlier , because of the risk of accidents ) . 
 The flight would be made in Reid 's Cessna <unk> Cardinal , a four @-@ seat single @-@ engine propeller aircraft manufactured in 1975 , registered <unk> , which like most aircraft had dual flight controls in the front . Jessica would sit in the front left seat , Reid in the front right , and Lloyd in the back . It was agreed that Reid would be paid for his services at normal flight instruction rates , plus compensation for the layover time . Reid reportedly told his wife that he considered the flight a " non @-@ event for aviation , " simply " flying cross country with a 7 @-@ year @-@ old sitting next to you and the parents paying for it . " 
 Nevertheless , Jessica became an instant media celebrity . ABC News gave Lloyd a video camera and blank cassettes to tape the flight ; once the journey began , it was vigorously followed by supporters , media outlets , and others who monitored its progress , reporting each time Dubroff landed or took off . 
 Dubroff slept during one of the flight segments en route to Cheyenne , and was assisted by Reid in one of the landings due to high winds . 
 = = Final flight segment = = 
 Dubroff , her father , and her flight instructor arrived in Cheyenne the evening before the accident , after a long day of flying from their Half Moon Bay , California departure point . They were welcomed in Cheyenne by Mayor Leo Pando . After some media interviews they got a ride to their hotel in the car of a local radio station program director , who recalled them discussing the forecast weather conditions for the next day . 
 The weather in the morning of the accident flight , as forecast , consisted of an area of heavy precipitation over and to the north and west of Cheyenne , with better conditions to the east , where the flight was headed . As the group were about to board their aircraft , the program director who had taken them to their hotel the previous evening interviewed Dubroff by telephone . Since it began to rain at the airport and the weather seemed to be deteriorating , the director invited her to stay in Cheyenne , but Dubroff 's father declined , explaining that they wanted to " beat the storm " which was approaching . 
 After a telephone discussion with a Casper weather briefer , Reid decided to take off despite the worsening conditions at the airport , and to try to escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward . Although he was instrument rated , Reid was not instrument current and could not legally operate under instrument flight rules . He decided to file a visual flight rules ( VFR ) flight plan , and depart under VFR , to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport . 
 As the aircraft began taxiing to the departure runway , it was raining and visibility at the airport fell below the three mile minimum required for VFR flight . Cheyenne 's control tower advised the Cessna about the reduced visibility and that the " field is IFR . " Reid then requested and received from the control tower a special VFR clearance to allow him to exit the airport 's control zone visually , despite the reduced visibility . 
 = = Crash = = 
 At 8 : 24 a.m. MST , Reid 's aircraft began its takeoff from Cheyenne 's runway 30 to the northwest , in rain , strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence . According to witnesses , the plane lifted off and climbed slowly , with its nose high and its wings wobbling . It began a gradual right turn , and after reaching an altitude of a few hundred feet , the plane rolled out of its turn , then descended rapidly , crashing at a near @-@ vertical angle into <unk> Court , a street in a residential neighborhood . Dubroff , her father , and Reid were all killed by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces . Reid , who was legally the pilot in command for all of Dubroff 's flights , was apparently manipulating the controls during this particular flight segment . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the accident , and published a detailed final report on March 11 , 1997 . From the official point of view , the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid , who was the only one on board rated to fly the aircraft . The investigation focused on his decision @-@ making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne . 
 Several experienced pilots who were at the airport at the time of the accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight , as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field . In addition , investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96 lbs , which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent . Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain , the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased the stall speed by about 1 @.@ 5 percent . 
 Like most flight instructors giving dual instruction , Reid was seated on the right side , while the aircraft 's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left , in front of Dubroff in this case . Investigators speculated that because of the heavy rain in his immediate climb path , Reid 's forward visibility became greatly restricted . So to maintain control through the climbing right turn , he would have had to turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments ( most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators ) and to the right to see the ground through the side window . Such side @-@ to @-@ side head motion , combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin , could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control . 
 = = = Probable cause = = = 
 The NTSB concluded that the probable cause of the accident was Reid 's " improper decision to take off into deteriorating weather conditions ( including turbulence , gusty winds , and an advancing thunderstorm and associated precipitation ) when the airplane was overweight and when the density altitude was higher than he was accustomed to , resulting in a stall caused by failure to maintain airspeed . " The NTSB further determined that " contributing to the pilot in command ’ s decision to take off was a desire to adhere to an overly ambitious itinerary , in part , because of media commitments . "

 = = = Child Pilot Safety Act = = = 
 The accident and its associated publicity led to federal legislation to prevent similar " record " attempts by under @-@ age pilots from taking place in the future . The legislation passed the House on September 11 , 1996 , and the Senate on September 18 , 1996 . On September 27 , 1996 , differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill were resolved . On October 9 , 1996 , President Bill Clinton signed the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 , including the Child Pilot Safety Act , into law . The statute prohibits anyone who does not hold at least a private pilot certificate and a current medical certificate from manipulating the controls of an aircraft , if that individual " is attempting to set a record or engage in an aeronautical competition or aeronautical feat . " 
 Since a medical certificate and a private pilot 's license have a minimum age requirement of 16 and 17 respectively , the new rule prohibits " child pilots " such as Jessica Dubroff and Vicki Van Meter from manipulating the flight controls if they are pursuing a record , and the pilot in command 's pilot certificate may be revoked for allowing such activity . 
 = = = Media responsibility = = = 
 After the crash , there were claims that the media frenzy around the " bogus " record attempt contributed to the accident by helping promote the flight and pressuring its schedule . This was supported by the NTSB , which determined that the pressure induced by the intense media attention was a " contributing factor " in the accident . ABC 's Ted Koppel reflected on the media 's role in the tragedy on Nightline : " We need to begin by acknowledging our own contribution ... We feed one another : those of you looking for publicity and those of us looking for stories . " Koppel ended by asking " whether we in the media ... by our ravenous attention contribute to this phenomenon , " and answered : " We did . " 
 Time featured Jessica 's portrait on its front cover , in which she is seen wearing a gray cap with the inscription , Women Fly . The headline reads , " Who Killed Jessica ? " The child pilot was also featured on the cover of People .

 Lloyd Dubroff , Jessica 's father , was Lisa Blair Hathaway 's common @-@ law husband when Jessica and her brother were born . In 1990 he separated from Hathaway , and in 1991 he married then 19 @-@ year @-@ old Melinda Anne Hurst , with whom he had a child in 1992 . In December 1992 , Hathaway gave birth to Jessica 's full sister , Jasmine , conceived while she lived for a time with Lloyd and Melinda in California . 
 Before his death in the crash , Lloyd Dubroff bought four separate life insurance policies , each for US $ 750 @,@ 000 . Two of the policies named Hathaway as beneficiary and two named Melinda Dubroff , so that each was to receive $ 1 @.@ 5 million in the event of his death , ensuring adequate child support for his underage children living with the two women .

 = Philip Larkin = 
 Philip Arthur Larkin CH CBE FRSL ( 9 August 1922 – 2 December 1985 ) was an English poet , novelist and librarian . His first book of poetry , The North Ship , was published in 1945 , followed by two novels , Jill ( 1946 ) and A Girl in Winter ( 1947 ) , and he came to prominence in 1955 with the publication of his second collection of poems , The Less Deceived , followed by The Whitsun Weddings ( 1964 ) and High Windows ( 1974 ) . He contributed to The Daily Telegraph as its jazz critic from 1961 to 1971 , articles gathered in All What Jazz : A Record Diary 1961 – 71 ( 1985 ) , and he edited The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse ( 1973 ) . His many honours include the Queen 's Gold Medal for Poetry . He was offered , but declined , the position of Poet Laureate in 1984 , following the death of Sir John Betjeman . 
 After graduating from Oxford in 1943 with a first in English language and literature , Larkin became a librarian . It was during the thirty years he worked with distinction as university librarian at the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull that he produced the greater part of his published work . His poems are marked by what Andrew Motion calls a very English , glum accuracy about emotions , places , and relationships , and what Donald Davie described as lowered sights and diminished expectations . Eric Homberger ( echoing Randall Jarrell ) called him " the saddest heart in the post @-@ war supermarket " — Larkin himself said that deprivation for him was what daffodils were for Wordsworth . Influenced by W. H. Auden , W. B. Yeats , and Thomas Hardy , his poems are highly structured but flexible verse forms . They were described by Jean Hartley , the ex @-@ wife of Larkin 's publisher George Hartley ( the Marvell Press ) , as a " piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent " , though anthologist Keith Tuma writes that there is more to Larkin 's work than its reputation for dour pessimism suggests . 
 Larkin 's public persona was that of the no @-@ nonsense , solitary Englishman who disliked fame and had no patience for the trappings of the public literary life . The posthumous publication by Anthony Thwaite in 1992 of his letters triggered controversy about his personal life and political views , described by John Banville as hair @-@ raising , but also in places hilarious . Lisa Jardine called him a " casual , habitual racist , and an easy misogynist " , but the academic John Osborne argued in 2008 that " the worst that anyone has discovered about Larkin are some crass letters and a taste for porn softer than what passes for mainstream entertainment " . Despite the controversy Larkin was chosen in a 2003 Poetry Book Society survey , almost two decades after his death , as Britain 's best @-@ loved poet of the previous 50 years , and in 2008 The Times named him Britain 's greatest post @-@ war writer . 
 In 1973 a Coventry Evening Telegraph reviewer referred to Larkin as " the bard of Coventry " , but in 2010 , 25 years after his death , it was Larkin 's adopted home city , Kingston upon Hull , that commemorated him with the Larkin 25 Festival which culminated in the unveiling of a statue of Larkin by Martin Jennings on 2 December 2010 , the 25th anniversary of his death .

 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 Philip Larkin was born on 9 August 1922 at 2 , Poultney Road , Radford , Coventry , the only son and younger child of Sydney Larkin ( 1884 – 1948 ) , who came from Lichfield , and his wife , Eva Emily Day ( 1886 – 1977 ) of Epping . The family lived in the district of Radford , Coventry , until Larkin was five years old , before moving to a large three @-@ storey middle @-@ class house complete with servants quarters near Coventry railway station and King Henry VIII School , in Manor Road . Having survived the bombings of the Second World War their former house in Manor Road was demolished in the 1960s to make way for a road modernisation programme , the construction of an inner ring road . His sister Catherine , known as Kitty , was 10 years older than he was . His father , a self @-@ made man who had risen to be Coventry City Treasurer , was a singular individual , ' <unk> disillusioned in middle age ' , who combined a love of literature with an enthusiasm for Nazism , and had attended two Nuremberg rallies during the mid- ' 30s . He introduced his son to the works of Ezra Pound , T. S. Eliot , James Joyce and above all D. H. Lawrence . His mother was a nervous and passive woman , " a kind of defective mechanism ... Her ideal is ' to collapse ' and to be taken care of " , dominated by her husband . 
 Larkin 's early childhood was in some respects unusual : he was educated at home until the age of eight by his mother and sister , neither friends nor relatives ever visited the family home , and he developed a stammer . Nonetheless , when he joined Coventry 's King Henry VIII Junior School he fitted in immediately and made close , long @-@ standing friendships , such as those with James " Jim " Sutton , Colin Gunner and Noel " Josh " Hughes . Although home life was relatively cold , Larkin enjoyed support from his parents . For example , his deep passion for jazz was supported by the purchase of a drum kit and a saxophone , supplemented by a subscription to Down Beat . From the junior school he progressed to King Henry VIII Senior School . He fared quite poorly when he sat his School Certificate exam at the age of 16 . Despite his results , he was allowed to stay on at school ; two years later he earned distinctions in English and History , and passed the entrance exams for St John 's College , Oxford , to read English . 
 Larkin began at Oxford University in October 1940 , a year after the outbreak of Second World War . The old upper class traditions of university life had , at least for the time being , faded , and most of the male students were studying for highly truncated degrees . Due to his poor eyesight , Larkin failed his military medical examination and was able to study for the usual three years . Through his tutorial partner , Norman Iles , he met Kingsley Amis , who encouraged his taste for ridicule and irreverence and who remained a close friend throughout Larkin 's life . Amis , Larkin and other university friends formed a group they dubbed " The Seven " , meeting to discuss each other 's poetry , listen to jazz , and drink enthusiastically . During this time he had his first real social interaction with the opposite sex , but made no romantic headway . In 1943 he sat his finals , and , having dedicated much of his time to his own writing , was greatly surprised at being awarded a first @-@ class honours degree . 
 = = = Early career and relationships = = = 
 In 1943 Larkin was appointed librarian of the public library in Wellington , Shropshire . It was while working there that in early 1944 he met his first girlfriend , Ruth Bowman , an academically ambitious 16 @-@ year @-@ old schoolgirl . In 1945 , Ruth went to continue her studies at King 's College London ; during one of his visits their friendship developed into a sexual relationship . By June 1946 , Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the Library Association and was appointed assistant librarian at University College , Leicester . It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university 's Senior Common Room that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write Lucky Jim ( 1954 ) , the novel that made Amis famous and to whose long gestation Larkin contributed considerably . Six weeks after his father 's death from cancer in March 1948 , Larkin proposed to Ruth , and that summer the couple spent their annual holiday touring Hardy country . 
 In June 1950 Larkin was appointed sub @-@ librarian at The Queen 's University of Belfast , a post he took up that September . Before his departure he and Ruth split up . At some stage between the appointment to the position at Queen 's and the end of the engagement to Ruth , Larkin 's friendship with Monica Jones , a lecturer in English at Leicester , also developed into a sexual relationship . He spent five years in Belfast , which appear to have been the most contented of his life . While his relationship with Jones developed , he also had " the most satisfyingly erotic [ affair ] of his life " with Patsy Strang , who at the time was in an open marriage with one of his colleagues . At one stage she offered to leave her husband to marry Larkin . From 1951 onwards Larkin holidayed with Jones in various locations around the British Isles . While in Belfast he also had a significant though sexually undeveloped friendship with Winifred Arnott , the subject of " Lines on a Young Lady 's Photograph Album " , which came to an end when she married in 1954 . This was the period in which he gave Kingsley Amis extensive advice on the writing of Lucky Jim . Amis repaid the debt by dedicating the finished book to Larkin . 
 In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull , a post he held until his death . Professor R.L. Brett who was chairman of the library committee who appointed him and friend until Larkin 's death wrote " At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office , arriving early and leaving late . It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library . Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again . " For his first year he lodged in bedsits . In 1956 , at the age of 34 , he rented a self @-@ contained flat on the top @-@ floor of 32 Pearson Park , a three @-@ storey red @-@ brick house overlooking the park , previously the American Consulate . This , it seems , was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows . Of the city itself Larkin commented : " I never thought about Hull until I was here . Having got here , it suits me in many ways . It is a little on the edge of things , I think even its natives would say that . I rather like being on the edge of things . One doesn 't really go anywhere by design , you know , you put in for jobs and move about , you know , I 've lived in other places . " In the post @-@ war years , Hull University underwent significant expansion , as was typical of British universities during that period . When Larkin took up his appointment there , the plans for a new university library were already far advanced . He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee ; he suggested a number of emendations , some major and structural , all of which were adopted . It was built in two stages , and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after the university 's vice @-@ chancellor . 
 One of Larkin 's colleagues at Hull said he became a great figure in post @-@ war British librarianship . Ten years after the new library 's completion , Larkin computerized records for the entire library stock , making it the first library in Europe to install a <unk> system , an automated online circulation system . Richard Goodman wrote that Larkin excelled as an administrator , committee man and arbitrator . " He treated his staff decently , and he motivated them " , Goodman said . " He did this with a combination of efficiency , high standards , humour and compassion . " From 1957 until his death , Larkin 's secretary was Betty Mackereth . All access to him by his colleagues was through her , and she came to know as much about Larkin 's compartmentalized life as anyone . During his 30 years there , the library 's stock <unk> , and the budget expanded from £ 4 @,@ 500 to £ 448 @,@ 500 , in real terms a twelvefold increase . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 In February 1961 Larkin 's friendship with his colleague Maeve Brennan became romantic , despite her strong Roman Catholic beliefs . In early 1963 Brennan persuaded him to go with her to a dance for university staff , despite his preference for smaller gatherings . This seems to have been a pivotal moment in their relationship , and he memorialised it in his longest ( and unfinished ) poem " The Dance " . Around this time , also at her prompting , Larkin learnt to drive and bought a car – his first , a Singer Gazelle . Meanwhile , Monica Jones , whose parents had died in 1959 , bought a holiday cottage in Haydon Bridge , near Hexham , which she and Larkin visited regularly . His poem " Show Saturday " is a description of the 1973 Bellingham show in the North Tyne valley . 
 In 1964 , in the wake of the publication of The Whitsun Weddings , Larkin was the subject of an episode of the arts programme Monitor , directed by Patrick Garland . The programme , which shows him being interviewed by fellow poet John Betjeman in a series of locations in and around Hull , allowed Larkin to play a significant part in the creation of his own public persona ; one he would prefer his readers to imagine . 
 In 1968 , Larkin was offered the OBE , which he declined . Later in life he accepted the offer of being made a Companion of Honour . 
 Larkin 's role in the creation of Hull University 's new Brynmor Jones Library had been important and demanding . Soon after the completion of the second and larger phase of construction in 1969 , he was able to redirect his energies . In October 1970 he started work on compiling a new anthology , The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse ( 1973 ) . He was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at All Souls College , Oxford for two academic terms , allowing him to consult Oxford 's Bodleian Library , a copyright library . Larkin was a major contributor to the re @-@ evaluation of the poetry of Thomas Hardy , which , in comparison to his novels , had been overlooked ; in Larkin 's " idiosyncratic " and " controversial " anthology , Hardy was the poet most generously represented . There were twenty @-@ seven poems by Hardy , compared with only nine by T. S. Eliot ( however , Eliot 's is most famous for long poems ) ; the other poets most extensively represented were W. B. Yeats , W. H. Auden and Rudyard Kipling . Larkin included six of his own poems — the same number as for Rupert Brooke . In the process of compiling the volume he had been disappointed not to find more and better poems as evidence that the clamour over the Modernists had stifled the voices of traditionalists . The most favourable responses to the anthology were those of Auden and John Betjeman , while the most hostile was that of Donald Davie , who accused Larkin of " positive cynicism " and of encouraging " the perverse triumph of philistinism , the cult of the amateur ... [ and ] the weakest kind of <unk> " . After an initial period of anxiety about the anthology 's reception , Larkin enjoyed the clamour . 
 In 1971 Larkin regained contact with his schoolfriend Colin Gunner , who had led a picaresque life . Their subsequent correspondence has gained notoriety as in these letters " Larkin was particularly frank about political and personal opinions " , expressing right @-@ wing views and using racist language . In the period from 1973 to 1974 Larkin became an Honorary Fellow of St John 's College , Oxford and was awarded honorary degrees by Warwick , St Andrews and Sussex universities . In January 1974 Hull University informed Larkin that they were going to dispose of the building on Pearson Park in which he lived . Shortly afterwards he bought a detached two @-@ storey 1950s house in Newland Park which was described by his university colleague John Kenyon as " an entirely middle @-@ class backwater " . Larkin , who moved into the house in June , thought the four @-@ bedroom property " utterly undistinguished " and reflected , " I can 't say it 's the kind of dwelling that is eloquent of the nobility of the human spirit " . 
 Shortly after splitting up with Maeve Brennan in August 1973 , Larkin attended W. H. Auden 's memorial service at Christ Church , Oxford , with Monica Jones as his official partner . In March 1975 the relationship with Brennan restarted , and three weeks after this he initiated a secret affair with Betty Mackereth , who served as his secretary for 28 years , writing the long @-@ undiscovered poem " We met at the end of the party " for her . Despite the logistical difficulties of having three relationships simultaneously , the situation continued until March 1978 . From then on he and Jones were a monogamous couple . 
 In December 2010 , as part of the commemorations of the 25th anniversary of Larkin 's death , the BBC broadcast a programme entitled Philip Larkin and the Third Woman focusing on his affair with Mackereth in which she spoke for the first time about their relationship . It included a reading of a newly discovered secret poem , Dear Jake and revealed that Mackereth was one of the inspirations for his writings .

 In 1982 Larkin turned sixty . This was marked most significantly by a collection of essays entitled Larkin at Sixty , edited by Anthony Thwaite and published by Faber and Faber . There were also two television programmes : an episode of The South Bank Show presented by Melvyn Bragg in which Larkin made off @-@ camera contributions , and a half @-@ hour special on the BBC that was devised and presented by the Labour Shadow Cabinet Minister Roy Hattersley . 
 In 1983 Jones was hospitalised with shingles . The severity of her symptoms , including its effects on her eyes , distressed Larkin . As her health declined , regular care became necessary : within a month she moved into his Newland Park home and remained there for the rest of her life . 
 At the memorial service for John Betjeman , who died in July 1984 , Larkin was asked if he would accept the post of Poet Laureate . He declined , not least because he felt he had long since ceased to be a writer of poetry in a meaningful sense . The following year Larkin began to suffer from oesophageal cancer . On 11 June 1985 he underwent surgery , but his cancer was found to have spread and was inoperable . On 28 November he collapsed and was readmitted to hospital . He died four days later , on 2 December 1985 , at the age of 63 , and was buried at the Cottingham municipal cemetery near Hull . His grave can be found on the left hand side of the cemetery , close to the entrance . Its plain white headstone reads " Philip Larkin 1922 – 1985 Writer " . 
 Larkin had asked on his deathbed that his diaries be destroyed . The request was granted by Jones , the main beneficiary of his will , and Betty Mackereth ; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page , then had them burned . His will was found to be contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work ; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors , who decided the material should not be destroyed . When she died on 15 February 2001 , Jones , in turn , left one million pounds to St Paul 's Cathedral , Hexham Abbey , and Durham Cathedral .

 From his mid @-@ teens Larkin " wrote ceaselessly " , producing both poetry , initially modelled on Eliot and W. H. Auden , and fiction : he wrote five full @-@ length novels , each of which he destroyed shortly after completion . While he was at Oxford University he had a poem published for the first time : " Ultimatum " in The Listener . Around this time he developed a pseudonymous alter ego for his prose , Brunette Coleman . Under this name he wrote two novellas , Trouble at Willow Gables and Michaelmas Term at St Brides ( 2002 ) , as well as a supposed autobiography and an equally fictitious creative manifesto called " What we are writing for " . Richard Bradford has written that these curious works show " three registers : cautious indifference , archly overwritten symbolism with a hint of Lawrence and prose that appears to disclose its writer 's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement " . 
 After these works Larkin started his first published novel Jill ( 1946 ) . This was published by Reginald A. Caton , a publisher of barely legal pornography , who also issued serious fiction as a cover for his core activities . Around the time that Jill was being prepared for publication , Caton inquired of Larkin if he also wrote poetry . This resulted in the publication , three months before Jill , of The North Ship ( 1945 ) , a collection of poems written between 1942 and 1944 which showed the increasing influence of Yeats . Immediately after completing Jill , Larkin started work on the novel A Girl in Winter ( 1947 ) , completing it in 1945 . This was published by Faber and Faber and was well received , The Sunday Times calling it " an exquisite performance and nearly faultless " . Subsequently he made at least three concerted attempts at writing a third novel , but none went further than a solid start . 
 = = = Mature works = = = 
 It was during Larkin 's five years in Belfast that he reached maturity as a poet . The bulk of his next published collection of poems The Less Deceived ( 1955 ) was written there , though eight of the twenty @-@ nine poems included were from the late 1940s . This period also saw Larkin make his final attempts at writing prose fiction , and he gave extensive help to Kingsley Amis with Lucky Jim , which was Amis 's first published novel . In October 1954 an article in The Spectator made the first use of the title The Movement to describe the dominant trend in British post @-@ war literature . Various poems by Larkin were included in a 1953 PEN Anthology that also included poems by Amis and Robert Conquest , and Larkin was seen to be a part of this grouping . In 1951 Larkin compiled a collection called XX Poems which he had privately printed in a run of just 100 copies . Many of the poems in it subsequently appeared in his next published volume . 
 In November 1955 The Less Deceived was published by the Marvell Press , an independent company in Hessle near Hull ( dated October ) . At first the volume attracted little attention , but in December it was included in The Times ' list of Books of the Year . From this point the book 's reputation spread and sales blossomed throughout 1956 and 1957 . During his first five years in Hull the pressures of work slowed Larkin 's output to an average of just two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half poems a year , but this period saw the writing of some of his best @-@ known poems , such as " An Arundel Tomb " , " The Whitsun Weddings " and " Here " . 
 In 1963 Faber and Faber reissued Jill , with the addition of a long introduction by Larkin that included much information about his time at Oxford University and his friendship with Kingsley Amis . This acted as a prelude to the release the following year of The Whitsun Weddings , the volume which cemented his reputation ; almost immediately after its publication he was granted a Fellowship of the Royal Society of Literature . In the years that followed Larkin wrote several of his most famous poems , followed in the 1970s by a series of longer and more sober poems , including " The Building " and " The Old Fools " . All of these appeared in Larkin 's final collection , High Windows , which was published in June 1974 . Its more direct use of language meant that it did not meet with uniform praise ; nonetheless it sold over twenty thousand copies in its first year alone . For some critics it represents a falling @-@ off from his previous two books , yet it contains a number of his much @-@ loved pieces , including " This Be The Verse " and " The Explosion " , as well as the title poem . " Annus Mirabilis " ( Year of Wonder ) , also from that volume , contains the frequently quoted observation that sexual intercourse began in 1963 , which the narrator claims was " rather late for me " : this despite Larkin having started his own sexual career in 1945 . Bradford , prompted by comments in Maeve Brennan 's memoir , suggests that the poem commemorates Larkin 's relationship with Brennan moving from the romantic to the sexual . 
 Later in 1974 he started work on his final major published poem , " Aubade " . It was completed in 1977 and published in the 23 December issue of The Times Literary Supplement . After " Aubade " Larkin wrote only one poem that has attracted close critical attention , the posthumously published and intensely personal " Love Again " . 
 = = = Poetic style = = = 
 Larkin 's poetry has been characterized as combining " an ordinary , colloquial style " , " clarity " , a " quiet , reflective tone " , " ironic understatement " and a " direct " engagement with " commonplace experiences " , while Jean Hartley summed his style up as a " piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent " . 
 Larkin 's earliest work showed the influence of Eliot , Auden and Yeats , and the development of his mature poetic identity in the early 1950s coincided with the growing influence on him of Thomas Hardy . The " mature " Larkin style , first evident in The Less Deceived , is " that of the detached , sometimes lugubrious , sometimes tender observer " , who , in Hartley 's phrase , looks at " ordinary people doing ordinary things " . He disparaged poems that relied on " shared classical and literary allusions - what he called the myth @-@ kitty , and the poems are never cluttered with elaborate imagery . " Larkin 's mature poetic persona is notable for its " plainness and scepticism " . Other recurrent features of his mature work are sudden openings and " highly @-@ structured but flexible verse forms " . 
 Terence Hawkes has argued that while most of the poems in The North Ship are " metaphoric in nature , heavily indebted to Yeats 's symbolist lyrics " , the subsequent development of Larkin 's mature style is " not ... a movement from Yeats to Hardy , but rather a surrounding of the <unk> moment ( the metaphor ) within a <unk> frame " . In Hawkes 's view , " Larkin 's poetry ... revolves around two losses " : the " loss of modernism " , which manifests itself as " the desire to find a moment of epiphany " , and " the loss of England , or rather the loss of the British Empire , which requires England to define itself in its own terms when previously it could define ' Englishness ' in opposition to something else . " 
 In 1972 Larkin wrote the oft @-@ quoted " Going , Going " , a poem which expresses a romantic fatalism in its view of England that was typical of his later years . In it he prophesies a complete destruction of the countryside , and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity : " And that will be England gone ... it will linger on in galleries ; but all that remains for us will be concrete and tyres " . The poem ends with the blunt statement , " I just think it will happen , soon . " 
 Larkin 's style is bound up with his recurring themes and subjects , which include death and fatalism , as in his final major poem " Aubade " . Poet Andrew Motion observes of Larkin 's poems that " their rage or contempt is always checked by the ... energy of their language and the satisfactions of their articulate formal control " , and contrasts two aspects of his poetic personality — on the one hand an enthusiasm for " symbolist moments " and " freely imaginative narratives " , and on the other a " remorseless factuality " and " crudity of language " . Motion defines this as a " life @-@ enhancing struggle between opposites " , and concludes that his poetry is typically " ambivalent " : " His three mature collections have developed attitudes and styles of ... imaginative daring : in their prolonged debates with despair , they testify to wide sympathies , contain passages of frequently transcendent beauty , and demonstrate a poetic inclusiveness which is of immense consequence for his literary heirs . "

 Larkin was a notable critic of modernism in contemporary art and literature . His scepticism is at its most nuanced and illuminating in Required Writing , a collection of his book reviews and essays , and at its most inflamed and polemical in his introduction to his collected jazz reviews , All What Jazz , drawn from the 126 record @-@ review columns he wrote for The Daily Telegraph between 1961 and 1971 , which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts . Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired as an enemy of modernism , recent critical assessments of Larkin 's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 = = = Reception history = = = 
 When first published in 1945 , The North Ship received just one review , in the Coventry Evening Telegraph , which concluded " Mr Larkin has an inner vision that must be sought for with care . His recondite imagery is couched in phrases that make up in a kind of wistful hinted beauty what they lack in lucidity . Mr Larkin 's readers must at present be confined to a small circle . Perhaps his work will gain wider appeal as his genius becomes more mature ? " A few years later , though , the poet and critic Charles Madge came across the book and wrote to Larkin with his compliments . When the collection was reissued in 1966 it was presented as a work of juvenilia , and the reviews were gentle and respectful ; the most forthright praise came from Elizabeth Jennings in The Spectator : " few will question the intrinsic value of The North Ship or the importance of its being reprinted now . It is good to know that Larkin could write so well when still so young . " 
 The Less Deceived was first noticed by The Times , who included it in its List of Books of 1955 . In its wake many other reviews followed ; " most of them concentrated ... on the book 's emotional impact and its sophisticated , witty language . " The Spectator felt the collection was " in the running for the best published in this country since the war " ; G. S. Fraser , referring to Larkin 's perceived association with The Movement felt that Larkin exemplified " everything that is good in this ' new movement ' and none of its faults " . The TLS called him " a poet of quite exceptional importance " , and in June 1956 the Times Educational Supplement was fulsome : " As native as a Whitstable oyster , as sharp an expression of contemporary thought and experience as anything written in our time , as immediate in its appeal as the lyric poetry of an earlier day , it may well be regarded by posterity as a poetic monument that marks the triumph over the formless <unk> of the last twenty years . With Larkin poetry is on its way back to the middlebrow public . " Reviewing the book in America the poet Robert Lowell wrote , " No post @-@ war poetry has so caught the moment , and caught it without straining after its ephemera . It 's a hesitant , groping mumble , resolutely experienced , resolutely perfect in its artistic methods . " 
 In time , there was a counter @-@ reaction : David Wright wrote in Encounter that The Less Deceived suffered from the " palsy of playing safe " ; in April 1957 Charles Tomlinson wrote a piece for the journal Essays in Criticism , " The <unk> Muse " , attacking The Movement 's poets for their " middle @-@ cum @-@ <unk> " , " suburban mental ratio " and " parochialism " — Larkin had a " tenderly nursed sense of defeat " . In 1962 A. Alvarez , the compiler of an anthology entitled The New Poetry , famously accused Larkin of " gentility , neo @-@ Georgian pastoralism , and a failure to deal with the violent extremes of contemporary life " . 
 When The Whitsun Weddings was released Alvarez continued his attacks in a review in The Observer , complaining of the " drab circumspection " of Larkin 's " commonplace " subject @-@ matter . Praise outweighed criticism ; John Betjeman felt Larkin had " closed the gap between poetry and the public which the experiments and obscurity of the last fifty years have done so much to widen . " In The New York Review of Books Christopher Ricks wrote of the " refinement of self @-@ consciousness , usually flawless in its execution " and Larkin 's summoning up of " the world of all of us , the place where , in the end , we find our happiness , or not at all . " He felt Larkin to be " the best poet England now has . " 
 In his biography Richard Bradford writes that the reviews for High Windows showed " genuine admiration " but notes that they typically encountered problems describing " the individual genius at work " in poems such as " Annus Mirabilis " , " The Explosion " and " The Building " while also explaining why each were " so radically different " from one another . Robert Nye in The Times overcame this problem " by treating the differences as ineffective masks for a consistently nasty presence " . 
 In Larkin at Sixty , amongst the portraits by friends and colleagues such as Kingsley Amis , Noel Hughes and Charles Monteith and dedicatory poems by John Betjeman , Peter Porter and Gavin Ewart , the various strands of Larkin 's output were analysed by critics and fellow poets : Andrew Motion , Christopher Ricks and Seamus Heaney looked at the poems , Alan Brownjohn wrote on the novels , and Donald Mitchell and Clive James looked at his jazz criticism . 
 = = = Critical opinion = = = 
 In 1980 Neil Powell could write that " It is probably fair to say that Philip Larkin is less highly regarded in academic circles than either Thom Gunn or Donald Davie " . But more recently Larkin 's standing has increased . " Philip Larkin is an excellent example of the plain style in modern times , " writes <unk> <unk> . Robert Sheppard asserts that " It is by general consent that the work of Philip Larkin is taken to be exemplary " . " Larkin is the most widely celebrated and arguably the finest poet of the Movement , " states Keith Tuma , and his poetry is " more various than its reputation for dour pessimism and anecdotes of a disappointed middle class suggests " . 
 Stephen Cooper 's Philip Larkin : Subversive Writer and John Osborne 's " Larkin , Ideology and Critical Violence " suggest the changing temper of Larkin studies , the latter attacking eminent critics such as James Booth and Anthony Thwaite for their readiness to reduce to poems to works of biography , and stressing instead the genius of Larkin 's universality and <unk> . Cooper argues that " The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class , gender , authority and sexual relations " . Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer , and perceives in the letters a " plea for alternative constructs of masculinity , femininity and social and political organisation " . Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin 's works , as well as on unpublished correspondence , to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist , misogynist reactionary . Instead he identifies in Larkin what he calls a " subversive imagination " . He highlights in particular " Larkin 's objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics that hamper the lives of both sexes in equal measure " . 
 In similar vein to Cooper , Stephen Regan notes in an essay entitled " Philip Larkin : a late modern poet " that Larkin frequently embraces devices associated with the experimental practices of Modernism , such as " linguistic strangeness , self @-@ conscious literariness , radical self @-@ questioning , sudden shifts of voice and register , complex viewpoints and perspectives , and symbolist intensity " . 
 A further indication of a new direction in the critical valuation of Larkin is S. K. Chatterjee 's statement that " Larkin is no longer just a name but an institution , a modern British national cultural monument " . 
 Chatterjee 's view of Larkin is grounded in a detailed analysis of his poetic style . He notes a development from Larkin 's early works to his later ones , which sees his style change from " verbal opulence through a recognition of the self @-@ <unk> and self @-@ negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual <unk> – which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives , between abstracts and <unk> , between <unk> and risings and between singleness and multiplicity – are found to be the last stumbling @-@ block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness " . This contrasts with an older view that Larkin 's style barely changed over the course of his poetic career . Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by Bernard Bergonzi 's comment that " Larkin 's poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974 " . For Chatterjee , Larkin 's poetry responds strongly to changing " economic , socio @-@ political , literary and cultural factors " . 
 Chatterjee argues that " It is under the defeatist veneer of his poetry that the positive side of Larkin 's vision of life is hidden " . This positivity , suggests Chatterjee , is most apparent in his later works . Over the course of Larkin 's poetic career , " The most notable <unk> development lay in the zone of his view of life , which from being almost irredeemably bleak and pessimistic in The North Ship , became more and more positive with the passage of time " . 
 The view that Larkin is not a nihilist or pessimist , but actually displays optimism in his works , is certainly not universally endorsed , but Chatterjee 's lengthy study suggests the degree to which old stereotypes of Larkin are now being transcended . Representative of these stereotypes is Bryan Appleyard 's judgement ( quoted by Maeve Brennan ) that of the writers who " have adopted a personal pose of extreme pessimism and loathing of the world ... none has done so with quite such a grinding focus on littleness and triviality as Larkin the man " . Recent criticism of Larkin demonstrates a more complex set of values at work in his poetry and across the totality of his writings . 
 The debate about Larkin is summed up by Matthew Johnson , who observes that in most evaluations of Larkin " one is not really discussing the man , but actually reading a coded and implicit discussion of the supposed values of ' Englishness ' that he is held to represent " . Changing attitudes to Englishness are reflected in changing attitudes to Larkin , and the more sustained intellectual interest in the English national character , as embodied in the works of Peter Mandler for instance , pinpoint one key reason why there is an increased scholarly interest in Larkin . 
 A summative view similar to those of Johnson and Regan is that of Robert Crawford , who argues that " In various ways , Larkin 's work depends on , and develops from , Modernism . " Furthermore , he " demonstrates just how slippery the word ' English ' is " . 
 Despite these recent developments , Larkin and his circle are nonetheless still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets . For example , the poet Andrew Duncan , writing of The Movement on his <unk> website , notes that " there now seems to be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing , and that Movement poems are tedious , shallow , smug , sententious , emotionally dead , etc . Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics . Wolfgang <unk> 's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s — an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry , and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents . " Peter Riley , a key player in the British Poetry Revival , which was a reaction against The Movement 's poets , has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position : " What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards , in favour of ' This is what life is really like ' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable ' life ' . W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew perfectly well that ' life ' was like that , if you nominated it thus , which is why they went elsewhere . " 
 = = = Posthumous reputation = = = 
 Larkin 's posthumous reputation was deeply affected by the publication in 1992 of Anthony Thwaite 's edition of his letters and , the following year , his official biography , Philip Larkin : A Writer 's Life by Andrew Motion . These revealed his obsession with pornography , his racism , his increasing shift to the political right wing , and his habitual expressions of venom and spleen . In 1990 , even before the publication of these two books , Tom Paulin wrote that Larkin 's " obscenity is informed by prejudices that are not by any means as ordinary , commonplace , or acceptable as the poetic language in which they are so plainly spelled out . " The letters and Motion 's biography fuelled further assessments of this kind , such as Lisa Jardine 's comment in The Guardian that " The Britishness of Larkin 's poetry carries a baggage of attitudes which the Selected Letters now make explicit " . On the other hand , the revelations were dismissed by the novelist Martin Amis in The War Against Cliché , arguing that the letters in particular show nothing more than a tendency for Larkin to tailor his words according to the recipient . A similar argument was made by Richard Bradford in his biography on Larkin from 2005 . Commenting on Letters to Monica ( 2010 ) Graeme Richardson states that the collection went " some way towards the restoration of Larkin 's tarnished image ... reveal ( ing ) Larkin as not quite the sinister , black @-@ hearted near @-@ rapist everyone thought it was OK to abuse in the 90s . " 
 Trying to resolve Larkin 's contradictory opinions on race in his book Such Deliberate <unk> : The Art of Philip Larkin , the writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman , as if it exposes " all the post @-@ Motion and post @-@ Letters furore about Larkin ’ s ' racism ' as the nonsense it is " : 
 " The American Negro is trying to take a step forward that can be compared only to the ending of slavery in the nineteenth century . And despite the dogs , the <unk> and the burnings , advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights that would have been inconceivable when Louis Armstrong was a young man . These advances will doubtless continue . They will end only when the Negro is as well @-@ housed , educated and medically cared for as the white man . " 
 Reviewing Palmer 's book , John G. <unk> , Jr. wonders " if this does not qualify as the thought of a true racist : ' I find the state of the nation quite terrifying . In 10 years ’ time we shall all be cowering under our beds as hordes of blacks steal anything they can lay their hands on . ' Or this : ' We don ’ t go to cricket Test matches now , too many fucking niggers about . ' " 
 Despite controversy about his personal life and opinions , Larkin remains one of Britain 's most popular poets . In 2003 , almost two decades after his death , Larkin was chosen as " the nation 's best @-@ loved poet " in a survey by the Poetry Book Society , and in 2008 The Times named Larkin as the greatest British post @-@ war writer . Three of his poems , " This Be The Verse " , " The Whitsun Weddings " and " An Arundel Tomb " , featured in the Nation 's Top 100 Poems as voted for by viewers of the BBC 's Bookworm in 1995 . Media interest in Larkin has increased in the twenty @-@ first century . Larkin 's collection The Whitsun Weddings is one of the available poetry texts in the <unk> English Literature A Level syllabus , while High Windows is offered by the OCR board . Buses in Hull displayed extracts from his poems in 2010 . 
 = = = Recordings = = = 
 In 1959 , the Marvell Press published Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived ( Listen <unk> ) , an LP record on which Larkin recites all the poems from The Less Deceived in the order they appear in the printed volume . This was followed , in 1965 , by Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings ( Listen <unk> ) , again on the Marvell Press 's record label ( though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber ) . Once again the poems are read in the order in which they appear in the printed volume , but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems . A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection , High Windows , was published in 1975 as British poets of our time . Philip Larkin ; High Windows : poems read by the author ( edited by Peter Orr ) on the Argo record label ( Argo PLP 1202 ) . As with the two previous recordings , the sequencing of the poems is the same as in the printed volume . 
 Larkin also appears on several audio poetry anthologies : The Jupiter Anthology of 20th Century English Poetry – Part III ( <unk> <unk> ) , issued in 1963 and featuring " An Arundel Tomb " and " Mr <unk> " ( this same recording was issued in the United States in 1967 on the Folkways record label as Anthology of 20th Century English Poetry – Part III ( <unk> ) ) ; The Poet Speaks record 8 ( Argo PLP 1088 ) , issued in 1967 and featuring " Wants " , " Coming " , " Nothing to be Said " , " Days " and " Dockery and Son " ; On Record ( <unk> ) , issued in 1974 by Yorkshire Arts Association and featuring " Here " , " Days " , " Next , Please " , " Wedding @-@ Wind " , " The Whitsun Weddings " , " XXX " , " XIII " ( these last two poems from The North Ship ) ; and Douglas Dunn and Philip Larkin , issued in 1984 by Faber and Faber ( A Faber Poetry cassette ) , featuring Larkin reading 13 poems including , for the first time on a recording , " Aubade " . 
 Despite the fact that Larkin made audio recordings ( in studio conditions ) of each of his three mature collections , and separate recordings of groups of poems for a number of audio anthologies , he somehow gained a reputation as a poet who was reluctant to make recordings in which he read his own work . While Larkin did express a dislike of the sound of his own voice ( " I come from Coventry , between the sloppiness of Leicester and the whine of Birmingham , you know — and sometimes it comes out " ) , the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work , than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems . 
 In 1980 , Larkin was invited by the Poets ' Audio Center , Washington , to record a selection of poems from the full range of his poetic output for publication on a Watershed Foundation cassette tape . The recording was made in February 1980 ( at Larkin 's own expense ) by John Weeks , a sound engineer colleague from the University of Hull . Although negotiations between Larkin , his publishers and the Watershed Foundation collapsed , the recording ( of Larkin reading 26 poems selected from his four canonical volumes of poetry ) was sold – by Larkin – to Harvard University 's Poetry Room in 1981 . In 2004 , a copy of this recording was uncovered in the Hornsea garage studio of the engineer who had made the recording for Larkin . ( Subsequently , Larkin 's own copy of the recording was found in the Larkin Archive at the University of Hull ) News of the “ newly discovered ” recording made the headlines in 2006 , with extracts being broadcast in a Sky News report . A programme examining the discovery in more depth , The Larkin Tapes , was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in March 2008 . The recordings were issued on CD by Faber and Faber in January 2009 as The Sunday Sessions . 
 In contrast to the number of audio recordings of Larkin reading his own work , there are very few appearances by Larkin on television . The only programme in which he agreed to be filmed taking part is Down Cemetery Road ( 1964 ) , from the BBC Monitor series , in which Larkin was interviewed by John Betjeman . The filming took place in and around Hull ( with some filming in North Lincolnshire ) , and showed Larkin in his natural surroundings : his flat in Pearson Park , the Brynmor Jones Library ; and visiting churches and cemeteries . The film was more recently broadcast on BBC Four . In 1981 , Larkin was part of a group of poets who surprised John Betjeman on his seventy @-@ fifth birthday by turning up on his doorstep with gifts and greetings . This scene was filmed by Jonathan <unk> and later featured in third episode of his 1983 series for BBC2 , Time With Betjeman . In 1982 , as part of celebrations for his sixtieth birthday , Larkin was the subject of The South Bank Show . Although Larkin declined the invitation to appear in the programme , he recorded ( on audio tape ) " a lot of poems " specifically for it . Melvyn Bragg commented , in his introduction to the programme , that the poet had given his full cooperation . The programme , broadcast on 30 May , featured contributions from Kingsley Amis , Andrew Motion and Alan Bennett . Bennett was also filmed reading several Larkin poems a few years later , in an edition of Poetry in Motion , broadcast by Channel 4 in 1990 .

 In 1999 , Oliver Ford Davies starred in Ben Brown 's play Larkin With Women at the Stephen Joseph Theatre , Scarborough , reprising his role at the Orange Tree Theatre , London in 2006 . The play was published by Larkin 's usual publishers , Faber and Faber . Set in the three decades after Larkin 's arrival in Hull , it explores his long relationships with Monica Jones , Maeve Brennan and Betty Mackereth . Another Larkin inspired entertainment , devised and starring Sir Tom Courtenay , was given a pre @-@ production performance on the afternoon of Saturday 29 June 2002 at Hull University 's Middleton Hall . Courtenay performed his one @-@ man play Pretending to Be Me as part of the Second Hull International Conference on the Work of Philip Larkin . In November that year , Courtenay debuted the play at the West Yorkshire Playhouse , later transferring the production to the Comedy Theatre in London 's West End . An audio recording of the play , which is based on Larkin 's letters , interviews , diaries and verse , was released in 2005 . In June 2010 , Courtenay returned to the University of Hull to give a performance of a newly revised version of Pretending to Be Me called Larkin Revisited in aid of the Larkin statue appeal as part of the Larkin 25 festival . 
 In July 2003 , BBC Two broadcast a play entitled Love Again — its title also that of one of Larkin 's most painfully personal poems — dealing with the last thirty years of Larkin 's life ( though not shot anywhere near Hull ) . The lead role was played by Hugh Bonneville , and in the same year Channel 4 broadcast the documentary Philip Larkin , Love and Death in Hull . 
 In April 2008 , BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play by Chris <unk> entitled Mr Larkin 's Awkward Day , recounting the practical joke played on him in 1957 by his friend Robert Conquest , a fellow poet .

 The Philip Larkin Society is a Charitable organization dedicated to preserving the memory and works of Philip Larkin . It was formed in 1995 on the tenth anniversary of Larkin 's death in 1985 , and achieved charity status in the United Kingdom in 2000 . Anthony Thwaite , one of Larkin 's literary executors , became the society 's first president . The current Society Chairman is Edwin Dawes . 
 The society carries out various activities , such as lectures . It hosted the Larkin 25 art festival from June to December 2010 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Larkin 's death . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 Memorials to Larkin in Kingston upon Hull , where he worked and wrote much of his poetry , are the Larkin Building at the University of Hull housing teaching facilities and lecture rooms and the Philip Larkin Centre for Poetry and Creative Writing which hosts a regular programme of literary events . 
 In 2010 the city marked the 25th anniversary of his death with the Larkin 25 Festival . A video was commissioned to illustrate Larkin 's poem " Here " , his hymn to Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire . Forty decorated toad sculptures entitled " Larkin with Toads " were displayed in the city in tribute to Larkin 's poem " Toads " on 17 July 2010 . A larger @-@ than @-@ life @-@ size bronze statue of Larkin by sculptor Martin Jennings was unveiled at Hull Paragon Interchange on 2 December 2010 , closing the Larkin 25 events . It is inscribed , " That Whitsun I was late getting away " , from the poem , The Whitsun Weddings . Funding for the £ 100 @,@ 000 statue , designed by Martin Jennings , was raised at charity events and auctions with support from Hull City Council . The unveiling was accompanied by Nathaniel Seaman 's Fanfare for Larkin , composed for the occasion . Five plaques containing Larkin 's poems were added to the floor near the statue in 2011 . In December 2012 a memorial bench was installed around a pillar near the statue . 
 In June 2015 it was announced that Larkin would be honoured with a floor stone memorial at Poets ' Corner in Westminster Abbey . The memorial would be unveiled on 2 December 2016 , the 31st anniversary of his death .

 = Full Circle : Carnegie Hall 2000 = 
 Full Circle : Carnegie Hall 2000 is a live album by Indian musician and composer Ravi Shankar , released in 2001 through the record label Angel Records . Recorded at Carnegie Hall in October 2000 as part of a tour with Shankar 's daughter Anoushka , the album contains five tracks and presents two ragas . The concert occurred sixty @-@ two years after Shankar 's first performance at Carnegie Hall and commemorated his eightieth birthday ; the album was his first live recording in nearly twenty years . Full Circle was produced by Hans Wendl , mastered by Scott Hull , and mixed and engineered by Tom Lazarus . Featured are performances by Tanmoy Bose and Bickram Ghosh on tabla , and Anoushka and Ravi on sitar . 
 In 2001 , the album peaked at ninth position on Billboard 's Top World Music Albums chart and earned Shankar the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 Full Circle was recorded at Carnegie Hall in New York City on October 6 , 2000 , as part of a tour of the same name in which Ravi introduced his nineteen @-@ year @-@ old daughter and student Anoushka Shankar . Anoushka began studying at age nine and is the only musician in the world trained exclusively by Ravi . The concert commemorated Shankar 's eightieth birthday and occurred sixty @-@ two years after his first performance at the venue as a member of his brother Uday Shankar 's Indian dance group . The album also marked Shankar 's first live recording in nearly twenty years . The Carnegie Hall concert was held specifically for the purpose of recording a live album , despite Shankar 's hesitations about using " traditional recording considerations " to capture improvisational music . 
 Full Circle contains two ragas presented in five tracks totaling just over one hour in length . Kaushi Kanhara ( a compound raga that combines <unk> and Darbari Kanada ) is separated in an alap portion ( an unaccompanied introduction ) which includes jor and jhala ( playing with pulse and fast pulse ) , and a gat portion ( composition with tabla accompaniment ) . Mishra Gara is introduced with an <unk> ( a short alap ) , and features two gats , in a single thirty @-@ minute track . Hans Wendl worked as record producer and Scott Hull mastered the album , which was mixed and engineered by Tom Lazarus and features performances by Tanmoy Bose and Bickram Ghosh on tabla , and Anoushka and Ravi on sitar . Shankar said he was successful in reaching his goal of presenting variety on the album by incorporating both " ancient " and " contemporary , semi @-@ classical " styles and reaching a musical climax quickly . 
 Gilbert Heatherwick , an Angel Records executive , said that the label sought to market the album as an " event record " and would position it " upfront in pop departments " . Angel promoted the album through NPR stations and mainstream press outlets as a " human interest story " , focusing on Shankar 's career and how the album exemplifies its title . Full Circle was released in India through the EMI @-@ owned label Virgin India . 
 Anoushka Shankar 's album Live at Carnegie Hall was recorded at Carnegie Hall the same evening . The album was released in December 2001 and earned her a nomination for Best World Music Album at the 45th Grammy Awards ( 2003 ) , making her the youngest musician nominated in the category . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Allmusic 's Sean Westergaard awarded the album three of five stars and called it an " excellent recording " . He complimented Ravi 's musicianship and dexterity , particularly during the fast gat section of Mishra Gara , but suggested that alap and jor might be too long for some Western listeners . Yoga Journal 's Derk Richardson wrote that Shankar 's fast fingering and " ingenious note choices ... conspire to create a mesmerizing swirl " . Richardson complimented all instrumental performers , as well as producer Hans Wendl , for recording the ensemble with " striking clarity " , and called Shankar 's playing " timeless " . Bill Meyer wrote in his 2005 review for the Chicago Reader that Shankar was not as fast as he used to be but that he was still a " thrilling improviser " . 
 = = Chart performance and recognition = = 
 Full Circle reached a peak position of nine on Billboard 's Top World Music Albums chart the week of May 5 , 2001 . At the 44th Grammy Awards in 2002 , the album earned Shankar a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album . This marked Shankar 's third Grammy win , after he was previously recognized along with Yehudi Menuhin for the collaborative album West Meets East , and with George Harrison , et al. at the 15th Grammy Awards in 1973 for The Concert for Bangladesh . Following the 2002 Grammy win , tabla musician Bickram Ghosh said he enjoyed the recognition but insisted the " limelight " would not affect his future playing . When The Times of India questioned whether or not tanpura musicians received adequate praise for their contributions to the album , Ghosh responded that the tanpura is a " drawn instrument and not a performance art . " Of his performances alongside Shankar , Ghosh rated the Carnegie Hall concert an eight on a ten @-@ point scale , saving a nine rating for the Toronto Ford Centre concert in 1997 . According to the Ravi Shankar Foundation , the album also won first place in the Traditional World category at the 5th Annual <unk> Music Awards .

 = Hurricane Carlotta ( 2000 ) = 
 Hurricane Carlotta was the most powerful hurricane of the 2000 Pacific hurricane season . The third tropical cyclone of the season , Carlotta developed from a tropical wave on June 18 about 270 miles ( 470 km ) southeast off the coast of Mexico . With favorable conditions for development , it strengthened steadily at first , followed by a period of rapid deepening to peak winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) on June 22 . Cooler waters caused Carlotta to gradually weaken , and on June 25 it degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure while located about 260 miles ( 420 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas . 
 The hurricane produced heavy rainfall and rough surf along the southwest coast of Mexico , though no serious damage was reported . A Lithuanian freighter traversing through the peak of the hurricane was lost after experiencing an engine failure ; its crew of 18 was presumed killed . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June 3 . It tracked westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean , and on June 15 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean . The system continued westward , and late on June 16 a low pressure area developed about 300 miles ( 480 km ) southwest of San José , Costa Rica . At around 1200 UTC on June 17 , Dvorak classifications began on the disturbance , though initially its convection was broadly distributed and disorganized . The next day , however , an area of concentrated convection developed just south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec . Ships in the vicinity confirmed the development of a surface circulation within the system , while satellite imagery showed the development of a central dense overcast . Based on its organization , it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three @-@ E late on June 18 while located about 270 miles ( 470 km ) southeast of Puerto Angel , Oaxaca in Mexico . 
 Initially , the convection of the depression was displaced to the west of the circulation due to some easterly wind shear , though as it tracked west @-@ northwestward parallel to the coast of Mexico , it maintained and developed deep convection near and over the center . With favorable conditions , the cyclone strengthened and became Tropical Storm Carlotta early on June 19 . The storm initially maintained a track toward the Mexican coastline , though a mid @-@ level ridge turned it to the west ; its closest point of approach was about 140 miles ( 225 km ) at 1200 UTC on June 19 . Late that day , a ragged banding @-@ eye feature developed on satellite imagery , while at the same time it maintained an area of strong convection and well @-@ defined outflow to its south . The storm continued to intensify , and at 0600 UTC on June 20 Carlotta attained hurricane status while located about 155 miles ( 250 km ) south of Acapulco . Operationally , it was upgraded to hurricane status six hours earlier . 
 With a large anticyclone centered near Mazatlán , Sinaloa , Carlotta turned more to the west . Deep convection increased in coverage and intensity as the system maintained impressive upper @-@ level outflow over its southern semicircle . Late on June 20 , Hurricane Carlotta began a period of rapid deepening , with warm waters and a very favorable upper @-@ level environment , and in a twelve @-@ hour period the pressure dropped 49 mbar to an estimated minimum central pressure of 932 mbar at 0600 UTC on June 21 ; at the same time , Carlotta attained peak winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) while located about 285 miles ( 455 km ) southwest of Acapulco . At the time of its peak intensity , Carlotta maintained a well @-@ defined central dense overcast around an eye of 20 miles ( 36 km ) in diameter . Satellite intensity estimates indicated winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) , though through much of its duration there was a sizable discrepancy between the estimated winds and that of winds reported by Hurricane Hunters . 
 Hurricane Carlotta maintained peak winds for about twelve hours before weakening as it curved around the periphery of the mid @-@ level ridge over Mexico . Late on June 21 , the eye had become less distinct while its surrounding ring of convection eroded and warmed . Early on June 22 , northeasterly wind shear increased , and shortly thereafter the weakening trend was temporarily halted with some oscillations in the convective intensity and eye definition . Weakening continued on June 23 as the hurricane tracked over increasingly cooler waters , and shortly after 0000 UTC on June 24 Carlotta weakened to a tropical storm about 260 miles ( 420 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas . Overall convection continued to diminish , and early on June 25 the winds dropped to tropical depression status . Deep convection ceased to exist by 0600 UTC on June 25 , and Carlotta degenerated into a remnant low pressure area . The low @-@ level circulation of Carlotta persisted for several days as it continued northwestward . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Shortly after first developing , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Salina Cruz to Acapulco , and later was extended to Zihuatanejo . Though the National Hurricane Center never forecast it to make landfall , one computer model predicted Carlotta to move ashore ; due to the threat , the Mexican government also issued a hurricane watch from Puerto Angel to Zihuatanejo . Outer rainbands and rough surf affected the southwestern coast of Mexico for an extended duration ; officials evacuated about 100 families in potentially flooded areas of Acapulco as a precaution . Precipitation and clouds were reported in every Mexican state along the Pacific Ocean , resulting in flooding in some areas . No stations in Mexico reported sustained tropical storm force winds ; however , <unk> de Huatulco International Airport in Oaxaca reported a wind gust of 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) . Heavy rainfall and rough seas were also reported on Socorro Island . 
 Seven ships reported tropical storm force winds in association with Carlotta , peaking at 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) ; the lowest pressure recorded by ship was 1 @,@ 008 mbar . Offshore , waves reached 40 feet ( 12 m ) in height . The Lithuanian freighter Linkuva , en route to Long Beach , California , encountered the waves and strong winds as the hurricane was undergoing its period of rapid intensification . After an engine failure , the freighter was lost about 220 miles ( 355 km ) southwest of Acapulco . A naval vessel from both the United States Navy and the Mexican Navy searched for the freighter for three days , though the crew was lost and presumed killed . 
 = Special Air Service = 
 The Special Air Service ( SAS ) is a special forces unit of the British Army . The SAS was founded in 1941 as a regiment , and later reconstituted as a corps in 1950 . The unit undertakes a number of roles including covert reconnaissance , counter @-@ terrorism , direct action , hostage rescue and human intelligence gathering . 
 The corps presently comprises 22 Special Air Service Regiment , the regular component , under the operational command of United Kingdom Special Forces , and 21 ( Artists ) Special Air Service Regiment ( Reserve ) and 23 Special Air Service Regiment ( Reserve ) , which are reserve units under the operational command of 1st Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade . 
 The Special Air Service traces its origins to 1941 and the Second World War , and was reformed as part of the Territorial Army in 1947 , named the 21st Special Air Service Regiment ( Artists Rifles ) . 22 Special Air Service Regiment , part of the regular army , later gained fame and recognition worldwide after successfully assaulting the Iranian Embassy in London and rescuing hostages during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege , lifting the regiment from obscurity outside the military establishment . 
 = = History = = 
 The Special Air Service was a unit of the British Army during the Second World War , formed in July 1941 by David Stirling and originally called " L " Detachment , Special Air Service Brigade — the " L " designation and Air Service name being a tie @-@ in to a British disinformation campaign , trying to deceive the Axis into thinking there was a paratrooper regiment with numerous units operating in the area ( the real SAS would " prove " to the Axis that the fake one existed ) . It was conceived as a commando force to operate behind enemy lines in the North African Campaign and initially consisted of five officers and 60 other ranks . Its first mission , in November 1941 , was a parachute drop in support of the Operation Crusader offensive . Due to German resistance and adverse weather conditions , the mission was a disaster : 22 men , a third of the unit , were killed or captured . Its second mission was a success : transported by the Long Range Desert Group , it attacked three airfields in Libya , destroying 60 aircraft with the loss of 2 men and 3 Willys MB . In September 1942 it was renamed 1st SAS , consisting at that time of four British squadrons , one Free French , one Greek , and the Folboat Section . 
 In January 1943 , Stirling was captured in Tunisia and Paddy Mayne replaced him as commander . In April 1943 , the 1st SAS was reorganised into the Special Raiding Squadron under Mayne 's command and the Special Boat Squadron was placed under the command of George Jellicoe . The Special Raiding Squadron fought in Sicily and Italy along with the 2nd SAS , which had been formed in North Africa in 1943 in part by the renaming of the Small Scale Raiding Force . The Special Boat Squadron fought in the Aegean Islands and Dodecanese until the end of the war . In 1944 the SAS Brigade was formed from the British 1st and 2nd SAS , the French 3rd and 4th SAS and the Belgian 5th SAS . It was tasked with parachute operations behind the German lines in France and carried out operations supporting the Allied advance through Belgium , the Netherlands ( Operation Pegasus ) , and eventually into Germany ( Operation Archway ) . As a result of Hitler 's issuing of the Commando Order 18 October 1942 , the members of the unit faced the additional danger that they would be summarily executed if ever captured by the Germans . In July 1944 , following Operation <unk> , 34 captured SAS commandos were summarily executed by the Germans . In October 1944 , in the aftermath of Operation <unk> 31 captured SAS commandos were summarily executed by the Germans . 
 = = = Post war = = = 
 At the end of the war the British Government , seeing no further need for the force , disbanded it on 8 October 1945 . The following year it was decided there was a need for a long @-@ term deep @-@ penetration commando unit , and a new SAS regiment was to be raised as part of the Territorial Army . Ultimately , the Artists Rifles , raised in 1860 and headquartered at Dukes Road , Euston , took on the SAS mantle as 21st SAS Regiment ( V ) on 1 January 1947 . 
 In 1950 , a 21 SAS squadron was raised to fight in the Korean War . After three months of training in England , it was informed that the squadron would no longer be required in Korea and so it instead volunteered to fight in the Malayan Emergency . Upon arrival in Malaya , it came under the command of Mike Calvert who was forming a new unit called the Malayan Scouts ( SAS ) . Calvert had already formed one squadron from 100 volunteers in the Far East , which became A Squadron — the 21 SAS squadron then became B Squadron ; and after a recruitment visit to Rhodesia by Calvert , C Squadron was formed from 1 @,@ 000 Rhodesian volunteers . The Rhodesians returned home after three years service and were replaced by a New Zealand squadron . By this time , the need for a regular army SAS regiment had been recognised ; 22 SAS Regiment was formally added to the army list in 1952 and has been based at Hereford since 1960 . In 1959 the third regiment , 23 SAS Regiment , was formed by renaming the Reserve Reconnaissance Unit , which had succeeded MI9 and whose members were experts in escape and evasion . 
 = = = 22 SAS Regiment = = = 
 Since serving in Malaya , men from the regular army 22 SAS Regiment have taken part in covert reconnaissance and surveillance by patrols and some larger scale raiding missions in Borneo . An operation against communist guerillas included the Battle of <unk> in the Oman . They have also taken part in operations in the Aden Emergency , Northern Ireland , and Gambia . Their Special projects team assisted the West German counter @-@ terrorism group GSG 9 at Mogadishu . The SAS counter terrorist wing famously took part in a hostage rescue operation during the Iranian Embassy Siege in London . During the Falklands War B squadron were prepared for Operation Mikado before it was subsequently cancelled whilst D and G squadrons were deployed and participated in the raid on Pebble Island . Operation Flavius was a controversial operation in Gibraltar against the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) . 22 SAS also directed NATO aircraft onto Serb positions and hunted war criminals in Bosnia . They were also involved in the Kosovo War helping KLA guerillas behind Serbian lines . According to Albanian sources one SAS sergeant was killed by Serbian special forces . 
 The Gulf War , in which A , B and D squadrons deployed , was the largest SAS mobilisation since the Second World War , also notable for the failure of the Bravo Two Zero mission . In Sierra Leone it took part in Operation Barras , a hostage rescue operation , to extract members of the Royal Irish Regiment . In the Iraq War , it formed part of Task Force Black and Task Force Knight , with A Squadron 22 SAS being singled out for exceptional service by General Stanley McChrystal , the American commander of NATO forces : during a six @-@ month tour it carried out 175 combat missions . In 2006 , members of the SAS were involved in the operation to free peace activists Norman Kember , James Loney and <unk> Singh <unk> . The three men had been held hostage in Iraq for 118 days during the Christian Peacemaker hostage crisis . Operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan involved soldiers from 21 and 23 SAS Regiments . 
 Various British newspapers have speculated on the SAS involvement in Operation Ellamy and the 2011 Libyan civil war , the Daily Telegraph reports that " defence sources have confirmed that the SAS has been in Libya for several weeks , and played a key role in coordinating the fall of Tripoli . " While The Guardian reports " They have been acting as forward air controllers – directing pilots to targets – and communicating with NATO operational commanders . They have also been advising rebels on tactics . " 
 Members of the Special Air Service were deployed to Northern Iraq in late August 2014 , and according to former MI6 chief Richard Barrett would also be sent to Syria , tasked with trying to track down the Islamic State terrorist group that the press labeled the Beatles . In October 2014 , the SAS began executing raids against ISIS supply lines in western Iraq , using helicopters to drop light vehicles manned by sniper squads . It has been claimed that the SAS have killed up to eight ISIS fighters per day since the raids began . 
 In recent years SAS officers have risen to the highest ranks in the British Army . General Peter de la Billière was the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the British forces in the 1990 Gulf War . General Michael Rose became commander of the United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia in 1994 .

 Following the post @-@ war reconstitution of the Special Air Service , other countries in the Commonwealth recognised their need for similar units . The Canadian Special Air Service Company was formed in 1947 , being disbanded in 1949 . The New Zealand Special Air Service squadron was formed in 1954 to serve with the British SAS in Malaya . Australia formed the 1st SAS Company in July 1957 , which became a full regiment of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment ( SASR ) in August 1964 . On its return from Malaya , the C ( Rhodesian ) Squadron formed the basis for creation of the Rhodesian Special Air Service in 1961 . It retained the name " C Squadron ( Rhodesian ) Special Air Service " within the Rhodesian Security Forces until 1978 , when it became 1 ( Rhodesian ) Special Air Service Regiment . 
 Non @-@ Commonwealth countries have also formed units based on the SAS . The Belgian Army 's Special Forces Group , which wears the same capbadge as the British SAS , traces its ancestry partly from the 5th Special Air Service of the Second World War . The French 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment ( 1er <unk> ) can trace its origins to the Second World War 3rd and 4th SAS , adopting its " who dares wins " motto . The American unit , 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment @-@ Delta , was formed by Colonel Charles Alvin Beckwith , who served with 22 SAS as an exchange officer , and recognised the need for a similar type of unit in the United States Army . The Israeli Sayeret Matkal has also been modelled after the SAS , sharing its motto . Ireland 's Army Ranger Wing ( ARW ) has also modelled its training on that of the SAS , as well as Delta Force ( who in turn have been influenced by the SAS ) . The Philippine National Police 's Special Action Force was formed along the lines of the SAS . 
 = = Organisation = = 
 Little publicly verifiable information exists on the SAS , as the British government does not usually comment on special forces matters due to the nature of their work . The Special Air Service comprises three units : one Regular and two Army Reserve ( AR ) units . The regular army unit is 22 SAS Regiment and the reserve units are 21 Special Air Service Regiment ( Artists ) ( Reserve ) ( 21 SAS ( R ) ) and 23 Special Air Service Regiment ( 23 SAS ( R ) ) , collectively , the Special Air Service ( Reserve ) ( SAS ( R ) ) . 
 = = = Squadrons = = = 
 22 SAS normally has a strength of 400 to 600 . The regiment has four operational squadrons : A , B , D and G. Each squadron consists of approximately 65 men commanded by a major , divided into four troops ( each troop being commanded by a captain ) and a small headquarters section . Troops usually consist of 15 men , and each patrol within a troop consists of four men , with each man possessing a particular skill : signals , demolition , medic or linguist in addition to basic skills learned during the course of his training . The four troops specialise in four different areas : 
 Boat troop – are specialists in maritime skills using scuba diving , kayaks ( canoes ) and Rigid @-@ hulled inflatable boats and often train with the Special Boat Service . 
 Air troop – are experts in free fall parachuting , High Altitude @-@ Low Opening ( HALO ) and High Altitude @-@ High Opening ( <unk> ) techniques . 
 Mobility troop – are specialists in using vehicles and are experts in desert warfare ; they are also trained in an advanced level of motor mechanics to field @-@ repair any vehicular breakdown . 
 Mountain troop – are specialists in Arctic combat and survival , using specialist equipment such as skis , snowshoes and mountain climbing techniques . 
 In 1980 R Squadron ( which has since been renamed L Detachment ) was formed ; its members are all ex @-@ regular SAS regiment soldiers who have a commitment to reserve service .

 The special projects team is the official name for the Special Air Service anti – hijacking counter – terrorism team . It is trained in Close Quarter Battle ( CQB ) and sniper techniques and specialises in hostage rescue in buildings or on public transport . The team was formed in the early 1970s after Prime Minister Edward Heath asked the Ministry of Defence to prepare for any possible terrorist attack similar to the massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics and ordered that the SAS Counter Revolutionary Warfare ( CRW ) wing be raised . 
 Once the wing had been established , each squadron rotated on a continual basis through counter – terrorist training including hostage rescue , siege breaking , and live firing exercises — it has been reported that during CRW training each soldier expends as many as 100 @,@ 000 pistol rounds . Squadrons refresh their training every 16 months , on average . The CRW 's first deployment was during the Balcombe Street Siege . The Metropolitan Police had trapped a PIRA unit ; it surrendered when it heard on the BBC that the SAS were being sent in . 
 The first documented action abroad by the CRW wing was assisting the West German counter @-@ terrorism group GSG 9 at Mogadishu . In 1980 the SAS were involved in a hostage rescue during the Iranian Embassy Siege .

 During Operation <unk> the SAS Reserve were responsible for " mentoring " members of the Afghan National Police .

The report found that the SAS reservists lacked a clearly defined role , and also stated that the reservists lacked the military capability and skillset to serve alongside the regular special <unk> and , on 1 September 2014 , 21 and 23 SAS left United Kingdom Special Forces and were placed under the command of 1st Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade alongside the HAC . 
 = = Recruitment , selection and training = = 
 The regular elements of United Kingdom Special Forces never recruit directly from the general public . All current members of the UK Armed Forces can apply for special forces selection , but historically the majority of candidates have a Commando or Airborne forces background . Selections are held twice yearly , in summer and winter , in <unk> in the Brecon Beacons . Selection lasts for five weeks and normally starts with about 200 potential candidates . On arrival candidates first complete a Personal Fitness Test ( PFT ) and an Annual Fitness Test ( AFT ) . They then march cross country against the clock , increasing the distances covered each day , culminating in what is known as Endurance : a 40 miles ( 64 km ) march with full equipment scaling and descending Pen y Fan in 20 hours . By the end of the hill phase candidates must be able to run 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) in 30 minutes and swim two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) in 90 minutes . 
 Following the hill phase is the jungle phase , taking place in Belize , Brunei , or Malaysia . Candidates are taught navigation , patrol formation and movement , and jungle survival skills . Candidates returning to Hereford finish training in battle plans and foreign weapons and take part in combat survival exercises , the final one being the week @-@ long escape and evasion . Candidates are formed into patrols and , carrying nothing more than a tin can filled with survival equipment , are dressed in old Second World War uniforms and told to head for a point by first light . The final selection test is arguably the most gruelling : resistance to interrogation ( RTI ) , lasting for 36 hours . 
 Typically , 15 – 20 % of candidates make it through the hill phase selection process . From the approximately 200 candidates , most will drop out within the first few days , and by the end about 30 will remain . Those who complete all phases of selection are rewarded with a transfer to an operational squadron .

 The names of those members of the SAS who have died on duty were inscribed on the regimental clock tower at Stirling Lines . Originally funded by contributions of a day 's pay by members of the regiment and a donation from Handley Page in memory of <unk> RK <unk> who was killed in a freefall parachuting accident , this was rebuilt at the new barracks at Credenhill . Those whose names are inscribed are said by surviving members to have " failed to beat the clock " . At the suggestion of the then Commanding Officer , Dare Wilson , inscribed on the base of the clock is a verse from The Golden Road to Samarkand by James Elroy Flecker : 
 We are the Pilgrims , master ; we shall go 
 Always a little further : it may be 
 Beyond that last blue mountain barred with snow 
 Across that angry or that glimmering sea ... 
 The other main memorial is the SAS and Airborne Forces memorial in the cloisters at Westminster Abbey . The SAS Brigade Memorial at <unk> @-@ le @-@ Grand in France commemorates the wartime dead of the Belgian , British , and French SAS and recently a memorial plaque was added to the David Stirling Memorial in Scotland . There are other smaller memorials " scattered throughout Europe and in the Far East " . 
 The local church St Martins has part of its graveyard set aside as an SAS memorial , over twenty SAS soldiers are buried there . There is also a wall of remembrance displaying memorial plaques to some who could not be buried , including the 18 SAS men who lost their lives in the Sea King helicopter crash during the Falklands Campaign on 19 May 1982 .

 = Archaeoastronomy = 
 Archaeoastronomy ( also spelled <unk> ) is the study of how people in the past " have understood the phenomena in the sky , how they used these phenomena and what role the sky played in their cultures . " Clive Ruggles argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient astronomy , as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline , while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures . It is often twinned with <unk> , the anthropological study of <unk> in contemporary societies . Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical astronomy , the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the history of astronomy , which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice . 
 Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology , anthropology , astronomy , statistics and probability , and history . Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources , integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long @-@ term difficulty for archaeoastronomers . Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology . Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature , such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture . Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements . 
 Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods . The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture ; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs . It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as : " ... [ A ] field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other . " 
 = = History of archaeoastronomy = = 
 In his short history of ' Astro @-@ archaeology ' John Michell argued that the status of research into ancient astronomy had improved over the past two centuries , going ' from lunacy to heresy to interesting notion and finally to the gates of orthodoxy . ' Nearly two decades later , we can still ask the question : Is archaeoastronomy still waiting at the gates of orthodoxy or has it gotten inside the gates ? 
 Two hundred years before Michell wrote the above , there were no archaeoastronomers and there were no professional archaeologists , but there were astronomers and antiquarians . Some of their works are considered precursors of archaeoastronomy ; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as William Stukeley did of Stonehenge in 1740 , while John Aubrey in 1678 and Henry Chauncy in 1700 sought similar astronomical principles underlying the orientation of churches . Late in the nineteenth century astronomers such as Richard Proctor and Charles Piazzi Smyth investigated the astronomical orientations of the pyramids . 
 The term archaeoastronomy was first used by Elizabeth Chesley <unk> ( at the suggestion of Euan MacKie ) in 1973 , but as a topic of study it may be much older , depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined . Clive Ruggles says that Heinrich Nissen , working in the mid @-@ nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer . Rolf Sinclair says that Norman Lockyer , working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , could be called the ' father of archaeoastronomy . ' Euan MacKie would place the origin even later , stating : " ... the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of Alexander Thom in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s . " 
 In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer Gerald Hawkins , who proposed that Stonehenge was a Neolithic computer , inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites . The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed , but this was not the case for Alexander Thom 's work , whose survey results of megalithic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles . Euan MacKie , recognizing that Thom 's theories needed to be tested , excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter 's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct . There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom 's long alignment hypothesis ( Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site ) led him to check Thom 's geometrical theories at the <unk> stone circle in Islay , also with a positive result . MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom 's conclusions and published new <unk> of Britain . In contrast a re @-@ evaluation of Thom 's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom 's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence . Nevertheless , Thom 's legacy remains strong , Krupp wrote in 1979 , " Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for <unk> @-@ astronomical fieldwork and interpretation , and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades . " His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy . 
 The approach in the New World , where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in Amerindian civilizations , was markedly different . They had access to sources that the prehistory of Europe lacks such as <unk> and the historical records of the early colonizers . Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni , this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation . The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe . 
 This came to a head at a meeting sponsored by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) in Oxford in 1981 . The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes . Nevertheless , the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world . The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the <unk> of archaeological research , which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today , rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies , archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky . 
 = = Relations to other disciplines = = 
 ... [ O ] ne of the most endearing characteristics of archaeoastronomy is its capacity to set academics in different disciplines at loggerheads with each other . 
 Archaeoastronomy has long been seen as an interdisciplinary field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures . As such , it can be seen as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy : <unk> ( an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes ) , history of astronomy ( which deals primarily with the written textual evidence ) , and <unk> ( which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies ) . 
 Reflecting Archaeoastronomy 's development as an interdisciplinary subject , research in the field is conducted by investigators trained in a wide range of disciplines . Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology ; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods , the history of science and the history of religion ; and with the relation of astronomy to art , literature and religion . Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical , and then only as a secondary category . 
 Both practicing archaeoastronomers and observers of the discipline approach it from different perspectives . George <unk> and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy as part of an archaeology informed by cultural anthropology and aimed at understanding a " group 's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens ' , in a word , its cosmology . Todd Bostwick argued that " archaeoastronomy is anthropology – the study of human behavior in the past and present . " Paul Bahn has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology . Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science , either as it relates to a culture 's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations or as it relates to the political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques . Art historian Richard <unk> took a more flexible approach , maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing " the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism " Astronomers , however , raise different questions , seeking to provide their students with identifiable precursors of their discipline , and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are , indeed , intentionally astronomical . 
 The reactions of professional archaeologists to archaeoastronomy have been decidedly mixed . Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility , varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream of what they saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers . Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from archaeoastronomy into archaeology textbooks and , as mentioned above , some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics . 
 Since archaeoastronomers disagree so widely on the characterization of the discipline , they even dispute its name . All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy to the study of culture , using the term Astronomy in Culture or a translation . Michael Hoskin sees an important part of the discipline as fact @-@ collecting , rather than theorizing , and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline <unk> . Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies . Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term , what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish <unk> . 
 When debates polarise between techniques , the methods are often referred to by a colour code , based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference , where the approaches were first distinguished . Green ( Old World ) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice . Brown ( New World ) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and have been described as ' cavalier ' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis . Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s . 
 = = Methodology = = 
 For a long time I have believed that such diversity requires the invention of some all @-@ embracing theory . I think I was very naïve in thinking that such a thing was ever possible . 
 There is no one way to do Archaeoastronomy . The divisions between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists . Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher . In the Old World , there is little data but the sites themselves ; in the New World , the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data . The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today . Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches , though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories . 
 = = = Green archaeoastronomy = = = 
 Green Archaeoastronomy is named after the cover of the book Archaeoastronomy in the Old World . It is based primarily on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period . The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites . 
 Thom wished to examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high @-@ accuracy astronomy . He believed that by using horizon astronomy , observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day . The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon . A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun , but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re @-@ emerge on the other side for a ' double sunset ' . The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site , one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice , which has a double sunset . 
 To test this idea he surveyed hundreds of stone rows and circles . Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance , but he planned to show that together the distribution of alignments was non @-@ random , showing that there was an astronomical intent to the orientation of at least some of the alignments . His results indicated the existence of eight , sixteen , or perhaps even thirty @-@ two approximately equal divisions of the year . The two solstices , the two equinoxes and four cross @-@ quarter days , days half @-@ way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar . While not all these conclusions have been accepted , it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy , especially in Europe . 
 Euan MacKie has supported Thom 's analysis , to which he added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period . To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland . Kintraw is a site notable for its four @-@ meter high standing stone . Thom proposed that this was a foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn <unk> and Beinn o <unk> on Jura . This , Thom argued , was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter . However , from ground level , this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape , and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters : another observation platform was needed . This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones . The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the <unk> analysis was inconclusive , but further research at Maes Howe and on the Bush Barrow <unk> led MacKie to conclude that while the term ' science ' may be anachronistic , Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high @-@ accuracy alignments . 
 In contrast Clive Ruggles has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom 's surveys . Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon . A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times , its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested , which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past . Keith <unk> wrote : " To put it bluntly , in many cases it doesn 't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn ’ t inform the current interpretive questions . " Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research , especially in Europe . 
 = = = Brown archaeoastronomy = = = 
 In contrast to the largely alignment @-@ oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy , Brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the history of astronomy or to cultural history , insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual . The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas . 
 One famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is Chichen Itza . Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular , archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates . One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet Venus . This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus 's appearances in the sky . These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or <unk> . Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza . 
 The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or <unk> . This means that the building 's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky ( when it coincides with the rainy season ) may be meaningful . Aveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of <unk> , and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol . This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions . The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus . Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building 's upper platform were painted black and red . These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star . However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots , making them poor at letting light in , but providing a suitable place to view out . 
 Aveni states that one of the strengths of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example . The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco . Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance , However , ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year . In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record . This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which , in China , stretches back into the Han dynasty , in the second century BC . 
 A criticism of this method is that it can be statistically weak . Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are . Because of the wide variety of evidence , which can include artefacts as well as sites , there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy . Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation . Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field , whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically . Studies are more likely to be considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy . 
 = = Source materials = = 
 Because archaeoastronomy is about the many and various ways people interacted with the sky , there are a diverse range of sources giving information about astronomical practices . 
 = = = Alignments = = = 
 A common source of data for archaeoastronomy is the study of alignments . This is based on the assumption that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target . Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources , while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance , usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites . 
 An alignment is calculated by measuring the azimuth , the angle from north , of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass . A compass is easier to use , though the deviation of the Earth 's magnetic field from true north , known as its magnetic declination must be taken into account . Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference , such as sites being supported by scaffolding . Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree . 
 A theodolite can be considerably more accurate if used correctly , but it is also considerably more difficult to use correctly . There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation , usually the position of the Sun . Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth 's rotation , the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known , or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements . Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a <unk> . 
 = = = Artifacts = = = 
 For artifacts such as the Sky Disc of Nebra , alleged to be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos , the analysis would be similar to typical post @-@ excavation analysis as used in other sub @-@ disciplines in archaeology . An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples . The more parallels that can be found , the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists . 
 A more mundane example is the presence of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire . The use of shoes and sandals is well known , but Carol van Driel @-@ Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings . This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time . 
 Another well @-@ known artefact with an astronomical use is the Antikythera mechanism . In this case analysis of the artefact , and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero , would indicate a plausible use for the device . The argument is bolstered by the presence of symbols on the mechanism , allowing the disc to be read . 
 = = = Art and inscriptions = = = 
 Art and inscriptions may not be confined to artefacts , but also appear painted or inscribed on an archaeological site . Sometimes inscriptions are helpful enough to give instructions to a site 's use . For example , a Greek inscription on a stele ( from <unk> ) has been translated as : " Patron set this up for Zeus <unk> . Winter solstice . Should anyone wish to know : off ‘ the little pig ’ and the stele the sun turns . " From Mesoamerica come Mayan and Aztec codices . These are folding books made from <unk> , processed tree bark on which are glyphs in Mayan or Aztec script . The Dresden codex contains information regarding the Venus cycle , confirming its importance to the Mayans . 
 More problematic are those cases where the movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs . A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph . The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year . At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral ; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it . It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events . Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico . It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices . The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon , New Mexico , stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles : summer solstice , winter solstice , equinox , and the major and minor lunar <unk> of the moon ’ s 18 @.@ 6 year cycle . In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte , there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices , equinox and solar noon . Numerous buildings and <unk> alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site . 
 If no ethnographic nor historical data are found which can support this assertion then acceptance of the idea relies upon whether or not there are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance . It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples . This allows <unk> to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 As well as the materials left by peoples themselves , there are also the reports of other who have encountered them . The historical records of the Conquistadores are a rich source of information about the pre @-@ Columbian Americans . Ethnographers also provide material about many other peoples . 
 Aveni uses the importance of zenith passages as an example of the importance of ethnography . For peoples living between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn there are two days of the year when the noon Sun passes directly overhead and casts no shadow . In parts of Mesoamerica this was considered a significant day as it would herald the arrival of rains , and so play a part in the cycle of agriculture . This knowledge is still considered important amongst Mayan Indians living in Central America today . The ethnographic records suggested to archaeoastronomers that this day may have been important to the ancient Mayans . There are also shafts known as ' zenith tubes ' which illuminate subterranean rooms when the sun passes overhead found at places like Monte <unk> and <unk> . It is only through the ethnography that we can speculate that the timing of the illumination was considered important in Mayan society . Alignments to the sunrise and sunset on the day of the zenith passage have been claimed to exist at several sites . However , it has been shown that , since there are very few orientations that can be related to these phenomena , they likely have different explanations . 
 <unk> also caution against over @-@ interpretation of sites . At a site in Chaco Canyon can be found a pictograph with a star , crescent and hand . It has been argued by some astronomers that this is a record of the 1054 Supernova . However recent <unk> of related ' supernova petroglyphs ' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other <unk> . The Zuni people , who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco , marked their sun @-@ watching station with a crescent , star , hand and <unk> , similar to those found at the Chaco site . 
 <unk> is also an important field outside of the Americas . For example , anthropological work with Aboriginal Australians is producing much information about their Indigenous astronomies and about their interaction with the modern world . 
 = = Recreating the ancient sky = = 
 ... [ A ] lthough different ways to do science and different scientific results do arise in different cultures , this provides little support for those who would use such differences to question the sciences ' ability to provide reliable statements about the world in which we live . 
 Once the researcher has data to test , it is often necessary to attempt to recreate ancient sky conditions to place the data in its historical environment . 
 = = = Declination = = = 
 To calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed . The stars provide such a system . If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole . This point is + 90 ° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or − 90 ° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole . The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude , known as declination . The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West ( if the horizon is flat ) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0 ° . The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe . Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night ( see diagram below ) . Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction . 
 = = = Solar positioning = = = 
 While the stars are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not . The rising point of the Sun varies throughout the year . It swings between two limits marked by the solstices a bit like a pendulum , slowing as it reaches the extremes , but passing rapidly through the midpoint . If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of + 23 @.@ 5 ° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice . For more information see History of solar observation . 
 = = = Lunar positioning = = = 
 The Moon 's appearance is considerably more complex . Its motion , like the Sun , is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than solstices . However , its travel between lunistices is considerably faster . It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle rather than the year @-@ long trek of the Sun . This is further complicated as the lunistices marking the limits of the Moon 's movement move on an 18 @.@ 6 year cycle . For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise . For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise . However , much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon . The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle , the <unk> month . Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon . See Moon for more details . 
 = = = Stellar positioning = = = 
 Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars . On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other . Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth 's rotation about its axis . However , the Earth spins rather like a spinning top . Not only does the Earth rotate , it wobbles . The Earth 's axis takes around 25 @,@ 800 years to complete one full wobble . The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today . Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now . In the case of the Egyptian pyramids , it has been shown they were aligned towards <unk> , a faint star in the constellation of Draco . The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time , historically speaking . For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn . In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes . 
 = = = Transient phenomena = = = 
 Additionally there are often transient phenomena , events which do not happen on an annual cycle . Most predictable are events like eclipses . In the case of solar eclipses these can be used to date events in the past . A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians , which following the eclipse failed to happen , to 28 May , 585 BC . Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated . 
 Some comets are predictable , most famously Halley 's Comet . Yet as a class of object they remain unpredictable and can appear at any time . Some have extremely lengthy orbital periods which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted . Others may have only ever passed through the Solar System once and so are inherently unpredictable . 
 Meteor showers should be predictable , but some meteors are cometary debris and so require calculations of orbits which are currently impossible to complete . Other events noted by ancients include aurorae , sun dogs and rainbows all of which are as impossible to predict as the ancient weather , but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena . 
 = = Major topics of archaeoastronomical research = = 
 What has astronomy brought into the lives of cultural groups throughout history ? The answers are many and varied ... 
 = = = The use of calendars = = = 
 A common justification for the need for astronomy is the need to develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons . Ancient texts like Hesiod 's Works and Days , an ancient farming manual , would appear to contradict this . Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs , such as bird migrations to determine the seasons . <unk> work with the <unk> of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times in some parts of the world . All the same , calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities . 
 An example of a non @-@ agricultural calendar is the <unk> 'in calendar of the Maya civilization of pre @-@ Columbian Mesoamerica , which is a cycle of 260 days . This count is based on an earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica . This formed part of a more comprehensive system of Maya calendars which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles . 
 Other peculiar calendars include ancient Greek calendars . These were nominally lunar , starting with the New Moon . In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ton <unk> , by the moon . The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of <unk> events such as games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism may have been used as a politically neutral form of timekeeping . Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity 's name day , festivities , and special events . 
 = = = Myth and cosmology = = = 
 Another motive for studying the sky is to understand and explain the universe . In these cultures myth was a tool for achieving this and the explanations , while not reflecting the standards of modern science , are cosmologies . 
 The Incas arranged their empire to demonstrate their cosmology . The capital , Cusco , was at the centre of the empire and connected to it by means of ceques , conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre . These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four <unk> , which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco . The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the Andes . Gary <unk> , who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of <unk> , has connected this quartering with the appearance of the Milky Way in the night sky . In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a perpendicular fashion . 
 The importance of observing cosmological factors is also seen on the other side of the world . The Forbidden City in Beijing is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions . The Chinese system was composed of five directions : North , South , East , West and Centre . The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing . One approaches the Emperor from the south , thus placing him in front of the circumpolar stars . This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor . The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as feng shui . 
 There is also much information about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations . The <unk> of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars . When their constellation of the Caterpillar @-@ Jaguar ( roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius ) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees . The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce . 
 A more well @-@ known source of constellation myth are the texts of the Greeks and Romans . The origin of their constellations remains a matter of vigorous and occasionally fractious debate . 
 The loss of one of the sisters , Merope , in some Greek myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades disappeared from view by the naked eye . 
 Giorgio de Santillana , professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , along with Hertha von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial cosmology clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission . The chaos , monsters and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age . They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost with the rise of the Greco @-@ Roman civilization . Santillana and von Dechend in their book Hamlet 's Mill , An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time ( 1969 ) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena , especially the precession of the equinoxes . Santillana and von Dechend 's approach is not widely accepted . 
 = = = Displays of power = = = 
 By including celestial motifs in clothing it becomes possible for the wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn from above . It has been said that the Shield of Achilles described by Homer is also a catalogue of constellations . In North America shields depicted in Comanche petroglyphs appear to include Venus symbolism . 
 <unk> alignments also can be seen as displays of power . When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun ( the mythical origin place of the Sun ) in Lake Titicaca , the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge . The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite . Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers . 
 In Egypt the temple of Amun @-@ Re at Karnak has been the subject of much study . Evaluation of the site , taking into account the change over time of the obliquity of the ecliptic show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun . The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year . 
 In a later period the Serapeum in Alexandria was also said to have contained a solar alignment so that , on a specific sunrise , a shaft of light would pass across the lips of the statue of Serapis thus symbolising the Sun saluting the god . 
 = = Major sites of archaeoastronomical interest = = 
 Clive Ruggles and Michel <unk> recently edited a book on heritage sites of astronomy and archaeoastronomy that provides a list of the main sites around the world . 
 At Stonehenge in England and at Carnac in France , in Egypt and Yucatán , across the whole face of the earth , are found mysterious ruins of ancient monuments , monuments with astronomical significance ... They mark the same kind of commitment that transported us to the moon and our spacecraft to the surface of Mars . 
 = = = Newgrange = = = 
 Newgrange is a passage tomb in the Republic of Ireland dating from around 3 @,@ 300 to 2 @,@ 900 BC For a few days around the Winter Solstice light shines along the central passageway into the heart of the tomb . What makes this notable is not that light shines in the passageway , but that it does not do so through the main entrance . Instead it enters via a hollow box above the main doorway discovered by Michael O 'Kelly . It is this <unk> which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind . Clive Ruggles notes : 
 ... [ F ] ew people - archaeologists or <unk> have doubted that a powerful astronomical symbolism was deliberately incorporated into the monument , demonstrating that a connection between astronomy and funerary ritual , at the very least , merits further investigation . 
 = = = Egypt = = = 
 Since the first modern measurements of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie , various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations . It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough / Big Dipper which was known to Egyptians as the thigh . It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a plumb bob was used to ascertain where north lay . The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction . 
 Some have argued that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion , although this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers . The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular <unk> which occurs at the summer solstice , when the sun , viewed from the Sphinx terrace , forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet , which was also the name of the Great Pyramid . Further , the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis , as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner . 
 The astronomical ceiling of the tomb of Senenmut ( ca 1470 BC ) contains the Celestial Diagram depicting circumpolar constellations in the form of discs . Each disc is divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24 @-@ hour time period . Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt . The observation of lunar cycles is also evident . 
 = = = El Castillo = = = 
 El Castillo , also known as <unk> 's Pyramid , is a Mesoamerican step @-@ pyramid built in the centre of Mayan center of Chichen Itza in Mexico . Several architectural features have suggested astronomical elements . Each of the stairways built into the sides of the pyramid has 91 steps . Along with the extra one for the platform at the top , this totals 365 steps , which is possibly one for each day of the year ( 365 @.@ 25 ) or the number of lunar orbits in 10 @,@ 000 rotations ( 365 @.@ 01 ) . 
 A visually striking effect is seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs on the equinoxes . A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade of the northern stairway . The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway , with its head at the base in light . Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May , traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season . 
 = = = Stonehenge = = = 
 Many astronomical alignments have been claimed for Stonehenge , a complex of megaliths and earthworks in the Salisbury Plain of England . The most famous of these is the midsummer alignment , where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone . However , this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment , where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge , is the more significant alignment , and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography . 
 As well as solar alignments , there are proposed lunar alignments . The four station stones mark out a rectangle . The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset . The long sides if viewed towards the south @-@ east , face the most southerly rising of the moon . Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received . The Heel Stone azimuth is one @-@ seventh of circumference , matching the latitude of Avebury , while summer solstice sunrise azimuth is no longer equal to the construction era direction . 
 = = = Maeshowe = = = 
 This is an architecturally outstanding Neolithic chambered tomb on the Mainland of Orkney , Scotland – probably dating to the early 3rd millennium BC , and where the setting sun at midwinter shines down the entrance passage into the central chamber ( see Newgrange ) . In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment . Several new aspects of the site were discovered . In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island Hoy , about 10 miles away . Secondly , it consists of two straight lengths , angled at a few degrees to each other . Thirdly , the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy . Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill , just before it dips down to the notch between it at <unk> to the right . This indicated line points to sunset on the first <unk> of the solar year ( according to A. Thom ) before and after the winter solstice and the notch at the base of the right slope of the Hill is at the same declination . Fourthly a similar ' double sunset ' phenomenon is seen at the right end of <unk> , also on Hoy ; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice , at the beginning of November and February respectively – the Old Celtic festivals of Samhain and <unk> . This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines . Maeshowe is thus an extremely sophisticated calendar site which must have been positioned carefully in order to use the horizon <unk> in the ways described . 
 = = = Uxmal = = = 
 Uxmal is a Mayan city in the Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula , Mexico . The Governor 's Palace at Uxmal is often used as an exemplar of why it is important to combine ethnographic and alignment data . The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118 ° on the pyramid of <unk> . This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and , with a much greater precision , to the northernmost setting of Venus ; both phenomena occur once every eight years . By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events . The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun , Moon , other planets , Sirius et cetera ? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus , it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations . Moreover , the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May , coinciding with the onset of the rainy season . The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac , most likely referring to the <unk> of these phenomena , support the west @-@ working orientation scheme . 
 = = = Chaco Canyon = = = 
 In Chaco Canyon , the center of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest , numerous solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented . These findings date to the 1977 discovery of the Sun Dagger site by Anna Sofaer . Three large stone slabs leaning against a cliff channel light and shadow markings onto two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall , marking the solstices , equinoxes and the lunar <unk> of the 18 @.@ 6 year cycle of the moon . Subsequent research by the Solstice Project and others demonstrated that numerous building and <unk> alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon are oriented to solar , lunar and cardinal directions . In addition , research shows that the Great North Road , a thirty @-@ five mile engineered “ road ” , was constructed not for utilitarian purposes but rather to connect the ceremonial center of Chaco Canyon with the direction north . 
 = = = Lascaux Cave = = = 
 In recent years , new research has suggested that the Lascaux cave paintings in France may incorporate prehistoric star charts . Michael <unk> of the University of Munich argues that some of the non @-@ figurative dot clusters and dots within some of the figurative images correlate with the constellations of Taurus , the Pleiades and the grouping known as the " Summer Triangle " . Based on her own study of the astronomical significance of Bronze Age petroglyphs in the Vallée des <unk> and her extensive survey of other prehistoric cave painting sites in the region — most of which appear to have been selected because the interiors are illuminated by the setting sun on the day of the winter solstice — French researcher Chantal <unk> @-@ <unk> has further proposed that the gallery of figurative images in the Great Hall represents an extensive star map and that key points on major figures in the group correspond to stars in the main constellations as they appeared in the Paleolithic . <unk> phylogenetics to myths of the Cosmic Hunt , Julien d <unk> suggested that the palaeolithic version of this story could be the following : there is an animal that is a horned herbivore , especially an elk . One human pursues this ungulate . The hunt locates or get to the sky . The animal is alive when it is transformed into a constellation . It forms the Big Dipper . This story may be represented in the famous Lascaux shaft ‘ scene ’ 
 = = Fringe archaeoastronomy = = 
 At least now we have all the archaeological facts to go along with the astronomers , the Druids , the Flat <unk> and all the rest . 
 Archaeoastronomy owes something of this poor reputation among scholars to its occasional misuse to advance a range of pseudo @-@ historical accounts . During the 1930s , Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled <unk> <unk> , or " Teutonic <unk> " . The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the Ancient Near East in the field of astronomy , demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the " Aryans " ( Indo @-@ Europeans ) over the Semites . 
 Since the 19th century , numerous scholars have sought to use archaeoastronomical calculations to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture , computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BCE . David Pingree , a historian of Indian astronomy , condemned " the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers . " 
 More recently Gallagher , Pyle , and Fell interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as a description in Celtic Ogham alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site . The controversial translation was supposedly validated by a problematic archaeoastronomical indication in which the winter solstice sun shone on an inscription of the sun at the site . Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness , as well as its linguistic and <unk> claims , to describe it as an example of " cult archaeology " . 
 Archaeoastronomy is sometimes related to the fringe discipline of <unk> , when its followers attempt to find underlying mathematical orders beneath the proportions , size , and placement of archaeoastronomical sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramid of <unk> at Chichen Itza . 
 = = <unk> organisations and publications = = 
 There are currently three academic organisations for scholars of archaeoastronomy . ISAAC — the International Society for Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture — was founded in 1995 and now sponsors the Oxford conferences and Archaeoastronomy — the Journal of Astronomy in Culture .

SEAC holds annual conferences in Europe and publishes refereed conference proceedings on an annual basis . There is also <unk> — La Sociedad Interamericana de <unk> en la Cultura , primarily a Latin American organisation which was founded in 2003 . Two new organisations focused on regional archaeoastronomy were founded in 2013 : ASIA - the Australian Society for Indigenous Astronomy in Australia and SMART - the Society of Māori Astronomy Research and Traditions in New Zealand .

 = Return of Saturn = 
 Return of Saturn is the fourth studio album by the American rock band No Doubt , released on April 11 , 2000 by Interscope Records . It marked the band 's first album as a quartet , following the departure of original keyboardist Eric Stefani in 1994 . After touring for two and a half years to promote their breakthrough third studio album , Tragic Kingdom , No Doubt wrote several dozen songs for its follow @-@ up and eventually settled on working with producer Glen Ballard . Creating the album became a tumultuous process lasting two years , during which there was dissension among band members and between the band and its label . The album was completed after the band returned to the studio and recorded what became two of the album 's singles . 
 The album maintains the ska punk and reggae influences of the band 's previous work , but with slower , more ballad @-@ like songs . The lyrics to many of the songs describe singer Gwen Stefani 's pining for a more domestic life , contrasting that with her commitment to a music career . 
 Upon release , Return of Saturn received favorable reviews from music critics , although several of them were divided over its different sound to its predecessor . It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 but was unable to measure up to the sales of Tragic Kingdom . The album produced four singles , only one of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 . At the 43rd Grammy Awards , Return of Saturn was nominated for Best Rock Album . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the success of No Doubt 's breakthrough album Tragic Kingdom ( 1995 ) , the band wrote more than twenty songs for a new album , influenced by artists such as The Cure . Having toured extensively for two and a half years since the release of Tragic Kingdom , they initially had trouble producing material and decided to experiment with new sounds . Many of the songs were written in a rented house in Hollywood Hills , Los Angeles , California , where bassist Tony Kanal was living . During early production in mid @-@ 1998 the band worked on seven tracks in Los Angeles with Matthew Wilder , who had produced Tragic Kingdom , but had creative differences with him . They planned on going to New York to work with producer Michael Beinhorn , who had produced for alternative rock acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers , Hole , and Soundgarden . 
 When scheduling conflicts arose with Beinhorn , the band interviewed several producers and decided on Glen Ballard , who had produced Alanis Morissette 's Jagged Little Pill ( 1995 ) , because of pressure from manager Jimmy Iovine and Ballard 's belief in not using heavy production techniques . Ballard went through the band 's forty demos and ruled out half of them . They frequently missed due dates , arguing that hurrying the album to cash in on the success of Tragic Kingdom was unwise since three years had passed . In early 1999 , No Doubt released " New " , co @-@ produced by Talking Heads member Jerry Harrison , for the soundtrack to the 1999 film Go . 
 By that July , the band stopped work on the album , intending to be done with the record . Interscope , however , recommended that they continue writing so they would have a more marketable single . The band was split when singer Gwen Stefani offered to do so but drummer Adrian Young and guitarist Tom Dumont did not want to , hesitant to trust Interscope after it had <unk> Tragic Kingdom to Trauma Records . After a brief break , Dumont sent Stefani some of his demos as a peace offering . The band returned to the studio to create more upbeat songs and penned " Ex @-@ Girlfriend " and " Simple Kind of Life " . More recording , audio mixing and audio mastering were done late that year , and David LaChapelle photographed the band for the album cover in January 2000 . 
 The album 's working title was originally announced as Magic 's in the Makeup in May 1998 and later as Saturn Returns in November 1999 . Stefani was confused by her feelings of depression and interest in Sylvia Plath while recording the album . Her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale told her that she was going through her Saturn return . Saturn 's orbit takes 29 @.@ 4 Earth years and , in astrology , the time when Saturn returns to its position during a person 's birth is believed to be a period of self @-@ evaluation . Stefani was born October 3 , 1969 , and many of the songs were written during her Saturn return . 
 = = Composition = = 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music of Return of Saturn further explores No Doubt 's new wave influences , while adding an alternative rock feel and maintaining some of the band 's ska and reggae sounds . Adrian Young 's drum part on " Simple Kind of Life " was mixed through low fidelity filters to give it the sound of a lo @-@ fi power ballad . " Six Feet Under " and " Staring Problem " were described as a more self @-@ aware return to the band 's earlier material , a combination of work by New Wave band Missing Persons and hard rock band Van Halen . 
 No Doubt experiments with several new styles on the album . " Ex @-@ Girlfriend " , which originally featured a Prince @-@ style funk sound , was rewritten and includes rapped vocals over piano and flamenco guitar parts . After opening with Gabrial McNair 's jazz funeral horn part over Young 's beatboxing , " Bathwater " proceeds into a song written in swing time . It was described as a combination of the band 's 2 Tone roots with the operatic slapstick of Gilbert and Sullivan . " Marry Me " features use of the tabla , a pair of tuned hand drums prominent in India . Young and bassist Tony Kanal 's contributions were compared to the rhythm of nu metal music , and the fragmented progression of " Comforting Lie " was likened to the work of Korn . 
 = = = Lyrics = = = 
 The album 's lyrics depict Stefani 's maturation and femininity , reflected by images of oral contraceptives , a wedding cake and makeup on the album cover , as well as her romantic relationship with Rossdale . Her lyrics drew comparisons to the bitter , confessional styling of Hole frontwoman Courtney Love . " New " was written while the band was touring about the excitement of meeting Rossdale and her infatuation with him . Later compositions , however , discuss the problems that the two had maintaining a long @-@ distance relationship . " Ex @-@ Girlfriend " discusses a failing relationship , and " Suspension Without Suspense " and " Home Now " detail feelings of resentment , loneliness , and indecision . On " Simple Kind of Life " , she confesses to hoping for a mistake with her birth control and a desire to leaving music for a domestic life . She contrasts this , however , with her need for independence : 
 Anyone who knows me knows having a family has always been the most important thing to me . I wanted to be a mother — which is an unconditional giving of love — and a supportive wife , and suddenly , I can 't even be a good girlfriend , because I can 't seem to find the right time to call . I want to do it all , but I can only do one thing good , and right now I 've chosen to do this . Being in a band is a bit of a selfish choice .

 Did anyone else see the conclusion of the case ahead of time ? I was at a total loss . I had written off the baby 's mother as soon as they spoke with her . No many shows are able to do that . I can almost always narrow it down to at least two and one of them would be right . I was so far off the mark on with this and I loved it ! I love when a show can surprise me . 
 Like TV Fanatic 's Christina Orlando , Pavlica commented on Bud adding that he was a " real joy to watch " saying he said the " craziest things " , adding that he is the shows " funny guy " .

As the grand opening progresses , things begin to fall apart . Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone , resulting in a reprimand from Nellie . Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away , fearing their age will frighten the youth .

Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother and half @-@ apologizes to him and Pam . After Kelly begins physically harassing Toby , Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up , resulting in his other eye being blackened .

 The episode received mostly mixed reviews from critics . Myles McNutt from The A.V.

" However , McNutt appreciated Jim 's presentation , noting that " the final presentation was a pretty decent setpiece . " What Culture ! reviewer Joseph Kratzer awarded the episode three out of five stars , noting that the episode fell victim to " the overall lack of focus and believability that has plagued The Office all season . " Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten , noting that " The Office continues to get the comedy boost it needs from the Florida storyline . " Hyatt called the scene featuring Dwight and Jim imitating Kelly and Ryan 's mom as " one of my favorite moments of the season so far .

" 
 Many reviews were critical of the Scranton sub @-@ plot . McNutt wrote that , " Andy getting hit by a girl plays into the most weak , infantile parts of his character , and making Pam his accomplice was a complete non @-@ starter . " Kratzer wrote , " Don ’ t get me wrong , the idea of Andy getting punched in the face by a female fifth grader isn ’ t necessarily unbelievable or unfunny , it ’ s just that it had so little relevance or realism that it was difficult to follow for more than five minutes and it constituted an entire plot line .

 In an interview , Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin revealed that the song was written in mid @-@ 2004 and was inspired by Martin 's daughter , Apple , and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush : " That 's a song where we were listening to a lot of Kate Bush last summer , and we wanted a song which had a lot of tom @-@ toms in it . I just had my daughter up also , and was kind of feeling in a sense of awe and wonderment , so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles . " The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush 's 1985 song " Running Up that Hill " . In a separate interview , bassist Guy Berryman , in discussion of " Speed of Sound " , said : " We were listening to a Kate Bush song called ' Running Up that Hill ' and we were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song , and the chords . Some bands are reluctant to admit that they take things from other artists and bands that they listen to and we 're shameless in that respect , we don 't mind telling . " 
 The band 's opinion towards the song , however , has soured . Martin has said that he dislikes " Speed of Sound " , saying in a 2011 interview , " We never got it right . " During an interview with Howard Stern , Martin said that his dislike of " Speed of Sound " stems from the song having " a shit recording . " Due to this , Martin is reluctant to perform the song live , citing his feelings towards the song , noting that " an audience can pick up real fast if you ’ re not convinced by something . "

 " Speed of Sound " is a piano @-@ based song .

The song is written in the key of A Mixolydian . 
 The lyrics in the song are cryptic ; the ending lines of the third verse emphasise in belief and faith : " If you could see it then you 'd understand / ah , when you see it then you 'll understand , " and " Some things you have to believe / others are puzzles puzzling me . " The fourth line in the second verse alludes to discovering your place in the world : " How long am I gonna stand / with my head stuck under the sand . " 
 In his review of X & Y , Bill White of the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer newspaper noted that the " slowing ... creative juices " evident in " Speed of Sound " compare to " melodies from both Jeff Buckley ( ' Last Goodbye ' ) and Keane ( ' Everybody 's Changing ' ) " .

 The song was met with a polarised response from critics upon its release . PopMatters felt that the song " comes close to sounding too safe , almost like the band is on autopilot . " MusicOMH commented that " Speed Of Sound , the lead single , has ' Clocks ' -like drumming contrasts with synth sequences that remind more of Enya than rock music " and criticised it for sounding " familiar and far older than it is . " Pitchfork Media likewise criticised the song 's " uncanny resemblance to ' Clocks ' " and continued " Certainly , it rarely hurts to stick with what works , but this is not just a near @-@ exact replica of its successful predecessor ; it 's also a less memorable song riding a piano hook that has so deeply infiltrated the pop @-@ culture landscape that I 've become numb to it . " The reviewer did , however , comment that " the track 's vocal melody outperforms the one from ' Clocks ' by a hair . " 
 The Village Voice felt that the song was " unusually accomplished , fresh , and emotional . " Paste Magazine praised the song , saying that it " reveals the hand [ Coldplay are ] playing : a piano riff as memorable as the one in ' Clocks , ' ringing guitars , martial drums , orchestral pomp and , in the center , Chris Martin 's keening vocal , so vulnerable and yet forceful enough to stand out from the mass of sonic detail . " The New York Times , <unk> , <unk> X & Y for " trying to carry beauty of ' Clocks ' across an entire album – not least in its first single , ' Speed of Sound , ' which isn 't the only song on the album to borrow the ' Clocks ' drumbeat . " Rolling Stone magazine gave a mixed review , calling it " an appealing but not thrilling song " and noted " ... it sounds a bit like ... " Clocks " but without the swagger . "
