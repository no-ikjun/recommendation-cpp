 The Canadian cartoonist James Llewellyn " Jimmy " Frise ( / <unk> / , 16 October 1891 – 13 June 1948 ) is best known for his work on the comic strip Birdseye Center and his illustrations of humorous prose pieces by Greg Clark . 
 Born in Scugog Island , Ontario , Frise moved to Toronto at 19 and found illustration work on the Toronto Star 's Star Weekly supplement . His left hand was severely injured at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 during World War I , but his drawing hand was unhurt , and he continued cartooning at the Star upon his return . In 1919 he began his first weekly comic strip , Life 's Little Comedies , which evolved into the rural @-@ centred humorous Birdseye Center in 1923 . He moved to the Montreal Standard in 1947 , but as the Star kept publication rights to Birdseye Center , Frise continued it as Juniper Junction with strongly similar characters and situations . Doug Wright took over the strip after Frise 's sudden death from a heart attack in 1948 , and it went on to become the longest @-@ running strip in English @-@ Canadian comics history . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 James Llewellyn Frise was born 16 October 1891 near Fingerboard in Scugog Island , Ontario , the only son of John Frise ( d . 1922 ) , who was a farmer , and Hannah née Barker ( d . 1933 ) , who had immigrated with her family from England to Port Perry when she was two . He grew up in Seagrave and Myrtle and went to school in Port Perry . There he struggled with spelling — even with his own middle name — and developed an obsession with drawing . 
 Throughout his teens , friends and teachers encouraged Frise to move to Toronto to pursue a drawing career . In 1910 he moved there , though without aiming to develop his art — rather he sought work and found it as an engraver and printer at the Rolph , Clark , Stone lithography firm ; he spent six months drawing maps for the Canadian Pacific Railway company indicating lots for sale in Saskatchewan . 
 While seeking another job he read in the Toronto Star an exchange between a farmer and an editor in which the editor extolled the virtues of <unk> only to have the farmer rebut him and challenge him to try out farming . Frise drew a cartoon of the editor struggling to milk a cow and a farmer as an editor ; he submitted it to the Star , where it appeared in the Star Weekly supplement on that 12 November . He visited the Star 's offices the following Monday and the Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief hired him immediately . He began by lettering titles and touching up photos until the Star Weekly 's editor J. Herbert Cranston enlisted him for his drawing skills . Frise illustrated news stories and the children 's feature The Old Mother Nature Club , and did political cartoons . His cartoons also appeared in publications such as the Owen Sound Sun . 
 Frise took a job at an engraving firm in Montreal in 1916 and in the midst of World War I enlisted in the military that 17 May . He had had two years previous experience with the 48th Highlanders of Canada and served at first served in the 69th Battery of the Canadian Field Artillery . He was deployed overseas that September and by November was serving in the 12th Battery at the front , where he employed his farm experience driving horses to move artillery and ammunition . At the Battle of Vimy Ridge his left hand was severely injured when an enemy shell exploded at an ammunition dump where he was delivering loads of shells . The Star reported its anxiety over the possible loss of " one of Canada ’ s most promising cartoonists " , but his drawing hand — his right — was uninjured . He was discharged after recuperating in Chelmsford , England , and arrived back in Toronto on 1 December 1917 and returned to work , first at the Star and shortly after at the Star Weekly again . 
 Canadian Field Artillery 's 43rd Battery approached Frise in 1919 to illustrate a book on the history of their unit . The volume appeared later in the year under the title Battery Action ! , written by Hugh R. Kay , George Magee , and F. A. MacLennan and illustrated with Frise 's light @-@ hearted , humorous cartoons rendered in accurate detail . 
 As the Star Weekly 's circulation grew , so did its comics section . Cranston encouraged Frise to create a Canada @-@ themed comic strip in the vain of W. E. Hill 's Among Us Mortals , a Chicago strip which also ran in the Star . Frise protested he could not keep up with a weekly schedule but nonetheless began At the Rink , which débuted 25 January 1919 ; it became Life 's Little Comedies on 15 March . The strip proved popular and evolved by 1923 ; it had taken on the influence of John T. McCutcheon 's depictions of a fictional rural town in the American Midwest called Bird Center . Frise turned focus to humorous and nostalgic depictions of rural life and on 12 December 1925 renamed his strip Birdseye Center , whose setting he described as " any Canadian village " ; its lead characters included bowler @-@ hatted Pigskin Peters , Old Archie and his pet moose Foghorn , and lazy Eli Doolittle and his wife Ruby . The strip grew in popularity and in 1926 was voted favourite comic strip in a readers ' poll — as a write @-@ in , since the strip did not appear in the list of options . 
 ' ' Birdseye Center ' ' 
 From about 1920 Frise shared an office with the journalist and Vimy ridge veteran Greg Clark ( 1892 – 77 ) . They became friends , and Frise began providing colour illustrations to Clark 's tales in the Star of the pair 's misadventures in Toronto — Frise tall and gangly , and Clark short and stout . A selection appeared in a volume titled Which We Did in 1936 . Frise talked of their <unk> to the Star : " We 've fried eggs on the city hall steps . We caulked my house and flooded the parlor with cement . I once let Greg persuade me to get a steam shovel to do my spring digging and ruined my garden . Perhaps this book is our most foolish adventure . " 
 Frise chatted with the frequent visitors to the office . He worked at his own pace and often tore up work @-@ in @-@ progress in dissatisfaction and submitted his strips at the last moment . Frise 's tardiness caused such delays in production and distribution that editorial director Harry C. Hindmarsh once demanded Joseph E. Atkinson have something done about it . Atkinson replied , " Harry , The Star Weekly does not go to press without Mr. Frise . " 
 Frise was unconcerned with the resale value of his original artwork and pursued little licensing of his work , amongst which included product endorsements , products such as jigsaw puzzles , and a Birdseye Center Cabin Park on Lake Scugog , opened in 1940 . His work provided him well enough that he bought a home in the well @-@ to @-@ do Baby Point neighbourhood . 
 Frise and Clark had grown concerned with the Star 's treatment of its staff and made an agreement in 1946 to leave at the first <unk> . Clark contacted John McConnell , publisher of the Montreal Standard , a newspaper with a smaller circulation than the Star 's that had earlier offered him a position . McConnell offered the pair salaries similar to what they received at the Star , as well as the opportunity for Frise to have his strip syndicated in the United States , which would supplement his income . When they handed in their resignations that Christmas Eve , Hindmarsh asked them , " Aren 't you going to give us a chance to bid ? " Frise told him , " Mr Hindmarsh , you have nothing to bid with . " The last Birdseye Center episode ran on 1 February 1947 . 
 The Star maintained publication rights to Birdseye Center , so Frise re @-@ created the feature as Juniper Junction with strongly similar characters and situations . It début 22 February 1947 , and the Standard ran it in colour , as Frise had long wanted . Standard 's circulation grew after the addition of Frise and Clark 's collaborations . Frise provided the illustrations to Jack Hambleton 's cookbook Skillet Skills for Camp and Cottage published in 1947 . 
 After feeling unwell the night before , Frise died of a heart attack in his home in Toronto on 13 June 1948 , at age 57 . Clark telephoned Cranston on hearing the news , saying , " A great gentleman has passed on . " Frise was buried at Prospect Cemetery in Toronto .

 Frise stood 5 feet 9 inches ( 175 cm ) . He enjoyed the outdoors and pursued fishing and hunting . He often returned to the Lake Scugog area and sometimes spoke about his career there . He was a Methodist Christian . 
 After returning from his service in World War I , Frise began courting Ruth Elizabeth Gate , who had been born in the US and grew up in Toronto . She worked at an advertising agency , and co @-@ published with her father a magazine in braille and a braille bible . She married Frise on 21 February 1918 and the couple had four daughters , Jean , Ruth , Edythe , and Betty ; and a son , John . Frise often featured his spaniel Rusty in his strips .

 The Montreal cartoonist Doug Wright ( 1917 – 83 ) took the reins of Juniper Junction , which went on to become English Canada 's longest @-@ running comic strip . In 1965 the Canadian publisher McClelland & Stewart printed a treasury of Birdseye Center with commentary by Greg Clark and an introduction by Gordon Sinclair . Clark continued publishing his tales for a time with illustrations by Duncan Macpherson ( 1924 – 93 ) , but soon moved on to different topics . 
 Scugog Shores Museum in Port Perry holds some samples of Frise 's original artwork , and the Province of Ontario erected an Ontario Historical Plaque in front of the museum to commemorate Frise 's role in Ontario 's heritage . In 2009 , Frise was inducted into the Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame .

 FLCL was directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and produced by the FLCL Production Committee , which included Gainax , Production I.G , and Starchild Records . 
 Tsurumaki has said that he tried to " break the rules " of anime when making FLCL , for example , by choosing a contemporary Japanese band to provide the soundtrack , and patterning the style more after " a Japanese TV commercial or promotional video " , creating a work that is " short , but dense @-@ packed " . 
 FLCL 's localization director and script writer Marc Handler stated that localization of the script was the hardest part of the show . The in @-@ jokes in the show included obscure pop culture references that had to be decoded and transferred to English audiences . One example was a reference to Cheerio , a discontinued soft drink in Japan , for the English release the choice was made to use a discontinued American soft drink , Crystal Pepsi . Director Kazuya <unk> responded to criticism of FLCL , stating " comprehension should not be an important factor in FLCL . " 
 The Medical Mechanica building featured is in the shape of a large iron . The character Amarao describes Medical Mechanica 's goal as the destruction of all thought . FLCL uses the iron as a symbolic breakdown of " thought " by smoothing out the wrinkles as equated to the removing of the brain 's wrinkles . For English localization , the Japanese team had to explain the concept because a direct translation of script did not convey the ideology .

" Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A- stating , " FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental .

 IGN columnist Davis Smith reviewed the anime shortly after its English premier , in the article Smith praised the series ' unusual story telling , extremely high quality animation and the soundtrack provided by The Pillows ; rewarding the series a score of 9 out of 10 concluding , " Logic dictates that FLCL should be an undisciplined and <unk> mess , given all the insanity that its creators are attempting to weld into a functioning whole .

At the end of the tunnel is a sharp turn to the left followed by a turn to the right into a canyon with a S @-@ curve ( original heartline roll location ) . Water bombs shoot off as the train enters the canyon . The train then passes under the lift hill through an over banked turn at 92 degrees . It then turns to the right into another overbanked turn followed by an airtime hill . The train then turns to the right into the brake run . One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 30 seconds .

 Maverick features six three @-@ car steam @-@ era style trains that seat twelve passengers each . The trains have tiered seating and are named and colored as follows : Brett — Brass , Brent — Gold , Ben — <unk> , Beau — Gold , Bart — Silver , and Sam — Copper . The restraint system , similar to Accelerator Coasters , includes a hydraulic over the shoulder harness and an interlocking seat belt . The station features an elevated dual unloading and loading platform enabling two trains to be loaded and unloaded simultaneously . Maverick features western music , contributing to the western theme . There is also an elevator shaft designed to look like a silo , that also contributes to the western theme . The passenger height restriction was initially set to a minimum of 48 inches ( 120 cm ) . In May 2007 , the height restriction was raised to a minimum of 52 inches ( 130 cm ) per recommendations made by Intamin . At the 2015 Winter Chill Out , Cedar Point announced that the traditional over the shoulder restraints would be replaced with the soft vest style restraints seen on Intimidator 305 .

 Re @-@ education through labor ( RTL ) ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , abbreviated <unk> ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) was a system of administrative detentions in the People 's Republic of China in place from 1957 to 2013 which was generally used to detain persons for minor crimes such as petty theft , prostitution , and trafficking illegal drugs , as well as religious or political dissidents such as Falun Gong adherents . It was separate from the much larger laogai system of prison labour camps . 
 Sentences under re @-@ education through labor were typically for one to three years , with the possibility of an additional one @-@ year extension . They were issued as a form of administrative punishment by police , rather than through the judicial system . While incarcerated , detainees were often subject to some form of political education . Estimates on the number of RTL detainees on any given year range from 190 @,@ 000 to two million . China Daily in 2007 estimated that there were a total of 310 re @-@ education centers in China at that time . 
 On December 28 , 2013 , the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress abolished the re @-@ education through labor system and detainees were released . However , human rights groups have observed that other forms of extrajudicial detention have taken its place , with some former RTL camps being renamed as drug rehabilitation centers . 
 = = Re @-@ education through labor and the Chinese penal system = = 
 The People 's Republic of China employs several forms of corrections for people who have been arrested , of which re @-@ education through labor was one . The Laogai Research Foundation classifies re @-@ education through labor as a sub @-@ component under the umbrella of the laogai ( " reform through labor " ) criminal justice system , which generally refers to prisons , prison farms , and labor camps for convicted criminals . Re @-@ education through labor , on the other hand , refers to detentions for persons who are not considered criminals or have only committed minor offenses . Persons detained under re @-@ education through labor were detained in facilities which are separate from the general prison system ; furthermore , detainees in these re @-@ education facilities receive a small salary , which laogai detainees do not , and in theory have shorter work hours . The laogai system is much larger than the re @-@ education through labor system , with the Laogai Research Foundation identifying 1 @,@ 045 laogai camps in 2006 ( compared to 346 re @-@ education centers ) . Both systems , however , involve penal labor and often do not allow trials or judicial hearings . The term " reform through labor " or laogai was officially replaced with " prison " in 1994 , and the term " re @-@ education center " or <unk> ( <unk> ) was replaced with " correctional center " in 2007 . 
 Other components of the prison system include detention centers for individuals awaiting sentence or execution , and juvenile detention camps for individuals under a minimum age ( which has varied through the years , and may currently be under 14 ) . The system formerly included components such as custody and repatriation for individuals without a residence permit ; " forced job placement , " which has not been widely practiced since the 1990s ; and " shelter and investigation , " a system of detentions for individuals under legal investigation , which was abolished in 1996 . The Laogai Research Foundation also classifies psychiatric facilities , or <unk> , as a form of detention for political dissidents , although it is not officially recognized as part of the laogai penal system . 
 = = History = = 
 Institutions similar to re @-@ education through labor facilities , but called " new life schools " or " loafers ' camps " , existed in the early 1950s , although they did not become official until the anti @-@ rightist campaigns in 1957 and 1958 . A report by Human Rights in China ( <unk> ) states that re @-@ education through labor was first used by the Communist Party of China in 1955 to punish counter @-@ revolutionaries , and in 1957 was officially adopted into law to be implemented by the Ministry of Public Security . The law allowed police to sentence both minor offenders and " counter @-@ revolutionaries " or " anti @-@ socialist elements " to incarceration in labor camps without the right to a judicial hearing or trial , and did not allow judicial review to take place until after the punishment was being enforced . In the beginning there were no limits to the length for which detainees could be sentenced , and it was not until 1979 that a maximum sentence of four years ( three years ' sentence plus one @-@ year extension ) was set . In 1983 , the management and implementation of the re @-@ education through labor system was passed from the Ministry of Public Security to the Ministry of Justice . 
 When Falun Gong was banned in mainland China in 1999 , re @-@ education through labor became a common punishment for practitioners . Some human rights groups claim that as many as 10 @,@ 000 Falun Gong members were detained in between 1999 and 2002 , with as many as 5 @,@ 000 detained in 2001 alone . More recent estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong adherents are imprisoned in China , with some sources estimating up to half of the official reeducation through labor camp population is Falun Gong practitioners . In some labor camps , Falun Gong practitioners make up the majority population . 
 In the past decade , there have been numerous calls for the system to be reformed or replaced . As early as 1997 , the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ( <unk> ) called for China to allow judicial control over detentions ; in 2000 , the UN Committee Against Torture recommended that all forms of administrative detention , including re @-@ education through labor , be abolished ; in 2004 , the <unk> called for the establishment of rights to due process and counsel for individuals detained ; and in 2005 , the Special Rapporteur on Torture called for the outright abolition of re @-@ education through labor . The prominent deaths of two inmates in spring 2003 prompted many calls within China for reform of the system , but reform did not happen immediately , though The China Daily reported that there was " general consensus " that reform was needed . In March 2007 , however , the Chinese government did announce that it would abolish the re @-@ education through labor system and replace it with a more lenient set of laws . According to the proposal , the maximum sentence would be lowered from four years to 18 months ; re @-@ education centers would be renamed " correction centers " and have their fences and gates removed . A month later , Chongqing municipality passed a law allowing lawyers to offer legal counsel in re @-@ education through labor cases . 
 Many human rights groups , however , doubted the efficacy of the proposed reforms , saying that the new laws would only help minor criminals and not help political prisoners , and that the reforms would not actually abolish the re @-@ education through labor system . The Laogai Research Foundation stated that lowering the maximum length of detention and changing the names of the detention facilities would not constitute a " fundamental change " . Nine months after the declaration that the laws would be rewritten , the re @-@ education through labor system had not been abolished ; in December 2007 , a group of academics drafted an open letter to the government calling for an end to the system . During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , there were reports that some individuals applying for permits to protest were detained without trial ; of these , some were sentenced to re @-@ education through labor . In the United Nations Human Rights Council 's September 2008 Universal Periodic Review of the People 's Republic of China , re @-@ education through labor was listed as an " urgent human rights concern , " and as of February 2009 there remains a large number of active facilities . 
 = = = Statistics = = = 
 Reports on re @-@ education through labor have found it difficult to estimate the number of people in re @-@ education centers , and nationwide statistics were often unavailable in the past . What data have become available often vary widely . 
 Of these detainees , 5 to 10 percent are estimated to be political prisoners , and as many as 40 percent drug offenders — in 1998 , nearly one @-@ third of the known re @-@ education camps were meant specifically for holding drug offenders . 
 China Daily estimated that there were a total of 310 re @-@ education centers in China in 2007 . The 2008 edition the Laogai Research Foundation 's biennial report listed exactly 319 " confirmed " re @-@ education centers in China , and 74 " unconfirmed " ones , but estimated that the actual number might be much <unk> the provinces with the most centers being Guangdong ( 31 ) , Heilongjiang ( 21 ) , and Henan ( 21 ) . In a February 2009 meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council , the Chinese government stated that there are 320 centers . The provinces with the most re @-@ education centers include Guangdong , Liaoning , Heilongjiang , and Henan . As at the end of 2008 , there were 350 labour camps in which were held 160 @,@ 000 prisoners .

 = = = Conviction and detention = = = 
 Sentencing for re @-@ education through labor is generally carried out by the police rather than by the judicial system , so individuals are rarely charged or tried before being detained . Public security bureaus ( police offices ) are able to carry out administrative detentions for " minor " infringements that are not considered criminal acts ; at least one analyst has suggested that local public security bureaus often abuse their authority and detain individuals for things such as personal vendettas . Individuals may also be sentenced to re @-@ education through labor by courts , but the proportion of individuals who receive trials rather than going directly into administrative detention is determined in part by how much capacity that province has for re @-@ education detainees — provinces with large re @-@ education through labor apparatus generally allow fewer detainees to have trials . Where detainees have been allowed a trial , their lawyers have faced " intimidation and abuse , " according to some reports , and the individuals under trial have sometimes been convicted on the basis of confessions that were coerced through " torture and severe psychological pressure . " In at least one instance , convicted individuals were sent to re @-@ education through labor even after being found not guilty in a trial . 
 Most detainees in re @-@ education through labor facilities are reported to be drug users , petty criminals , and prostitutes , as well as some political prisoners ; James Seymour has also claimed that most individuals sentenced to re @-@ education through labor are from urban areas . Individuals who attempt to leave the country illegally have also been sentenced to re @-@ education through labor upon their return . In periods leading up to visits from foreign dignitaries or politically sensitive anniversaries ( such as the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 ) , local authorities have supposedly detained " undesirables " such as the homeless , mentally or physically disabled individuals , and migrant workers . One China specialist at the RAND Corporation has claimed that the police , faced with a lack of " modern rehabilitation and treatment programs , " use re @-@ education through labor convictions to " warehouse " individuals for " an increasing number of social problems . " In some instances , individuals were sent to re @-@ education through labor even after being found not guilty in a court of law . 
 Detainees can seek to have their detention repealed through an " administrative review " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) of the decision or by filing an " administrative litigation " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) against the Re @-@ education Through Labor Management Committee that detained them . According to the advocacy group Chinese Human Rights Defenders , however , these options are ineffective and the groups overseeing the reviews and litigations often have the same interests as the management committee that originally ordered the detention . 
 = = = Conditions in the facilities = = = 
 The United States Department of State called the conditions in prisons " harsh and frequently degrading , " and said the conditions in re @-@ education through labor facilities were similar , citing overcrowded living spaces , low @-@ quality food , and poor or absent medical care . Detainees in camps are required to work for little or no pay ; while Chinese law requires that prison laborers ' workday be limited to 12 hours a day , The United States Department of State and the Laogai Research Foundation have speculated that re @-@ education through labor detainees are forced to work longer . In 2001 , sociologist Dean Rojek estimated that detainees generally worked six days a week , " in total silence . " Much of the labor done by re @-@ education through labor detainees is geared towards agriculture or producing goods , many of which are sold internationally , since re @-@ education through labor detainees are not counted as official " prisoners " and therefore not subject to international treaties . They also perform work ranging " from tending vegetables and emptying septic pits to cutting stone blocks and construction work . " 
 Although drug abusers are ostensibly placed in re @-@ education through labor to be treated for their addictions , some testimonial evidence has suggested that little " meaningful treatment " takes place in at least some of the centers , and that drug abusers often relapse into addiction upon their release from detention . 
 The facilities have been widely criticized for the physical abuse that is said to go on within them . Corporal punishment is commonly used , and torture and physical abuse are also thought to be widespread in the facilities . In April 2003 , Zhang Bin , an inmate at the re @-@ education facility <unk> City Correctional Camp , was beaten to death , reportedly by other inmates and by the labor supervisor . Zhang 's death , along with the March 2003 death of inmate Sun <unk> in a custody and repatriation prison , sparked calls within China for reform of the system , although reforms were not made immediately . 
 Though most reports describe the conditions of re @-@ education camps as " brutal , " there are some claims of prisoners being well @-@ treated . For example , when he was released from a three @-@ year re @-@ education sentence in 1999 , dissident Liu Xiaobo said that he had been treated very mildly , that he had been allowed to spend time reading , and that the conditions had been " pretty good . " 
 Forced labor may include breaking rocks and assembling car seat covers , and even gold farming in World of Warcraft . 
 = = = Life after release = = = 
 Detainees who are released from re @-@ education through labor camps may still be unable to travel or see other people freely . Individuals who remain in re @-@ education through labor for 5 or more years may not be allowed to return to their homes , and those who do may be closely monitored and not permitted to leave certain areas . For example , in July 2003 a priest who had been released from detention was kept under house arrest , and five men who attempted to visit him were themselves detained . 
 According to Xinhua , the official news agency of the Communist Party of China , slightly over 50 % of detainees released from prison and re @-@ education through labor in 2006 received government aid in the form of funds or assistance in finding jobs . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 Human Rights Watch has stated that the " re @-@ education through labor " system violates international law , specifically Article 9 ( 4 . ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) , which provides that " Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court , in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention ... " The Chinese Ministry of Justice , as well , has admitted that the system violated items in the Chinese constitution . Wang Gongyi , vice @-@ director of the Institute of Justice Research affiliated to the Ministry of Justice , said that the current re @-@ education through labor practice contradicts several items in the Constitution , the Criminal Procedure Law , and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights a United Nations human rights treaty China signed in 1998 . Re @-@ education through labor has also been criticized by numerous human rights groups for not offering procedural guarantees for the accused , and for being used to detain political dissidents , teachers , Chinese house church leaders , and Falun Gong practitioners . Furthermore , even though the law up until 2007 specified a maximum length of detainment of four years , at least one source mentions a " retention for in @-@ camp employment " system that allowed authorities to keep detainees in the camps for longer than their official sentences . 
 Re @-@ education through labor has been a focus of discussion not only among foreign human rights groups , but also among legal scholars in China , some of whom were involved in the drafting of the 2007 laws meant to replace the system . In addition to legal scholars , the Supreme People 's Court of the People 's Republic of China had criticized the system . In light of the widespread disapproval of the system , <unk> called in 2001 for the system to be abolished entirely . Among its criticisms it cited the fact that the wording of re @-@ education through labor laws was too loose , allowing authorities to manipulate it ; the fact that the punishment given in re @-@ education centers was too severe for the crimes committed ; the abusive conditions at re @-@ education centers ; and the variation of re @-@ education through labor laws from one province to another . 
 Although many human rights groups and legal scholars both within and without China called for the reform or total abolition of re @-@ education through labor , some groups have defended the system . A 1997 report in China 's Legal Daily hailed re @-@ education through labor as a means to " maintain social peace and prevent and reduce crime . " The Ministry of Public Security stated in 2005 that re @-@ education through labor helped maintain rule of law and was mainly used for rehabilitating lawbreakers . In 2007 , when new laws were drafted , the Ministry of Public Security was in favor of continuing the practice of not allowing judicial review before punishment was enforced .

 During the Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress in Beijing on 15 November 2013 , Chinese officials announced that they planned to abolish the Re @-@ education Through Labour system . The announcement came after a series of stories about Masanjia Labor Camp garnered international as well as domestic attention . First was the highly publicised letter from an inmate at Masanjia that a Portland , Oregon woman found hidden in a box of Halloween decorations . The letter listed abuses at the camp and pleaded for help . Secondly a small magazine in China called Lens published a 14 @-@ page report detailing abuses of women at Masanjia . An online version of the report quickly became the most read news item in China . These two stories along with continued pressure from international NGO 's as well as reformers within China precipitated the announcement to end the system . 
 The planned abolition of the system , however , has been criticised by human rights groups , with Amnesty International issuing a report titled " Changing the Soup but Not the Medicine . " Amnesty 's report concludes that the camp closures are a positive step forward for human rights , but the fundamental problems of arbitrary detention remain in China : 
 Many of the policies and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed : quite the contrary . There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force . The latest anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign , launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years , shows that the CCP ’ s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated . Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “ brainwashing centres ” and other forms of arbitrary detention . Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment , forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “ black jails ” and other forms of arbitrary detention . Human rights defenders , democracy advocates , whistle @-@ blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention , “ black jails ” , short @-@ term administrative detention , and enforced disappearances , rather than RTL . 
 On December 28 , 2013 , the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress abolished the re @-@ education through labor system . Detainees were released without finishing their sentences . 
 = Agustín Ross Cultural Centre = 
 Agustín Ross Cultural Centre ( Spanish , Centro Cultural Agustín Ross ) , previously known as Casino Ross ( Ross Casino ) , is the cultural center of the city of Pichilemu in Libertador General Bernardo O 'Higgins Region , Chile . It was constructed between 1906 and 1909 at the request of politician Agustín Ross Edwards . The structure of the cultural center is very similar to that of the Grand Trianon in Versailles , France . 
 It is best known for housing one of the first casinos of Chile ; a casino operated in the building between 1917 and 1931 . After 1931 all casinos , except the newly opened Casino de Viña del Mar , were declared illegal . The building has also been used as a post office , a store selling imported goods , a hotel , a discotheque , and a bar . There were two attempts by the local government to purchase the building ; the first time in 1982 failed while the second in 1995 succeeded . The former casino was declared a National Monument of Chile along with the Agustín Ross Park in February 1988 . 
 Over time , the building deteriorated , and a project was approved in January 2007 for it to be renovated for use as a cultural center . The restored building opened in January 2009 and houses the local library . In January 2010 , the cultural center was inaugurated by President Michelle Bachelet and Mayor Roberto Córdova .

 Agustín Ross Edwards was a wealthy Chilean writer , member of parliament , government minister and politician . He reportedly had the dream of " creating a port which could be an alternative to the Valparaíso port , " but this would turn later into " creating a touristic place , an elite resort , collecting the most important characteristics of European places , which would make it unique . " 
 For this purpose , Ross Edwards bought Fundo Pichilemu , a farm , from Juan Esteban Torrealba Maturana in 1885 . There was a little hotel in Fundo Pichilemu called La Posada , which he converted into a first @-@ class hotel called the Gran Hotel Pichilemu ( now the Agustín Ross Hotel ) . Following the development of the Gran Hotel Pichilemu , Ross Edwards saw the need of creating " a seaside resort with all the comforts and luxuries capable of seducing the Chilean aristocracy ; " for this purpose , he conceived the idea of creating a park , and a post @-@ office building . Afterwards , Agustín Ross installed amenities such as a laundry , stables , and stairways , among others , according to local historian José Arraño Acevedo , turning Pichilemu into a summer resort town for affluent people from Santiago and Mendoza , Argentina .

 According to Washington Saldías González , editor of Pichilemu News , the construction of the building lasted from 1906 to 1909 , while Jorge Godoy Rojas , architect of the University of Chile , states that it was built between 1904 and 1906 . Ross wanted it to look similar to the Grand Trianon of the Tuileries Palace in Paris , France ; he imported building materials and furniture from France and England . After its opening , the building included a post office with telegraph service and a store for imported goods , exclusive to clients of the Gran Hotel Pichilemu . 
 The National Monuments Council asserts that the first casino in Chile was opened in the building in 1906 ; however , historians Antonio Saldías and José Arraño Acevedo have pointed out that it was inaugurated as a de facto casino in the summer of 1917 , after Agustín Ross rented the building to Argentinean businessman Alfredo Master . Saldías also noted that there were casinos in Chile before Agustín Ross 's arrival in Pichilemu , in towns such as Constitución . The casino operated until 1931 , when the Casino de Viña del Mar , the first official casino of Chile , opened ; all others were declared illegal . Ross died in 1925 at age of 82 in Viña del Mar , just months before " one of his greatest " dreams was accomplished : the railway from Palmilla and the local railway station .

 After the casino closed , the building was mostly left unused until the 1940s , when the González Pérez family purchased it from Agustín Ross de Ferrari , a descendant of Ross Edwards . The family converted the building into a hotel , and in the late 1940s , the underground floor was remodeled and made a clandestine casino . Twenty years later , in the late 1960s , Gustavo González Pérez , then a pilot in the Chilean Air Force , along with another member of the Air Force , created an American @-@ style discotheque called La <unk> ( The Cavern ) in the basement . Years later , González Pérez transferred the business to other members of his family , who renamed the discotheque Los Tijuana ( The <unk> ) . Finally , the González Pérez family decided to close the discotheque in the late 1970s . Shortly afterwards , Rancagua businesswoman Carmelita Tello installed a <unk> called Carmelita in the main room . Later , <unk> Roberto Álvarez decided to run a discotheque called Master in the same place , while at the same time , there was a grill bar called Wa @-@ Na in another room ; both businesses operated until the 1990s . The condition of the building gradually deteriorated , and its use became restricted . 
 During the administration of Mayor Julio <unk> Wolff ( 1981 – 1983 ) , an attempt was made to buy the building with municipal funds ; however , <unk> was not allowed to complete the purchase because the price of eight million pesos ( approximately US $ 16 @,@ 000 ) was " too high for the municipal budget , and would leave many things without financing . " The building would finally be purchased in 1995 by Mayor Orlando Cornejo Bustamante with the support of the Pichilemu City Council , then composed of Aldo Polanco Contreras , Jorge Vargas González , Mario <unk> Cáceres , Mariano Polanco <unk> , and Raúl Tobar Pavez , for 30 million pesos ( approximately US $ 60 @,@ 000 ) . 
 In 1987 , after the re @-@ inauguration of another work of Agustín Ross , the Ross Park , a request was made to the National Monuments Council that both the park and the former casino be declared <unk> Históricos ( National Monuments ) ; they were so designated on 25 February 1988 .

 After the former casino was purchased by the government of Pichilemu , the building was used to hold meetings , exhibitions of paintings , sculptures , theater , and for launching books . In 1997 , the Club <unk> de Pichilemu ( Aero Club of Pichilemu ) requested the building to host the fiftieth annual reunion of the Air Federation of Chile . Permission was granted , but the Club <unk> had to purchase toilet fixtures , as the ones in the building were seriously damaged . This prompted the government of Mayor Jorge Vargas González ( 1996 – 2007 ) to begin restoring the deteriorated former casino , but it was not until 2004 that the Regional Government of Libertador General Bernardo O 'Higgins Region approved financing for a restoration design study . The study by the Department of Architecture of the Ministry of Public Works began in 2005 and lasted until mid – 2006 . Afterwards , on 15 December , Intendant of Libertador General Bernardo O 'Higgins Region Héctor Leiva Polanco unveiled to the community of Pichilemu the design and announced that he would present a financing proposal during the next year to the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Regional ( National Fund of Regional Development ) . The project was approved on 23 January 2007 ; the budget , according to architect Jorge Godoy Rojas , was 513 @,@ 125 @,@ 000 pesos ( US $ 1 @,@ 026 @,@ 250 ) . On 12 June 2007 , the budget was increased to accommodate additional restoration work , by 100 million pesos to 663 @,@ 702 @,@ 000 pesos ( US $ 1 @,@ 327 @,@ 404 ) . 
 On 14 February 2007 , the Regional Secretary ( <unk> ) of the Ministry of Public Works , Beatriz Valenzuela , wrote in an article in the online newspaper El <unk> , " The current state of the historic monument is bad , because of the deterioration of the roof , which over the years has had permanently leaked water and humidity . This can be easily seen in the damaged wood of its inside enclosure and the great frame of the mansard roof , which is of oak wood . " Some months later , on 23 August , Valenzuela announced that the restoration of the building would begin that same day , after it was authorized by the Regional Government ; the building would become a cultural center , housing the local public library and art galleries . The restoration work was the responsibility of development firm Atelier <unk> . 
 During the restoration of the casino , a number of historical items were found . Those included newspapers , specifically a copy of Las Últimas Noticias from February 1941 , during the time the building served as a hotel ; a US telephone battery from 1909 ; and a tile from the casino 's ceiling with signatures and drawings by casino workers in 1915 .

 The completely restored building opened on 23 January 2009 , one hundred years after its original construction . An exhibition of photographs by Ana María <unk> Lemarchand was the first to be staged in the restored building . In June 2009 , a non @-@ political organization called the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu ( Pichilemu Cultural Corporation ) was formed to manage the cultural center , in coordination with the local government . The center 's inauguration was supposed to take place in March of that year , with President Michelle Bachelet Jeria in attendance ; however , it was postponed until 27 January 2010 . Bachelet toured the rooms of the cultural center with Mayor Roberto Córdova , and later said that the center " [ is ] to merge itself with the origins of modern Pichilemu , restoring the facilities to do what is so necessary : to make room for the creativity , talent , imagination , dreams of so many young and many people . " 
 After the earthquakes of 27 February , and 11 March 2010 , the cultural center was " slightly " damaged . The <unk> of both the northwest and southeast towers of the building fell down after the earthquakes ; in the northwest tower , a pole broke ; and there were some cracks and minor damage to the walls . Repairs took place in February 2011 , with an investment of fourteen million pesos ( US $ 28 @,@ 000 ) by the government of Pichilemu .

 The Centro Cultural Agustín Ross houses the local public library , and has four exhibition rooms , an auditorium , a music room , and several other rooms in which workshops take place for yoga , acrobatics , theatre , and other disciplines for people of all ages . The restoration of the cultural centre prompted the creation of an independent organization called the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu ( Pichilemu Cultural Corporation ) .

 The Biblioteca Pública de Pichilemu ( Public Library of Pichilemu ) is the public library of the city of Pichilemu , and its director as of 2011 is María Angélica Yáñez Cortés . The library was created on 16 May 1989 , under the leadership of Mayor René Maturana Maldonado . 
 The library was previously located in a dedicated building on Santa María Avenue from 1989 until 16 January 2009 , before relocating to the Centro Cultural Agustín Ross . In September 2010 , the library received a donation of 150 music and culture @-@ related books with the help of Alejandra <unk> , the cultural center 's communications and cultural management officer .

 Jorge Godoy Rojas , architect of the University of Chile , suggested in an January 2007 article he wrote for the online newspaper El Cachapoal that a semi @-@ autonomous legal entity be set up for the management of the cultural center . Such a legal entity had also been suggested to the authorities previously by local cultural organizations for several years , but they had been largely ignored . On 20 November 2008 , fourteen local organizations , including the Tourism Chamber of Pichilemu , the Agrupación <unk> por un Pichilemu <unk> ( Citizens Group for a Clean Pichilemu ) , and Canal 3 Pichilemu , sent a letter to the Pichilemu City Council requesting the creation of the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu ( Pichilemu Cultural Corporation ) for the third time . 
 In May 2009 , municipal employee Jorge Torres <unk> reported that the Cultural Corporation had been approved by the City Council , and its constitution was to be drawn up on 2 June ; it was approved on 11 June . Of the seven directors of the corporation , two are elected , two are appointed by the Pichilemu City Council , and another two by the regional or provincial government , and the mayor presides as the seventh member . Longtime Pichilemu resident sculptor Macarena Irarrázabal Correa and Professor Carlos Leyton <unk> , native of the nearby village of Ciruelos and creator of the Museo del Niño Rural ( Museum of the Rural Child ) , were elected .

 There is a popular myth surrounding the former casino which tells of " underground caves " between the Gruta de la Virgen ( also known as the Gruta de Nuestra Señora de Lourdes ; Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes ) and the building , crossing Agustín Ross Park . During the restoration of the building , in December 2007 , it was reported that " two great walls constructed with flagstone , very wide and very close together " were found , but nothing was confirmed afterwards . 
 Before the former casino building was completed , in 1908 , Agustín Ross Edwards and Evaristo Merino reported to historiographer José Toribio Medina the existence of indigenous remains in the cave now called the Gruta de la Virgen . Medina asked Argentinean ethnographer Félix Faustino <unk> to inspect the remains , and subsequently Medina wrote the book Los <unk> Indígenas de Pichilemu ( The Indigenous Remains of Pichilemu ) , using the report Faustino <unk> gave him . 
 American writer Trudy Larkin Forster wrote the book Los Gatos del Casino : la Historia de Don Agustín Ross Edwards y la Brigada de los Gatos Negros ( The Cats of the Casino : the History of Sir Agustín Ross Edwards and the Brigade of the Black Cats ) in 1999 . The book is set in Pichilemu and the Agustín Ross Casino , and it was premiered in the Children 's Book Fair of Santiago in June 1999 , and then in the Agustín Ross Art Room ( in current Centro Cultural Agustín Ross ) on 18 September of that year . 
 = Tropical Storm Karina ( 2008 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Karina was a weak , short @-@ lived tropical cyclone that developed during the 2008 Pacific hurricane season . The 12th tropical cyclone and 11th named storm of the season , it originated out of a tropical wave in the North Atlantic hurricane basin . The wave entered the Pacific Ocean on August 30 and spawned an area of low pressure off the western coast of Mexico on the morning of September 1 . The low had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression the next morning . The depression quickly developed into a tropical storm later in the morning , at which time it was named Karina and reached its peak intensity of 40 miles per hour ( 65 km / h ) with a minimum pressure of 1000 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 54 inHg ) . Later that day , after being classified a tropical storm for 12 hours , wind shear weakened the storm to a depression on September 3 and it dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Storm Karina originated from the southern portion of the tropical wave — a tropical wave is an elongated low pressure area embedded within the easterly trade winds — that also spawned Hurricane Gustav in the Caribbean Sea . The wave crossed Central America and entered the eastern Pacific basin on August 28 . After two days , the wave spawned an area of low pressure south of Manzanillo , Mexico . The low was located beneath an area of moderate convection , but was nearing cooler waters and a moist , yet stable , air mass . By later that night , a low @-@ level circulation developed partially underneath deep thunderstorm activity . In an area favorable for development , a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued on September 2 . However , strong easterly shear separated the showers and thunderstorms from the center of circulation . Despite the shear , sufficient convection developed around the center ; the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) classified it a tropical depression at 0600 UTC , while centered about 390 miles ( 630 km ) south of the southern tip of Baja California . The NHC initially did not recognize the system as a tropical depression and did not initiate advisories on it until several hours later . The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm due to a brief relaxation of the wind shear and was given the name Karina while located about 25 mi ( 40 km ) north of Socorro Island . 
 Karina was located to the south of a weakening mid @-@ level ridge , leading to a relatively slow west @-@ northwest movement at 9 mph ( 15 km / h ) . Upon becoming a tropical storm , Karina reached its peak with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . There was uncertainty as to the intensity of the storm , as the Dvorak technique — a system used to estimate the intensity of a tropical cyclone — rendered an intensity of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) ; but because the center of the storm had just moved under the deep convection , the winds were held at minimal tropical storm intensity . That night , 12 hours after being declared a tropical storm , Karina was downgraded to a tropical depression . Strong easterly wind shear of at least 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) tore away the deep convection that previously surrounded Karina . Karina was moving into a stable environment over cooling waters which would prevent convection from redeveloping , despite a forecast of lessening wind shear . The forward motion gradually decreased . By the morning of September 3 , convection had been sheared 125 mi ( 200 km ) from the center of circulation , leaving only a swirl of clouds . Karina degenerated into a remnant low @-@ pressure area later that morning and the NHC issued their final advisory . The remnant low quickly dissipated that afternoon . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 When the National Hurricane Center issued its first advisory on Karina , the storm was near the island of Socorro . There were no known preparations taken before the storm , as the island is mainly a natural reserve and the only inhabitants reside in a military base . On Clarion Island , residents took minor actions to prepare for possible impact from the storm . Officials advised residents to cancel all coastal activities and comply with advice from the National Civil Protection . Small crafts were advised to exercise extreme caution . In Cabo San Lucas , officials closed the port due to high waves produced by Karina ; small crafts such as water taxis and jet skis were to remain at the port . Port officials in Oaxaca and Chiapas advised boaters of strong winds , rain , and low visibility that they may encounter when nearing the seas around Karina . Despite the proximity to Socorro , no damage was reported and Karina remained far enough away from Clarion that there was no impact on the island . There were no ship reports of tropical storm @-@ force winds . 
 = Thomas Coke , 1st Earl of Leicester ( seventh creation ) = 
 Thomas William Coke , 1st Earl of Leicester ( 6 May 1754 – 30 June 1842 ) , known as Coke of Norfolk or Coke of Holkham , was a British politician and agricultural reformer . Born to Wenman Coke , Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Derby , and his wife Elizabeth , Coke was educated at several schools , including Eton College , before undertaking a Grand Tour of Europe . After returning to Britain and being married , Coke 's father died , leaving him the owner of a 30 @,@ 000 acre Norfolk estate . Returned to Parliament in 1776 for Norfolk , Coke became a close friend of Charles James Fox , and joined his Eton schoolmate William Windham in his support of the American colonists during the American Revolutionary War . As a supporter of Fox , Coke was one of the MPs who lost their seats in the 1784 general election , and he returned to Norfolk to work on farming , hunting , and the maintenance and expansion of Holkham Hall , his ancestral home . 
 Coke was again returned to Parliament in 1790 , sitting continuously until 1832 , and he primarily spoke on matters of local interest , such as the Corn Laws . His second focus was on civil liberties , and he spoke out against the government 's response to the Peterloo Massacre and similar events . Described as the " greatest commoner in England " , he chose the passage of the Great Reform Act 1832 as the moment to retire , later being made the Earl of Leicester in July 1837 . After a short illness , Coke died on 30 June 1842 , and was succeeded as Earl by his son Thomas . Coke 's main legacy is as an agricultural reformer , not as a politician ; he has historically been credited with sparking the British Agricultural Revolution through the reforms he made to farming on his estates . Later historians have questioned this , however , noting that the developments credited to him are most likely the work of other individuals ; nevertheless , he has still been described as " the real hero of Norfolk agriculture " . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Coke was born on 6 May 1754 in London , to Wenman and Elizabeth Coke . The Cokes were a landowning family of Derbyshire , originally from Norfolk , Wenman representing Derby as one of its two Members of Parliament , and as such Coke was born into a wealthy , estate @-@ owning family ; one of his first memories was " being held up to a window to watch a fox being cornered and killed by hounds " . Little is known of Coke 's father ; Wenman is described as a shy person who " saw little company and lived much out of the world ; his habits were those of a country gentleman , bending his mind to agriculture , moderately addicted to field sports and more than either , to reading in which he passed many hours ; firm in his principles which were those of the old Whig ; amiable in his disposition mild in his manners , he was beloved of his friends " . The family 's prospects improved significantly when Coke was five , when his uncle , Thomas Coke , 1st Earl of Leicester , died . The cause of Thomas 's death is not certain , although there are chances it was a duel , but the result was that upon the death of Thomas 's wife Margaret , Wenman would inherit substantial Norfolk estate , including Holkham Hall , a " Palladian masterpiece " . Margaret studiously avoided the rest of the family , vowing to outlive Wenman simply to ensure that he did not inherit the estate . 
 Few records exist of Thomas Coke 's early years , although it is known that he was educated in Longford , Derbyshire , before going to a school in Wandsworth run by French refugees . In 1765 he was sent to Eton College , where he was joined by William Windham , a close friend in his later life . Coke was apparently happy at Eton , and was excellent at field sports ; on one occasion 70 snipes he had killed were found in his room , and on another he narrowly avoiding being punished for shooting a pheasant in Windsor Park . He was not particularly interested in his academic studies , but by the time he left Eton in 1771 Coke had developed a close circle of friends and connections from the landowning class , and practical skills to deal with his future estates . After leaving school he undertook a Grand Tour of Europe , financed by his father and his great @-@ aunt ( who offered him £ 500 not to go to a university , regarding them as dens of vice ) . Coke visited France and Italy , where he witnessed the marriage of the Young Pretender to Princess Louise of Stolberg @-@ <unk> ; Louise apparently fell in love with Coke , preferring the similarly @-@ aged Englishman to her 52 @-@ year @-@ old alcoholic husband . 
 = = Career = = 
 By the time Coke returned to Britain , plans were already under way for him to enter Parliament . When an election was called in 1774 , Wenman stood for the seat of Norfolk , with his son asked to stand in his place for Derby . Coke was not particularly enthusiastic about this , and withdrew when his opponent discovered he was under 21 , the requisite age to stand for Parliament . With his father elected , Coke travelled with him to London , meeting members of the British high society . His sister Elizabeth and her husband James Dutton were also visiting , with Dutton 's sister Jane , and Coke fell in love with her . Wenman was not impressed when Coke asked him to let them be married , as he had picked out the daughter of a baronet for his son , but with the intercession of Wenman 's friend Harbord Harbord , he finally consented to their marriage , which occurred on 5 October 1775 . 
 The new couple lived in <unk> Manor , their peace disturbed in 1776 when Wenman 's health began to fail . He finally died on 10 April after " a constipation which medicine could not remove " , leaving Coke in charge of a 30 @,@ 000 acre estate at the age of 22 . Soon after his father 's death , Harbord and other senior Whigs visited Coke and asked him to stand for Norfolk in his father 's stead . Coke was not enthusiastic , not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth , but after his visitors pointed out a Tory might otherwise replace him " my blood chilled all over me from my head to my foot , and I came forward " . On 12 April he issued a manifesto to the Norfolk electorate , soon returning to campaign , and after being unanimously nominated on 27 April he was elected in May . 
 = = = Entry to Parliament = = = 
 Little is known of Coke 's early career in Parliament ; he spoke relatively infrequently , and the parliamentary session was dissolved soon after his election . During that summer , however , he struck up a relationship with Charles James Fox , a soon to be famous Whig politician noted for his outspoken and flamboyant lifestyle . Coke later recounted that " When I first went into Parliament I attached myself to Fox and clung to him through life . I lived in the closest bond of friendship with him . " The period was one of economic stability and political calm under Lord North , which ended due to the American Revolution and resulting American Revolutionary War . Coke was noted for his support of the American colonists ; as a strong supporter of the 1688 Glorious Revolution and the resulting Bill of Rights 1689 , he felt that the support of the espoused principles of justice and tolerance in Britain and overseas was his duty as a British subject , and saw no conflict between his position as a supporter of the colonists and his patriotism . Following the Battles of Saratoga , it became clear that any victory in America would be long and expensive , and in an attempt to raise funds King George III asked subjects to donate . In Norwich , a meeting was held in January 1778 for this purpose ; it raised £ 4 @,@ 500 in less than an hour . Windham and Coke attended this meeting , Windham making an impassioned speech pointing out that the campaign had so far resulted only in " disappointment , shame and dishonour " , and that " peace and reconciliation with America " was the only option . Windham , Coke and their supporters then withdrew to a nearby pub , where they drafted a petition to the king from " the Nobility , Gentry , Clergy , Freeholders and Inhabitants of the County of Norfolk " . This was presented to Parliament by Coke on 17 February 1778 , signed by 5 @,@ 400 people from Norfolk . George III took this as a personal insult , and as a result disliked Coke until his death . 
 Coke also brought up the issue of hunting game . During the late 18th century a series of laws were passed protecting a landowner 's right to hunt , and giving severe penalties to poachers . On 27 February Coke , an enthusiastic hunter , suggested in Parliament that these laws be relaxed ; " Combinations had been formed in the Country against the execution of these laws and some lives had been lost " . Before any motion could be brought ( it was not until 1827 that the laws were revised ) the situation in America came up again . On 22 February , Henry Seymour Conway brought a motion asking the King to " listen to the humble prayer and advice of his faithful Commons , that the war on the continent of North America may no longer be pursued for the impractical purpose of reducing the inhabitants of that country to obedience by force " . While the motion failed , it was again brought on 27 February , and passed . With this , Conway moved that " An humble address be presented to His Majesty " ; George III replied that he would see them on 3 March at St James 's Palace . It was then that " the most important and symbolic act of Coke 's political career " occurred . As a Knight of the Shire , Coke had the right to appear in court dressed " in his boots " as opposed to in formal court dress ; this he did , appearing in front of George III dressed in leather breeches , boots and spurs . 
 Eventually , the king began negotiations with the American colonies and accepted the resignation of Lord North – an action which would , eventually , lead to Coke leaving Parliament . A new government was formed in April 1782 , with Lord Rockingham as Prime Minister and Fox and Lord Shelburne as Secretaries of State . Rockingham and Shelburne disagreed constantly , particularly over the situation in North America , and with Rockingham 's death on 1 July Shelburne was made Prime Minister . At this the rest of the government resigned , and after a period of political chaos the short @-@ lived Fox @-@ North Coalition was formed in April 1783 . Coke was disgusted by this arrangement , describing it as a " revolting compact " . An East India Bill , which created 7 commissioners to oversee India , brought chaos to the coalition . Controversially , the commissioners would be appointed by the government , not by the crown , which challenged what the King saw as his constitutional right . Defeated in the House of Lords , the bill was used by George III to overturn Fox 's government and install a government led by William Pitt the Younger . Parliament was eventually dissolved on 25 March 1784 , and thanks to Coke 's long @-@ standing support of Fox and his actions , the ensuing general election led to Coke losing his seat .

 In between his Parliamentary work , Coke and his wife had been maintaining and improving his estates since they took possession of it in April 1776 . The cornerstone was Holkham House , a " temple to the arts " built by Coke 's great uncle . Knowing that he did not have the same understanding of classical architecture and art , Coke mainly left it alone , instead focusing on the park and gardens . The grounds had been laid out during the 1720s and 1730s , in a design which quickly became seen as old @-@ fashioned . Coke had the lake massively expanded , shifting a total of 36 @,@ 000 cubic yards of earth , and employed the gardener John Sandys from 1781 . Sandys created several large pieces of woodland , planting over 7 @,@ 000 trees in 22 acres near the Eastern Lodge , another ten acres near the lake , and four acres on marshland . In 1784 a further woodland expansion was undertaken , with 40 acres and 11 @,@ 000 trees , and between 1785 and 1789 396 @,@ 750 trees were planted on a further 179 acres . He retired in 1805 and was replaced a year later by James Loose , but continued to advise Coke on forestry matters . The library was also expanded , through the work of William Roscoe , who bought books including the Mainz Psalter for Coke between 1814 and 1842 . 
 Coke also expanded the estate itself , incorporating farms around the House as their leases ended , and by 1800 the estate covered 3 @,@ 500 acres . Samuel Wyatt was also employed from 1799 to 1805 to build new lodges at the entrance of the extended estate , and until 1806 also worked on a new kitchen garden ; this covered six acres . Humphry Repton was employed to extend the lake yet again , and proposed building a boathouse and fishing pavilion , as well as a chain ferry leading to a " snug thatched cottage " ; there is no evidence this proposal was ever approved . Most of the work was completed by 1810 , and from then on Coke 's attention turned to hunting game . The estate was explicitly designed with that in mind , and game books note between 1 @,@ 300 and 2 @,@ 500 partridges killed most years . In 1822 , Elizabeth , Coke 's daughter , recorded that 800 birds were shot in one day . 
 Jane Dutton , Coke 's wife , gave birth to their first child in 1777 , a daughter named Jane . Two more daughters followed ; Anne Margaret in 1779 , and Elizabeth in 1795 , before Jane 's death in 1800 . Jane was married to Charles Nevison Howard , Viscount Andover , on 21 June 1796 , but on 11 January 1800 Andover died in a shooting accident on the Holkham estate . Jane remarried to Henry Digby in 1806 , and they had 11 children . 
 = = = Landlord and agriculturalist = = = 
 As a landlord , Coke was a firm believer in the right and moral obligation of a landowner to improve the quality of life of those living on his estates . The roles of landlord and tenant were clearly set out by the late 18th century ; the landlord was to provide fields , roads and buildings , while the tenant would provide the seed , implements and manual labour . Coke 's estate included 54 farms when he inherited it , with excellent farm output . There were , however , significant debts as a result of his uncle 's work on Holkham Hall , with the interest alone being £ 4 @,@ 000 a year . He had some difficulties dealing with the people employed before he inherited the estates , and when the steward Ralph Cauldwell , appointed by Coke 's uncle , retired in 1782 , Coke failed to replace him until 1816 . This replacement was Francis Blaikie , a Scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for Lord Chesterfield . Blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or could do better , but often struggled to deal with Coke . Coke lacked financial sense in matters other than the agricultural , on one occasion selling all his land near Manchester . It wasn 't until 20 years later that Blaikie became aware of this , after receiving a query from the new owners about the mineral rights . Blaikie travelled to Manchester to meet the solicitor who had handled the sale , finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all the sold land had been rich in coal . 
 In the early 18th century , farmland was run through an open field system , which were commonly overstocked and made trying experimental methods very difficult ; enclosed farms , on the other hand , were higher quality and useful for experimentation , with the result that they commanded a rent almost double a similarly sized open field . Compounding this problem , many of the enclosures were split up into strips , with the result that ownership was unclear . Between 1776 and 1816 , Coke rapidly bought strips of land near his estates and had them enclosed . Much of this came during the Napoleonic Wars , where grain prices ( and therefore farming profits ) peaked . Coke was influenced by " Turnip " Townshend , who had owned a nearby estate who promoted crop rotation and farm improvement . Along with enclosure , <unk> and improved grasses , Townshend 's improvements resulted in " a course of husbandry utterly unlike that practised a hundred years ago " . 
 Coke 's big improvements came in two areas ; grasses and husbandry . He pioneered the use of cocksfoot and <unk> as grass and feed respectively , with the result that by 1793 he was claiming to have 2 @,@ 400 sheep in Holkham , as opposed to the 700 kept when he inherited the estates . The husbandry involved the milking comparisons of various types of cow , along with the first planting of Scottish turnips , which are " a good table vegetable being more palatable and nutritious and not so watery as the Norfolk variety " . His prime area of experimentation was on the selective breeding for sheep . The most common sheep in the area was the Norfolk Horn , which was long @-@ legged and slow to mature . Coke became a promoter of the English Leicester , a breed noted as fast @-@ maturing and excellent when fed turnips . Coke cross @-@ bred the two , with the resulting sheep being highly tame and superior to the pure Norfolk breed . Coke also bred cattle and used oxen for ploughing rather than horse , being the first to use them harnessed rather than yoked and winning a prize for his oxen in 1837 . 
 Through sheep <unk> , competitions and his contacts within the nobility , Coke soon spread his new ideas and breeds . Initially small events of local farmers , the <unk> soon became 200 @-@ person formal dinners , rising to 300 people in 1821 and 700 soon after , with even the American ambassador Richard Rush attending in 1819 , along with the French Consul and the Duke of Sussex . The Board of Agriculture was formed in 1793 , with Coke sitting as one of the 30 " ordinary members " as a leading agriculturalist ; he was made the Vice @-@ President in 1805 . The Board published a series of county reports for most of the United Kingdom , describing new farming measures being undertaken in various parts of the country . 
 Coke has been described as " the real hero of Norfolk agriculture " , despite the fact that his land was so poor one critic is said to have remarked that " the thin sandy soil must be ploughed by rabbits yoked to a pocket knife " . However , academics and writers dispute his importance . 19th and early 20th century historians held him to be the crucial figure of the British Agricultural Revolution , crediting him with inventing four @-@ crop rotation . Naomi Riches describes this as an " error " , and <unk> Parker , writing in the Economic History Review , states that " many of the innovations he is supposed to have introduced should be attributed to his predecessors in Norfolk " ; however that " is not to deny the substantial contribution of Coke himself to the advance of farming technique in England " . 
 = = = Further Parliamentary career = = = 
 Coke was re @-@ elected to Parliament in 1790 , at a time of great political trouble . The French Revolution a year earlier had torn the Whig party in half , with Coke and Fox in the isolated minority who supported the revolutionaries as their acts became more brutal . With the declaration of war in 1793 , an impact was finally felt in Britain with a rise in agricultural prices and rent . It also led to the establishment of local yeomanry forces to defend the country , something Coke opposed . This reduced his popularity in Norfolk and led to suspicions he might be a Jacobin , to the point where he was forced to publicly declare that he was not a Republican and " detested their principles " . Eventually , late September 1798 , he raised the Holkham Yeoman Cavalry , commanding it as a Major , to defend against any invasion . This unit was dissolved in 1802 with the Peace of Amiens , but after war broke out again a year later more volunteer regiments were formed . Coke was notably absent from any preparations for defence , feeling that the risks of invasion were exaggerated , but was eventually persuaded by public opinion to reform the Yeoman Cavalry in 1803 ; it was again dissolved in 1805 . 
 The French Revolution had split the Whigs into two factions , but as it progressed Fox 's group in support of the revolutionaries began to dwindle . Coke stuck by Fox , and with the outbreak of the War , the split became finalised ; Fox refused to accept that Britain need be involved in conflict , as did Coke . In Parliament , Coke spoke out against the conflict , debating the motion to raise money for the war through a new tax in April 1794 , and supporting Wilberforce 's anti @-@ war motion on 24 March 1795 . He felt more comfortable with local matters , however , and his main concerns " were those of the agricultural interest " , arguing against a new land tax and introducing a bill to shorten the shooting season , allowing for the production of more corn . Coke was again returned to Parliament in 1796 , despite an anti @-@ war and anti @-@ government address to the electorate which was condemned as arrogant and dictatorial , but found on his return that the <unk> had agreed to withdraw from Parliamentary activity . 
 After Parliament was dissolved in June 1802 , another election saw Coke again returned , although in a contested election that cost the candidates £ 35 @,@ 000 . With the death of William Pitt in 1806 , the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance , which took the form of the Ministry of All the Talents ; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary , and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies . The government apparently offered Coke a peerage , which he refused , and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery , which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806 . Fox 's death made Parliament lose some of its appeal to Coke , as they had been close friends . His attendance in the next two years was very limited , and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws , which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815 . 
 With the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo , the wars in Europe ended , and the troops returned home . As a result , the nation underwent dramatic shifts due to rising unemployment as the economy shifted and the government began to pay off its debts incurred during 20 years of war . Agricultural prices slumped , and Coke became active in opposing tax increases which would impact on the farmers . In February 1816 he spoke out against income and malt tax , and in March attacked the property tax as " utterly at variance with civil liberty " . An opponent of government excess in a time of unemployment and high taxation , he also voted against the army estimates and opposed the Civil List in May . With a County Meeting on 5 April 1817 , Coke spoke on the King 's intent on " overturning democracy and enslaving the country " by restricting freedom of speech and the press , suggesting that the government needed to be removed . 
 Returning to Parliament in 1818 , he argued against the Royal Households Bill and introduced a Game Law Amendment Bill , which was defeated . Following the Peterloo Massacre and the government 's introduction of a Seditious Meetings Prevention Bill , Coke accused the government of being " most strongly implicated in the events in Manchester " , saying that the meeting would have been peaceful had it not been " interfered with by the officious agents of authority " . The 1820s saw Coke speak far less ; firstly , because of the continued Tory domination of Parliament , and secondly because of his remarriage . In 1822 , at the age of 68 and after 21 years as a widower , he married Anne Keppel , the daughter of Lord Albemarle , and Coke 's 18 @-@ year @-@ old godchild . Anne had initially been brought to Holkham to partner with his nephew William , who due to Coke 's lack of sons would inherit the estate , but they failed to get on . Anne and Coke 's marriage was met with bemusement , and described as " absurd " , but despite opposition took place on 26 February . Soon after the wedding Anne became pregnant , and their son Thomas was born on 22 December . 
 In 1831 , Coke 's personal friend Earl Grey became Prime Minister ; as a result , Coke 's appearances in Parliament became more regular . He expressed delight at the Great Reform Act 1832 , although he only spoke on the subject once , and chose its passage on 4 June 1832 as the appropriate moment to retire as an MP . As the " greatest commoner in England " , Coke finally accepted a peerage in July 1837 ( having been offered one six times before ) , becoming the Earl of Leicester . He took no pleasure in attending the House of Lords , however , describing it as " the hospital for <unk> " . 
 = = Death = = 
 Coke remained in the prime of life after his retirement ; records show him killing 24 deer with 25 shots at the age of 79 , and having another child three years later . A portrait painted of him which appears to be of a man 20 years younger , is according to Stirling " no flattering likeness " , but instead completely accurate . After a short and painful illness while visiting his estate ( and childhood home ) at Longford Hall , Derbyshire , Coke died in the early hours of 30 June 1842 at the age of 88 ; his last words were reported to be " well , perhaps I have talked too much " . The body lay in state for two days , with the funeral procession finally setting out on 7 July . It travelled through King 's Lynn , where black flags of mourning were flown and thousands came to pay their respects . On the final leg of the journey , with a funeral procession two miles in length led by 150 Holkham tenants on horseback and followed by several hundreds of private carriages , 200 gentlemen on horseback , riding two abreast , and lastly , a long train of neighbours , tenants and yeomen , Coke was eventually buried at the family mausoleum in <unk> on 11 July . Immediately after Coke 's death , a committee formed to create a monument to him ; over a thousand subscribers contributed £ 5 @,@ 000 . The eventual Coke Monument , found in the grounds of Holkham Hall , was designed by William Donthorne and finally completed in 1851 .

New routes were opened from Oslo Airport , Fornebu to Bodø , Harstad / Narvik and Tromsø , but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated . International routes to Rome , Nice and Jersey were introduced . In 1996 , Braathens SAFE bought Sweden 's second @-@ largest airline , Transwede , and started flying on the Oslo – Stockholm route . The following year , Transwede , with its five domestic routes , was merged into Braathens SAFE . The same year , KLM bought 30 % of Braathens SAFE and the airlines started a partnership . 
 In 1998 , the airline changed its name to Braathens and introduced two @-@ class cabins . Full @-@ fare passengers traveled in the " Best " -class , while discounted travelers traveled in the " Back " -class . It also bought the Swedish airline Malmö Aviation . Oslo Airport , Gardermoen replaced Fornebu as the airline 's main hub , and a price war started against SAS and the new low @-@ cost airline Color Air . The availability of slots increased the frequency of flights for all three airlines to an unsustainable level . After a year , Color Air was bankrupt , but Braathens had suffered large losses , and terminated many routes , including all services in Sweden . In 2001 , the airline was bought by SAS , and the following year the two coordinated their services so as not to compete . On 1 May 2004 , they merged to create SAS Braathens , that re @-@ branded to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007 . 
 = = Deregulation = = 
 The deregulation process , which would eliminate the need for concessions for routes , was driven by Norway 's application for membership of the EU . This was supported by the Labor Party and the right @-@ winged Conservative Party and Progress Party . The plans from the EU indicated that international routes within EU should be deregulated from 1 January 1993 , with Norway and Sweden joining from 1 July . Full , domestic liberalization should be performed by 1 April 1997 . SAS and Braathens SAFE proposed a solution where only Norwegian airlines could compete until 1997 , which was thought to efficiently hinder other airlines , rather than these two , until then . SAS announced its support for competition on 4 February 1993 , while Braathens SAFE stated that it no longer was in favor of competition , despite having arguing for this for the whole of the company 's history . The company stated that stability was needed and that competition would result in marginalized routes , that were being cross @-@ subsidized , being closed . SAS stated that with competition , prices would fall 20 – 30 % , and that SAS wanted to operate with a loss to force Braathens SAFE close services . 
 During the discussion about deregulation , Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself . In particular , it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa , British Airways and KLM about an alliance , but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE , stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner 's hub . Minister of Transport , Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway , Jan <unk> , both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS , to ensure that the company had a 100 % market share on the primary routes before the merger . This would , according to them , secure that no foreign company could compete with the merged company . The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE 's management . Still , negotiations started between the companies in 1992 , although they were quickly abandoned . The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK 1 @.@ 2 billion , but that this had been rejected as too expensive by SAS . 
 Prior to a government report being presented on 30 March 1993 , SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of free competition , while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date . <unk> SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war . Bjørn G. Braathen stated that the company had bought the new aircraft based on the belief that deregulation would occur in 1997 , giving the airline time to pay more of the debt . On 2 June 1993 , with 76 against 18 votes , parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994 . It was supported by the Labor , Conservative and Progress Party . With this , Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate , after Sweden and the United Kingdom . 
 Both Braathens SAFE and SAS had been cross @-@ subsidizing their routes . Through the regulations , the airlines had agreed to fly to unprofitable airports , in exchange for making higher profits on other routes . With free competition , this would not be followed , and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable . To finance these , a NOK 10 fee would be charged on all primary routes . The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports . Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund – Bergen and Oslo – Røros – Trondheim were not profitable . 
 To meet the free market situation , the company 's management introduced measures to keep costs low . On 19 August 1993 , ten of eleven trade unions agreed to a three @-@ year wage contract , which contained bonuses for all employees based on the company 's profit . The cabin crew 's union had a two @-@ day strike , before reaching an agreement . At the same time , the company needed NOK 400 million in share capital . Braathens Rederi sold the sister company Braathens Helikopter to <unk> Service for NOK 225 million on 30 September 1993 , and the money was used to buy Braathens SAFE stock . The company raised further capital in an initial public offering , and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994 . After the listing , Braathens Rederi retained 69 % of the company . 
 On 1 April , Braathens SAFE increased the number of services . The daily number of flights from Oslo to Bergen increased to nine , and the airline introduced four new services to Northern Norway from Oslo : two each to Tromsø and Harstad / Narvik . Later , the frequency to Tromsø increased to four , and from 28 June there were also two daily round trips to Bodø . SAS increased its services on the routes from Oslo to Stavanger and Trondheim , and from Bergen to Stavanger . The liberalization did not result in a price war , and prices remained constant . The following two years , Braathens SAFE also introduced scheduled international flights to Rome , as well as summer routes to Jersey and Nice . However , Braathens SAFE terminated their routes from Bergen to Bodø , Harstad / Narvik and Tromsø , making the passengers switch planes in Trondheim . 
 In 1995 , Braathens signed agreements with many of the large companies in Norway as a prioritized airline . Several of the contracts had been secured by the airline offering discounts to the companies in exchange for not allowing their customers to collect frequent flyer points . SAS had not allowed this scheme , and had lost companies such as Statoil , Aker and the Government of Norway . 
 = = Expansion into Sweden = = 
 In 1996 , Braathens SAFE started negotiations to purchase the Swedish airline Transwede Airways from its owners , <unk> . After SAS had bought Linjeflyg , Transwede had become the second @-@ largest domestic airline in Sweden , operating five Fokker 100s . In 1995 , Braathens SAFE had a revenue of NOK 4 billion , with a profit of NOK 242 million . The same year , Transwede had lost NOK 200 million with a revenue of NOK 1 @.@ 2 billion . The company had been split in two , a charter and a scheduled company , and Braathens SAFE started negotiating to purchase the scheduled company . Transwede 's scheduled services were at the time form Stockholm @-@ Arlanda Airport to Halmstad , Jönköping , Luleå , Sundsvall and Umeå , plus a service from Luleå to Sundsvall . It had a 13 % market share , transporting 800 @,@ 000 people in 1995 , and had been through a major restructuring the year before , where the fleet had been reduced from seven to five aircraft . 
 On 18 June , Braathens SAFE announced that starting on 27 October , the company put one aircraft into service on the route from Oslo to Stockholm . SAS had at the time fifteen round trips on the route , and Braathens planned to introduce seven . The route was considered one of the most profitable for SAS . The purchase of Transwede was confirmed on 25 June ; Braathens SAFE bought 50 % of the company 's scheduled division , Transwede Airways , with an option to purchase the rest in 1997 . The companies planned to integrate their networks , to allow connection between Braathens SAFE 's and Transwede flights at Stockholm . Services to Stockholm started on 6 November ; after three months , the airline had captured 14 % of the Oslo – Stockholm market . In 1996 , Braathens SAFE had a 51 % domestic market share in Norway , transporting 9 @.@ 5 million passengers . 
 On 3 February 1997 , the airline announced it had ordered six 134 @-@ seat Boeing 737 @-@ 700 aircraft for NOK 1 @.@ 5 billion . These aircraft would be delivered in 1998 , prior to the opening of the new airport at Gardermoen . In addition , the airline had an option for additional ten planes to be delivered after 2000 . In 1997 , Transwede started replacing its Fokker 100s with Boeing 737s . In May 1997 , Braathens SAFE was criticized by the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association because it was using retired Braathens SAFE pilots to fly Transwede aircraft , due to Transwede not having certified pilots for their new Boeing 737 @-@ 300 . Braathens SAFE stated that this was within the rules of the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration and the Joint Aviation Authorities . 
 In 1997 , SAS announced that it was going to reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5 % . Braathens followed , reducing from 8 to 5 % from 1 January 1998 . However , to try to attract more business passengers , the airline retained the 8 % commission on their international routes . At the same time , the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state @-@ employed civil servants ' flights . Instead , they introduced an annual tender for the routes . It was awarded to SAS , who also won all subsequent tenders . For Braathens SAFE , this meant that state @-@ employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly . The contract was worth NOK 500 million for SAS . 
 On 1 April 1997 , the European airline market was fully deregulated . At this time , British Airways announced increased activity to Scandinavia , based in part on a cooperation with Braathens SAFE concerning their frequently flyer program ; holders of Bracard were allowed to collect frequent flyer points on British Airways ' flights . On 3 April , Braathens SAFE , Transwede and Finnair signed an agreement involving codesharing on Finnair 's flights from Stockholm and Oslo to Helsinki , Bracard members would be granted points on Finnair flights , and Braathens SAFE took over Finnair 's handling services in Oslo . 
 On 18 December , Braathens SAFE bought the remaining half of Transwede , paying 2 Swedish krona for the who company . However , due to an agreement about converting debt into share capital , the company was sold for SEK 13 million . With the take @-@ over , the company changed its name to Braathens Sverige AB . At the same time , management announced that they planned to replace all the company 's Fokker 100s with 737 @-@ 300s . 
 = = Partnership and new identity = = 
 On 18 August 1997 , Braathens SAFE announced a strategic partnership with the Dutch airline KLM . The partnership replaced the agreement with British Airways , and became active in 1998 . Analysts stated that the partnership came as a reaction to SAS ' alliance with Lufthansa , the Star Alliance , that had been created the previous year . Braathens SAFE had also been in negotiations with British Airways . The agreement involved KLM purchasing a 30 % stake in Braathens SAFE from Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi for NOK 800 million . In addition , Braathens SAFE started flying from several Norwegian cities to KLM 's main hub at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam . In addition , the partnership involved a coordination of scheduling , prices , frequent flyer programs , corporate customer agreements , maintenance and procurement . The partnership also involved cooperation with the American airline Northwest Airlines . In 1997 , Braathens SAFE and Transwede had a revenue of NOK 5 @.@ 4 billion and made a profit of NOK 206 million , down 88 million from 1996 . 
 Starting in March , Braathens SAFE took over KLM 's routes from Stavanger to Amsterdam , and started a new route from Trondheim to Amsterdam . From 26 March 1998 , Braathens SAFE moved its flights to London from Gatwick to London Stansted Airport . At the same time , it announced that the number of daily services from Oslo to London would increase from one to three , following the opening of Gardermoen . In addition , KLM @-@ partner AirUK would become an agent for Braathens SAFE , and the company hoped that 40 % of the sales on the route would be sold in the United Kingdom . The agreement also involved a codesharing agreement with AirUK , including some onwards flights from London , notably the route to Dublin . At the same time , Braathens SAFE announced that the airline would start selling more discounted tickets on the London @-@ flights , to compete with Ryanair 's new route from <unk> to Sandefjord Airport , Torp . 
 On 23 March 1998 , Braathens SAFE changed its name and corporate identity to Braathens . It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom , and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract , silver wing , that became the company 's new logo . The re @-@ branding was an attempt to create an international identity , and tone down the Norwegian national symbols that had been on the airplanes since 1946 . At the same time , a two @-@ class configuration was introduced : the ' Best ' section , accounting for 70 % of the planes capacity , received higher seat pitch , complimentary in @-@ flight drinks , meals and newspapers , priority boarding and refundable tickets . The ' Back ' section was for discount ticket holders , who received a no @-@ frills service with a smaller seat pitch , and were located at the back of the aircraft behind a curtain . Best tickets became NOK 300 more expensive , while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets . The scheme was , according to Erik G. Braathen , an attempt to differentiate between the full @-@ fare customers , with whom Braathens was competing with SAS , and the low @-@ fare customers , who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to @-@ be established Color Air . The scheme as first introduced on the first 737 @-@ 700 that was delivered . 
 The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions encouraged its 800 @,@ 000 members to not fly with Braathens due to the introduction of a segregated classes . SAS did not follow the same policy , and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens ' , including complimentary service . After introduction , the concept increased the work load on handing employees , who needed to check the passengers ' tickets to ensure they sat in the right class . There were also complaints from Best @-@ passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced . 
 On 17 August 1998 , Braathens bought Malmö Aviation , that flew from Stockholm @-@ Bromma Airport to Gothenburg @-@ <unk> Airport and Malmö Airport . In addition , it served all three airports from London City Airport . The airline had eleven British Aerospace 146 jets . In 1997 , it had 772 @,@ 000 passengers , 450 employees , a revenue of SEK 900 million and a profit of SEK 40 million . The airline cost SEK 600 million and the deal gave Braathens and Malmö Aviation a 25 % domestic market share in Sweden . 
 = = Price war = = 
 In January 1998 , Olav Nils Sunde , owner of the <unk> company Color Line , announced that he would start a domestic low @-@ cost airline . They company aimed for a 15 – 20 % domestic market share and was named Color Air . The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way , and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend . 
 From 1 April , a new NOK 65 tax was introduced on all domestic flights . Braathens and SAS decided to divide the cross @-@ subsidize the taxes between their routes , something Color Air was not able to do . This was because the tax was only valid for routes within Southern Norway ; Braathens and SAS could therefore tacitly collude to increase the prices to Northern Norway , and thereby subsidize their routes in Southern Norway . Color Air on the other hand would be forced to put the full tax on all its departures . While the government had no way to hinder the incumbents from doing this , Gudmund <unk> , Minister of Finance from the Center Party , encouraged the airlines to not " cheat " , and follow the intentions of the law , even if he admitted that there was nothing the government could do to hinder the airlines from cross @-@ subsidizing . 
 Color Air started with flights from Gardermoen on 1 August , two months before the airport opened . Gardermoen was taken into use on 8 October by SAS and Braathens . Both immediately increased the number of flights . Braathens established a route to Haugesund , while SAS started routes to Ålesund and Kristiansand . The number of daily trips from Oslo for SAS increased from 59 to over 80 . In total , the three companies increased their daily round trip from 138 to 200 , and the daily seat capacity from 18 @,@ 000 to 26 @,@ 000 . Ålesund had the largest increase , from seven daily round trips with only Braathens , to seventeen offered by all three companies . 
 In late 1998 and early 1999 , KLM and Braathens introduced direct flights from Sandefjord and Kristiansand to Amsterdam . Braathens also started flights from Sandefjord to Stavanger and Bergen . On 1 May 1999 , Northwest Airlines started flights to its hub at Minneapolis @-@ Saint Paul International Airport in the United States . This service was terminated in October . The Northwest service had a connection to Stockholm as well as a new route from Oslo to Gothenburg , operated by Braathens . After Northwest announced the withdrawal of their service , the Gothenburg service was also terminated . 
 In November 1998 , Color Air introduced a new cheapest ticket for NOK 345 . After the winter settled , the ice front between Color Air and Braathens grew colder following Braathens ' denying Color Air to use their deicing equipment at Ålesund , resulting in the plane being stuck at the airport . By the end of 1998 , it became clear that Braathens had increased capacity with 20 % , but only achieved a 5 @.@ 2 % ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen . Similar numbers were applicable for SAS . The business market , in particular the large corporations with divisions in several cities , were demanding high frequencies on the routes . Color Air could get by with fewer departures , because they mainly targeted the leisure segment . In particular , the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization ; to Ålesund there were 1 @.@ 2 million flown seats annually , but only 345 @,@ 000 passengers , giving a 29 % cabin load . 
 In September 1999 , SAS announced that if Braathens took the first step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo , they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures . However , Braathens was not willing to reduce . On 15 September , Color Air announced that they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger on 1 October , following the delivery of their fourth aircraft . At the same time , the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two . In January 1999 , Braathens applied to register twenty of its Norwegian aircraft in Sweden , following their discovery that foreign @-@ registered aircraft , such as Color Air 's and SAS ' , did not have to pay value added tax on good sold on board . This was rejected by the Norwegian Armed Forces , who based their need of transport of military personnel during war time on requisition of civilian , Norwegian @-@ registered aircraft . The same month , Geir Olsen , head of Braathens in Sweden , withdrew from his position , due to disagreements about the corporate strategy . 
 On 27 September 1999 , Color Air terminated all flights and ceased operations . On the day of the termination , the stock price of Braathens increased by 16 % . Immediately following the bankruptcy , the two airlines increased their prices . Subsequently Braathens increased their ticket price by 15 % , but stated that this had nothing to do with the elimination of competition , since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes . In November , Braathens started to remove routes , and announced they would increase prices by 20 % . They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the tail , which since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver , abstract wing . Both Braathens and SAS lost more than NOK 1 billion in 1999 , totaling the cost of the price war between the three airlines to exceed NOK 3 billion . 
 = = Crisis = = 
 On 23 July 1999 , Braathens replaced its CEO with Arne A. Jensen . He introduced the program Improve 800 , that was to improve the bottom line with NOK 800 million . In February 1999 , Braathens merged the Swedish division with Malmö Aviation , to create Braathens Malmö Aviation . At the same time , the airline removed the ' Best ' and ' Back ' scheme on domestic Swedish flights . In November , Braathens terminated all services in Sweden that were inherited from Transwede . The Fokker 100 aircraft and Boeing 737 @-@ 300 aircraft were sold , and the service from Oslo to Stockholm taken over by the company 's Norwegian department . Malmö Aviation retained on flights from Stockholm @-@ Bromma to Gothenburg and Malmö , as well as to London City . In addition , a Stockholm to Halmstad Airport service was started . In 1999 , Braathens lost SEK 300 million in Sweden , bringing the total loss of Braathens Swedish operations since 1996 to SEK 600 million . At the same time , Braathens terminated its services from Sandefjord to Stavanger and Bergen , and the route from Oslo to Haugesund . From 25 June 2000 , the company also terminated its Oslo to Stockholm route . Instead , the planes were put into service to Malaga and Alicante . 
 During 1999 , domestic air ticket prices increased 9 @.@ 2 % , and another 17 % the following year . By 2001 , the domestic capacity was below the level before Gardermoen opened . Braathens and SAS started cooperating to set the full @-@ price tickets on routes to eleven cities . This meant that the prices were identical on all the routes where both airlines flew , although they were not allowed to make such cooperation with discounted tickets . During the crisis , Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity . The company announced in 2000 that they were considering purchasing a smaller type of aircraft , that would replace the 737s on some routes , and that would allow Braathens to start operating the Norwegian Air Shuttle services themselves . 
 The ' Best ' and ' Back ' service was highly criticized by analysts and customers . Braathens SAFE had a strong image , and unlike SAS , that was branded as ' The Businessman 's Airline ' , Braathens SAFE was seen as the people 's airline . It also drew goodwill from being Norwegian @-@ owned , and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane . Prior to the rebranding , no airline in Norway had ever operated a two @-@ class service on domestic flights — including SAS . Professor of Sociology Per Morten <unk> commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers . Customers who previously had been paying full price , became more aware of the savings on using ' Back ' tickets . At the same time , people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second @-@ rate customers with SAS . This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends . The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate , but also increased operating expenses , because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class . Planes were sometimes delayed for hours , particularly in the beginning of the service , due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew . 
 On 25 November 2000 , Braathens terminated the route to Murmansk . On 2 January 2001 , they also terminated the routes from Molde to Kristiansand and from Kristiansand to Trondheim , the routes to Røros from Trondheim and Oslo , and the services from Oslo to Newcastle . The routes from Bergen to Haugesund were reduced from five to three round trips , and the Bergen – Molde – Trondheim route was reduced from four to three . The capacity on the routes from Oslo to Molde and Kristiansund were increased . A second round trip was introduced from Stavanger to Newcastle , flown by Norwegian Air Shuttle . From 15 February , the airline introduced four weekly services from Oslo to Barcelona , and from 1 March , three weekly round trips to directly from Longyearbyen to Oslo . A direct service was introduced from Bergen to Alicante from 7 April . 
 = = Take @-@ over = = 
 On 21 May 2001 , SAS and Braathens announced that KLM and Braathens Rederi had agreed to sell their 69 % stake in Braathens for NOK 800 million to SAS — <unk> Braathens to NOK 1 @.@ 1 billion . Braathens had contacted British Airways , but they had stated that they did not wish to purchase Braathens . The deal with SAS was initiated by Braathens ; they stated that this would allow the two companies to cooperate to eliminate the overcapacity in the domestic market . Because both airlines operated a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft , about NOK 150 million could be saved in maintenance . The agreement also involved that Malmö Aviation would have to be sold before the take @-@ over . If not , the Braathens family would purchase the airline for NOK 1 . At the same time , the family @-@ owned companies guaranteed for about NOK 1 billion in the Swedish subsidiary . 
 The Norwegian Competition Authority announced that since the new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports , it was unlikely that the take @-@ over would receive permission from them . However , it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs . On 20 August , the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens ; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens . Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed . The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take @-@ over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline 's incentive to provide discounted tickets , because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor , and that they would not need low @-@ paying customers to fill up the vacant seats . Instead , the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights . While Braathens also was opposed to the tax , they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company . 
 CEO Arne A. Jensen stated to the press that he felt that the cause of the problems were made in 1993 , when the airline failed to make the correct choices in relation to the deregulation . He stated that he felt that part of the cause was that KLM and the Braathens family had cancelled a planned private placement . He further stated that a monopoly was the best for society , the passengers and the employees . He also stated that if the appeal failed , he had a " Plan B " , involving a much smaller airline that would compete with SAS on the main routes . From October , the airline terminated its service to Milan and reduced capacity on some domestic routes ; this removed the need for two aircraft . In addition , the airline increased all ticket prices with 5 % , due to higher insurance costs . 
 On 23 October 2001 , the Competition Authority granted permission for SAS to purchase Braathens . The rationale was that there were no other realistic purchasers for the airline , and that a bankruptcy was imminent without the take @-@ over . As a condition , the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs , and stated that it would ban cross @-@ subsidization aimed at <unk> or operating at a loss to force new entrants out of the market . 
 = = Coordinated operation = = 
 By then , SAS had taken sixteen aircraft out of service , reduced production with 12 % and fired 1 @,@ 000 employees . The airline stated that they wished to renegotiate the agreement with the Braathens family and KLM to reduce the price . Because there had <unk> a situation with high over @-@ capacity of aircraft , the value of planes had fallen . In addition , SAS demanded that Braathens reduce its fleet from 33 to 23 aircraft if the deal was to go through , threatening to terminate the purchase if the airline did not abide . 
 On 2 April 2002 , SAS and Braathens split all the routes between them . SAS started flying on the main @-@ haul routes from Oslo to Trondheim , Bergen and Stavanger , with only a few flights to Stavanger flown by Braathens to get planes to the technical base there . From Oslo and Trondheim to Northern Norway , all routes were taken over by Braathens , with exception of a few flights made by SAS to Tromsø and Bodø . SAS also withdrew their flights from Oslo to Kristiansand and Ålesund , and Braathens increased their frequency on the route . Braathens retained the routes it had flown where SAS had not formerly flown . Braathens also kept the international flights to Barcelona , Nice , Malaga and Alicante . This reduced the overcapacity in the market , and allowed the SAS Group to save between NOK 600 and 900 million . 
 For a short period , members of both Wings and SAS ' <unk> could collect points from the other airlines . But from 1 July , the awarding of frequent flyer miles on domestic <unk> was no longer permitted . From 1 April 2003 , the West Coast routes , which had been on contract with Norwegian Air Shuttle , were taken over by SAS Commuter . 
 On 24 April 2002 , SAS announced that all handling services operated by Braathens would be taken over by SAS Ground Services . All SAS employees would be prioritized in the rationalization process , and 800 Braathens employees were laid off . Three hundred Braathens ' employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services , but these lost their seniority . No employees in SAS lost their jobs . The case ended in the courts , where 369 former Braathens employees sued SAS to receive the same seniority as they had in Braathens . On 15 October 2003 , Asker and Bærum District Court decided that only 42 of the employees , those working in Kristiansund and Molde , had right to keep their seniority . The case was appealed , and on 18 March 2005 , Borgarting Court of Appeal , with four against three votes , decided in favor of SAS , denying the employees their claim . The matter was not settled until 31 January 2006 , when the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in favor of the employees . 
 By 2004 , Braathens had managed to cut costs sufficiently to make a profit . At the same time , SAS was having problems making a profit . SAS announced on 10 March 2004 that SAS and Braathens would be merged into a single company , SAS Braathens , in May . At the same time , the airline would create separate national airlines for Sweden and Denmark . SAS Braathens would operate 50 aircraft , all variations of the 737 . The company took over the operating licence of Braathens , including the IATA and ICAO code , and callsign . Because all the operations streamlined and coordinated , there would be no further <unk> due to the merger . From 1 June 2007 , SAS Braathens was rebranded to Scandinavian Airlines , making it identical to the branding in Sweden and Denmark , although it remain a separate limited company named SAS Norge AS . 
 = Early life and military career of John McCain = 
 The early life and military career of John Sidney McCain III spans the first forty @-@ five years of his life ( 1936 – 1981 ) . McCain 's father and grandfather were admirals in the United States Navy . McCain was born on August 29 , 1936 , in the Panama Canal Zone , and attended many schools growing up as his family moved among naval facilities . McCain graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1958 . He married the former Carol Shepp in 1965 ; he adopted two children from her previous marriage and they had another child together . 
 As a naval aviator , McCain flew attack aircraft from carriers . During the Vietnam War , he narrowly escaped death in the 1967 Forrestal fire . On his twenty @-@ third bombing mission in October 1967 , he was shot down over Hanoi and badly injured . He subsequently endured five and a half years as a prisoner of war , including periods of torture . In 1968 , he refused a North Vietnamese offer of early release , because it would have meant leaving before other prisoners who had been held longer . He was released in 1973 after the Paris Peace Accords . 
 Upon his return , McCain studied at the National War College , commanded a large training squadron in Florida , and was appointed the Navy liaison to the U.S. Senate . He divorced his wife Carol in 1980 and married the former Cindy Hensley shortly thereafter . He retired from the Navy in 1981 as a captain .

 John Sidney McCain III was born on August 29 , 1936 , at a United States Navy hospital at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone , which at that time was considered to be among the unincorporated territories of the United States . His parents were Navy officer John S. " Jack " McCain , Jr . ( 1911 – 1981 ) and Roberta ( Wright ) McCain ( born 1912 ) . McCain is of Scots @-@ Irish and English ancestry . 
 John McCain 's grandparents were natives of Arkansas , Mississippi , and Texas , and much of his ancestry was Southern on both his mother 's side and father 's side . The McCain family 's patrilineal ancestral home is in Mississippi 's Carroll County ; they owned and ran a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 8 @.@ 1 km2 ) plantation in <unk> from 1848 until 1952 . The plantation had slaves before the American Civil War – some of whose descendants share the surname and call themselves the " black McCains " – and sharecroppers afterward ; influential blues guitarist Mississippi John Hurt was born on the plantation to one of the latter . 
 The McCain family tree has a long heritage of American military service , with ancestors fighting as soldiers in the Indian Wars , American Revolutionary War ( due to which McCain maintains a membership with the Sons of the American Revolution ) , War of 1812 , for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War , and in World War I. The tree also includes roguish behavior and economic success . John McCain 's maternal grandfather , Archibald Wright ( 1875 – 1971 ) , was a Mississippi native who migrated to Muskogee , Oklahoma , in his twenties , ran afoul of the law with several gambling and bootlegging charges , then became a strong @-@ willed wildcatter who prospered on land deals during the early statehood years and struck oil in the Southwest . Rich by age forty , he never worked again and became a stay @-@ at @-@ home father . Raising a family in Oklahoma and Southern California , he instilled in Roberta and her twin sister Rowena a lifelong habit of travel and adventure . There is also independent @-@ minded behavior in the family tree : Jack McCain and Roberta Wright eloped and married in a bar in Tijuana , Mexico , when Archibald Wright 's wife Myrtle objected to Roberta 's association with a sailor . 
 McCain 's father and paternal grandfather eventually became Navy admirals , and were the first father – son pair to achieve four @-@ star admiral rank . His grandfather , Admiral John S. " Slew " McCain , Sr. ( 1884 – 1945 ) , was a pioneer of aircraft carrier operations who in 1942 commanded all land @-@ based air operations in support of the Guadalcanal Campaign , and who ultimately in 1944 – 1945 aggressively led the Fast Carrier Task Force in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II . His operations off the Philippines and Okinawa , and air strikes against Formosa and the Japanese home islands , caused tremendous destruction of Japanese naval and air forces in the closing period of the war . His death four days after the Japanese surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay was front page news . Jack McCain was a submarine commander in several theaters of operation in World War II and was decorated with both the Silver Star and Bronze Star . 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 For his first ten years , " Johnny " McCain ( the nickname he was given as part of a family tradition of distinguishing the generations ) was frequently uprooted as his family , including older sister Sandy ( born 1934 ) and younger brother Joe ( born 1942 ) , followed his father to New London , Connecticut , Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , and other stations in the Pacific Ocean . Summer vacations were sometimes spent at the family 's <unk> plantation , but McCain always felt his heritage was military , not Southern . McCain attended whatever naval base school was available , often to the detriment of his education , as schools were sometimes substandard and their curricula often erratic . After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor , his father was absent for long stretches . His formal education was supplemented by the efforts of his mother , who took advantage of the family 's many long @-@ distance travels to expose him to historical and cultural sites . He later wrote , " She taught me to find so much pleasure in life that misfortune could not rob me of the joy of living . " A Republican , she also made sure that he followed current events , although his parents avoided outward partisan affiliations due to his father 's military career . 
 After World War II ended , his father stayed in the Navy , sometimes working political liaison posts . The family settled in Northern Virginia , and McCain attended the educationally stronger St. Stephen 's School in Alexandria from 1946 to 1949 . To his family , McCain had long been quiet , dependable , and courteous , while at St. Stephen 's he began to develop an unruly , defiant streak . Another two years were then spent following his father to naval stations ; altogether he attended about twenty schools during his youth . He was frequently disciplined in school for fighting . He later wrote , " The repeated farewells to friends rank among the saddest regrets of a childhood constantly disrupted by the demands of my father 's career ... At each new school I arrived eager to make , by means of my insolent attitude , new friends to compensate for the loss of others . At each new school I grew more determined to assert my crude individualism . At each new school I became a more unrepentant pain in the neck . " 
 In 1951 , McCain enrolled at Episcopal High School in Alexandria , an academically superior , all @-@ male private boarding school with a rigorous honor code , tradition of hazing , and spartan living environment . Most of the children there were sons of wealthy Southerners , from whom McCain got a glimpse of life and career aspirations outside the Navy culture . Nicknamed " Punk " and " <unk> " due to his combative , fiery disposition , McCain enjoyed and cultivated a tough guy image ; he also made a few friends . McCain earned two varsity letters in wrestling , excelling in the lighter weight classes . He also played on the junior varsity football team and the tennis team , and participated in the student newspaper , yearbook , and drama club . English teacher William Bee Ravenel III , who was also his football coach , became a great influence towards his sense of learning , honor , and self @-@ image . With what he later termed an " undistinguished , but acceptable " academic record , McCain graduated from high school in 1954 . 
 = = = Naval Academy = = = 
 Having done well on its entrance exams , McCain entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , in June 1954 , following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather . He had neither been ordered to go there by his parents nor discussed alternatives ; as he later wrote , " I remember simply recognizing my eventual enrollment at the Academy as an immutable fact of life , and accepting it without comment . " 
 <unk> about his presence there , McCain chose not to conform to the Academy 's rules and some of its traditions . Each year he was given over a hundred demerits – earning him membership in the " Century Club " – for offenses such as shoes not being shined , formation faults , room in disorder , and talking out of place . His father came to the Academy to reprimand him on his behavior a number of times . He hated " plebe year " , the trial by ordeal and hazing of entering midshipmen that would eventually weed out one quarter of the class . He did not take well to those of higher rank arbitrarily wielding power over him – " It was bullshit , and I resented the hell out of it " – and occasionally intervened when he saw it being done to others . At 5 @-@ foot 7 inches and 127 pounds ( 1 @.@ 70 m and 58 kg ) , he competed as a lightweight boxer for three years , where he lacked skills but was fearless and " didn 't have a reverse gear " . In his final year , he managed the battalion boxing team to a brigade championship . 
 Possessed of a strong intelligence , McCain did well in a few subjects that interested him , such as English literature , history , and government . There was a fixed Bachelor of Science curriculum taken by all midshipmen ; McCain 's classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities on mathematics , science , and engineering courses and thought his low grades were by inclination and not ability , while McCain would later acknowledge that those courses were a struggle for him . His class rank was further lowered by poor grades for conduct and leadership , which reflected his sloppy appearance , rebellious attitude , and poor relations with his company officer . Despite his low standing , he was popular and a leader among his fellow midshipmen , in what biographer Robert Timberg called a " manic , intuitive , highly idiosyncratic way " . Good at attracting women , he was famed for organizing off @-@ Yard activities with a group who called themselves " the Bad Bunch " ; one classmate said that " being on liberty with John McCain was like being in a train wreck . " Other midshipmen were annoyed by his behavior . A June 1957 training cruise aboard the destroyer USS Hunt found McCain showing good skills at the conn , and the destination stop in Rio de Janeiro led to a dream @-@ like romance with Brazilian fashion model and ballerina Maria <unk> that persisted through a Christmastime reunion . 
 McCain graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1958 ; he was fifth from the bottom in class rank , <unk> out of 899 . Despite his difficulties , McCain later wrote that he never defamed the more compelling traditions of the Academy – courage , resilience , honor , and sacrifice for one 's country – and he never wavered in his desire to show his father and family that he was of the same mettle as his naval forebears . Indeed , Slew and Jack McCain had not had sterling records at the Academy themselves , finishing in the bottom third and bottom twentieth respectively . McCain realized later that the Academy had taught him that " to sustain my self @-@ respect for a lifetime it would be necessary for me to have the honor of serving something greater than my self @-@ interest " , a lesson that he would need to carry him through a " desperate and uncertain " time a decade later .

 McCain was commissioned an ensign . He spent two years as a naval aviator in training , first at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida through September 1959 , and then at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas , during which time he was promoted to lieutenant , junior grade . He earned a reputation as a party man , as he drove a Corvette , dated an exotic dancer named " Marie the Flame of Florida " , spent all his free time on the beach or in a Bachelor Officer Quarters room turned bar and friendly gambling den , and , as he later said , " generally misused my good health and youth " . He began as a sub @-@ par flier : he had limited patience for studying aviation manuals , and spent study time reading history books instead . He was not assigned to the elite units flying fighter aircraft , and instead became a pilot of attack aircraft . During a March 1960 practice run in Texas , he lost track of his altitude and speed , and his single @-@ seat , single @-@ <unk> @-@ engine AD @-@ 6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom . Although momentarily knocked unconscious by the impact , he squeezed out of the cockpit and swam ten feet to the surface , escaping without major injuries . He graduated from flight school at Corpus Christi in May 1960 . He joined squadron VA @-@ 42 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia for five months of further training on the Skyraider . 
 Starting in November 1960 , McCain flew Skyraiders with the VA @-@ 65 " World Famous Fighting Tigers " squadron on the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise . The carriers were based at Naval Station Norfolk and cruised in the Caribbean and in several deployments to the Mediterranean . His aviation skills improved , but around December 1961 he collided with power lines while recklessly flying too low over southern Spain . The area suffered a power outage , but McCain was able to return his damaged Skyraider to Intrepid . 
 On board for Enterprise 's maiden voyage in January 1962 , McCain gained visibility with the captain and shipboard publicity that fellow sailors and aviators attributed to his famous last name . McCain was made a lieutenant in June 1962 , and was on alert duty on Enterprise when it helped enforce the naval quarantine of Cuba during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis . In November 1963 , he was rotated back to shore duty , serving nine months on the staff of the Naval Air Basic Training Command at Pensacola . In September 1964 , he became a flight instructor with the VT @-@ 7 training squadron at Naval Air Station Meridian in Mississippi , where McCain Field had been named for his grandfather . 
 During the 1964 stint at Pensacola , McCain began a relationship with Carol Shepp , a successful swimwear and runway model originally from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . They had known each other at the Naval Academy and she had married and then divorced one of his classmates . McCain told her he wanted to do something important with his life , so he would be recorded in history . On July 3 , 1965 , McCain married Shepp in Philadelphia . She already had two children , Douglas and Andrew , born in 1959 and 1962 respectively ; he adopted them in 1966 . Carol and he then had a daughter named Sidney in September 1966 . 
 In July 1965 , McCain appeared as a contestant on the quiz show Jeopardy ! ( during the Art Fleming era ) , winning one game and losing the next . 
 In November 1965 , he had his third accident when apparent engine failure in his T @-@ 2 Buckeye trainer jet over the Eastern Shore of Virginia led to his ejecting safely before his plane crashed . While at Meridian , McCain requested a combat assignment . In October 1966 , he was slated for upcoming Vietnam War duty , and so reported to the VA @-@ 44 Replacement Air Group squadron at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Florida for training on the A @-@ 4 Skyhawk , a single @-@ seat jet attack aircraft . There McCain was seen as a good pilot , albeit one who tended to " push the envelope " in his flying . Promoted to lieutenant commander in January 1967 , McCain joined the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal by May 1967 , flying Skyhawks with the VA @-@ 46 " <unk> " squadron . Forrestal conducted training exercises in the Atlantic early in the year , then set sail for the Pacific in June . By this time , Jack McCain had risen in the ranks , making rear admiral in 1958 and vice admiral in 1963 ; in May 1967 , he was promoted to four @-@ star admiral , and became Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , U.S. Naval Forces , Europe , stationed in London . 
 = = = Vietnam operations = = = 
 On July 25 , 1967 , Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin and joined Operation Rolling Thunder , the 1965 – 1968 air interdiction and strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam . The alpha strikes flown from Forrestal were against specific , pre @-@ selected targets such as arms depots , factories , and bridges . They were quite dangerous , due to the strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses , which used Soviet @-@ designed and -supplied surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles , anti @-@ aircraft artillery , and MiG jet interceptors . McCain 's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went without incident , and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations , McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator . McCain and his fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from Washington ; he later wrote , " The target list was so restricted that we had to go back and hit the same targets over and over again ... Most of our pilots flying the missions believed that our targets were virtually worthless . In all candor , we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn 't have the least notion of what it took to win the war . " 
 McCain was almost killed on board Forrestal on July 29 , 1967 . While the air wing was preparing to launch attacks , a Zuni rocket from an F @-@ 4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier 's deck . The rocket struck either McCain 's A @-@ 4E Skyhawk or one near it . The impact ruptured the Skyhawk 's fuel tank , which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose . McCain later said , " I thought my aircraft exploded . Flames were everywhere . " McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit , working himself to the nose of the jet , and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck . His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames , but he was able to put it out . He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded ; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet ( three meters ) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments . McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator , then went to Forrestal 's ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire @-@ fighting efforts on the room 's closed @-@ circuit television . The fire killed 134 sailors , injured scores of others , destroyed at least 20 aircraft , and took 24 hours to control . In Saigon a day after the conflagration , McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck , and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple , Jr . , " It 's a difficult thing to say . But now that I 've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship , I 'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam . " But such a change of course was unlikely ; as McCain added , " I always wanted to be in the Navy . I was born into it and I never really considered another profession . But I always had trouble with the regimentation . " 
 As Forrestal headed to port for repairs , McCain volunteered to join the undermanned VA @-@ 163 " Saints " squadron on board the USS Oriskany . This carrier had earlier endured its own deck fire disaster and its squadrons had suffered some of the heaviest losses during Rolling Thunder . The Saints had a reputation for aggressive , daring attacks , but paid the price : in 1967 , one @-@ third of their pilots were killed or captured , and all of their original fifteen A @-@ 4s had been destroyed . After taking some leave in Europe and back home in Orange Park , Florida , McCain joined Oriskany on September 30 , 1967 , for a tour he expected would finish early the next summer . He volunteered to fly the squadron 's most dangerous missions right away , rather than work his way up to them . During October 1967 , the pilots operated in constant twelve @-@ hour on , twelve @-@ hour off shifts . McCain would be awarded a Navy Commendation Medal for leading his air section through heavy enemy fire during an October 18 raid on the Lac Trai shipyard in Haiphong . On October 25 , McCain successfully attacked the Phúc Yên Air Base north of Hanoi through a barrage of anti @-@ aircraft artillery and surface @-@ to @-@ air missile fire ; credited with destroying one aircraft on the ground and damaging two , the raid would garner him the Bronze Star . Air defenses around Hanoi were at this point the strongest they would be during the entire war .

 On October 26 , 1967 , McCain was flying his twenty @-@ third mission , part of a twenty @-@ plane strike force against the Yen Phu thermal power plant in central Hanoi that previously had almost always been off @-@ limits to U.S. raids due to the possibility of collateral damage . Arriving just before noon , McCain dove from 9 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 feet on his approach ; as he neared the target , warning systems in McCain 's A @-@ 4E Skyhawk alerted him that he was being tracked by enemy fire @-@ control radar . Like other U.S. pilots in similar situations , he did not break off the bombing run , and he held his dive until he released his bombs at about 3 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 000 m ) . As he started to pull up , the Skyhawk 's wing was blown off by a Soviet @-@ made SA @-@ 2 anti @-@ aircraft missile fired by the North Vietnamese Air Defense Command 's 61st Battalion , commanded by Captain Nguyen Lan and with fire control officer Lieutenant Nguyen Xuan Dai . ( McCain was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this day , while Nguyen Xuan Dai was awarded the title Hero of the People 's Armed Forces . Decades later , Soviet Army Lieutenant Yuri <unk> claimed that he had been the missile guidance officer who had shot McCain down . In any case , the raid was a failure , as the power plant was not damaged and three of the attacking planes were shot down . ) 
 McCain 's plane went into a vertical inverted spin . McCain bailed out upside down at high speed ; the force of the ejection fractured his right arm in three places , his left arm , and his right leg at the knee , and knocked him unconscious . McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into <unk> Bạch Lake in Hanoi ; the weight of his equipment was pulling him down , and as he regained consciousness , he could not use his arms . Eventually , he was able to inflate his life vest using his teeth . Several Vietnamese , possibly led by Department of Industry clerk Mai Van On , pulled him ashore . A mob gathered around , spat on him , kicked him , and stripped him of his clothes ; his left shoulder was crushed with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his left foot and abdominal area . He was then transported to Hanoi 's main Hỏa Lò Prison , nicknamed the " Hanoi Hilton " by American POWs . 
 McCain reached Hỏa Lò in as bad a physical condition as any prisoner during the war . His captors refused to give him medical care unless he gave them military information ; they beat and interrogated him , but McCain only offered his name , rank , serial number , and date of birth ( the only information he was required to provide under the Geneva Conventions and permitted to give under the U.S. Code of Conduct ) . Soon thinking he was near death , McCain said he would give them more information if taken to the hospital , hoping he could then put his interrogators off once he was treated . A prison doctor came and said it was too late , as McCain was about to die anyway . Only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a high @-@ ranking admiral did they give him medical care , calling him " the crown prince " . Two days after McCain 's plane went down , that event and his status as a POW made the front pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post . Interrogation and beatings resumed in the hospital ; McCain gave the North Vietnamese his ship 's name , squadron 's name , and the attack 's intended target . This information , along with personal details of McCain 's life and purported statements by McCain about the war 's progress , would appear over the next two weeks in the North Vietnamese official newspaper Nhân Dân as well as in dispatches from outlets such as the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina . <unk> the military information was in violation of the Code of Conduct , which McCain later wrote he regretted , although he saw the information as being of no practical use to the North Vietnamese . Further coerced to give future targets , he named cities that had already been bombed , and responding to demands for the names of his squadron 's members , he supplied instead the names of the Green Bay Packers ' offensive line . 
 McCain spent six weeks in the hospital , receiving marginal care in a dirty , wet environment . A prolonged attempt to set the fractures on his right arm , done without anesthetic , was unsuccessful ; he received an operation on his broken leg but no treatment for his broken left arm . He was temporarily taken to a clean room and interviewed by a French journalist , François <unk> , whose report was carried on the French television program Panorama in January 1968 and later in the U.S. on the CBS Evening News . The film footage of McCain lying in the bed , in a cast , smoking cigarettes and speaking haltingly , would become one of the most widely distributed images of McCain 's imprisonment . McCain was observed by a variety of North Vietnamese , including renowned Vietnamese writer Nguyễn <unk> and Defense Minister and Army commander @-@ in @-@ chief General Võ Nguyên Giáp . Many of the North Vietnamese observers assumed that McCain must be part of America 's political @-@ military @-@ economic elite . Now having lost fifty pounds ( twenty @-@ three kilograms ) , in a chest cast , covered in grime and eyes full of fever , and with his hair turned white , in early December 1967 McCain was sent to a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed " the Plantation " . He was placed in a cell with George " Bud " Day , a badly injured and tortured Air Force pilot ( later awarded the Medal of Honor ) and Norris <unk> , another Air Force pilot ; they did not expect McCain to live another week . <unk> , and subsequently Day , nursed McCain and kept him alive ; Day later remembered that McCain had " a fantastic will to live " . 
 = = = = Solitary = = = = 
 In March 1968 , McCain was put into solitary confinement , where he remained for two years . Unknown to the POWs , in April 1968 , Jack McCain was named Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Pacific Command ( CINCPAC ) effective in July , stationed in Honolulu and commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater . In mid @-@ June , Major Bai , commander of the North Vietnamese prison camp system , offered McCain a chance to return home early . The North Vietnamese wanted to score a worldwide propaganda coup by appearing merciful , and also wanted to show other POWs that members of the elite like McCain were willing to be treated preferentially . McCain turned down the offer of release , due to the POWs ' " first in , first out " interpretation of the U.S. Code of Conduct : he would only accept the offer if every man captured before him was released as well . McCain 's refusal to be released was remarked upon by North Vietnamese senior negotiator Lê Đức Thọ to U.S. envoy Averell Harriman , during the ongoing Paris Peace Talks . Enraged by his declining of the offer , Bai and his assistant told McCain that things would get very bad for him . 
 In late August 1968 , a program of vigorous torture methods began on McCain . The North Vietnamese used rope bindings to put him into prolonged , painful positions and severely beat him every two hours , all while he was suffering from dysentery . His right leg was reinjured , his ribs were cracked , some teeth were broken at the <unk> , and his left arm was re @-@ fractured . Lying in his own waste , his spirit was broken ; the beginnings of a suicide attempt were stopped by guards . After four days of this , McCain signed and taped an anti @-@ American propaganda " confession " that said , in part , " I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate . I almost died , and the Vietnamese people saved my life , thanks to the doctors . " He used stilted Communist jargon and ungrammatical language to signal that the statement was forced . McCain was haunted then and since with the belief that he had dishonored his country , his family , his comrades and himself by his statement , but as he later wrote , " I had learned what we all learned over there : Every man has his breaking point . I had reached mine . " Two weeks later his captors tried to force him to sign a second statement ; his will to resist restored , he refused . He sometimes received two to three beatings per week because of his continued resistance ; the sustained mistreatment went on for over a year . His refusals to cooperate , laced with loud obscenities directed towards his guards , were often heard by other POWs . His boxing experience from his Naval Academy days helped him withstand the battering , and the North Vietnamese did not break him again . 
 Other American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated in order to extract " confessions " and propaganda statements . Many , especially among those who had been captured earlier and imprisoned longer – such as those in the " Alcatraz Gang " – endured even worse treatment than McCain . Under extreme duress , virtually all the POWs eventually yielded something to their captors . There were momentary exceptions : on one occasion , a guard surreptitiously loosened McCain 's painful rope bindings for a night ; when , months later , the guard later saw McCain on Christmas Day , he stood next to McCain and silently drew a cross in the dirt with his foot . In October 1968 , McCain 's isolation was partly relieved when Ernest C. Brace was placed in the cell next to him ; he taught Brace the tap code the prisoners used to communicate . On Christmas Eve 1968 , a church service for the POWs was staged for photographers and film cameras ; McCain defied North Vietnamese instructions to be quiet , speaking out details of his treatment then shouting " Fu @-@ u @-@ u @-@ u @-@ ck you , you son of a bitch ! " and giving the finger whenever a camera was pointed at him . McCain refused to meet with various anti @-@ Vietnam War peace groups coming to Hanoi , such as those led by David Dellinger , Tom Hayden , and Rennie Davis , not wanting to give either them or the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory based on his connection to his father . McCain was still badly hobbled by his injuries , earning the nickname " <unk> " among the other POWs , but despite his physical condition , continued beatings and isolation , he was one of the key players in the Plantation 's resistance efforts . 
 In May 1969 , U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird began publicly questioning North Vietnamese treatment of U.S. prisoners . On June 5 , 1969 , a United Press International report described a Radio Hanoi broadcast that denied any such mistreatment . The broadcast used excerpts from McCain 's forced " confession " of a year before , including a statement where he said he had bombed " cities , towns and villages " and had received " very good medical treatment " as a prisoner . In late 1969 , treatment of McCain and the other POWs suddenly improved . North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had died the previous month , possibly causing a change in policy towards POWs . Also , a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected , and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia , which included McCain 's brother Joe , heightened awareness of the POWs ' plight . In December 1969 , McCain was transferred back to the Hoa Lo " Hanoi Hilton " ; his solitary confinement ended in March 1970 . When the prisoners talked about what they wanted to do once they got out , McCain said he wanted to become President . McCain consented to a January 1970 interview outside Hoa Lo with Spanish @-@ born , Cuban psychologist Fernando Barral , that was published in the official Cuban newspaper Granma . McCain talked about his life and expressed no remorse for his bombing North Vietnam , and Barral proclaimed him " an insensitive individual without human depth . " The POWs issued an edict forbidding any further such interviews , and despite pressure from his captors , McCain subsequently refused to see any anti @-@ war groups or journalists sympathetic to the North Vietnamese regime . 
 = = = = Release = = = = 
 McCain and other prisoners were moved around to different camps at times , but conditions over the next several years were generally more tolerable than they had been before . Unbeknownst to them , each year that Jack McCain was CINCPAC , he paid a Christmastime visit to the American troops in South Vietnam serving closest to the DMZ ; he would stand alone and look north , to be as close to his son as he could get . By 1971 , some 30 – 50 percent of the POWs had become disillusioned about the war , both because of the apparent lack of military progress and what they heard of the growing anti @-@ war movement in the U.S. , and some of them were less reluctant to make propaganda statements for the North Vietnamese . McCain was not among them : he participated in a defiant church service and led an effort to write letters home that only portrayed the camp in a negative light , and as a result spent much of the year in a camp reserved for " bad attitude " cases . 
 Back at the " Hanoi Hilton " from November 1971 onward , McCain and the other POWs cheered the resumed bombing of the north starting in April 1972 , whose targets included the Hanoi area and whose daily orders were issued by Jack McCain , knowing his son was in the vicinity . Jack McCain 's tour as CINCPAC ended in September 1972 , despite his desire to have it extended so he could see the war to its conclusion . The old @-@ time POWs cheered even more during the intense " Christmas Bombing " campaign of December 1972 , when Hanoi was subjected for the first time to repeated B @-@ 52 Stratofortress raids . Although its explosions lit the night sky and shook the walls of the camp , scaring some of the newer POWs , most saw it as a forceful measure to compel North Vietnam to finally come to terms . 
 The Paris Peace Accords were signed on January 27 , 1973 , ending direct U.S. involvement in the war , but the Operation Homecoming arrangements for the 591 American POWs took longer . McCain was finally released from captivity on March 14 , 1973 , being taken by bus to Gia Lam Airport , transferred to U.S. custody , and flown by C @-@ 141 to Clark Air Base in the Philippines . 
 Altogether , McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years , nearly five of them after his refusal to accept the out @-@ of @-@ sequence repatriation offer . His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising either arm more than 80 degrees . For his actions as a POW , McCain was awarded the Silver Star , the Legion of Merit , three more instances of the Bronze Star , another instance of the Navy Commendation Medal , and the Purple Heart . He also gained an appreciation , from experiencing the mutual help and organized resistance of the POWs , that his earlier individualism needed to be tempered by a belief in causes greater than self @-@ interest .

 Upon his return to the United States a few days later , McCain was reunited with his wife Carol and his family . She had suffered her own crippling , near @-@ death ordeal during his captivity , due to an automobile accident in December 1969 that left her hospitalized for six months and facing twenty @-@ three operations and ongoing physical therapy . Businessman and POW advocate Ross Perot had paid for her medical care . By the time McCain saw her , she was four inches ( ten centimeters ) shorter , on crutches , and substantially heavier . As a returned POW , McCain became a celebrity of sorts : The New York Times ran a story and front @-@ page photo of him getting off the plane at Clark Air Base in the Philippines ; he authored a thirteen @-@ page cover story describing his ordeal and his support for the Nixon administration 's handling of the war in U.S. News & World Report ; he participated in parades in Orange Park and elsewhere and made personal appearances before groups , where he showed strong speaking skills ; he was given the key to the city of Jacksonville , Florida ; and a photograph of him on crutches shaking the hand of President Richard Nixon at a White House reception for returning POWs became iconic . The McCains became frequent guests of honor at dinners hosted by Governor of California Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan , and John McCain made a strong impression speaking at a large prayer breakfast hosted by the governor . McCain had admired Ronald Reagan while in captivity and afterwards , believing him a man who saw honor in Vietnam service and a potential leader would not lead the nation into a war it was unwilling to win . 
 McCain underwent three operations and other treatment for his injuries , spending three months at the Naval Regional Medical Center in Jacksonville . Psychological tests , given to all the returning POWs , showed that McCain had " adjusted exceptionally well to repatriation " and had " an ambitious , striving , successful pattern of adjustment " . McCain told examiners that he withstood his ordeal by having " Faith in country , United States Navy , family , and God " . Unlike many veterans , McCain did not experience flashbacks or nightmares of his Vietnam experience , although due to the association with prison guards , the sound of keys rattling would cause him to " tense up " . 
 McCain was promoted to commander effective July 1973 and attended the National War College in Fort McNair in Washington , D.C. during the 1973 – 1974 academic year . There he intensively studied the history of Vietnam and the French and American wars there , and wrote " The Code of Conduct and the Vietnam Prisoners of War " , a long paper on the Vietnam POW experience as a test of the U.S. Code of Conduct . By the time he graduated , he concluded that mistakes by American political and military leaders had doomed the war effort . He accepted the right of the anti @-@ war movement in the U.S. to have exercised their freedom to protest , and he adopted a live @-@ and @-@ let @-@ live attitude towards those who had evaded the draft . Nor did the vast changes in American social mores that had taken place during his absence bother him , as it did many other former POWs . McCain returned to Saigon in November 1974 ; he and a couple of other former POWs received the National Order of Vietnam , that country 's highest honor . He also spoke at the South Vietnamese war college , five months before Saigon fell . McCain resolved not to become a " professional POW " but to move forward and rebuild his life . Few thought McCain could fly again , but he was determined to try , and during this time he engaged in nine months of grueling , painful physical therapy , especially to get his knees to bend again . 
 = = = Commanding officer = = = 
 McCain recuperated just enough to pass his flight physical and have his flight status reinstated . In August 1974 , he was assigned to the Replacement Air Group VA @-@ 174 " <unk> " . This was an A @-@ 7 Corsair II training squadron located at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Jacksonville and the largest aviation squadron in the Navy . He became its executive officer in 1975 , and on July 1 , 1976 , he was made VA @-@ 174 's commanding officer . This last assignment was controversial , as he did not have the required experience of having commanded a smaller squadron first ( something that he now had too high a rank to do ) . While some senior officers resented McCain 's presence as favoritism due to his father , junior officers rallied to him and helped him qualify for A @-@ 7 carrier landings . 
 As commanding officer , McCain relied upon a relatively unorthodox leadership style based upon the force of his personality . He removed personnel he thought ineffective , and sought to improve morale and productivity by establishing an informal rapport with enlisted men . Dealing with limited post @-@ Vietnam defense budgets and parts shortages , he was forceful in demanding that respect be given the female officers just beginning to arrive into the unit . McCain 's leadership abilities were credited with improving the unit 's aircraft readiness ; for the first time , all fifty of its aircraft were able to fly . Although some operational metrics declined during the period , the pilot safety improved to the point of having zero accidents . The squadron was awarded its first @-@ ever Meritorious Unit Commendation , while McCain received a Meritorious Service Medal . McCain later stated that being commanding officer of VA @-@ 174 was the most rewarding assignment of his naval career . When his stint ended in July 1977 , the change of command ceremony was attended by his father and the rest of his family , as well as some of his fellow POWs ; speaker Admiral Isaac C. Kidd , Jr. said that John had joined Jack and Slew McCain in a place of honor in Navy tradition , a tribute that deeply moved McCain . 
 During their time in Jacksonville , the McCains ' marriage began to falter . McCain had extramarital affairs ; he was seen with other women in social settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for womanizing . Some of McCain 's activity with other women occurred when he was off @-@ duty after routine flights to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Naval Air Facility El Centro . McCain later said , " My marriage 's collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more than it was to Vietnam , and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war . The blame was entirely mine . " His wife Carol later stated that the failure was not due to her accident or Vietnam and that " I attribute [ the breakup of our marriage ] more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else . " John McCain 's biographer , Robert Timberg , believes that " Vietnam did play a part , perhaps not the major part , but more than a walk @-@ on . " According to John McCain , " I had changed , she had changed . People who have been apart that much change . " 
 = = = Senate liaison , divorce , and second marriage = = = 
 McCain had thought about entering politics since his return from Vietnam , although 1964 had been the only time in his life he had ever voted . In 1976 , he briefly thought of running for the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida ; he had the support of some local figures in Jacksonville , but was convinced by other Republican Party leaders that he did not have sufficient political experience , funding , or popular support to defeat longtime Democratic incumbent Charles E. Bennett . Instead , he worked so hard for Ronald Reagan 's 1976 Republican primary campaign that his base commander reprimanded him for being too politically active for his naval position . 
 As his tenure with VA @-@ 174 was ending , McCain was assigned to a low @-@ profile desk job within the Naval Air Systems Command . Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III thought this assignment a waste of McCain 's social talents , and instead in July 1977 McCain was appointed to the Senate Liaison Office within the Navy 's Office of Legislative Affairs ( an assignment Jack McCain had once held ) . The office 's role mostly consisted of providing constituent service and acting as a facilitator among legislators , the Department of Defense , and lobbyists . McCain later said the liaison job represented " [ my ] real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant " . McCain 's lively personality and knowledge of military matters made his post in the Russell Senate Office Building a popular gathering spot for senators and staff . He also frequently escorted congressional delegations on overseas trips , where he arranged entertaining side escapades . McCain was influenced by senators of both parties , and formed an especially strong bond with John Tower of Texas , the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee . During 1978 and 1979 , McCain played a key behind @-@ the @-@ scenes role in gaining congressional funding for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration and Navy Secretary W. Graham <unk> Jr . In August 1979 , McCain was promoted to captain , and became Director of the Senate Liaison Office . During McCain 's time there , the Senate Liaison Office enjoyed one of its few periods of high influence . 
 McCain and his wife Carol had been briefly separated soon after returning to Washington , but then reunited and remained married . In April 1979 , while attending a military reception for senators in Hawaii , McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley , eighteen years his junior , a teacher from Phoenix , Arizona and the daughter of James Willis Hensley , a wealthy Anheuser @-@ Busch beer distributor , and Marguerite " Smitty " Hensley . They began dating , travelling between Arizona and Washington to see each other , and John McCain urged his wife Carol to accept a divorce . The McCains stopped cohabiting in January 1980 , and John McCain filed for divorce in February , which Carol McCain accepted at that time . After she did not respond to court summonses , the uncontested divorce became official in Fort Walton Beach , Florida , on April 2 , 1980 . McCain gave Carol a settlement that included full custody of their children , alimony , child support including college tuition , houses in Virginia and Florida , and lifelong financial support for her ongoing medical treatments resulting from the 1969 automobile accident ; they would remain on good terms . McCain and Hensley were married on May 17 , 1980 in Phoenix , with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart as best man and <unk> . McCain 's children were upset with him and did not attend the wedding , but after several years they reconciled with him and Cindy . Carol McCain became a personal assistant to Nancy Reagan and later Director of the White House Visitors Office . The Reagans were stunned by the divorce ; Nancy Reagan 's relationship with John McCain turned cold for a while following it , but eventually the two renewed their friendship . The same happened with most of McCain 's other friends , who were eventually won over by the force of his personality and his frequent expressions of guilt over what had happened . 
 Around the end of 1980 , McCain decided to retire from the Navy . He had not been given a major sea command , and his physical condition had deteriorated , causing him to fail the flight physical required for any carrier command position ( in addition to his limited arm movement , certain weather would always cause him to walk with a limp ) . McCain thought he might make rear admiral , but probably not vice admiral , and never become a four @-@ star admiral as his grandfather and father had been . McCain later wrote that he did not anguish over his decision , although it pained his mother , who thought congressional careers paled in comparison to top naval ones . He was excited by the idea of being a member of Congress and was soon recruiting a campaign manager that Cohen knew , for a planned run at a House seat from Arizona . In early 1981 , Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman , who did not want to see McCain leave the liaison post , told McCain that he was still on the path to be selected for one @-@ star rear admiral . McCain told Lehman that he was leaving the Navy and that he could " do more good " in Congress . 
 McCain retired with an effective date of April 1 , 1981 , the rank of Captain , and a disability pension due to his wartime injuries . For his service in the Senate liaison office , McCain was awarded a second instance of the Legion of Merit . Jack McCain died on March 22 , 1981 . On March 27 , 1981 , McCain attended his father 's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery , wearing his uniform for the last time before signing his discharge papers , and later that day flew to Phoenix with his wife Cindy to begin his new life .

 = Independent Women 's Forum = 
 The Independent Women 's Forum ( IWF ) is a politically conservative American non @-@ profit organization focused on policy issues of concern to women . The IWF was founded by activist Rosalie Silberman to promote a " conservative alternative to feminist tenets " following the controversial Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas in 1992 . 
 The group advocates " equity feminism , " a term first used by IWF author Christina Hoff Sommers to distinguish " traditional , classically liberal , humanistic feminism " from " gender feminism " , which she claims opposes gender roles as well as patriarchy . According to Sommers , the gender feminist view is " the prevailing ideology among contemporary feminist philosophers and leaders " and " thrives on the myth that American women are the oppressed ' second sex . ' " Sommers ' equity feminism has been described as anti @-@ feminist by critics . 
 In the 2012 U.S. presidential election , Independent Women ’ s Voice ran an advertisement comparing President Obama to a dishonest boyfriend . 
 = = Origin and history = = 
 Founded in 1992 by Rosalie Silberman , Anita K. Blair , and Barbara Olson , the IWF grew out of the ad hoc group " Women for Judge Thomas , " created to defend Clarence Thomas against allegations of sexual harassment and other improprieties . By 1996 the organization had some 700 dues @-@ paying members who met regularly at luncheons to network and share ideas . Silberman was the IWF 's first president ; subsequent leaders have included Nancy Pfotenhauer and Anita Blair . The current executive director of the organization is Sabrina Schaeffer . The IWF has been described as " a virtual ' Who 's Who ' of Washington 's Republican establishment . " In 2006 , the organization had 20 @,@ 337 members and a budget of $ 1 @.@ 05 million . 
 = = Opposition to other feminist ideas = = 
 The IWF opposes many mainstream feminist positions , describing them as " radical feminism " . IWF @-@ affiliated writers have argued that the gender gap in income exists because of women 's greater demand for flexibility , fewer hours , and less travel in their careers , rather than because of sexism . In an article for the Dallas Morning News , IWF Vice @-@ President Carrie Lukas attributed gender disparities in income to " women 's own choices " , writing that women " tend to place a higher priority on flexibility and personal fulfillment than do men , who focus more on pay . Women tend to avoid jobs that require travel or relocation , and they take more time off and spend fewer hours in the office than men do . Men disproportionately take on the most dirty , dangerous and depressing jobs . " 
 Conservative commentators have praised the IWF ; Linda Chavez credited Women 's Figures : An Illustrated Guide to the Economic Progress of Women in America , a 1999 book published in part by the IWF , with " debunk [ ing ] much of the feminists ' voodoo economics . " Writing in Capitalist Magazine , John Stossel cited Michelle Bernard 's 2007 book Women 's Progress as evidence that " American women have never enjoyed more options or such a high quality of life . " 
 Some writers have asserted that feminist rhetoric is used by the IWF for anti @-@ feminist ends . A New York Times editorial described the IWF as " a right @-@ wing public policy group that provides <unk> support for extreme positions that are in fact dangerous to women . "

 The Forum is active in education policy discussions and focuses on a number of different issues both in primary / secondary education and higher education . 
 = = = = Title IX enforcement = = = = 
 Since shortly after the organization 's inception , the IWF has joined with groups like the National Wrestling Coaches Association in opposing the manner in which the United States Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights has enforced Title IX gender equality legislation . The 1972 Title IX law that states : " No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . " According to IWF senior fellow Christine Stolba , the law has resulted in a number of negative , unintended consequences . Elaborating on the group 's position , Stolba asserts , 
 The ( women 's forum ) is often accused of opposing Title IX . But we don 't oppose Title IX .... What we 're opposing is the way the Office for Civil Rights chooses to enforce Title IX . Given their regulations , colleges are enforcing statistical proportionality .... Common sense and poll data suggest that men are more interested in playing sports than women . But there are more female students than male . It becomes a numbers game , where the number of athletes has to be proportional . The easiest way to do that is to cut men 's teams . 
 In support of the group 's claims that absent current Title IX enforcement , men are more likely to enroll in collegiate athletic programs than women , the IWF conducted a 1998 survey that examined the percentage of students at all @-@ women 's schools participating in athletics compared to the percentage of female students participating in similar programs at undergraduate schools generally . The survey found that female students at co @-@ educational schools are far more likely to be student athletes . Jeremy Rabkin cited the survey in an April 1999 article in the American Spectator , asking , " If ' discrimination ' keeps down the proportion of women athletes at co @-@ ed schools , what accounts for overall participation rates that are half of the national women 's average at Bryn Mawr , Mount Holyoke , Wellesley , and Smith ? " 
 In a January 2012 article remarking on the 40th anniversary of Title IX , IWF executive director Sabrina Schaeffer described her " hope [ that ] feminists will begin to accept that men and women — no matter how balanced the circumstances — maintain different strengths and preferences . Because what is very clear is that legislation in the name of " gender equality " does not actually make men and women the same . "

 In response to falling test scores in American public elementary , middle , and high schools , particularly among young boys , IWF created its Women For School Choice project . The effort targets in part what the organization describes as the negative results of the Women 's Educational Equity Act . According to researcher Krista <unk> , whose report was published by the IWF , 
 <unk> is a solution without a problem . The program wastes money that would be better spent on actual crises — boys ' literacy for example — or returned to taxpayers .... Girls are more engaged and ambitious in school , while boys are more likely to suffer academic and behavioral problems . 
 The creation of this project was also largely a reaction to the National Organization for Women 's vocal opposition to single @-@ sex schools , which decried such arrangements as unacceptable modern examples of segregation . 
 = = = = 2006 Duke University lacrosse case = = = = 
 After rape accusations against Duke University lacrosse players surfaced in March 2006 , the IWF was quick to call attention to the fact that the parties involved in the case were receiving much attention in the press , something that would be harmful to their reputations regardless of the ultimate legal outcome . In April 2006 , Carrie Lukas of the IWF said , 
 At Duke , a woman has accused three men of raping her . Two have been indicted . We know the names of the accused ; we 've seen their pictures ; their lives will never be the same .... Perhaps the evidence will show they ... committed the heinous crime of rape . If so , they will be and they should be severely punished . Yet the media so quick to sensationalize the accuser 's account and condemn the lacrosse players now is revealing facts suggesting that the accused might be innocent of this crime . 
 Columnist Michael Gaynor , writing for Alan Keyes ' organization Renew America , noted IWF 's early criticism of the school 's and the district attorney 's mishandling of the case , saying , " The Independent Women 's Forum 's Charlotte Allen figured out early that the real scandal was the way the players were mistreated and her posts during April 2006 on the IWF website showed a commendable concern with due process and evidence instead of rushing to an erroneous misjudgment . " 
 = = = = Campus programs = = = = 
 The organization emphasizes traditional family roles and cultural norms as essential for civil society . In particular , IWF encourages young women to embrace what it presents as a healthy attitude towards dating , courtship , and marriage . This emphasis is reflected by high @-@ profile , sometimes controversial work on college campuses where IWF sponsors advertising campaigns and literature distribution to promote its views . One such effort included the running of advertisements with provocative headings such as " The Ten Most Common Feminist Myths . " IWF also offers internships and sponsors an annual essay contest open to full @-@ time female undergraduate students . 
 As a reaction to reports of growing promiscuity on college campuses and the V @-@ Day movement founded by Eve Ensler , IWF created its " Take Back the Date " campus program to " reclaim Valentine 's Day from radical feminists on campus who use a day of love and romance to promote vulgar and promiscuous behavior through activities like The Vagina Monologues . " Specifically addressing the controversial play , IWF 's " Take Back the Date " release states that , " although the play raises money for a good cause , the hyper @-@ sexualized play counteracts the positive contributions of the feminist movement and degrades women . " 
 In an article in The Guardian , Jessica Valenti wrote that the program was merely " [ r ] <unk> outdated notions of femininity and positioning them as cutting edge . " 
 = = = Right to keep and bear arms = = = 
 Individuals affiliated with IWF have advocated for the right of members of the public to keep and bear arms . Allison Kasic , director of the Forum 's R.

Heller decision , in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution recognized an individual right to keep and bear arms . Kasic described her enthusiasm for the manner in which the court resolved the case by noting , " as Justice Scalia pointed out in his opinion , ' the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self @-@ defense weapon . ' All citizens of D.C. should rejoice at their new found freedom . But for women especially , guns are the ultimate equalizer in self @-@ defense . " In January 2012 , Anna <unk> , an IWF senior fellow writing in support of federal legislation that would guarantee interstate reciprocity for concealed handgun <unk> , asserted that this issue is of particular importance to women because , 
 In many cases , women lack the physical ability to defend themselves against or outrun would @-@ be assailants . Intangible factors that make women vulnerable are heightened when traveling because of a tourist ’ s lack of familiarity with her surroundings and local trends in crime . Taking away a woman ’ s access to effective means of self @-@ defense makes her an even more attractive target .

 = Early life of Fidel Castro = 
 The early life of Cuban revolutionary and politician Fidel Castro , born Lina Castro , spans the first 26 years of his life , from 1926 to 1952 . Born in Birán , Oriente Province , Castro was the illegitimate son of Ángel Castro y Argiz , a wealthy farmer and landowner , and his mistress Lina Ruz González . First educated by a tutor in Santiago de Cuba , Fidel Castro then attended two boarding schools before being sent to El Colegio de Belén , a school run by Jesuits in Havana . In 1945 he began studying law at the University of Havana , where he first became politically conscious , becoming a staunch anti @-@ imperialist and critic of United States involvement in the Caribbean . Involved in student politics , he was affiliated to Eduardo Chibás and his Partido Ortodoxo , achieving publicity as a vocal critic of the pro @-@ U.S. administration of President Ramón Grau and his Partido Auténtico . 
 Immersed in the university 's violent gang culture , in 1947 he took part in a quashed attempt to invade the Dominican Republic and overthrow the military junta of Rafael Trujillo . Returning to student politics , Castro was involved with violent demonstrations in which protesters clashed with riot police , at which he became increasingly left @-@ wing in his views . Traveling to Bogotá , Colombia , he fought for the Liberals in the <unk> before returning to Havana , where he embraced Marxism . In 1948 he married the wealthy Mirta Díaz Balart , and in September 1949 their son Fidelito was born . Obtaining his Doctorate of Law in September 1950 , he co @-@ opened an unsuccessful law firm before entering parliamentary politics as a Partido Ortodoxo candidate . When General Fulgencio Batista launched a coup and overthrew the elected presidency , Castro brought legal challenges against him , but as this proved ineffective , he began to think of other ways to oust Batista . 
 = = Childhood and education : 1926 – 1945 = = 
 Castro 's father , Ángel Castro y Argiz ( 1875 – 1956 ) , was born to a poor peasant family in Galicia , a province in northwest Spain . A farm laborer , in 1895 he was conscripted into the Spanish Army to fight in the Cuban War of Independence and the ensuing Spanish – American War of 1898 , in which the U.S. seized control of Cuba . In 1902 , the Republic of Cuba was proclaimed ; however it remained economically and politically dominated by the U.S. For a time , Cuba enjoyed economic growth , and Ángel migrated there in search of employment . After various jobs , he set up a business growing sugar cane at Las <unk> farm in Birán , near <unk> , Oriente Province . Ángel took a wife in 1911 , María Luisa <unk> Reyes , with whom he had five children before separating . He then began a relationship with Lina Ruz González ( 1903 – 1963 ) , a household servant of Canarian descent who was twenty @-@ seven years his junior ; she bore him three sons and four daughters , legally marrying in 1943 . 
 Castro was Lina 's third child , born out of wedlock at Ángel 's farm on August 13 , 1926 . Because of the stigma of illegitimacy , he was given his mother 's surname of Ruz rather than his father 's name . Although Ángel 's business ventures prospered , he ensured that Fidel grew up alongside the children of the farm 's workforce , many of whom were Haitian economic migrants of African descent . This experience , Castro later related , prevented him from absorbing " bourgeois culture " at an early age . 
 Aged six , Castro , along with his elder siblings Ramón and Angela , was sent to live with their teacher in Santiago de Cuba , dwelling in cramped conditions and relative poverty , often failing to have enough to eat because of their tutor 's poor economic situation . Aged eight , Castro was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church , although later became an atheist . Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago , where he regularly misbehaved , and so was sent to the privately funded , Jesuit @-@ run Dolores School in Santiago . In 1945 he transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit @-@ run El Colegio de Belén in Havana . Although Castro took an interest in history , geography and debating at Belén , he did not excel academically , instead devoting much of his time to playing sport . 
 = = University and early political activism : 1945 – 1947 = = 
 In late 1945 , Castro began studying law at the University of Havana . Admitting he was " politically illiterate " , he became embroiled in the student protest movement : under the regimes of Cuban Presidents Gerardo Machado , Fulgencio Batista and Ramón Grau there had been a crackdown on protest , with student leaders being killed or terrorized by gangs . This led to a form of <unk> culture within the university , dominated by armed student groups who spent much of their time fighting and running criminal enterprises . Passionate about anti @-@ imperialism and opposed to U.S. intervention in the Caribbean , Castro joined the University Committee for the Independence of Puerto Rico and the Committee for Democracy in the Dominican Republic . During an unsuccessful campaign for the presidency of the Federation of University Students ( Federación <unk> Universitaria - FEU ) , he put forward a platform of " honesty , decency and justice " and emphasized his opposition to corruption , which he associated with U.S. involvement in Cuba . 
 Castro became critical of the corruption and violence of Grau 's regime , delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that earned him a place on the front page of several newspapers . In contact with members of student leftist groups – including the Popular Socialist Party ( Partido Socialista Popular – PSP ) , the Socialist Revolutionary Movement ( Movimiento Socialista Revolucionaria – MSR ) and the <unk> Revolutionary Union ( Unión <unk> Revolucionaria – UIR ) – he grew close to the UIR , although biographers are unsure whether he became a member . In 1947 , Castro joined a new socialist group , the Party of the Cuban People ( Partido Ortodoxo ) , founded by veteran politician Eduardo Chibás ( 1907 – 1951 ) . A charismatic figure , Chibás advocated social justice , honest government , and political freedom , while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform . Though Chibás lost the election , Castro remained committed to working on his behalf . Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers , and Castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university ; he refused and began carrying a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends . In later years Castro was accused of attempting gang @-@ related assassinations during this period , including that of UIR member Lionel Gómez , MSR leader Manolo Castro and university policeman Oscar Fernandez , but these charges remain unproven . 
 = = Latin American rebellions : 1947 – 1948 = = 
 In June 1947 , Castro learned of a planned international expedition to invade the Dominican Republic and overthrow its right @-@ wing president , Rafael Trujillo , a military general and U.S. ally . Widely seen as a dictator , Trujillo utilized a violent secret police which routinely murdered and tortured opponents . Becoming president of the University Committee for Democracy in the Dominican Republic , Castro decided to join the expedition , led by Dominican exile General Juan Rodríguez . Launched from Cuba , the invasion began on July 29 , 1947 ; it consisted of around 1 @,@ 200 men , most of whom were exiled Dominicans or Cubans . However , the Dominican and U.S. governments were prepared , and soon quashed the rebellion . Grau ’ s government arrested many of those involved before they set sail , but Castro escaped arrest by jumping off of his naval frigate and swimming to shore at night . 
 The botched mission furthered Castro ’ s opposition to the Grau administration , and returning to Havana , he took a leading role in the student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards . The protests , accompanied by a <unk> crackdown on those considered communists , led to violent clashes between protesters and police in February 1948 , in which Castro was badly beaten . At this point his public speeches took on a distinctively leftist slant , condemning the social and economic inequalities of Cuba , something in contrast to his former public criticisms , which had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism . 
 After a quick visit to Venezuela and Panama , in April 1948 Castro traveled to the city of Bogotá , Colombia , with a Cuban student group sponsored by the government of Argentine President Juan Perón , whose anti @-@ imperialist politics impressed Castro . There , the assassination of popular leftist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala led to widespread rioting that came to be known as the <unk> . Leaving 3000 dead , the riots revolved around clashes between the governing Conservatives – backed by the army – and leftist Liberals with support from socialists . Along with his fellow Cuban visitors , Castro joined the Liberal cause by stealing guns from a police station , but subsequent police investigations concluded that neither Castro nor any of the other Cubans had been involved in the killings . 
 = = Marriage and Marxism : 1948 – 1950 = = 
 Returning to Cuba , Castro became a prominent figure in protests against the government ’ s attempts to raise bus fares , a mode of transport used mostly by students and workers . That year , Castro married Mirta Díaz Balart , a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite . The relationship was a love match , disapproved of by both families . Mirta ’ s father gave them tens of thousands of dollars to spend in a three @-@ month honeymoon in New York City , and the couple also received a U.S. $ 1 @,@ 000 wedding gift from the military general and former president Fulgencio Batista , a friend of Mirta ’ s family . That same year , Grau decided not to stand for re @-@ election , which was instead won by his Partido Auténtico 's new candidate , Carlos Prío Socarrás . Prío faced widespread protests when members of the MSR , now allied to the police force , assassinated Justo Fuentes , a self @-@ educated black Cuban who was a prominent UIR member and friend of Castro 's . In response , Prío agreed to quell the gangs , but found them too powerful to control . 
 Castro had moved further left in his politics , influenced by the writings of Marxist communists like Karl Marx , Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin . He came to interpret Cuba 's problems as an integral part of capitalist society , or the " dictatorship of the bourgeoisie " , rather than the failings of corrupt politicians . Adopting the Marxist idea that meaningful political change could only be brought about by a proletariat revolution , Castro visited Havana ’ s poorest neighborhoods , witnessing the nation ’ s social and racial inequalities , and became active in the University Committee for the Struggle against Racial Discrimination . 
 In September 1949 , Mirta gave birth to a son , Fidelito , so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat . Castro continued to put himself at risk , staying active in the city 's politics and joining the September 30 Movement , which contained within it both communists and members of the Partido Ortodoxo . The group 's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university ; despite his promises , Prío had failed to control the situation , instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries . Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13 , exposing the government 's secret deals with the gangs and identifying key members . Attracting the attention of the national press , the speech angered the gangs , and Castro fled into hiding , first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later , Castro lay low and focused on his university studies , graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950 . 
 = = Career in law and politics : 1950 – 1952 = = 
 Castro founded a legal partnership with two fellow leftists , Jorge Azpiazu and Rafael Resende , focusing on helping poor Cubans assert their rights . A financial failure , its main client was a timber merchant who paid them in timber to furnish their office . Caring little for money or material goods , Castro failed to pay his bills ; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off , distressing his wife . He took part in a high @-@ school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950 , fighting a four @-@ hour battle with police in protest at the Education Ministry ’ s ban on the founding of student associations . Arrested and charged for violent conduct , the magistrate dismissed the charges . He also became an active member of the Cuban Peace Committee , campaigning against western involvement in the Korean War . His hopes for Cuba still centered on Eduardo Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo ; however Chibás had made a mistake when he accused Education Minister Aureliano Sánchez of purchasing a Guatemalan ranch with misappropriated funds , but was unable to substantiate his allegations . The government accused Chibás of being a liar , and in 1951 he shot himself during a radio broadcast , issuing a " last wake @-@ up call " to the Cuban people . Castro was present and accompanied him to the hospital where he died . 
 Seeing himself as the heir to Chibás , Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections . Senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him ; instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana 's poorest districts , and began campaigning . The Ortodoxo gained a considerable level of support and was predicted to do well in the election . 
 During his campaign , Castro met with General Fulgencio Batista , the former president who had returned to politics with the Unitary Action Party ; although both opposed Prío ’ s administration , their meeting never got beyond " polite generalities " . In March 1952 , Batista seized power in a military coup , with Prío fleeing to Mexico . Declaring himself president , Batista cancelled the planned presidential elections , describing his new system as " disciplined democracy " ; Castro , like many others , considered it a one @-@ man dictatorship . Batista moved to the right , solidifying ties with both the wealthy elite and the United States , severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union , suppressing trade unions and persecuting Cuban socialist groups . Intent on opposing Batista ’ s administration , Castro brought several legal cases against them , arguing that Batista had committed sufficient criminal acts to warrant imprisonment and accusing various ministers of breaching labor laws . His lawsuits coming to nothing , Castro began thinking of alternate ways to oust the new government . 
 = Jaguar XJ220 = 
 The Jaguar XJ220 is a two @-@ seater supercar produced by British luxury car manufacturer Jaguar from 1992 until 1994 , in collaboration with the specialist automotive and race engineering company Tom Walkinshaw Racing . Recording a top speed of 212 @.@ 3 mph ( 342 km / h ) in 1992 the XJ220 could keep up with the fastest production car since 1987 , the Ruf CTR which also had reached 342 km / h at Nardo before being superseded by the McLaren F1 in 1993 when it recorded a top speed of 231 mph ( 372 km / h ) . The Jaguar held the Nürburgring production car lap record between 1992 and 2000 with a time of 7 : 46 @.@ 36 . 
 The XJ220 was developed from a V12 @-@ engined 4 @-@ wheel drive concept car designed by an informal group of Jaguar employees working in their spare time . The group wished to create a modern version of the successful Jaguar 24 Hours of Le Mans racing cars of the 1950s and ' 60s that could be entered into FIA Group B competitions . The XJ220 made use of engineering work undertaken for Jaguar 's then current racing car family . 
 The initial XJ220 concept car was unveiled to the public at the 1988 British International Motor Show , held in Birmingham , England . Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to put the car into production ; some 1500 deposits of £ 50 @,@ 000 each were taken , and deliveries were planned for 1992 . 
 Engineering requirements resulted in significant changes to the specification of the XJ220 , most notably replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine . The changes to the specification and a collapse in the price of collectible cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options . A total of just 271 cars were produced by the time production ended , each with a retail price of £ 470 @,@ 000 in 1992 . 
 = = Conception = = 
 Jaguar were approached by racing team owner Tom Walkinshaw and encouraged to enter the Jaguar XJS into the 1981 European Touring Car Championship ; they succeeded in winning the competition in 1984 . Jaguar had started to provide factory support to racing team Group 44 Racing , who were using the Jaguar @-@ engined XJR @-@ 5 in the IMSA GT Championship , supplying V12 engines from 1983 onwards and supporting a Le Mans entry in 1984 . Tom Walkinshaw and Jaguar agreed to entering the FIA Group C World Sportscar Championship and developed the XJR @-@ 6 , which was powered by the Jaguar V12 engine ; the car was launched during the 1985 season . 
 TWR took over the IMSA GT Championship operation in 1988 and one model – Jaguar XJR @-@ 9 – was launched to compete in both series . The XJR @-@ 9 , which retained the Jaguar V12 engine , went on to win the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans and World Sportscar Championship in the same year . The poor fuel consumption of the Jaguar V12 combined with new rules restricting refueling during races forced the replacement of the V12 engine in the XJR @-@ 9s successors , the XJR @-@ 10 and XJR @-@ 11 . The normally @-@ aspirated Austin Rover V64V engine , designed for the MG Metro 6R4 had recently been made redundant thanks to the Group B rally ban in 1987 , and the design rights were for sale . The compact , lightweight and fuel efficient nature of the small @-@ displacement , turbocharged engine was investigated by TWR , who considered it an ideal basis for a new engine to power the XJR @-@ 10 and purchased the design rights from Austin Rover Group . 
 Jaguar and their Director of Engineering , Jim Randle , felt these racing cars were too far removed from the product available to the general public , especially with the rule changes that mandated the replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine in the forthcoming XJR @-@ 10 and XJR @-@ 11 racing cars . Therefore , a project was initiated to design and build a car capable of winning Le Mans " in house " , just as the Jaguar C @-@ Type and D @-@ Type had done . The groundwork for the project was undertaken by Randle over Christmas 1987 , when he produced a 1 : 4 scale cardboard model of a potential Group B racing car . 
 The cardboard model was taken into the Jaguar styling studio and two mock @-@ ups were produced . One was said to be reminiscent of the Porsche 956 , the other took elements of the then current Jaguar <unk> project and Malcolm Sayer 's work on the stillborn Jaguar <unk> racing car . The second design , by Keith Helfet , was chosen as it was " more obviously Jaguar in its look " . 
 The project still had no official support , leaving Randle no option but to put together a team of volunteers to work evenings and weekends in their own time . The team came to be known as " The Saturday Club " , and consisted of twelve volunteers . To justify the resources consumed by the project , the XJ220 needed to provide meaningful data to the engineers on handling , aerodynamics – particularly at high speeds – and aluminium structures . These requirements , together with FIA racing regulations and various government regulations governing car design and safety influenced the overall design and engineering direction of the car . 
 = = Concept car = = 
 The FIA Group B regulations steered the concept towards a mid @-@ engine , all @-@ wheel @-@ drive layout , with a Jaguar V12 engine as the power source . The concept car was designed and built at very little cost to Jaguar , as Randle called in favours from component suppliers and engineering companies he and Jaguar had worked with in the past . In return he offered public recognition for their assistance and dangled the possibility of future contracts from Jaguar . 
 The name XJ220 was chosen as a continuation of the naming of the Jaguar <unk> , which referred to the top speed of the model in miles per hour . The concept car had a targeted top speed of 220 mph ( 350 km / h ) so became the XJ220 . The <unk> , like the XJ220 , was an aluminium @-@ bodied sports car , and when launched was the fastest production car in the world . 
 = = = Engine and transmission = = = 
 Jaguar and engine designer Walter Hassan had previously created a 48 @-@ valve variant of their V12 engine specifically for motorsport use . It featured a double overhead camshaft layout with four valves per cylinder , compared with the single overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder of the production engine , which was used in the Jaguar XJ and Jaguar XJS models at the time . 
 TWR had manufactured a number of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s and they had been raced competitively , with a 7 @-@ litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR @-@ 9 . Five of these engines still existed , all of which were fitted with dry sump lubrication . These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle 's centre of gravity . The displacement of the V12 was set at 6 @.@ 2 litres ( <unk> cc ) for the XJ220 . The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods . 
 Jaguar had little experience with four @-@ wheel drive systems at the time , having previously only produced rear @-@ wheel drive cars . Randle approached Tony Rolt 's company , FF Developments to design the transmission and four @-@ wheel drive system for the XJ220 , with Rolt 's son Stuart running the project . Tony Rolt was the Technical Director of Ferguson Research , where he was heavily involved in the design of the four @-@ wheel drive system used in the Jensen FF , the first sports car to be fitted with such a transmission . Tony Rolt also had a long involvement with Jaguar , winning the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans with the factory works team driving the Jaguar C @-@ Type . 
 The mid @-@ engine complicated the design of the four @-@ wheel drive system , and an innovative solution was needed to get drive from the rear of the engine to the front wheels . The chosen design took the front @-@ wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive , before joining an inverted differential . The clutch was a twin @-@ plate unit designed by AP Racing . 
 = = = <unk> and interior = = = 
 The design brief for the exterior restricted the use of aerodynamic aids , and aimed for a stylish yet functional body similar to the Jaguar D @-@ Type . Drag and lift were limited at the envisioned ground clearance for road use , but the design allowed for additional downforce when the car was set up for racing ; the body produced around 3 @,@ 000 lb ( 1 @,@ 400 kg ) of downforce at 200 mph ( 320 km / h ) . The design was also intended to have a variable rear wing that folded into the bodywork at lower speeds . Aerodynamic work was undertaken at the Motor Industry Research Association wind tunnel using a 1 : 4 scale model , as the project was unable to budget for a full @-@ scale mock @-@ up . 
 The bodywork for the concept car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal , a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low @-@ volume , niche models for various manufacturers , including Bentley . <unk> Coatings undertook final painting of the <unk> in silver . The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover to show off the V12 engine . 
 The concept car had a Connolly Leather @-@ trimmed interior produced by Callow & Maddox , and was fitted with front and rear heated windscreens , electric windows , air conditioning , heated electrically adjustable seats with an Alpine CD player . The dashboard was supplied by <unk> . 
 = = = Chassis = = = 
 The chassis was manufactured from aluminium using Alcan 's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology ( <unk> ) , and had a wheelbase of <unk> mm . The design for the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead . Suspension design largely focused on road use , but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable . The concept car was fitted with a four @-@ channel anti @-@ lock braking system . 
 The concept car was larger than the production model at 5 @,@ 140 mm ( 202 in ) in length and 2 @,@ 000 mm ( 79 in ) wide . It weighed 1 @,@ 560 kg ( 3 @,@ 440 lb ) . 
 = = = Launch = = = 
 The concept car was completed in the early hours of 18 October 1988 , the day it was due to be unveiled at the British International Motor Show , being held at the National Exhibition Centre , Birmingham . The vehicle was completed at 03 : 00 GMT , moved to Jaguar 's stand at 06 : 00 GMT and unveiled at 11 : 00 GMT . 
 Jaguar 's marketing department had allocated space on their stand at the motor show for the XJ220 , but had not seen the vehicle until its arrival . Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam , who was in charge of Jaguar 's racing activities , were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and signed off on the concept , allowing its unveiling . The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press , and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production . Ferrari 's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed ; an estimated 90 @,@ 000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220 . 
 The XJ220 was not initially intended to be a production car , but , following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers , a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar . Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible ( subject to engineering changes ) , and that it would be financially viable . The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989 . The list price on 1 January 1990 was £ 290 @,@ 000 exclusive of value added tax , options and delivery charges , but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to <unk> of contracts . The offer was four times oversubscribed , and deposits of £ 50 @,@ 000 exclusive of Value Added Tax ( VAT ) were taken from around 1400 customers ; first deliveries were planned for mid @-@ 1992 . 
 = = Production version = = 
 Jaguar were unable to develop the XJ220 in house as their engineering resources were committed to working on the Jaguar XJ and Jaguar XJS models ; the re @-@ engineered and facelifted XJS was launched in May 1991 . 
 Jaguar and TWR had an existing joint venture , JaguarSport Ltd , formed in 1987 to produce racing cars . Jaguar 's board made the decision that subject to contractual agreement , TWR and JaguarSport would be responsible for the XJ220 . JaguarSport formed a new company , Project XJ220 Ltd , specifically to develop and build the XJ220 . 
 The team that should determine the necessary engineering work and assess the car 's financial viability was put in place during mid @-@ 1989 , working from the TWR workshops . Mike Moreton headed the team , joining TWR to run the XJ220 project . Moreton came from Ford Motorsports where he led the team responsible for the Ford Sierra <unk> Cosworth , and was a project manager for the Ford <unk> Group B rally car program . Richard Owen was appointed chief designer , and the remainder of the team was made up of Jaguar and TWR staff , including Pete Dodd , the only member of the group of twelve responsible for the XJ220 concept . The exterior and interior designers who had worked on the XJ220 prototype , Keith Helfet and Nick Hull , rejoined the project when it became clear that more design work would be needed . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The development team looked at the two principal competitors , the Ferrari F40 and the Porsche 959 . These were powered by compact , lightweight engines ; both the Ferrari and the Porsche used forced induction to obtain high power outputs from small @-@ displacement engines . Ferrari used a 2 @.@ 9 @-@ litre twin turbo V8 that produced 478 PS ( 352 kW ; 471 hp ) whilst Porsche used a 2 @.@ 9 @-@ litre twin @-@ turbo flat six producing 450 PS ( 330 kW ; 440 hp ) , resulting in cars that were significantly lighter and smaller than the XJ220 concept : the Ferrari was lighter by 600 kg and 710 mm shorter , whilst the Porsche was 250 kg lighter and 870 mm shorter . The Porsche 's specifications were closer to the Jaguar 's , with four @-@ wheel drive and a luxurious interior . By comparison the rear @-@ wheel driven Ferrari had a very basic interior , with no carpets , door handles or a stereo . 
 = = = Engine = = = 
 The production XJ220 used a 3 @.@ 5 @-@ litre ( <unk> cc ) twin turbocharged engine , which was given the designation Jaguar / TWR JV6 . This engine , which replaced the Jaguar V12 engine featured in the concept car , was a heavily redesigned and significantly altered version of the Austin Rover V64V V6 engine . The decision to change the engine was based on engine weight and dimensions , as well as to environmental emission considerations . Use of the shorter V6 engine design allowed the wheelbase of the XJ220 to be shortened and its weight to be reduced ; the V12 engine was definitively ruled out when it was determined it would have difficulty in meeting emissions legislation whilst producing the required power and torque . 
 TWR purchased the rights to the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new turbocharged engine , codenamed JV6 , under the auspices of Allan Scott , with proportions roughly similar to the V64V , and suitable for <unk> racing . TWR redesigned all parts of the engine , increasing the displacement to 3 @.@ 5 litres , and adding two Garrett <unk> turbochargers . The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR @-@ 10 and XJR @-@ 11 racing cars ; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220 . The engine had a 90 ° bank angle , four valves per cylinder and belt @-@ driven double overhead camshafts . It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine . 
 The V64V engine chosen had a short but successful career as a purpose @-@ designed racing car engine . It was designed by Cosworth engine designer David Wood for Austin Rover Group 's Metro derived Group B rally car , the MG Metro 6R4 . The redesign work necessary to create the Jaguar / TWR JV6 engine was undertaken by Andrew Barnes , TWR 's Powertrain Manager , and also involved Swiss engine builder Max Heidegger who had designed and built the race engines used in the XJR @-@ 10 and XJR @-@ 11 racing cars . 
 The XJ220 's engine had a bore and stroke of 94 mm × 84 mm ( 3 @.@ 70 by 3 @.@ 31 inches ) , dry sump lubrication , Zytek multi point fuel injection with dual injectors and Zytek electronic engine management . The engine was manufactured with an aluminium cylinder block , aluminium cylinder heads with steel connecting rods and crankshaft , and in the standard state of tune , it produced a maximum power of 550 PS ( 400 kW ; 540 hp ) at 7200 rpm and torque of 475 lb · ft ( 644 N · m ) at 4500 rpm . The XJ220 can accelerate from 0 – 60 miles per hour in 3 @.@ 6 seconds and reach a top speed of 213 miles per hour . 
 The exhaust system is equipped with two catalytic converters , which reduced the power output of the engine . During testing at the <unk> Ring in Italy the XJ220 , driven by 1990 Le Mans Winner Martin Brundle could achieve a top speed of 217 @.@ 1 miles per hour when these catalytic converters were removed and the rev limiter was increased to <unk> ; owing to the circular nature of the track , a speed of 217 mph ( 349 km / h ) is equivalent to 223 mph ( 359 km / h ) on a straight , level road . The V64V engine had the additional benefit of being very economical for such a powerful petrol engine , it was capable of achieving 32 mpg @-@ imp ( 8 @.@ 8 L / 100 km ; 27 mpg @-@ US ) , in contrast , the smallest @-@ engined Jaguar saloon of the time , the Jaguar <unk> 4 @.@ 0 could only achieve around 24 mpg @-@ imp ( 12 L / 100 km ; 20 mpg @-@ US ) . 
 = = = Transmission = = = 
 Four @-@ wheel drive was decided against early in the development process , for a number of reasons . It was thought rear @-@ wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations , that the additional complexity of the four @-@ wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer . FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox / transaxle assembly , modifying their four @-@ wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear @-@ wheel drive design for the production car . A five @-@ speed gearbox is fitted ; a six @-@ speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary , as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant . The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction . 
 The transmission system featured triple @-@ cone <unk> on first and second gears to handle rapid starts , whilst remaining relatively easy for the driver to engage and providing positive feel . 
 AP Racing provided an 8 @.@ 5 in ( 22 cm ) diameter clutch . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The exterior retained the aluminium body panels of the XJ220 concept , but for the production vehicles , Abbey Panels of Coventry were contracted to provide the exterior panels . The scissor doors were dropped for the production model , and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the wheelbase and overall length of the car was altered . Geoff Lawson , Design Director at Jaguar took a greater interest in the car and insisted the design had to be seen to be a Jaguar if it was to be successful in promoting the company . Keith Helfet returned to undertake the necessary redesign work mandated by the change in the wheelbase , which was reduced by 200 mm . The turbocharged engine required larger air intakes to feed the two <unk> . Situated between the doors and the rear wheels , the air intakes were larger on the production version of the XJ220 than on the concept car . A number of small design changes for the body were tested in the wind tunnel ; the final version had a drag coefficient of 0 @.@ 36 with downforce of 3 @,@ 000 lb ( 1 @,@ 400 kg ) at 200 mph ( 320 km / h ) . The XJ220 was one of the first production cars to intentionally use underbody airflow and the venturi effect to generate downforce . 
 The rear lights used on the production XJ220 were taken from the Rover 200 . 
 = = = Chassis = = = 
 The production model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology ( <unk> ) as the concept car for the chassis . The chassis design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and would provide an energy absorbing structure in the event of a frontal impact , these were successfully tested at speeds up to 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) , an integral roll cage formed part of the chassis and monocoque , providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass stringent crash testing . 
 The rear @-@ wheel steering was dropped from the production car to save weight and reduce complexity , as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology . The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension , double unequal length wishbones , inboard coil springs and anti @-@ roll bars , with <unk> gas @-@ filled dampers . The suspension was designed in accordance with the FIA Group C specifications . 
 The braking system was designed by AP Racing and featured ventilated and cross @-@ drilled discs of 13 in ( 33 cm ) diameter at the front and 11 @.@ 8 in ( 30 cm ) diameter at the rear . The calipers are four pot aluminium units . JaguarSport designed the handbrake , which are separate calipers acting on the rear brake discs . Feedback from enthusiasts and racing drivers resulted in the decision to drop the anti @-@ lock braking system from the production car . The braking system was installed without a servo , but a number of owners found the brakes to be difficult to judge when cold and subsequently requested a servo to be fitted . 
 Rack and pinion steering was fitted , with 2 @.@ 5 turns lock to lock ; no power assistance was fitted . The Bridgestone Expedia <unk> asymmetric uni @-@ directional tyres were specially developed for the XJ220 and had to be rateable to a top speed in excess of 220 miles per hour ( 350 km / h ) , carry a doubling of load with the exceptionally high downforce at speed and maintain a compliant and comfortable ride . Rally alloy wheel specialists Speedline Corse designed the alloy wheels , these are both wider and have a larger diameter on the rear wheels ; 17 inches ( 43 cm ) wheels are fitted to the front and 18 inches ( 46 cm ) are fitted at the rear , with 255 / 55 <unk> tyres at the front and 345 / 35 <unk> tyres at the rear . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The interior was designed for two passengers and trimmed in leather . Leather trimmed sports seats are fitted together with electric windows and electrically adjustable heated mirrors . The dashboard unusually curves round and carries onto the drivers door , with a secondary instrument binnacle containing four analogue gauges , including a clock and <unk> fitted on the front of the drivers door . Air conditioning and green tinted glazing was also fitted . 
 The luggage space consists of a small boot directly behind and above the rear portion of the engine , also trimmed in leather . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 The car was assembled in a purpose @-@ built factory at <unk> Mill , Bloxham near Banbury in Oxfordshire . HRH The Princess of Wales officially opened the factory and unveiled the first production XJ220 in October 1991 . 
 The JV6 engines used in the Jaguar racing cars were produced by Swiss engineer Max Heidegger , but delivering the number of engines required for the XJ220 program was considered beyond his capacity . TWR formed a division , TWR Road Engines , to manage the design , development , construction and testing of the engines for the production cars . The JV6 engine used in the XJ220 featured little commonality with the engines Heidegger built for use in the XJR racing cars , being specifically engineered to meet performance and in particular , the European emissions requirements , which the race engines didn 't have to meet . 
 FF Developments , in addition to their design work on the gearbox and rear axle assembly were given responsibility for their manufacture . The aluminium chassis components and body panels were manufactured and assembled at Abbey Panels factory in Coventry , before the body in white was delivered to the assembly plant at Bloxham . The car , including chassis and body components , consists of approximately 3000 unique parts . 
 The first customer delivery occurred in June 1992 , and production rates averaged one car per day . The last XJ220 rolled off the production line in April 1994 ; the factory was then transferred to Aston Martin and used for the assembly of the Aston Martin <unk> until 2004 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Press coverage of the concept XJ220 in 1988 was overwhelmingly positive and contributed to the decision in 1989 to put the XJ220 into limited production . The production version of the car was first shown to the public in October 1991 , at the Tokyo Motor Show . The first car was released for press review in autumn 1991 . 
 Autocar reviewer Andrew Frankel was the first journalist to road @-@ test the car and reported : " Savage acceleration really is a given here . What 's really incredible about the XJ220 is its ability to provide such performance in a way that never , ever intimidates . " He was particularly impressed with the throttle response , the driver 's ability to control the performance of the car very precisely , and the way in which the engine delivers its power progressively rather than in one short burst . 
 Performance Car reviewer John Barker was also impressed with the performance as well as the ride and stability of the car , writing " The V6 has a rumbly , loping note which , in league with a remarkably supple ride , belies the speed we are travelling at . I glance to the speedo and have trouble believing that it is indicating 170 mph . " Barker was also impressed with the engineering , saying " this car is catalysed , fully homologated and has passed the same tests that a Volvo needs before going on sale , " going on to discuss how the vehicle looked at home on the racetrack thanks to the design . Autocar 's verdict was " Right now , the XJ220 gives us a standard by which all other fast cars can be compared . For the few who will actually own and , hopefully , use their XJ220s , the fact that they are in command of the most accomplished supercar ever made should suffice . " 
 Critics of the car consider it underwhelming for such an expensive , powerful and high performance machine . Motoring journalists have been critical of the interior and the car itself for being too comfortable and lacking the sense of occasion present with other supercars . Commentators who approve of the interior have criticised the luggage space as being " largely useless " . Journalists and other commentators often bemoaned the lack of the Jaguar V12 engine and other technical components fitted to the concept car . Contemporary reviews pondered on whether the sales performance and residual values would have been improved by sticking more closely to the specification of the concept car . 
 Sales performance was disappointing . Jaguar had intended to produce up to 350 cars , but production ceased in 1994 with 275 production cars produced , not all of which had been sold ; some left @-@ hand drive examples were still available in 1997 . The recession left many of those who placed a deposit unable to complete the purchase . The index linking of contracts exacerbated the issue , and added almost £ 200 @,@ 000 to the purchase price between early 1990 and mid @-@ 1992 . The McLaren F1 suffered from similarly poor sales performance , with just 71 cars sold against McLaren 's target of 300 . McLaren 's F1 program eventually turned a small profit thanks to the sale and servicing of the 28 GTR racing variants produced . 
 The price of collectible cars collapsed as a result of the recession over the six @-@ year period from 1989 – 94 ; for example , a highly collectible Ferrari 250 GTO sold for just $ 3 @.@ 5 million in 1994 , an $ 11 @.@ 1 million loss from its sale price in 1989 . The Jaguar XJ220 had attracted a significant number of speculators who hoped the scarcity of the XJ220 and enthusiasm for the Jaguar marque would push up prices overnight , allowing large profits to be made over a short period of time . 
 The market for supercars was growing when the production XJ220 was announced , with comparable cars immediately reselling after delivery for three and four times the list price . The Ferrari F40 had been selling for more than £ 800 @,@ 000 in 1990 , but like the XJ220 it was adversely affected by the recession , and by 1992 prices had dropped to between £ 100 @,@ 000 to £ 150 @,@ 000 . 
 Further complicating the sales situation was the announcement by JaguarSport of a road @-@ going version of the Jaguar XJR @-@ 9 , the last of the racing cars to feature the Jaguar V12 engine . The Jaguar XJR @-@ 15 was developed by TWR and styled by Peter Stevens whilst the XJ220 was being developed at Jaguar , and featured the V12 engine and a host of other technologies not adopted for the XJ220 , including carbon fibre construction and the option of a six @-@ speed racing gearbox . It was considerably rarer and more expensive than the XJ220 when it went on sale ; only 50 were built , each with a list price of £ 600 @,@ 000 ( $ 1 million ) in 1990 . It was designed primarily for racing but could be specified as a road @-@ legal vehicle . About half were built as road @-@ going variants , which added £ 55 @,@ 000 to the list price . 
 Jaguar customers attempting to withdraw from their contracted purchases were given the option to buy themselves out of their contracts , but by 1995 , the issue had resulted in legal action as buyers claimed the specification changes rendered any contracts void . Jaguar produced evidence clearly demonstrating that the vehicle specification shown in the contract matched the vehicle that was delivered , and the presiding judge , John Donaldson , quickly ruled in Jaguar 's favour . The last of the unsold XJ220s were sold for £ 127 @,@ 550 plus VAT in 1997 . While never officially approved for sale in the United States , the XJ220 was approved under the Show and Display exemption by 2001 . 
 The XJ220 remains popular with the contemporary motoring press ; Evo journalist David Vivian , writing a head @-@ to @-@ head test between the XJ220 and the Lamborghini Murcielago in 2009 , commented that " going ludicrously fast seems trivially easy " , and acknowledged that the decision to change the V12 engine for a turbocharged V6 engine has more recently become acceptable . Vivian was impressed by the car 's ride , handling and grip .

 A racing version was introduced at the 1993 Autosport International motor show ; given the model name XJ220 @-@ C , it was built to compete in FISA GT racing . The XJ220 @-@ C driven by Win Percy won its first race , a round of the BRDC National Sports GT Challenge at Silverstone . 
 Three works XJ220 @-@ Cs were entered in the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans race , in the newly created Grand Touring Class . John Nielsen , David Brabham and David Coulthard won the GT class , beating Porsche by two laps ; the other two cars retired , both through engine failure . However , the class win was revoked when the Jaguar XJ220 @-@ C was controversially disqualified for failing to run with catalytic converters . The Jaguars had passed scrutiny and completed the first day of qualifying when senior steward Alain <unk> complained that Jaguar were not running catalytic converters . The cars had been entered under the IMSA GT category and <unk> claimed that they needed to run with catalysts . The cars ran in the race under appeal . International Motor Sports Association ( IMSA ) officials wrote to the Automobile Club de l 'Ouest ( ACO ) ( English : Automobile Club of the West ) , organisers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans , confirming that the XJ220s had complied with IMSA rules . Jaguar won their appeal ( supported by the FIA ) but were nevertheless disqualified , as the ACO confirmed that the appeal had not been lodged in time . 
 Four cars were entered in the GT1 class for the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans , two by PC Automotive Jaguar and two by Chamberlain Engineering , though the latter did not run their cars . Neither team had Jaguar or TWR backing ; both of PC Automotive 's cars were outpaced by the new McLaren F1 GTR . Richard Piper , Tiff Needell and James Weaver were holding fourth position until an engine failure during the night , ending their race , whilst the second XJ220 retired after leaving the road . 
 An XJ220 was also used in the Italian GT Championship , although without factory support ; it raced in Martini livery . The <unk> was promoted in the United States in the @-@ made @-@ for @-@ TV " Fast Masters " racing series at Indianapolis Raceway Park , airing on ESPN in the summer of 1993 and featuring invited drivers over 50 years old in an elimination format . 
 TWR developed a further six XJ220 @-@ S road cars , featuring one @-@ piece carbon @-@ fiber @-@ reinforced polymer front and rear bodywork ; the engine was tuned to 700 PS ( 510 kW ; 690 hp ) . The XJ220 @-@ S models did away with the hidden headlamps of the original and instead opted for perspex covered lights . The S models were essentially road @-@ going versions of the XJ220 @-@ C racer , and as a result featured a much simpler race @-@ orientated interior with kevlar seats and the removal of the leather trim . Colin Goodwin , a writer for Autocar , tested an XJ220 @-@ S in June 1995 at Millbrook Proving Ground and set the lap record at an average speed of 180 @.@ 4 mph ( 290 @.@ 3 km / h ) .

 = Criminal damage in English law = 
 In English law , causing criminal damage was originally a common law offence . The offence was largely concerned with the protection of dwellings and the food supply , and few sanctions were imposed for damaging personal property . Liability was originally restricted to the payment of damages by way of compensation . 
 As time passed , specific laws were introduced to deal with particular situations as they were judged to require intervention , most particularly alongside the rise of mechanisation and urbanisation during the Industrial Revolution . 
 The modern law of criminal damage is mostly contained in the Criminal Damage Act 1971 , which redefines or creates several offences protecting property rights . The Act provides a comprehensive structure covering merely preparatory acts to the most serious offences of arson and causing damage with intent to endanger life . As such , punishments vary from a fixed penalty to life imprisonment , and the court may order payment of compensation to a victim . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Common law = = = 
 The common law generally treated damage to another 's chattels as a civil matter leading only to a right to damages in trespass or nuisance ; in the 18th century , Blackstone stated : " The rights of personal property in possession are liable to two species of injuries : the <unk> [ carrying away ] or deprivation of that possession ; and the abuse or damage of the chattels , while the possession continues in the legal owner . " Blackstone clearly labelled these as " Private Wrongs " in his commentaries , emphasising that property rights were enforced inter partes , and that the State was not necessarily one of the involved parties . In fact , the criminal law only intervened in the case of arson , defining it as " the malicious and wilful burning of the house or outhouses of another man " . This protection extended to barns and even " stacks of corn " . Arson traditionally attracted the death penalty , and had done so in Roman law . 
 = = = Early legislation = = = 
 Whereas the common law protected habitation and sources of wealth and food in a largely agricultural society , the Industrial Revolution , especially the Luddism resulting from workers ' perceived threats to their livelihood , required new legislation to match the circumstances . The reaction of Parliament to Luddism was to criminalise machine @-@ breaking – the destruction of textile @-@ making machinery – as early as 1721 . Initially the punishment was transportation to the Colonies but as a result of continued opposition to mechanisation the Frame @-@ Breaking Act of 1812 made the death penalty available . 
 = = = Consolidation = = = 
 A number of statutory provisions creating offences of damaging specific types of property were consolidated by 7 & 8 <unk> <unk> ( 1827 ) ( Malicious injuries to property ) which was one of Peel 's Acts . This Act and a number of subsequent statutes were consolidated by the Malicious Damage Act 1861 . 
 = = Malicious Damage Act 1861 = = 
 The Malicious Damage Act 1861 was a Victorian consolidation statute which set out detailed protections of property , most of which have now been superseded by the Criminal Damage Act 1971 . The remaining provisions applicable in England and Wales are : 
 Section 35 - Placing wood , & c. on railway , with intent to obstruct or overthrow any engine , & c . 
 Section 36 - <unk> engines or carriages on railways 
 Section 58 - Malice against owner of property unnecessary 
 Section 72 - Offences committed within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty 
 = = Criminal Damage Act 1971 = = 
 = = = Definition = = = 
 Whereas the 1861 Act protected in detail many different types of property , the Criminal Damage Act 1971 provided a definition wide enough to apply to any tangible property . By section 1 ( 1 ) of the Act : 
 A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence . 
 = = = = " Without lawful excuse " = = = = 
 Apart from the general self @-@ defence excuse applicable to any offence involving violent acts , section 5 of the Act sets out specific provisions in relation to criminal damage : a defendant will have " lawful excuse " if 
 ( a ) at the time ... he believed that the person ... believed to be entitled to consent to the destruction or damage ... had so consented , or would have consented had they known ... , or 
 ( b ) he destroyed or damaged ... the property in question ... in order to protect property ... and at the time ... he believed — 
 ( i ) that the property ... was in immediate need of protection ; and 
 ( ii ) that the means of protection ... were ... reasonable having regard to all the circumstances . 
 Section 5 ( 3 ) of the Act states that it is immaterial whether the defendant 's belief is justified as long as it is an honest belief , and therefore creates a subjective test to be assessed by the court or jury . In Chamberlain v. Lindon ( 1998 ) , Lindon demolished a wall to protect a right of way , honestly believing that it was a reasonable means of avoiding litigation . It was said that : 
 In the criminal context the question is not whether the means of protection adopted by the respondent were objectively reasonable , having regard to all the circumstances , but whether the respondent believed them to be so , and by virtue of section 5 ( 3 ) it is immaterial whether his belief was justified , provided it was honestly held . 
 However , in R v. Hill and Hall ( 1989 ) , the Court of Appeal introduced an objective element to part ( b ) of the defence . The defendants had been convicted of possession of a hacksaw blade outside a US naval base in Wales , having admitted an intention to use the blade to cut through the base 's perimeter fence . They claimed a lawful excuse in that they had acted to protect their own property located near the base ; their reasoning was that the base would at some point in the future attract a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union . Given that Hill was " forced to admit that she did not expect a nuclear bomb to fall today or tomorrow " , the Court concluded that this threat to property was too remote and thus the defence had not been made out , however honest the belief had been . 
 The case of Jaggard v. Dickinson ( 1980 ) held that even a drunken belief will support the defence even though this allows drunkenness to negate basic intent ; and Lloyd v. DPP ( 1992 ) ruled that a motorist who damages a wheel clamp to free his car , having parked on another 's property knowing of the risk of being clamped , does not have a lawful excuse under the Act even if he makes a mistake of law . 
 The courts have said that a defendant relying upon lawful excuse as a defence need not necessarily seek to put himself within section 5 . In R v. Denton ( 1981 ) , the defendant had been asked by his employer to set fire to the employer 's factory to facilitate an insurance claim . Despite this , it was held that the owner of the factory was entitled to have it burned down – as the Lord Chief Justice put it , " [ i ] t is not an offence for a man to set light to his own ... property " – and therefore Denton , knowing this , had a lawful excuse independent of section 5 . 
 = = = = " Destroys or damages " = = = = 
 Whether destruction or damage has occurred is an issue of fact and degree in each case and case law suggests that damage must be more than de minimis . In A ( a juvenile ) v. R ( 1978 ) , the defendant spat on a police officer 's raincoat , which was easily wiped clean ; it was held that this did not amount to damage within the 1971 Act . Similarly , in <unk> v. Salmon ( 1990 ) , a scratch to a scaffolding pole did not affect its value or usefulness and thus damage had not been proved . The court said : 
 The authorities show that the term " damage " for the purpose of this provision , should be widely interpreted so as to conclude not only permanent or temporary physical harm , but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness . 
 A different conclusion was reached in Hardman v. Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary ( 1986 ) , where graffiti , although eventually removable by action of rainfall , was actually washed away by the local authority , incurring expense , was held to be criminal damage . 
 It is sufficient that any damage be merely temporary : in Cox v. Riley ( 1986 ) , the deletion of the program from a computer @-@ controlled machine , rendering it unusable , was held to constitute damage . This decision was followed in R v. Whiteley ( 1991 ) in relation to computer hacking , although that conduct is now dealt with under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 . In that case it was said that : 
 Any alteration to the physical nature of the property concerned may amount to damage within the meaning of the section . Whether it does so or not will depend on the effect that the alteration has had upon the legitimate operator ( who for convenience may be referred to as the owner ) ... where ... the interference ... amounts to an impairment of the value or usefulness of the [ property ] to the owner , then the necessary damage is established . 
 In R v. <unk> ( 2005 ) , the defendant used a clean blanket to block the toilet of the police cell he was occupying , causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells . The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor , and that in the process the blanket was soaked by clean water . The blanket would have been reusable when dry . Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself . The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself , and held that while it is true that the effect of the appellant 's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both <unk> , the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned . Further , the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared . Thus , both had sustained damage , albeit temporary . 
 = = = = " Property " = = = = 
 The definition of property in the 1971 Act differs slightly from the Theft Act 1968 in that it only includes " property of a tangible nature " . Land can be damaged , as in Henderson and Batley ( 1984 ) , where the defendants had dumped rubble on a development site which cost a substantial sum to clear ; it was held that this constituted damage to the land . 
 = = = = " Belonging to another " = = = = 
 Section 10 ( 2 ) of the Act specifies that property shall be regarded as belonging to any person — 
 ( a ) having the custody or control of it ; 
 ( b ) having in it any proprietary right or interest ( not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest ) ; or 
 ( c ) having a charge on it . 
 These provisions are similar to those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to theft . It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes , including its damage or destruction . However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a mortgage can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property . Property that is abandoned has no owner , and cannot be stolen ; it follows that such property cannot be the subject of a charge of criminal damage . 
 = = = = Intent and recklessness = = = = 
 The mens rea of all offences in the Act is direct or oblique intention , or subjective recklessness as defined by the House of Lords in R v. G ( 2003 ) . Bingham L.J. stated that a person acts " recklessly " with respect to 
 ( i ) a circumstance when he is aware of a risk that it exists or will exist ; or 
 ( ii ) a result when he is aware of a risk that it will occur ; 
 and it is , in the circumstances known to him , unreasonable to take the risk . In Booth v. Crown Prosecution Service ( 2006 ) the Divisional Court upheld the defendant pedestrian 's conviction on a charge that , by rashly dashing into the road , he recklessly damaged the vehicle that hit him because " the appellant was aware of the risk and closed his mind to it " . 
 = = = Aggravated criminal damage = = = 
 Section 1 ( 2 ) of the Act creates an offence which includes all the elements of the section 1 ( 1 ) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life . The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant 's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life . However , there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant . In R v. Steer ( 1986 ) , the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person , but missed and hit a window instead ; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted , the damage itself did not endanger life . This approach was extended in R v. Webster ( 1995 ) , in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored . That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles , and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended , or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage . Therefore , although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window , ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle , perhaps fatally , constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus . 
 = = = = Attempts = = = = 
 Proof of specific intent to endanger life is unnecessary on a charge of attempting this offence . In Attorney General 's Reference No. 3 of 1992 ( 1994 ) , on a charge of attempted aggravated arson , it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the defendant was reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered . 
 = = = Arson = = = 
 Section 1 ( 3 ) of the 1971 Act specifies that offences under section 1 , where the destruction or damage is caused by fire , shall be charged as arson . It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view in relation to the lawful excuse defence in relation to arson , as in R v. Hunt ( 1977 ) . The defendant , wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people 's home , set fire to it to demonstrate the risks . He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this , he had a lawful excuse within section 5 ( 2 ) . It was held , however , that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property . Although the court assumed that his belief was honest , it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself . 
 = = = Threats = = = 
 Section 2 provides that a person threatening another , with the intent that the other would fear the threat would be carried out 
 ( a ) to destroy or damage any property belonging to that other or a third person ; or 
 ( b ) to destroy or damage his own property in a way which he knows is likely to endanger the life of that other or a third person ; 
 shall be guilty of an offence .

 Section 3 provides that a person who has anything in his custody or under his control intending without lawful excuse to use it or cause or permit another to use it 
 ( a ) to destroy or damage any property belonging to some other person ; or

 shall be guilty of an offence .

 The 1971 Act applies in England and Wales , and also to Northern Ireland by the Criminal Damage ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1977 . 
 Certain types of minor damage , such as graffiti , may be dealt with by the issue of fixed penalty notices as an alternative to prosecution . 
 Non @-@ aggravated offences involving damage valued at less than £ 5 @,@ 000 are triable only summarily by magistrates and the maximum sentence is three months ' imprisonment and a fine of £ 2 @,@ 500 . If the value of the property damaged exceeds £ 5 @,@ 000 , the defendant is entitled to claim trial on indictment by a jury , but if tried summarily , may be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a £ 5 @,@ 000 fine . Where the value of the property is unclear , the court may hear representations as to value , but may also offer the defendant the option of summary trial , with limited penalties . 
 Section 4 of the 1971 Act sets out that offences under sections 1 ( 2 ) and 1 ( 3 ) are punishable by a maximum term of life imprisonment and all others by a maximum of ten years ' imprisonment . Section 30 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 sets out a higher maximum of 14 years ' imprisonment for racially or religiously aggravated offences other than those already carrying a maximum of life imprisonment . 
 Courts are empowered by sections 130 to 133 of the Powers of Criminal Courts ( Sentencing ) Act 2000 to order payment of compensation by a convicted defendant . The limit is £ 5 @,@ 000 per offence in a magistrates ' court ; the powers of the Crown Court are unlimited . 
 The Criminal Damage Act 1971 repealed the Dockyards , etc . Protection Act 1772 , which created the capital offences commonly known collectively as " arson in royal dockyards " ; these had been overlooked when the death penalty for murder was abolished in 1965 . 
 = Ficus obliqua = 
 Ficus obliqua , commonly known as the small @-@ leaved fig , is a tree in the family Moraceae , native to eastern Australia , New Guinea , eastern Indonesia to Sulawesi and islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . Previously known for many years as Ficus eugenioides , it is a banyan of the genus Ficus , which contains around 750 species worldwide in warm climates , including the edible fig ( Ficus <unk> ) . Beginning life as a seedling , which grows on other plants ( epiphyte ) or on rocks ( lithophyte ) , F. obliqua can grow to 60 m ( 200 ft ) high and nearly as wide with a pale grey buttressed trunk , and glossy green leaves . 
 The small round yellow fruit ripen and turn red at any time of year , although they peak in autumn and winter ( April to July ) . Known as a syconium , the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity . Ficus obliqua is pollinated by two species of fig wasp — Pleistodontes <unk> and P. xanthocephalus . Many species of bird , including pigeons , parrots and various passerines , eat the fruit . The range is along the east coast from Queensland , through New South Wales in rainforest , savanna woodland , sclerophyll forest and gallery forest . It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces , and is well @-@ suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai . All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Commonly known as the small @-@ leaved fig , Ficus obliqua was described by German naturalist Georg Forster in 1786 based on type material collected in Vanuatu . Dutch botanist Friedrich Miquel described Urostigma eugenioides from Albany Island in Queensland in 1861 , which was reclassified by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller as Ficus eugenioides in 1867 , and it was known as this for many years . However , as Forster 's name is older , it takes precedence . The specific epithet is the Latin adjective obliquus , meaning " oblique " , although the attribute it refers to is unclear . Frederick Manson Bailey described Ficus <unk> in 1906 , from a collection at altitude on Middle Percy Island in the Whitsunday Islands off central Queensland , which is now regarded as F. obliqua . Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander collected and named Ficus <unk> from Booby Island in 1770 , which was synonymised with F. obliqua by William Philip <unk> in 1901 . 
 The species is currently regarded as monotypic . Three varieties of Ficus obliqua were recognised until 2001 — F. obliqua var. petiolaris , F. obliqua var. obliqua , and F. obliqua var. <unk> from Western Australia . A revision of the group led to the conclusion that F. obliqua var. petiolaris belonged in the species F. rubiginosa . F. obliqua var. <unk> was found to be more distantly related to obliqua than rubiginosa and hence has been reclassified as a separate species , Ficus brachypoda . 
 With over 750 species , Ficus is one of the largest angiosperm genera . Based on morphology , English botanist E. J. H. Corner divided the genus into four subgenera , which was later expanded to six . In this classification , Ficus obliqua was placed in subseries Malvanthereae , series Malvanthereae , section Malvanthera of the subgenus Urostigma . In his reclassification of the Australian Malvanthera , Australian botanist Dale J. Dixon altered the delimitations of the series within the section , but left this species in the series Malvanthereae . 
 In a study published in 2008 , Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers ( ITS and ETS ) , and the glyceraldehyde @-@ 3 @-@ phosphate dehydrogenase ( <unk> ) region , in the first molecular analysis of the section Malvanthera . They found F. obliqua to be most closely related to three species of the arid Northern Territory ( F. <unk> , F. <unk> and F. <unk> ) and classified it in a new series <unk> in the subsection <unk> . The species had remained a transitional rainforest species while its relatives radiated into dryer regions . 
 = = Description = = 
 Ficus obliqua is a tree , which may reach 15 – 60 m ( 49 – 197 ft ) in height with a similar crown width . It has smooth thin grey bark with lighter @-@ coloured lenticels , and a buttressed trunk , which may reach 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) in diameter . The glossy green leaves are elliptic to oblong in shape and measure 5 – 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) long by 2 – 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 – 1 @.@ 38 in ) wide on 1 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 79 in ) petioles . They are alternately arranged on the stems . Growing in pairs , the round yellow fruit turn orange or orange @-@ red dotted with darker red and reaches a diameter of 6 to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 to 0 @.@ 39 in ) upon ripening over April to July , although fruit can appear at other times of year . As is the case with all figs , the fruit is an inverted inflorescence known as a syconium , with tiny flowers arising from the inner surface . Ficus obliqua is monoecious — both male and female flowers are produced by the same plant , and in fact in the same fruit . Within any given fruit , female flowers mature several weeks before the male flowers . 
 Historically , there has been some confusion between Ficus obliqua and the related F. rubiginosa . F. obliqua can be distinguished by its smaller fruit on shorter stalks and its glabrous ( hairless ) leaves ; in addition , the petioles have ascending hyaline hairs . Some forms of F. rubiginosa have both leaves and petioles glabrous while others have both covered in fine fur . The syconia of F. obliqua are smaller , measuring 4 @.@ 3 – 11 @.@ 9 mm long and 4 @.@ 4 – 11 @.@ 0 mm in diameter , compared with 7 @.@ 4 – 17 @.@ 3 mm long and 7 @.@ 6 – 17 @.@ 3 mm diameter for F. rubiginosa . Ficus brachypoda is a lithophytic plant from arid northern and western Australia , with a short petiole and leaf shape aligning it with Ficus <unk> . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Ficus obliqua occurs from Mount Dromedary ( 36 ° S ) in southern New South Wales northwards along the coast and Great Dividing Range to the tip of Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland . Outside Australia it occurs on New Guinea and offshore islands , through eastern Indonesia to Sulawesi in the west and east into the southwestern Pacific , where it is found in New Caledonia , Fiji , Tonga , Samoa and Vanuatu . It had been thought to occur in Western Australia , but these collections have been now referred to Ficus brachypoda . Preferring soils with high nutrient and water content , it occurs on sandstone or <unk> soils in the Sydney region . The habitat is warm temperate to moist subtropical rainforest . Large specimens can rise above the canopy as emergent trees . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The double @-@ eyed fig parrot ( <unk> <unk> ) eats the fruit of Ficus obliqua , steadily depositing fruity detritus on the ground . The rainbow lorikeet ( Trichoglossus <unk> ) is another parrot that consumes the fruit and disperses the seeds ; other Australian bird species include the southern cassowary ( <unk> casuarius ) , brown cuckoo @-@ dove ( Macropygia <unk> ) , rose @-@ crowned fruit dove ( Ptilinopus regina ) , <unk> fruit dove ( P. magnificus ) , wonga pigeon ( <unk> melanoleuca ) , topknot pigeon ( <unk> antarcticus ) , silvereye ( Zosterops lateralis ) , pied currawong ( Strepera graculina ) , black @-@ faced cuckoo @-@ shrike ( <unk> <unk> ) , olive @-@ backed oriole ( <unk> <unk> ) , Australasian <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , green catbird ( <unk> crassirostris ) , regent bowerbird ( <unk> <unk> ) , satin bowerbird ( <unk> violaceus ) , and Lewin 's honeyeater ( Meliphaga lewinii ) . The tree is an important food source for the western Polynesian species the many @-@ coloured fruit dove ( Ptilinopus <unk> ) and crimson @-@ crowned fruit dove ( P. <unk> ) , and has been recommended for amenity planting in Tonga for these birds . The spectacled flying fox ( Pteropus <unk> ) and grey @-@ headed flying fox ( Pteropus poliocephalus ) also eat the fruit . 
 Leaves of Ficus obliqua serve as a food source for the larvae of the butterfly species the common crow ( <unk> core ) , the no @-@ brand crow ( <unk> alcathoe ) , and the <unk> moth species <unk> <unk> . The thrips species <unk> australis feeds on the underside of new leaves of F. obliqua , as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla . As plant cells die , nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue . A gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over . The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime before returning in the evening , possibly to different galls about the tree . The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth , and the life cycle is around six weeks . At other times , thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark . 
 = = = Reproduction and life span = = = 
 Figs have an obligate mutualism with fig wasps ( Agaonidae ) ; figs are only pollinated by fig wasps , and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers . Generally , each fig species depends on a single species of wasp for pollination . The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species to reproduce . The assumption that fig species are usually pollinated by just one species of fig wasp has been challenged by the discovery of cryptic species complexes among what was previously thought to be single species of fig wasps . Ficus obliqua is pollinated by two species of fig wasp — Pleistodontes <unk> and P. xanthocephalus . 
 Female and male flowers in each syconium mature at different times . Female wasps enter the syconium and lay eggs in the female flowers as they mature . These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate . The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers , which have matured by this point , and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process . A field study in Brisbane found that F. obliqua trees often bore both male and female syconia at the same time — this could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations , such as those on islands . The same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter , thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months . 
 The animals that eat the figs disperse the seeds , which then germinate and grow on other plants ( epiphytes ) or on rocks ( <unk> ) . As the new plants develop , they send roots to the forest floor . Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they strangle their hosts . Ficus obliqua is long @-@ lived , and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years .

 Ficus obliqua is an elegant shade tree for parks or fields , and is adaptable to differing soils . A notable specimen in Mick Ryan Park , Milton on the New South Wales south coast stands 14 m ( 46 ft ) tall and 38 m ( 125 ft ) across , and is a local landmark . Like other fig species that grow into large trees , Ficus obliqua is not suitable for any but the largest gardens as its aggressive root system invades drains and garden beds . Fig trees also drop large quantities of fruit and leaves , leaving a mess underfoot . Although it is much less used in bonsai than F. rubiginosa , F. obliqua is well @-@ suited for use in the medium ; its small leaves and trunk 's propensity to thicken give it attributes optimal for a tree 10 – 80 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 31 @.@ 5 in ) in height . It is seen in bonsai nurseries mainly in the Brisbane area , where it is a locally common species , and is very highly regarded by at least one proponent , Bradley Barlow . Barlow entered a specimen from Brisbane to the Bonsai Clubs International competition in 2006 , winning a prize . It is also suited for use as an indoor plant in low- , medium- or brightly lit indoor spaces . The timber is too soft for use in woodworking . 
 Known as baka or baka ni <unk> in Fiji , Ficus obliqua has many of its parts used in Fijian traditional medicine , and was previously held to be sacred there . Its white sap has been used for painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils , or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk . Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or , when diluted , to improve health after childbirth , and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions . The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga . 
 = Tropical Storm Bilis = 
 Severe Tropical Storm Bilis , known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Florita , was a weak tropical cyclone in July 2006 that caused significant damage to areas of the Philippines , Taiwan , and southeastern China . The word Bilis , submitted by the Philippines , means ' speed ' or ' swiftness ' in Tagalog . 
 Despite never officially reaching typhoon strength , Bilis was responsible for $ 4 @.@ 4 billion ( 2006 USD ) in damage and 859 fatalities in the Philippines , Taiwan , and China . Most of the damage was caused by heavy rain , which triggered widespread flash flooding and landslides . Many of the areas Bilis flooded were later affected by Typhoon Kaemi , Typhoon Prapiroon , and intense Typhoon Saomai . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical disturbance developed northeast of Yap on July 7 and slowly increased in organization . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance later that day as it moved northwestward . By July 8 , it had developed sufficient convection to be designated a tropical depression by the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) . The depression continued to strengthen , and was designated Tropical Storm Bilis by the JMA early on July 9 . The JTWC upgraded Bilis to tropical storm status later that day . On July 10 , Bilis moved into the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) , and was designated Tropical Storm Florita for local warnings . 
 Over the next several days , Bilis moved generally northwestward toward Taiwan , slowly strengthening over open waters . Bilis was designated a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 11 , but the storm did not strengthen much further over the next few days due to a marginal upper @-@ air environment and dry air entrainment . PAGASA upgraded the system to typhoon status on July 12 , but the JMA never officially recognized the system as such in its advisories . Bilis reached its official peak intensity of 60 knots ( 110 km / h , 70 mph ) later that day . 
 Bilis made its first landfall in northern Taiwan on July 13 , with an intensity of 55 kt ( 100 km / h , 65 mph ) . After moving across northern Taiwan , Bilis made its second landfall in Fujian , China early on July 14 at the same intensity , then weakened into a tropical depression over land the next day . Bilis lingered as a tropical depression over southeastern China before degenerating into a remnant low on July 16 . But the JMA carried the system as a tropical depression until July 17 . Despite becoming a remnant low , the remnants of Bilis maintained their identity for several days while moving westward over China , bringing heavy rains to inland areas . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 On July 13 , PAGASA issued Storm Signal Number 3 , a warning for winds of 100 – 185 km / h ( 62 – 115 mph ) , for the Batanes and Calayan Islands . Storm Signal Number 2 , for winds of 60 – 100 km / h ( 37 – 62 mph ) , was issued for northern Luzon , including the rest of Cagayan , Ilocos Norte , and Apayao . Storm Signal Number 1 ( 30 – 60 km / h , 19 – 37 mph ) was raised for most of central Luzon , including much of the Cordillera Administrative Region and the northern half of the Ilocos Region . Schools and government offices in those regions were closed . 
 The provincial observatory of Fujian issued a typhoon warning for the province on July 11 , well in advance of Bilis ' final landfall . In response to the warning , officials evacuated over 800 @,@ 000 people from Hunan and 70 @,@ 000 from Zhejiang . In addition , 256 @,@ 000 fishermen and workers were evacuated from coastal areas in southeastern China , and 220 @,@ 000 ships were ordered to return to port . In Shanghai , the evacuations caused significant rail and bus delays , and more than 210 flights in and out of the city were canceled prior to landfall .

 The strongest winds and heaviest rains were south and east of Bilis ' center , and its outer rainbands swept across Luzon in the Philippines , causing heavy rains , wind gusts to tropical storm force , flash flooding , and landslides . Bilis was responsible for 45 million pesos in damage and at least 14 deaths , including three in Baguio City , and six more in the Manila area .

 Damage was light in Taiwan , due to Bilis ' quick movement across the northern coast of the island . The Republic of China government reported four deaths , two of which were the deaths of fishermen from mainland China whose boat ran aground on Matsu Island . Another man was electrocuted in the city of Taipei as a result of the storm . The cause of the fourth death is unknown .

 The storm made its second landfall in Fujian province , China , which was the province most impacted by the tropical cyclone . A total of 92 deaths and 3 billion Chinese yuan in damage were caused by the system , mostly from flooding . Schools and tourist attractions in the province were closed for several days . A total of 4 @,@ 028 @,@ 000 people were affected over an area of 17 @,@ 597 square kilometres ( 6 @,@ 794 sq mi ) , and the storm caused the evacuation of 519 @,@ 000 people from the province . 
 Flooding killed 39 people in eastern Guangxi and 183 people in Guangdong . Eight more people were killed in Yunnan when a flash flood swept away some road workers ' huts . A weather station in Guangdong reported a 5 @-@ hour rainfall total of 360 @.@ 6 mm ( 14 @.@ 2 inches ) . In Zhejiang , strong winds and heavy rain from Bilis caused 694 million yuan in damage , and a wind gust to 43 m / s ( 155 km / h , 96 mph ) was reported . 
 Several sections of the Beijing @-@ Guangzhou railway , a main rail route in China , were blocked by flooding and landslides , causing many delays and diversions . One train was surrounded by floodwaters in <unk> , and passengers had to be evacuated to a nearby school . At least 274 trains were affected and the train company refunded nearly 2 million tickets . After three days of repair work , the rail service resumed normal operations on July 18 . 
 Significant damage occurred in Hunan , where heavy flooding and mudslides destroyed over 31 @,@ 000 homes and caused 526 deaths . Most of the damage and fatalities occurred in the village of <unk> , where local officials reported the flooding as the worst the area had seen in the past 100 years , and described the death toll as " unprecedented " . In all , Bilis was responsible for 843 deaths , 208 people reported missing , and $ 4 @.@ 4 billion ( 2006 USD ) in damage to southeastern China . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Bilis and its associated flooding left over 400 @,@ 000 people homeless , and over 2 million more had to be evacuated in the face of rising waters . Following the storm , the Red Cross Society of China provided food , blankets , and water purification kits to over 100 @,@ 000 Hunan residents in mass evacuation shelters . The relief effort was complicated by an earthquake in Yunnan , as well as three more tropical cyclones : Typhoon Kaemi , Typhoon Prapiroon , and Typhoon Saomai . All of the storms were stronger than Bilis , and exacerbated flooding and other problems in the region . 
 Because of the sudden large increase in the number of reported deaths in Hunan in a matter of hours , Chinese government officials accused local officials of covering up damage and casualty details . The Ministry of Civil Affairs sent a team to Hunan to investigate the allegations , and issued a notice stating that anyone found to be covering up any damage details would be held accountable . 
 The China Meteorological Administration released a press release after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage . First , the storm decelerated after landfall and maintained its identity for 120 hours while moving south of due west . Secondly , the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle . Also , the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea , and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1 @-@ hour rainfall total of 115 @.@ 1 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 inches ) , a new record . Finally , previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more prone to flooding . 
 At the 39th annual meeting of the ESCAP / WMO Typhoon Committee in Manila in December 2006 , the name Bilis was retired , along with four other names . In December 2007 , the committee selected the name <unk> to replace Bilis on the Western Pacific basin name lists beginning in 2008 .

 Starting in 1996 , he served two years as a legislative assistant to the Buffalo Common Council . In early 1998 , he was named executive director of the Office of Urban Initiatives , which is a community development corporation that endeavors to improve business opportunities for minorities . After then @-@ City Councilman Byron Brown was elected to the New York State Senate in November 2000 , Thompson was favored for an appointment as Brown 's city council successor . 
 = = Councilman = = 
 Thompson was sworn in as the Masten District City Councilman on January 4 , 2001 after being appointed by the Democratic Committee . His east side district included 27 % of Buffalo 's African American population . The Buffalo City Council had a brief African @-@ American majority during Thompson 's appointed half term that ended following the subsequent elections in September and November 2001 . After African @-@ Americans lost their majority the council voted along racial lines by a 7 – 6 margin to shrink the common council from thirteen to nine members by eliminating the four at @-@ large positions ( three of which were held by African @-@ Americans ) . The city voters endorsed the proposal by a 35 @,@ 849 – 19 @,@ 036 margin which largely went along racial lines . Thompson retained his council position in the 2001 , 2003 and 2005 elections .

 = = = Higher office = = = 
 In 2005 , Thompson began testing the waters for higher office . He raised campaign funds and consulted party leaders about the possibility of challenging United States House of Representatives then 76 @-@ year @-@ old congresswoman Louise Slaughter who was already a 10 @-@ term veteran . Slaughter 's New York 's 28th congressional district was 29 percent African American , and minorities comprised nearly 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote . Charles B. Rangel warned that Slaughter had strong ties to the Congressional Black Caucus as well as strong support from labor , women 's and pro @-@ choice groups . 
 Thompson was encouraged to pursue Brown 's New York State Senate seat that was to be filled by special election on February 28 , 2006 after Brown ascended to be the Mayor of Buffalo on January 1 , 2006 following the 2005 election . The district has a 4 – 1 ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans . In 2006 , the Erie County Democratic Party chairman was Leonard Lenihan , and he noted that Thompson had not been timely in entering the special election process . The Erie and Niagara County Democratic committees bypassed Thompson as their nominee in favor of Marc Coppola despite Brown 's backing . 
 Thompson had issued a threat that without backing for the State Senate seat , he would challenge Slaughter in the September primary election , but Lenihan was unimpressed with the threat and noted that Thompson needed to take a " Dale Carnegie course in terms of how to win friends and influence people " . 
 Brown and Lenihan were at odds over various political positions after Lenihan played a major role in Brown 's election to the office of Mayor . Brown supported Andrew Cuomo for New York Attorney General , David Paterson for Lieutenant Governor of New York and Thompson for 60th District New York Senator .

Marc Coppola won the special election by a 56 – 44 % margin in a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 6 : 1 . Thompson opposed incumbent Senator Marc Coppola as well as his cousin Former State Sen. Al Coppola in the September 2006 Democratic Primary for a full two @-@ year term in the Senate . Thompson defeated both with 53 % of the vote . He then defeated Marc Coppola again in the General election where Coppola ran as an Independent .

After refusing to comment on the issue for some time , Thompson was one of eight Democratic defectors on Eliot Spitzer 's unpopular policy allowing illegal aliens to obtain driver 's licenses . Thompson was one of eleven New York State Senators to be uncontested in the November 2008 general election . He supported the streamlining of <unk> and woman @-@ owned business certification . He opposes fracking 
 Thompson voted in favor of same @-@ sex marriage legislation on December 2 , 2009 , but the bill was defeated . 
 He won the Democratic Party nomination in the September 14 , 2010 primary election . After a lengthy recount Thompson lost the general election to Mark Grisanti .

 = Bop Gun ( Homicide : Life on the Street ) = 
 " Bop Gun " is the second season premiere of the American police drama television series Homicide : Life on the Street , and the tenth overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 6 , 1994 . In the episode , the Baltimore homicide unit investigates the shooting death of the wife of a tourist , played by guest star Robin Williams . 
 The episode was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana , and directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal . In response to network feedback and poor ratings from the first season , " Bop Gun " marked several changes in the series , including a less bleak visual style and a greater focus on one plot , rather than multiple subplots . It was also the first episode to focus primarily on a homicide victim , rather than on the detectives . Simon felt the dialogue was realistic , especially that of the dark humor employed by detectives as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the job . 
 Williams previously worked with Homicide executive producer Barry Levinson on the films Good Morning , Vietnam ( 1987 ) and Toys ( 1992 ) . This led to speculation that Williams took the role on " Bop Gun " as a favor to Levinson , but the actor insisted it was out of admiration for the series itself . A young Jake Gyllenhaal , the son of the episode 's director , makes an appearance as Williams ' son . The episode was the first to feature Chris Tergesen as music coordinator , which resulted in the use of more songs than previous episodes , including " Killer " by Seal and " Feels Like Rain " by Buddy Guy . 
 " Bop Gun " was seen by 16 @.@ 3 million viewers , one of the highest Nielsen ratings of the week , thanks in large part due to interest in Williams ' appearance . The episode received generally positive reviews , with several particularly complimenting the dramatic performance by Williams . " Bop Gun " won a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay of an Episodic Drama . Williams also received an Emmy Award nomination for Guest Actor in a Drama Series . The episode , along with the rest of the first and second seasons of Homicide : Life on the Street was released on DVD in the United States on May 27 , 2003 .

 Felton ( Daniel Baldwin ) and Howard ( Melissa Leo ) investigate the murder of an Iowa woman who was shot to death in front of her husband Robert Ellison ( Robin Williams ) and two young children during a stick @-@ up . Since the victims are tourists , the case becomes a " red ball " and receives considerable attention from the press , city officials and top police brass . Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) tries to interview the two young children , but Ellison stops him , protesting that the experience is too hard on them . After obtaining information from street thugs , the police arrest Marvin ( Antonio Charity ) , who possesses 45 @-@ caliber bullets matching those used in the shooting . A mournful Ellison overhears Felton making jokes about the investigation and bragging about the overtime he expects to receive from it . He angrily demands Felton be thrown off the case , but Gee ( Yaphet Kotto ) calms him down by explaining the police have to be detached from the victims because they encounter so many . Ellison takes his children back to their hotel room , where his daughter Abby ( Julia Devin ) is in denial about her mother 's death , and his son Matt ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) angrily refuses to talk to his father . 
 The police arrest a second suspect named Tweety ( Vincent Miller ) , who was found in possession of the murdered woman 's locket . The detectives question Marvin and Tweety separately until Tweety identifies the shooter as 19 @-@ year @-@ old Vaughn Perkins ( Lloyd Goodman ) . Howard is surprised to learn Vaughn has a mostly clean criminal record , and his family insists Vaughn would never kill anybody . Vaughn is arrested without incident , but Ellison is unable to identify the three suspects because he does not remember their faces . Meanwhile , Ellison sees his wife 's body in the morgue , and gets upset that her clothes and wedding ring have been removed . Bayliss later returns the ring to Ellison , who admits he feels guilty for not protecting his wife or stopping the shooter . Ellison asks to hold Bayliss ' gun just to know how it feels , and Bayliss reluctantly agrees . 
 Howard repeatedly questions Vaughn , believing he is acting as the fall guy for his two friends . Vaughn says nothing , but eventually writes a letter of apology to Ellison . Felton closes the case despite Howard 's protests for more time to investigate . Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole . Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison , but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead . Howard tries to give Vaughn 's letter to Ellison , but he refuses to accept it . Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison , where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick @-@ up because he thought if he had the gun , he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt . Vaughn said he lost control of the robbery , and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends . A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton 's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter . 
 = = Production = = 
 Despite critical acclaim , Homicide : Life on the Street suffered from poor ratings throughout its first season , prompting NBC to consider taking it off the air . After a nine @-@ episode first season , the network approved four more episodes for the show 's second season as a trial run to determine whether to continue or cancel the show . The script for " Bop Gun " was completed before the first season ended , but NBC executives asked for several refinements – including less involved plots and fewer camera movements – before approving a second season . In an attempt to appease the network and improve ratings , executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana sought to make subtle changes to give the show a stronger mainstream appeal , while aiming not to compromise its integrity or originality . With " Bop Gun " , the producers slightly toned down the bleak visual style and hand @-@ held photography motif . It is also the first episode to focus on a single story , rather than multiple subplots , which Fontana felt allowed the writers to tell the main story better . Fontana said of the changes to the series , " We were experimenting with our first nine episodes . Whenever you try something new , you tend to err on the side of breaking ground . But we 'd rather have more people watching , so the colors and lighting are slightly brighter , and the camera movements are not as jarring . " " Bop Gun " marked the first episode with Jean de Segonzac as director of photography . The first scene , which depicts the moments immediately before the shooting , juxtaposes shots of the Ellison family admiring the tourist attractions of Baltimore with shots of their shooters playing basketball before following the family . The photography depicts the different sides of Baltimore by presenting the Ellison family shots like a cheerful tourist advertisement , with the other shots presenting a grittier image of the city .
