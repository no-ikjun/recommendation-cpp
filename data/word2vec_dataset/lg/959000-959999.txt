 Finally , in 1260 , Hasan @-@ Jalal decided to ally himself with the forces of the Georgian king David <unk> , who was leading an insurrection against Mongol rule . He was captured several times by the Mongols yet his family was able to free him by paying a ransom . The insurrection eventually failed and under the orders of Arghun Khan , Hasan @-@ Jalal was arrested once more and taken to Qazvin , ( now in Iran ) . According to Kirakos <unk> , <unk> appealed to the Hulagu Khan 's wife Doquz Khatun , to pressure Arghun to free her father . However , as Arghun Khan learned of this , he had Hasan @-@ Jalal tortured and finally executed . Hasan Jalal 's son <unk> ordered several of his men to Iran to retrieve his father 's dismembered body , which had been tossed into a well ; upon bringing it back , the body was given a proper funeral and buried at Gandzasar monastery .

 Following his death , the family truncated Hasan @-@ Jalal 's official title to the shorter " Princes of <unk> . " <unk> was ordered by <unk> to take over his father 's position and held the post until 1306 . His cousin Vakhtank , whose descendants would become the Melik @-@ <unk> family , was given control over the region of Dizak . As a method of showing their relation to Hasan @-@ Jalal , his descendants adopted Hasan @-@ Jalal as their surname and appended -yan to the end to form a suffix . The family funded numerous architectural and cultural projects which continue to stand today , including Gandzasar monastery and the adjacent Church of St. John the Baptist . In the late 16th century , the family branched out and established <unk> in settlements in Jraberd , Khachen and Gulistan . 
 = = = Liberation movement = = = 
 During the Turko @-@ Persian wars of the 17th century and 18th century , the meliks fiercely resisted and fought back against incursions made by both sides . In the last quarter of the 18th century , they aided the invading Russian armies to help clear the region of both the Turks and Persians . The Hasan @-@ Jalalyans were one of the most prominent of the melik families that took up the cause to liberate the region from foreign control ; the foremost among them being Catholicos Yesayi Hasan @-@ Jalalyan ( ? - 1728 ) . In 1677 , Armenian Catholicos Hakob of Julfa had held a secret meeting with the meliks of Karabakh , proposing that a delegation travel to Europe to garner support for a liberation of the region . In 1711 , Yesayi , accompanying Israel Ori , traveled to Russia to help build support for an army under Peter the Great . Ori , however , died on the way , and Yesayi soon took over as the lead figure of the movement . He continued negotiations with Peter , and in a letter sent to him in 1718 , promised the support of a 10 @-@ 12 @,@ 000 @-@ man Armenian army as well as support from neighboring Georgian forces . His entreaties continued until 1724 , when Peter concluded an agreement with the Ottoman Empire that , oddly , gave the Muslim @-@ populated regions in eastern Transcaucasia to Russia and Christian @-@ populated western regions to the Turks . Both had just finished conquering swaths of Safavid territory comprising large parts of the Caucasus and Eastern Anatolia , while the latter was disintegrating in a civil war . Russian interest in the Caucasus soon waned after Peter 's death in 1725 as its leaders pulled their forces back across the Terek River. and the gained territories in the North and South Caucasus were ceded back to Iran ( now led by Nader Shah ) per the treaties of <unk> and Ganja of 1732 and 1735 , <unk> . 
 While the Ottomans thus temporarily therefore gained the Christian regions of the disintegrating Safavids , <unk> was blamed for this failure by some of the leaders of the Armenian army as they were forced to fend for themselves against the Turkish invasions . 
 In the course of the period from the 17th century to the early 19th century , the Jalalyan house also proliferated in the establishment of several other Armenian noble houses , including the Melik @-@ <unk> family , who became the last rulers of the principality of Jraberd . <unk> II Hasan @-@ Jalalyan , who was to die in 1813 , was the final melik of Khachen when the Russian Empire first entered the region in 1805 during the Russo @-@ Persian War of 1804 @-@ 1813 . In 1828 , following the end of the second Russo @-@ Persian War , when per the outcome as confirmed in the Treaty of Turkmenchay and Persia 's forced ceding of the last territories it was holding in the South Caucasus , the Russians finally dissolved the office of Catholicos .

 = Seton Hall University = 
 Seton Hall University is a private Roman Catholic university in South Orange , New Jersey , United States . Founded in 1856 by Archbishop James Roosevelt Bayley and named after his aunt , Elizabeth Ann Seton , Seton Hall is the oldest diocesan university in the United States . 
 Seton Hall consists of 11 schools and colleges with an undergraduate enrollment of about 5 @,@ 800 students and a graduate enrollment of about 4 @,@ 400 . It was ranked tied for 123rd in Best National Universities by U.S. News & World Report in 2016 , with the School of Law ranked tied for 63rd . The Stillman School of Business was ranked 78th of 132 undergraduate business schools in the nation by Bloomberg Businessweek in 2014 . 
 Seton Hall University was also ranked one of the top five universities for undergraduate internships by the International Business Times in 2011 .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 Like many Catholic universities in the United States , Seton Hall arose out of the Plenary Council of American Bishops , held in Baltimore , Maryland in 1844 , with the goal of bringing Catholicism to higher education in order to help propagate the faith . The Diocese of Newark had been established by Pope Pius IX in 1853 , just three years before the founding of the college , and it necessitated an institution for higher learning . Seton Hall College was formally founded on September 1 , 1856 by Archdiocese of Newark Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley , a cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt . Bishop Bayley named the institution after his aunt , Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton , who was later named the first American @-@ born Catholic saint . 
 The main campus of the college was originally in Madison , New Jersey . Reverend Bernard J. McQuaid served as the first college president ( 1856 – 1857 , 1859 – 1868 ) and directed a staff of four diocesan clergy including Reverend Alfred Young , vice @-@ president ; Reverend Daniel Fisher ( the second college president , 1857 – 1859 ) and five lay instructors . Initially , Seton Hall had only five students – Leo G. <unk> , Louis and Alfred <unk> , Peter Meehan and John Moore . By the end of the first year , the student body had grown more than tenfold to 60 . The college moved to its current location in 1860 . 
 By the 1860s , Seton Hall College was continuing its rapid growth and began to enroll more and more students each year . However , among other difficulties , several fires on campus slowed down the growth process . The first of several strange fires in the University 's history occurred in 1867 which destroyed the college 's first building . Two decades later on March 9 , 1886 , another fire destroyed the university 's main building . In the 20th century , another campus fire burned down a classroom as well as several dormitory buildings in 1909 . 
 During the 19th century , despite setbacks , financially tight times and the American Civil War , the College continued to expand . Seton Hall opened a military science department ( forerunner to the ROTC program ) during the summer of 1893 , but this program was ultimately disbanded during the Spanish – American War . Perhaps one of the most pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when Seton Hall 's preparatory ( high school ) and college ( undergraduate ) divisions were permanently separated . By 1937 , Seton Hall established a University College . This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall . Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968 . In 1948 , Seton Hall was given a license by the FCC for WSOU @-@ FM . 
 The College was organized into a university in 1950 following an unprecedented growth in enrollment . The College of Arts and Sciences and the schools of business , nursing and education comprised the University ; the School of Law opened its doors in 1951 , with Miriam Rooney as the first woman dean of law in the United States . 
 = = = College of Medicine and Dentistry = = = 
 The Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry was established in 1954 as the first medical school and dental school in New Jersey . It was located in Jersey City , adjacent to the Jersey City Medical Center , which was used for clinical education . Although the college , set up under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Newark , was a separate legal entity from the University , it had an interlocking Board of Trustees . The first class was enrolled in 1956 and graduated in 1960 . The dental school also awarded its first degrees in 1960 . From 1960 to 1964 , 348 individuals received an M.D. degree . The college was sold to the state of New Jersey in 1965 for $ 4 million after the Archdiocese could not support mounting school debt and renamed the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry ( which became the New Jersey Medical School , part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey ) . That entity became part of the Rutgers University system in 2013 and now exists as the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School . Seton Hall established a new School of Medicine in partnership with Hackensack University Health Network in 2015 . 
 = = = Modernization period = = = 
 Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing in the next two decades , the university saw the construction and modernization of a large number of facilities and the construction of the library , science building , residence halls and the University center . Many new programs and majors were inaugurated , as were important social outreach efforts . New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors , and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged . 
 The 1970s and 1980s continued to be a time of growth and renewal . New business and nursing classroom buildings and an art center were opened . In 1984 , the Immaculate Conception Seminary returned to Seton Hall , its original home until 1926 , when it moved to Darlington ( a section of Mahwah centered on a grand mansion and estate ) . The Recreation Center was dedicated in 1987 . With the construction of four new residence halls between 1986 and 1988 , and the purchase of an off @-@ campus apartment building in 1990 , the University made significant changes to account for a larger number of student residents . Seton Hall is recognized as a residential campus , providing living space for about 2100 students . 
 The physical development of the campus continued in the 1990s . The $ 20 million Walsh Library opened in 1994 , and its first @-@ class study and research resources marked the beginning of a technological transformation of Seton Hall . The University dedicated its newest academic center in 1997 , originally named Kozlowski Hall for Dennis Kozlowski , former CEO of Tyco International . Renamed Jubilee Hall following Kozlowski 's criminal conviction in 2005 , the building is a clear example of Seton Hall 's commitment to expanding the role of information technology in higher education . All classrooms in this six @-@ story , 126 @,@ 000 square foot ( 12 @,@ 000 m2 ) building are wired for network and Internet connections , and many of the lecture halls are equipped with distance @-@ learning technology . Its recreation center was originally named after Robert Brennan , but he was found guilty of securities fraud in 1994 . It has since been renamed for long @-@ time athletic director Richie Regan . 
 A new School of Law building and parking garage were also constructed in the 1990s as part of the revitalization of downtown Newark . Seton Hall continues to be a leader in technology in education , as well as in distance learning , with its renowned Seton World Wide program . In 1998 , all incoming full @-@ time , first @-@ year students were issued laptop computers as part of the University 's innovative and nationally recognized mobile computing program .

 On January 19 , 2000 , an arson fire killed three and injured 54 students in Boland Hall , a freshman residence hall on the campus in South Orange . The incident , one of the deadliest in recent US history , occurred at 4 : 30 am , when most students were asleep . After a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half year investigation , a 60 @-@ count indictment charged two freshmen students , Sean Ryan and Joseph <unk> , with starting the fire and felony murder for the deaths that resulted . <unk> and Ryan pleaded guilty to third @-@ degree arson and were sentenced to five years in a youth correctional facility with eligibility for parole 16 months after the start of their prison terms . Consequently , the student body dedicated an area in front of Boland Hall to those that suffered from the fire called " The Remember Seal " and stronger university fire safety precautions were executed .

 On the 150th anniversary ( 1856 – 2006 ) of the university ’ s founding , Seton Hall initiated the Ever Forward capital campaign to raise a total of $ 150 million . The campaign was the most prestigious building campaign in the University ’ s long history . The funds were directed to many areas throughout the university , however a majority went toward building and reconstructing campus facilities and historic sites . 
 In fall 2007 , the university opened the new $ 35 million Science and Technology Center , completing one of the major campaign priorities ahead of schedule . On December 17 , 2007 , the university announced that the campaign 's fund raising goals had been met and exceeded more than two weeks ahead of the campaign 's scheduled closing date .

A second round of construction is planned for 2016 and beyond . 
 Seton Hall announced the formation of two additional academic units in 2015 – the School of Medicine and the College of Communication and the Arts . The medical school , which is expected to open in 2017 in partnership with Hackensack University Health Network , will be one of six Catholic medical schools in the United States and should address a shortage of primary care physicians in New Jersey and the surrounding region .

Colonel Winter ( James Gandolfini ) , the prison 's commandant , is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears : Irwin criticizes Winter 's much @-@ prized military artifacts collection , calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would ever have . 
 Winter , who has never seen combat , resents the remark . He then takes exception to what he perceives as Irwin 's attempt to change the attitudes of the prisoners , his admiration for Irwin fading fast . On one occasion , Irwin is punished harshly after stopping a guard from clubbing a prisoner , Corporal Ramon Aguilar ( Clifton Collins , Jr . ) , who had made the mistake of saluting Irwin in the prison yard . 
 Continuing to observe acts of cruelty , Irwin attempts to unify the prisoners by building a " castle wall " of stone and mortar at the facility , which in many ways resembles a medieval castle . <unk> the respect Irwin is clearly receiving , Winter orders his guards to destroy the wall . Aguilar , directly involved in its construction , takes a stand before the bulldozer . Winter orders a sharpshooter with a coded hand gesture to fire a normally non @-@ lethal rubber bullet directly at Aguilar 's head , killing him . 
 After the wall is destroyed , Irwin and the inmates pay final respects to Aguilar in formation . Winter later tries to make amends with Irwin , who calls him a disgrace to the uniform and demands his resignation . 
 The prisoners begin to behave like soldiers around Irwin , using code words and gestures , infuriating the commandant . Winter reaches out to an anti @-@ social prisoner named Yates ( Mark Ruffalo ) , a former officer and Apache helicopter pilot convicted of running a drug @-@ smuggling ring . Yates is bribed to inform about Irwin 's plans in exchange for a reduced sentence . 
 Irwin organizes a plot to throw the prison into chaos . His intent is to show a friend , Brigadier General Wheeler ( Delroy Lindo ) , the commandant 's superior officer , that the commandant is unfit and should be removed from command under the Uniform Code of Military Justice . During a visit , Winter receives a letter threatening the kidnapping of General Wheeler by the prisoners . After ordering his men into action , Winter discovers that the scheme was a fake orchestrated by Irwin to detect how prison guards would react during an actual uprising . 
 Yates steals a U.S. flag from the warden 's office and seizes a helicopter used by guards . 
 Using improvised weapons the prisoners capture an armored vehicle and the helicopter . The prisoners place a call to Wheeler 's headquarters and inform him of the riot . Winter has little time to regain control before Wheeler will arrive to see the prison under siege , so orders the use of live ammunition against the prisoners . 
 Winter knows from Yates that Irwin 's ultimate goal is to raise the American flag upside down , a classic signal of distress . Irwin 's men create havoc but ultimately are confronted by overwhelming numbers of guards , armed with live ammunition . Irwin orders the prisoners to stand down and elects to personally hoist the flag . Winter shoots Irwin , fatally . 
 Peretz places the Colonel under arrest for the shooting of Irwin . The prisoners salute the flag and Winter now sees that Irwin has actually raised the flag in the correct manner . It flies above the prison 's walls as General Wheeler arrives . Colonel Winter is led away in handcuffs . The inmates build a new wall as memorial to their fallen comrades . Aguilar and Irwin 's names are among those carved onto the castle 's wall .

 The film was shot mainly at the 103 @-@ year @-@ old former Tennessee State Prison in Nashville , which had previously been used for filming in The Green Mile and Last Dance , and was chosen because of its Gothic and castle @-@ like appearance . The state of Tennessee offered to provide the location rent @-@ free , with exemption from the state 's 6 percent state sales tax . James Gandolfini earned $ 5 million for co @-@ starring in the film after finishing the third season of The Sopranos in March 2001 . 
 A crew of 150 worked on refurbishing existing buildings and constructing new buildings in a time limit of nine weeks . A wall 61 metres ( 200 ft ) long and 6 metres ( 20 ft ) high was built , serving as the prison 's entrance . A metal walkway and two towers were also built as vantage points for the guards . The film required an office with a large window through which the warden could watch the inmates ; this was constructed by the production crew . Director Rod Lurie insisted on having the prisoners ' cells face each other , but this is not the case at the Tennessee State Prison . To solve the problem , production designer Kirk <unk> created cells in a warehouse near the prison . 
 = = = Cinematography = = = 
 To show the balance of power , the film crew used multiple cinematography techniques involving different displays of color , lighting , camera and costumes . In the warden 's office intense color was used to reflect freedom or power , in contrast to the washed @-@ out colors from the less powerful yard . The contrasts shift as the story progresses , showing the increasing power of the prisoners . The American flag in the yard is described by <unk> as " the heart of The Castle " and is the only exemption to the washed @-@ out color palette . 
 Cinematographer Shelly Johnson , in collaboration with director Lurie and the design team , also used lighting and camerawork to signify the shifting of powers . For example , the yard is at first naturally lit and more influenced by daylight , in contrast to Winter 's office , which is artificially illuminated by lamps . As the film progresses , the office is more fully infiltrated by exterior light through a broken window . The shift of power is also emphasized through camera techniques . Hand @-@ held cameras were used when filming in the yard to make the audience feel as if they were " participants in the action " . However , a very precise , sterile camera composition was used in the warden 's office . The prisoners ' world gets more precise during the film , while the colonel 's world is filmed more loosely . 
 Costume designer Ha Nguyen also demonstrates this contrast in the clothing of the cast . The film starts with the prisoners having their clothing divided by ethnicity , with African Americans wearing different headwear , Latinos wearing vests and various arm accessories , and the White Americans in cut @-@ off t @-@ shirts . After the arrival of General Irwin , the prisoners start wearing more similar clothing in a " sharp military manner " . The uniforms of the prisoners change from the usual chocolate brown color to light grey , because of its muddled look on film and excessive darkness in some scenes . Ha Nguyen also contrasted the non @-@ battlefield ribbons found on Colonel Winter 's uniform with the battlefield medals found on General Irwin 's uniform ( seen only in the opening scene as Irwin is inducted into the prison ) . 
 The wall created by the prisoners in the middle of the yard also represents change and incarnation . What is at first a " <unk> mess " representing the lack of unity among prisoners later becomes a perfect wall , a " powerful symbol of the results of [ Irwin 's ] leadership " .

 Special effects supervisor Burt Dalton and stunt coordinator Mic Rodger created the battle weapons used in the final scenes . The trebuchet , used by prisoners to throw rocks , was capable of throwing a 68 kilograms ( 150 lb ) rock a distance of 60 metres ( 200 ft ) with an accuracy of ten feet around the target . The water cannon had the power to shoot 76 litres ( 20 US gal ) of water per second . Some of the cast did their own stunts , including Mark Ruffalo , who performed one scene hanging from a helicopter . Interiors of the helicopter were not created with blue screen effects ; instead , a special gimbal was used to hold a full @-@ sized Huey @-@ A type military helicopter . The gimbal was capable of rotating the helicopter 360 degrees and vertically moving it 20 feet . The gimbal was controlled by a computer , allowing Dalton to precisely set speed and movement ; this ensured precise <unk> for multiple takes .

 The Last Castle received mixed reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 52 % , based on 113 reviews , with an average rating of 5 @.@ 6 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus , " The Last Castle is well acted and rousing for the most part , but the story cannot stand up to close scrutiny . " At Metacritic , a rating website which assigns a normalized rating , the film has a score of 42 out of 100 , based on 32 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . 
 Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle mentioned the cast , describing Redford as " no George C. Scott " and Gandolfini as an unusual choice to play an icy intellectual . LaSalle stated that " ' The Last Castle ' , on the surface , seems like a naive film about a great leader 's capacity to inspire " , but at closer look " seems to mean one thing but means another upon reflection " . In general , LaSalle is in favour of the movie . 
 Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun @-@ Times saw it as " a dramatic , involving story " but criticized its " loopholes and lapses . " Ebert noted that Irwin is no less evil than Winter and that they both " delight in manipulating those they can control . " He pointed out that the film fails to portray how the prisoners manufacture the weapons and hide them under Winter 's observation . 
 It received 3 out of 5 stars on IGN ; the review noted that though a well paced and well acted film , it " suffers from this overall militaristic , streamlined approach . " 
 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the film 's " pretensions lead to a slow , even stately pace , what should be crackling confrontations between Irwin and Winter end up playing more like a tea party than a Wagnerian battle of wills . " 
 Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the movie a " C @-@ plus " grade , writing : " As staged by Lurie , the drama has all the subtlety and surprise of a showdown between the sissy @-@ bully son of Captain <unk> and a hero who 's like a fusion of Brubaker , Spartacus , and Norma Rae . "

 = Dyson sphere = 
 A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star and captures most or all of its power output . The concept was first described by Olaf Stapledon in his science fiction novel , Star Maker ( 1937 ) , and later popularized by Freeman Dyson in his 1960 paper , " Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation " . Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the escalating energy needs of a technological civilization and would be a necessity for its long @-@ term survival . He proposed that searching for such structures could lead to the detection of advanced , intelligent extraterrestrial life . Different types of Dyson spheres and their energy @-@ harvesting ability would correspond to levels of technological advancement on the Kardashev scale . 
 Since then , other variant designs involving building an artificial structure or series of structures to encompass a star have been proposed in exploratory engineering or described in science fiction under the name " Dyson sphere " . These later proposals have not been limited to solar @-@ power stations , with many involving habitation or industrial elements . Most fictional depictions describe a solid shell of matter enclosing a star , which is considered the least plausible variant of the idea . In May 2013 , at the Starship Century Symposium in San Diego , Dyson repeated his comments that he wished the concept had not been named after him . 
 = = Origin of concept = = 
 The concept of the Dyson sphere was the result of a thought experiment by physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson , when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy . He reasoned that if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough , there would come a time when it demanded the total energy output of the Sun . He proposed a system of orbiting structures ( which he referred to initially as a shell ) designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun . Dyson 's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed , but focused only on issues of energy collection , on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual emission spectrum in comparison to a star . His 1960 paper " Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra @-@ Red Radiation " , published in the journal Science , is credited with being the first to formalize the concept of the Dyson sphere . 
 However , Dyson was not the first to advance this idea . He was inspired by the mention of the concept in the 1937 science fiction novel Star Maker , by Olaf Stapledon , and possibly by the works of J. D. Bernal , Raymond Z. Gallun , and Edgar Rice Burroughs who seem to have explored similar concepts in their work . 
 = = Feasibility = = 
 Although such megastructures may be theoretically possible , all plans to build a fixed @-@ in @-@ place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity 's engineering capacity . However , parts of the technology , like orbiting satellites and solar sails , have already been developed . Deployment of spacecraft and satellites using photovoltaics might be seen as the first small steps towards building a Dyson swarm . However , the number of craft required to obtain , transmit , and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present @-@ day industrial capabilities . George <unk> has advocated use of self @-@ replicating robots to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term . Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around white dwarfs and even pulsars . 
 = = Variants = = 
 In fictional accounts , the Dyson @-@ sphere concept is often interpreted as an artificial hollow sphere of matter around a star . This perception is based on a literal interpretation of Dyson 's original short paper introducing the concept . In response to letters prompted by this paper , Dyson replied , " A solid shell or ring surrounding a star is mechanically impossible . The form of ' biosphere ' which I envisaged consists of a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star . " 
 = = = Dyson swarm = = = 
 The variant closest to Dyson 's original conception is the " Dyson swarm " . It consists of a large number of independent constructs ( usually solar power satellites and space habitats ) orbiting in a dense formation around the star . This construction approach has advantages : components could be sized appropriately , and it can be constructed incrementally . Various forms of wireless energy transfer could be used to transfer energy between components and Earth . 
 Disadvantages resulting from the nature of orbital mechanics would make the arrangement of the orbits of the swarm extremely complex . The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring , in which all such structures share the same orbit . More @-@ complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star 's output , but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap . Another potential problem is the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations . 
 As noted below , such a cloud of collectors would alter the light emitted by the star system . However , the disruption compared to a star 's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small to be noticed on Earth . 
 = = = Dyson bubble = = = 
 A second type of Dyson sphere is the " Dyson bubble " . It would be similar to a Dyson swarm , composed of many independent constructs ( usually solar power satellites and space habitats ) and likewise could be constructed incrementally . 
 Unlike the Dyson swarm , the constructs making it up are not in orbit around the star , but would be statites — satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure to counteract the star 's pull of gravity . Such constructs would not be in danger of collision or of eclipsing one another ; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star , and independent of one another . Because the ratio of radiation pressure and the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance ( provided the statite has an unobstructed line @-@ of @-@ sight to the surface of its star ) , such statites could also vary their distance from their central star . 
 The practicality of this approach is questionable with modern material science , but cannot yet be ruled out . A 100 % reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall density of 0 @.@ 78 grams per square meter of sail . To illustrate the low mass of the required materials , consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2 @.@ 17 × 1020 kg , which is about the same mass as the asteroid Pallas . Another illustration : Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g / m2 . 
 Such a material has not yet been produced in the form of a working light sail . The lightest carbon @-@ fiber light @-@ sail material currently produced has a density — without payload — of 3 g / m2 , or about four times as heavy as would be needed to construct a solar statite . 
 A single sheet of graphene , the two @-@ dimensional form of carbon , has a density of only 0 @.@ 37 mg per square meter , making such a single sheet of graphene possibly effective as a solar sail . However , as of 2015 graphene has not been fabricated in large sheets , and it has a relatively high rate of radiation absorption , about 2 @.@ 3 % ( i.e. , it would only be 97 @.@ 7 % reflective ) . For frequencies in the upper GHz and lower THz range , the absorption rate is as high as 50 – 100 % due to voltage bias and / or doping . 
 Ultra @-@ light carbon nanotubes meshed through molecular manufacturing techniques have densities between 1 @.@ 3 g / m2 to 1 @.@ 4 g / m2 . By the time a civilization is ready to use this technology , the carbon nanotube 's manufacturing might be optimised enough for them to have a density lower than the necessary 0 @.@ 7 g / m2 , and the average sail density with rigging might be kept to 0 @.@ 3 g / m2 ( a " spin stabilized " light sail requires minimal additional mass in rigging ) . If such a sail could be constructed at this areal density , a space habitat the size of the L5 Society 's proposed O 'Neill cylinder — 500 km2 , with room for over 1 million inhabitants , massing 3 × 106 tons — could be supported by a circular light sail 3 @,@ 000 km in diameter , with a combined sail / habitat mass of 5 @.@ 4 × 109 kg . For comparison , this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of Jupiter 's moon Europa ( although the sail is a flat disc , not a sphere ) , or the distance between San Francisco and Kansas City . Such a structure would , however , have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids . Although the construction of such a massive inhabitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking , and the required material science behind it is early stage , there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants . 
 In theory , if enough statites were created and deployed around their star , they would compose a non @-@ rigid version of the Dyson shell mentioned below . Such a shell would not suffer from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure , nor are the mass requirements of such a shell as high as the rigid form . Such a shell would , however , have the same optical and thermal properties as the rigid form , and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion ( see below ) . 
 = = = Dyson shell = = = 
 The variant of the Dyson sphere most often depicted in fiction is the " Dyson shell " : a uniform solid shell of matter around the star . Such a structure would completely alter the emissions of the central star , and would intercept 100 % of the star 's energy output . Such a structure would also provide an immense surface that many envision would be used for habitation , if the surface could be made habitable . 
 A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a radius of one astronomical unit , so that the interior surface would receive the same amount of sunlight as Earth does per unit solid angle , would have a surface area of approximately 2 @.@ 8 × 1017 km2 ( 1 @.@ 1 × 1017 sq mi ) , or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth . This would intercept the full 384 @.@ 6 <unk> ( 3 @.@ 846 × 1026 watts ) of the Sun 's output . Non @-@ shell designs would intercept less , but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun 's evolution . This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998 , which was 12 terawatts . 
 There are several serious theoretical difficulties with the solid shell variant of the Dyson sphere : 
 Such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with its <unk> star ( see shell theorem ) , and could drift in relation to the central star . If such movements went uncorrected , they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star — most likely with disastrous results . Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift , or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star . 
 For the same reason , such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with anything else inside it . The contents of any biosphere placed on the inner surface of a Dyson shell would not be attracted to the sphere 's surface and would simply fall into the star . It has been proposed that a biosphere could be contained between two concentric spheres , placed on the interior of a rotating sphere ( in which case , the force of artificial " gravity " is perpendicular to the axis of rotation , causing all matter placed on the interior of the sphere to pool around the equator , effectively rendering the sphere a Niven ring for purposes of habitation , but still fully effective as a radiant @-@ energy collector ) or placed on the outside of the sphere where it would be held in place by the star 's gravity . In such cases , some form of illumination would have to be devised , or the sphere made at least partly transparent , because the star 's light would otherwise be completely hidden . 
 If assuming a radius of one AU , then the compressive strength of the material forming the sphere would have to be immense to prevent implosion due to the star 's gravity . Any arbitrarily selected point on the surface of the sphere can be viewed as being under the pressure of the base of a dome 1 AU in height under the Sun 's gravity at that distance . Indeed , it can be viewed as being at the base of an infinite number of arbitrarily selected domes , but because much of the force from any one arbitrary dome is counteracted by those of another , the net force on that point is immense , but finite . No known or theorized material is strong enough to withstand this pressure , and form a rigid , static sphere around a star . It has been proposed by Paul Birch ( in relation to smaller " Supra @-@ Jupiter " constructions around a large planet rather than a star ) that it may be possible to support a Dyson shell by dynamic means similar to those used in a space fountain . Masses travelling in circular tracks on the inside of the sphere , at velocities significantly greater than orbital velocity , would press outwards on magnetic bearings due to centrifugal force . For a Dyson shell of 1 @-@ AU radius around a star with the same mass as the Sun , a mass travelling ten times the orbital velocity ( 297 @.@ 9 km / s ) would support 99 ( a = v2 / r ) times its own mass in additional shell structure . 
 Also if assuming a radius of one AU , then there may not be sufficient building material in the Solar System to construct a Dyson shell . Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1 @.@ 82 × 1026 kg of easily usable building material in the Solar System , enough for a 1 @-@ AU shell with a mass of 600 kg / m2 — about 8 – 20 cm thick on average , depending on the density of the material . This includes the hard @-@ to @-@ access cores of the gas giants ; the inner planets alone provide only 11 @.@ 79 × 1024 kg , enough for a 1 @-@ AU shell with a mass of just 42 kg / m2 . 
 The shell would be vulnerable to impacts from interstellar bodies , such as comets , meteoroids , and material in interstellar space that is currently being deflected by the Sun 's bow shock . The heliosphere , and any protection it theoretically provides , would cease to exist .

 = = = = Dyson net = = = = 
 Another possibility is the " Dyson net " , a web of cables strung about the star that could have power or heat collection units strung between the cables . The Dyson net reduces to a special case of Dyson shell or bubble , however , depending on how the cables are supported against the sun 's gravity . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 A <unk> is an artificial construct that consists of a shell of living space around a sphere of hydrogen gas . The shell contains air , people , houses , furniture , etc . The idea was conceived to answer the question , " What is the largest space colony that can be built ? " However , most of the volume is not habitable and there is no power source . 
 Theoretically , any gas giant could be enclosed in a solid shell ; at a certain radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial , and energy could be provided by tapping the thermal energy of the planet . This concept is explored peripherally in the novel Accelerando ( and the short story Curator , which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter ) by Charles Stross , in which Saturn is converted into a human @-@ habitable world . 
 = = = = Stellar engine = = = = 
 Stellar engines are a class of hypothetical megastructures whose purpose is to extract useful energy from a star , sometimes for specific purposes . For example , <unk> brains extract energy for purposes of computation ; <unk> thrusters extract energy for purposes of propulsion . Some of the proposed stellar engine designs are based on the Dyson sphere . 
 A black hole could be the power source instead of a star in order to increase the energy @-@ to @-@ matter conversion efficiency . A black hole would also be smaller than a star . This would decrease communication distances that would be important for computer @-@ based societies as those described above . 
 = = Search for megastructures = = 
 In Dyson 's original paper , he speculated that sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow a similar power @-@ consumption pattern to that of humans , and would eventually build their own sphere of collectors . Constructing such a system would make such a civilization a Type II Kardashev civilization . 
 The existence of such a system of collectors would alter the light emitted from the star system . Collectors would absorb and <unk> energy from the star . The wavelength ( s ) of radiation emitted by the collectors would be determined by the emission spectra of the substances making them up , and the temperature of the collectors . Because it seems most likely that these collectors would be made up of heavy elements not normally found in the emission spectra of their central star – or at least not radiating light at such relatively " low " energies compared to what they would be emitting as energetic free nuclei in the stellar atmosphere – there would be atypical wavelengths of light for the star 's spectral type in the light spectrum emitted by the star system . If the percentage of the star 's output thus filtered or transformed by this absorption and <unk> was significant , it could be detected at interstellar distances . 
 Given the amount of energy available per square meter at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun , it is possible to calculate that most known substances would be <unk> energy in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum . Thus , a Dyson sphere , constructed by life forms not dissimilar to humans , who dwelled in proximity to a Sun @-@ like star , made with materials similar to those available to humans , would most likely cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system 's emitted spectrum . Hence , Dyson selected the title " Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation " for his published paper . 
 SETI has adopted these assumptions in their search , looking for such " infrared heavy " spectra from solar analogs . As of 2005 Fermilab has an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) . Identifying one of the many infrared sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources . Fermilab discovered 17 potential " ambiguous " candidates , of which four have been named " amusing but still questionable " . Other searches also resulted in several candidates , which are , however , unconfirmed . 
 On 14 October 2015 , the realization of a strange pattern of light from star KIC <unk> , observed by the Kepler Space Telescope , raised speculation that a Dyson sphere may have been discovered . 
 = = Fiction = = 
 As noted above , the Dyson sphere originated in fiction , and it is a concept that has appeared often in science fiction since then . In fictional accounts , Dyson spheres are most often depicted as a Dyson shell with the gravitational and engineering difficulties of this variant noted above largely ignored . 
 = Cookiecutter shark = 
 Cookiecutter shark ( Isistius brasiliensis ) , also called the cigar shark , is a species of small dogfish shark in the family <unk> . This shark occurs in warm , oceanic waters worldwide , particularly near islands , and has been recorded as deep as 3 @.@ 7 km ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ) . It migrates vertically up to 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) every day , approaching the surface at dusk and descending with the dawn . Reaching only 42 – 56 cm ( 16 @.@ 5 – 22 in ) in length , the cookiecutter shark has a long , cylindrical body with a short , blunt snout , large eyes , two tiny spineless dorsal fins , and a large caudal fin . It is dark brown , with light @-@ emitting photophores covering its underside except for a dark " collar " around its throat and gill slits . 
 The name " cookiecutter shark " refers to its feeding habit of gouging round plugs , as if cut out with a cookie cutter , out of larger animals . Marks made by cookiecutter sharks have been found on a wide variety of marine mammals and fishes , as well as on submarines , undersea cables , and even human bodies . It also consumes whole smaller prey such as squid . Cookiecutter sharks have adaptations for hovering in the water column and likely rely on stealth and subterfuge to capture more active prey . Its dark collar seems to mimic the silhouette of a small fish , while the rest of its body blends into the downwelling light via its ventral photophores . When a would @-@ be predator approaches the lure , the shark attaches itself using its suctorial lips and specialized pharynx and neatly excises a chunk of flesh using its <unk> @-@ like set of lower teeth . This species has been known to travel in schools . 
 Though rarely encountered because of its oceanic habitat , a handful of documented attacks on humans were apparently caused by cookiecutter sharks . Nevertheless , this diminutive shark is not regarded as highly dangerous . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the cookiecutter shark under Least Concern , as it is widely distributed , has no commercial value , and is not particularly susceptible to fisheries . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard originally described the cookiecutter shark during the 1817 – 1820 exploratory voyage of the corvette Uranie under Louis de Freycinet , giving it the name <unk> brasiliensis because the type specimen was caught off Brazil . In 1824 , their account was published as part of Voyage autour du monde ... sur les corvettes de S.M. l <unk> et la <unk> , Louis de Freycinet 's 13 volume report on the voyage . In 1865 , American ichthyologist Theodore Nicholas Gill coined the new genus Isistius for this species , after Isis , the Egyptian goddess of light . 
 One of the earliest accounts of the wounds left by the cookiecutter shark on various animals is in ancient Samoan legend , which held that <unk> ( skipjack tuna ) entering <unk> Bay would leave behind pieces of their flesh as a sacrifice to <unk> , the community chief . In later centuries , various other explanations for the wounds were advanced , including lampreys , bacteria , and invertebrate parasites . In 1971 , <unk> Jones of the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries ( a predecessor of the National Marine Fisheries Service ) discovered the cigar shark , as it was then generally known , was responsible . Shark expert Stewart Springer thus popularized the name " cookiecutter shark " for this species ( though he originally called them " demon whale @-@ biters " ) . Other common names used for this shark include luminous shark , smalltooth cookiecutter shark , and smooth cookiecutter shark . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cookiecutter shark has an elongated , cigar @-@ shaped body with a short , <unk> rounded snout . The nostrils have a very short flap of skin in front . The large , oval , green eyes are placed forward on the head , though not so that there is extensive binocular vision . Behind the eyes are large spiracles , positioned on the upper surface of the head . The mouth is short , forming a nearly transverse line , and is surrounded by enlarged , fleshy , suctorial lips . There are 30 – 37 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 25 – 31 tooth rows in the lower jaw , increasing with body size . The upper and lower teeth are extremely different : the upper teeth are small , narrow , and upright , tapering to a single , smooth @-@ edged cusp . The lower teeth are also smooth @-@ edged , but much larger , broader , and knife @-@ like , with their bases interlocking to form a single saw @-@ like cutting edge . The five pairs of gill slits are small . 
 The pectoral fins are short and roughly trapezoidal in shape . Two spineless dorsal fins are placed far back on the body , the first originating just ahead of the pelvic fins and the second located just behind . The second dorsal fin is slightly larger than the first , and the pelvic fins are larger than either . The anal fin is absent . The caudal fin is broad , with the lower lobe almost as large as the upper , which has a prominent ventral notch . The dermal denticles are squarish and flattened , with a slight central concavity and raised corners . The cookiecutter shark is chocolate brown in color , becoming subtly lighter below , and there is a dark " collar " that wraps around the gill region . The fins have translucent margins , except for the caudal fin , which has a darker margin . Complex , light @-@ producing organs called photophores densely cover the entire underside , except for the collar , and produce a vivid green glow . The maximum recorded length for this species is 42 cm ( 17 in ) for males and 56 cm ( 22 in ) for females . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Inhabiting all of the world 's major tropical and warm @-@ temperate oceanic basins , the cookiecutter shark is most common between the latitudes of 20 ° N and 20 ° S , where the surface water temperature is 18 – 26 ° C ( 64 – 79 ° F ) . In the Atlantic , it has been reported off the Bahamas and southern Brazil in the west , Cape Verde , Guinea to Sierra Leone , southern Angola , and South Africa in the east , and Ascension Island in the south . In the Indo @-@ Pacific region , it has been caught from Mauritius to New Guinea , Australia , and New Zealand , including Tasmania and Lord Howe Island , as well as off Japan . In the central and eastern Pacific , it occurs from Fiji north to the Hawaiian Islands , and east to the Galápagos , Easter , and Guadalupe Islands . Fresh wounds observed on marine mammals suggest this shark may range as far as California in warm years . 
 Based on catch records , the cookiecutter shark appears to conduct a diel vertical migration of up to 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) each way . It spends the day at a depth of 1 – 3 @.@ 7 km ( 0 @.@ 62 – 2 @.@ 30 mi ) , and at night it rises into the upper water column , usually remaining below 85 m ( 279 ft ) , but on rare occasions venturing to the surface . This species may be more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels than sharks in the related genera <unk> and <unk> . It is frequently found near islands , perhaps for reproductive purposes or because they hold congregations of large prey animals . In the northeastern Atlantic , most adults are found between 11 ° N and 16 ° N , with the smallest and largest individuals being found in lower and higher latitudes , respectively . There is no evidence of gender segregation . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Best known for biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish , the cookiecutter shark is considered a facultative ectoparasite , as it also wholly ingests smaller prey . It has a wide gape and a very strong bite , by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages . With small fins and weak muscles , this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column . To maintain neutral buoyancy , its liver , which can comprise some 35 % of its weight , is rich in low @-@ density lipids . As this species has higher skeletal density than <unk> or <unk> , its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger , and the oil content is much higher . Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger , faster prey that come in range . 
 The cookiecutter shark regularly replaces its teeth like other sharks , but sheds its lower teeth in entire rows rather than one at a time . A cookiecutter shark 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long has been calculated to have shed 15 sets of lower teeth by the time it is 50 cm ( 20 in ) long , totaling 435 – 465 teeth . This represents a significant investment of resources and is probably why the shark swallows its old sets of teeth , so that it can recycle the calcium content . Unlike other sharks , the retina of the cookiecutter shark has ganglion cells concentrated in a concentric area rather than in a horizontal streak across the visual field ; this may help to focus on prey in front of the shark . This fat shark has been known to travel in schools , which may increase the effectiveness of its lure ( see below ) , as well as discourage counterattacks by much larger predators . 
 = = = Bioluminescence = = = 
 The intrinsic green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is the strongest known of any shark , and has been reported to persist for three hours after it has been taken out of water . The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the downwelling light , a strategy known as counter @-@ illumination , that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone . The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye , suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high visual acuity and / or at close distances . 
 Set apart from the glowing underside , the darker , <unk> collar tapers at both sides of the throat , and has been hypothesized to serve as a lure by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below . The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks . If the collar does function in this way , the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey , while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would @-@ be predators . As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities , its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Virtually every type of medium to large @-@ sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack : bite scars have been found on cetaceans ( including porpoises , dolphins , beaked whales , sperm whales , and baleen whales ) , pinnipeds ( including fur seals , leopard seals , and elephant seals ) , dugongs , sharks ( including blue sharks , goblin sharks , basking sharks , great white sharks , megamouth sharks and smalltooth sand tiger sharks ) , stingrays ( including deepwater stingrays , pelagic stingrays and sixgill stingrays ) , and bony fishes ( including billfishes , tunas , <unk> , jacks , escolars , <unk> , and <unk> ) . The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of 15 – 30 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 – 11 @.@ 8 in ) , comparable in size to the shark itself , as well as bristlemouths , copepods , and other prey of more modest dimensions . 
 Parasitic attacks by the cookiecutter shark leave a round " crater wound " , averaging 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) across and 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) deep . The prevalence of these attacks can be high ; off Hawaii , nearly every adult spinner dolphin bears scars from this species . Diseased or otherwise weakened animals appear to be more susceptible ; in the western Atlantic , there are records of emaciated beached melon @-@ headed whales with dozens to hundreds of recent and healing cookiecutter shark wounds , while such wounds are rare on <unk> beached whales . The impact of parasitism on prey species , in terms of resources diverted from growth or reproduction , is uncertain . 
 The cookiecutter shark exhibits a number of specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle . The shark first secures itself to the body surface of its prey by closing its spiracles and retracting its <unk> ( tongue ) to create pressure lower than that of the surroundings ; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal . It then bites , using its narrow upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp lower teeth slices into the prey . Finally , the shark twists and rotates its body to complete a circular cut , quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of its prey . The action of the lower teeth may also be assisted by back @-@ and @-@ forth vibrations of the jaw , a mechanism akin to that of an electric carving knife . This shark 's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also of utility in capturing smaller prey such as squid . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Like other dogfish sharks , the cookiecutter shark is aplacental viviparous , with the developing embryos being sustained by yolk until birth . Females have two functional uteruses and give birth to litters of 6 to 12 pups . There is a record of a female carrying 9 embryos 12 @.@ 4 – 13 @.@ 7 cm ( 4 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 4 in ) long ; though they were close to the birth size , they still had well @-@ developed yolk sacs , suggesting a slow rate of yolk absorption and a long gestation period . The embryos had developed brown pigmentation , but not the dark collar or differentiated dentition . Newborn cookiecutter sharks measure 14 – 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long . Males attain sexual maturity at a length of 36 cm ( 14 in ) , and females at a length of 39 cm ( 15 in ) . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Favoring offshore waters and thus seldom encountered by humans , the cookiecutter shark is not considered very dangerous because of its small size . However , it has been implicated in a few attacks ; in one notable case , a school of fierce , 30 cm ( 12 in ) long fish with blunt snouts attacked an underwater photographer on an open ocean dive . Similar reports have come from shipwreck survivors , of suffering small , clean , deep bites during night time . In March 2009 , Maui resident Mike Spalding was bitten by a cookiecutter shark while swimming across <unk> Channel . There are at least two records of bodies recovered from the water with post @-@ mortem cookiecutter shark bites . 
 During the 1970s , several U.S. Navy submarines were forced back to base to repair damage caused by cookiecutter shark bites to the neoprene boots of their AN / BQR @-@ 19 sonar domes , which caused the sound @-@ transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation . An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared , before this shark was identified as the culprit , and the problem was solved by installing fiberglass covers around the domes . In the 1980s , some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites , mostly to the rubber @-@ sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones . Again , the solution was to apply a fiberglass coating . Oceanographic equipment and telecommunications cables have also been damaged by this species . 
 The harm inflicted by cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and economically important species may have a minor negative effect on commercial fisheries . The shark itself is too small to be of value , and is only infrequently taken , as bycatch , on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets . The lack of significant population threats , coupled with a worldwide distribution , has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern . 
 = So ( album ) = 
 So is the fifth studio album by English rock musician Peter Gabriel , released on 19 May 1986 by Charisma Records . After working on the soundtrack to the film Birdy ( 1984 ) , producer Daniel Lanois was invited to remain at Gabriel 's home during 1985 to work on his next singing project . Initial sessions for So consisted of Gabriel , Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes , although these grew to include a number of percussionists . 
 Although Gabriel continued to use the pioneering Fairlight CMI synthesizer , songs from these sessions were notably less experimental than his previous material , and fused pop and art rock with elements of traditional world music , particularly African and Brazilian styles . It is Gabriel 's first non @-@ eponymous album , So representing an " anti @-@ title " that resulted from label pressure to properly market his music . Widely regarded as his best album , as well as his most accessible , it transformed Gabriel from a cult artist into a mainstream star . It received positive reviews from critics , who praised its melodicism and fusion of genres , and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year . Gabriel toured So on the This Way Up tour ( 1986 – 1987 ) , with some songs performed at human rights and charity concerts during this period . 
 So is Gabriel 's best @-@ selling solo release , and has been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry . It spawned five singles , " Sledgehammer " , " Don 't Give Up " , " Big Time " , " In Your Eyes " and " Red Rain " . " Sledgehammer " achieved particular success , reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning a record of ten MTV Video Music Awards . So was remastered in 2002 , partially re @-@ recorded for Gabriel 's 2012 orchestral project New Blood and issued as a box set the same year . It has been deemed one of the best albums of the 1980s and is listed at number 187 in Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .

 Prior to recording So , Gabriel released four studio albums all titled Peter Gabriel . They received nicknames based on their sleeve art , which were designed by English duo Hipgnosis . His debut , Car ( 1977 ) , received positive reviews , mainly because of the hugely popular " Solsbury Hill " , which concerned the site of the same name near Ashcombe House , Gabriel 's estate to the north @-@ east of Bath in Somerset . His second album — Scratch ( 1978 ) — fared less well and it was not until Melt ( 1980 ) that Gabriel was considered a progressive solo artist . Melt included the emotive anti @-@ apartheid song " Biko " and the popular " Games Without Frontiers " , with Gabriel helping to " blueprint the sound of 80s rock through its trailblazing use of what became known as the " gated reverb " drum effect . " In the early 1980s , Gabriel embarked on various projects , including founding the World Music , Arts and Dance Festival ( WOMAD ) , with a WOMAD album featuring himself , Robert Fripp , Pete Townshend and other artists of the world music genre . His fourth album , Security ( 1982 ) — also released in German as the Deutsches Album ( 1982 ) — saw success with Gabriel 's music video for the eye @-@ opening " Shock the Monkey " . Gabriel won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for scoring the soundtrack to the film Birdy ( 1984 ) . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Since 1978 , Gabriel had composed all of his music at Ashcombe House , including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or " Security " ( 1982 ) and the Birdy ( 1984 ) soundtrack . An inexpensive studio existed in the house 's adjacent barn , consisting of two rooms , one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics , and another where the music would be assembled . When preparing for So , Gabriel considered Chic 's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers . He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator , Daniel Lanois , to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further . Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel , Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes . Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures , around which they built their own improvised compositions . Lanois recalled they had " a nice starting point [ as ] in that kind of scenario , it 's not a good idea to have a lot of people around because you get nervous that you 're wasting other people 's time " . Consequently , there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges , an American vaudeville act of the mid @-@ twentieth century . This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a " turning up for work humour " . As sessions grew , engineer Kevin Killen , bassist Tony Levin , and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors , and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar . 
 The studio 's basic equipment consisted of " two analog 24 @-@ track machines , a Studer A80 , and a Studer A80 shell that had been modified by a local electronics wizard , with its own audio cards and transport controls " . To record vocals a Neumann U47 tube microphone and a Decca compressor were used without equalization . All of So 's songs were made in a similar format . Gabriel would record a piano demo on a modified " B machine " and play this to the band . During rehearsals , the band would listen to the B machine through headphones and record their output onto the " A machine " ; parts of Gabriel 's demo would also be transferred to the A machine at this stage . Subsequent takes of the song were then put onto the B machine in order for the band to hear what they had played with the demo , as well as the song 's new and old takes . 
 Other equipment included the " groundbreaking " Fairlight CMI synthesizer , which Gabriel said in an interview for Billboard meant " more human imagination is involved " . He added , " the creative decision @-@ making process has become more important than technique . You have a wider range of tools , a wider range of decisions " . Although remaining continually inspired to produce new music , he often struggled to write lyrics and would delay doing so by procrastinating . His proclivity to being dissatisfied with them required Killen to isolate certain vocal performances as the master track , in order to keep other tracks available so new lyrics could be edited in . Lanois took adverse measures to encourage his writing , such as destroying his much @-@ used telephone in the nearby woods and , on one occasion , nailed the studio door shut to lock him inside . 
 Towards the end of recording , Gabriel became " obsessed " with the album 's track listing and created an audio cassette of all the song 's beginnings and ends in order to hear how the sounds blended together . His original intention was to have " In Your Eyes " at the end of the record , but because of its prominent bass line , it had to be placed earlier in the listing on the vinyl edition as there is more room for the stylus to vibrate . With later CD releases , this restriction was removed and the track was placed at the end of the album . So was completed in February 1986 and cost £ 200 @,@ 000 to make . It was over @-@ dubbed at Power Station Studios in New York , despite Gabriel considering sending it via a computer @-@ telephone set up , reasoning , " that 's a lot of information to send via phone . Isn 't it amazing though ? You can send a song idea around the world to musicians then beam parts back by satellite " . It was mastered by Ian Cooper in mid @-@ February 1986 at London 's Townhouse Studios . 
 = = Composition = = 
 So has been described as Gabriel 's most commercially accessible and least experimental album . Like his previous albums , its basis is in art rock , although on So , Gabriel develops an increased focus on melody and now combines this genre with elements of soul and African music . Its songs are highly influenced by traditional world music , particularly African and Brazilian music , with Gabriel using the distinctive drum beat from these styles . In a 2011 interview for Uncut , Gabriel said , " I 'd had my fill of instrumental experimenting for a while , and I wanted to write proper pop songs , albeit on my own terms . " Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes that Gabriel " doesn 't just add on African drums or Indian violin to ordinary songs ; they are part of the foundation . " Daniel Lanois production was noted as textured , replete with ambient details and " immaculate warmth giving each note room to breathe , its textures lavish ( in the preferred style of the time ) without being sterile " . 
 = = = Side one = = = 
 Gabriel wanted the album to " crash open at the front " and despite disliking " metal " percussion instruments , he was persuaded by Lanois to allow The Police 's Stewart Copeland to play cymbals and hi @-@ hat on its opener , " Red Rain " . The track sees Gabriel sing in his upper register with a throaty , gravely texture , of a destructive world with social problems such as torture and kidnapping . Its concept originated from a dream in which he envisaged the parting of a vast , red sea and human @-@ like glass bottles filling up with blood . It was also intended to continue the story of <unk> , a recurring character in Gabriel 's first and second albums . The second track , " Sledgehammer " , was the final track to be conceived of . Although most of Gabriel 's band had packed away their equipment and were ready to leave the studio , Gabriel asked them to reassemble to quickly run through a song he had an idea for . " Sledgehammer " was partially inspired by the music of Otis Redding , and Gabriel sought out Wayne Jackson , who Gabriel had seen on tour with Redding in the 1960s , to record horns for the track . Opened by a shakuhachi bamboo flute , its beat is dominated by brass instruments , particularly Jackson 's horn , and features lyrics abundant with sexual euphemisms . Manu Katché 's drums were recorded in one take as he believed any subsequent version would be inferior to his original interpretation of the music . 
 So 's most prominent political statement , " Don 't Give Up " , was fuelled by Gabriel 's discontent with rising unemployment during Margaret Thatcher 's premiership and Dorothea Lange 's photograph " Migrant Mother " . The track began as a rhythm pattern of slow , low @-@ pitched tom @-@ tom drums that Gabriel made , and Lanois believed could serve as the centrepiece of a song . Tony Levin added bass to create a more harmonious sound , and during the second @-@ half of the track , put a <unk> behind his bass strings to dampen the sound . Gabriel ensured the song , which follows a narrative of an unemployed man and his lover , was written as a conversational piece . He initially sought out Dolly Parton to portray the woman , although Parton declined ; his friend Kate Bush later agreed to feature . Bush serves as the song 's respondent , she assumes a comforting role and with delicate vocals , sings lines such as " Rest your head / you worry too much " . The album 's first side culminates with " That Voice Again " , in which Gabriel explores the concept of conscience , examining the " parental voice in our heads that either helps or defeats us " . Co @-@ written with David Rhodes , who plays guitar over Katché and Levin 's input , the song was written after Gabriel 's initial discussions with Martin Scorsese about scoring The Last Temptation of Christ ( 1988 ) . 
 = = = Side two = = = 
 " In Your Eyes " has been described as Gabriel 's greatest love song . Inspired by the Sagrada Família and its architect Antoni Gaudí , Gabriel sings over a drumbeat of only feeling complete in the eyes of his lover . The track 's powerful atmosphere is created through the scat singing of Senegalese musician Youssou N 'Dour , who sings in his native language . Gabriel became interested in the late American poet Anne Sexton after reading the anthology To Bedlam And Part Way Back . He dedicated So 's sixth track to her , calling it " Mercy Street " after " 45 Mercy Street " , a poem released in another posthumous collection . " Mercy Street " is set to one of several <unk> @-@ inspired percussion compositions that Gabriel recorded in Rio de Janeiro . When these compositions were unearthed in the studio , they were accidentally played back at a speed ten per cent slower than the original recording , giving them a grainy quality that Gabriel and Lanois thought highlighted the cymbal and guitars . It features two harmonious Gabriel vocals , one of which is a shadow vocal which is an octave below the main vocal , intended to give a sensual , haunting effect , although this was hard to capture except when Gabriel had first woken up . 
 The dance song " Big Time " has funk influences and is built on a " percussive bass sound " . Its lyrics satirise the yuppie culture of the 1980s , materialism and consumerism and are the result of Gabriel 's self @-@ examination , after he considered whether he may have desired fame after all . " We Do What We 're Told ( Milgram 's 37 ) " was a song written for Gabriel 's third album Peter Gabriel or " Melt " and is described as an interlude . It references the experiment on obedience carried out by American social psychologist Stanley Milgram , intended as a reference to the obedience citizens show to dictators during times of war . Marotta 's drums on the song were said to resemble " a heartbeat heard from the womb " , these were coupled with Shankar 's violin and " two overdubbed guitar tracks by Rhodes " . The album is completed by " This Is The Picture ( Excellent Birds ) " , which Gabriel decided forty @-@ eight hours before his album submission , was going to be included . " Excellent Birds " was composed with American musician Laurie Anderson and featured on her 1984 album Mister Heartbreak . This was interpolated into another recording called " This Is The Picture " , which Nile Rodgers plays rhythmic guitar on . 
 = = Release = = 
 So is Gabriel 's first non @-@ eponymous album . Gabriel has noted his dislike for titling albums , mainly because it distracts from the sleeve design . In an interview for Rolling Stone , he explained that his American label Geffen Records refused to release Peter Gabriel IV until it was retitled Security . He elaborated that for So " [ he ] decided to go for the anti @-@ title ... It can be more a piece of graphic , if you like , as opposed to something with meaning and intention . And that 's what I 've done ever since " . When the album was profiled in the Classic Albums documentary series , Gabriel quipped that its short title meant it could be enlarged and useful when marketing it . The sleeve design is a portrait of Gabriel photographed by Trevor Key , who was then most famous for capturing the bell artwork for Mike Oldfield 's Tubular Bells ( 1973 ) . It was then designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens ; Saville was most known for designing several sleeves for Factory Records artists . Saville was paid £ 20 @,@ 000 for his design . Gabriel has since commented : " the only compromise I made was to go with Peter Saville 's idea for a retro @-@ style portrait . I was told my usual obscure LP sleeves alienated women . " 
 So was released on 19 May 1986 . It topped the charts of seven countries worldwide , including the United Kingdom , where it became Gabriel 's second number one album . In the United States , So became one of Geffen Records ' most commercially successful releases , peaking at number two and remaining on the chart for ninety @-@ three weeks . In April 1986 , " Sledgehammer " was released as the album 's lead single and became Gabriel 's first and only number one on the Billboard Hot 100 , displacing Genesis ' first and only US number one " Invisible Touch " . The track reached number four in the United Kingdom , where it ties with " Games Without Frontiers " as his highest charting single , and peaked at number one in Canada . The success of " Sledgehammer " can be seen , in part , due to its hugely popular and innovative stop motion music video , designed by Aardman Animations . Gabriel would go on to say in an interview for Rolling Stone that he believed the video exposed So 's songs to a wider audience , bolstering the album 's success . Two high @-@ charting singles followed , " Don 't Give Up " , which rose to number nine on the UK Singles Chart and a less successful seventy @-@ nine in America , while " Big Time " peaked at number thirteen in the UK and number eight in America . " In Your Eyes " saw moderate success in America , where it reached twenty @-@ six on the Hot 100 , while " Red Rain " peaked at forty @-@ six in the United Kingdom . 
 Bono contacted Gabriel to perform at A Conspiracy of Hope , a series of Live Aid @-@ inspired concerts that intended to spread awareness of human rights issues in light of Amnesty International 's twenty @-@ fifth anniversary . Gabriel accepted and in June 1986 , he performed alongside Sting , The Police , Lou Reed and Joan Baez , with a set that opened with " Red Rain " and featured " Sledgehammer " . Gabriel described it as " the best tour [ he 'd ] ever been on " . In the same month , Gabriel performed at London 's Clapham Common , along with Boy George and Elvis Costello , for Artists Against Apartheid . Gabriel eventually embarked on the ninety @-@ three date This Way Up tour to support So , beginning in Rochester , New York on 7 November 1986 . One of the dates was a special two @-@ night residency ( 20 – 21 December ) at Tokyo 's Meiji <unk> Stadium to fund a global computer system for the University for Peace , a United Nations project . The tour suspended in early 1987 until June when it reached Europe , before going on to America and finishing at the <unk> Amphitheatre in Athens in October . Gabriel partially performed So at The Prince 's Trust Concert and at Human Rights Now ! Tour in 1988 .

 So received mostly favourable reviews from music critics . Robert Christgau commented " Gabriel 's so smart he knows rhythm is what makes music go , which relieves him of humdrum melodic responsibilities but doesn 't get him up on the one — smart guys do go for texture in a pinch . " Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote " only a handful of Western rock musicians have managed to use exotic rhythms and instruments with so much ingenuity and conviction " . Pareles also praised his vocals , describing them as " grainy but not bluesy , ageless and joyless , the voice of some ancient mariner recounting disasters " . Tim Holmes writing for Rolling Stone described the album as " a record of considerable emotional complexity and musical sophistication " and was pleased that the records would assist exposing Gabriel to mainstream pop music . Terry Atkinson of Los Angeles Times viewed the album as offering " an amazing variety of tones , moods , and topics and a consistently powerful level of expression " . Although disliking " Big Time " , Atkinson concludes So is " a great album , possibly Gabriel 's best " . Chicago Tribune 's Lynn Van <unk> praised the album 's " wave of funky rhythms " and called for more appreciation of Gabriel 's talent , but noted that there were no tracks as stand out as " Biko " , a single from his third eponymous album Peter Gabriel or " Melt " . 
 Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commended So as Gabriel 's " catchiest , happiest record he ever cut " . Erlewine particularly praised Gabriel 's fusion of art rock with African music and soul . Jude Rogers of the BBC wrote " once you look past the bombast of " Sledgehammer " , ... you notice how easily its artful ideas slipped inside the 80s mainstream " . The Quietus ' Wyndham Wallace praised So 's sincerity and called it " a heartfelt journey through intense emotional territory , assembled and arranged with intricacy and commitment , laboured over with such care that it sounds effortless " . Ryan Bray , writer for Consequence of Sound , concluded So was an " all @-@ too @-@ rare record that manages to have it both ways , earning its richly deserved critical and commercial respect without giving so much as an artistic inch " . He added that " it still stands on its own two feet as one of the consensus best records of the 80s " . Mark Blake of Q described the album as " carbon @-@ dated to 1986 thanks to those blaring saxes and Fairlight CMI digital sampling synths " . He added that " Gabriel crafted an album of user @-@ friendly pop that was still reassuringly odd . " Mojo 's David Buckley contrasted the album with Gabriel 's earlier , more experimental work , claiming " on 1986 's So , he switched tack to write pop , and write big . The results are mixed . Sledgehammer , echoing both Stevie Wonders 's " Superstition " and David Bowie 's " Fame " , retains its punch . Elsewhere , Gabriel sounds airbrushed on Mercy Street , Red Rain and In Your Eyes , with only We Do What We 're Told a reminder of a daring past . " Writing in Uncut , John Lewis praised its state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art production in parts , highlighting " Big Time " and " Sledgehammer " as standout tracks , but claimed elsewhere it interfered , such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer on " That Voice Again " and whistling ambient accompaniment on " Mercy Street " . Terry Staunton of Classic Rock wrote " Red Rain was familiarly pensive and politically charged , but the radio waves completely surrendered to the record 's muscular dance rock and slower tempo eloquence . " Staunton concluded that Gabriel had displayed " a masterful confidence , delivering a satisfyingly unified whole " .

 At the 29th Annual Grammy Awards , So was nominated for Album of the Year , losing to Paul Simon 's Graceland ( 1986 ) , while " Sledgehammer " received nominations for Record of the Year , Song of the Year and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance . At the sixth Brit Awards , hosted by Jonathan King at the Grosvenor House Hotel , London , Gabriel won Best British Male Artist and " Sledgehammer " won Best British Music Video . Gabriel was most successful at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards where he was honoured with the Video Vanguard Award and " Sledgehammer " won an additional nine awards including Video of the Year , a record that has not been challenged . Its video is the most played music video in the history of MTV . 
 So is often regarded as Gabriel 's best album , as well as one of the best albums of the 1980s . It enabled Gabriel to transform from a cult artist , acclaimed for his cerebral , experimental solo work in the 1970s , into a mainstream , internationally @-@ known star . Rolling Stone placed So at 187 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and at 14 on its 100 Best Albums of the 1980s , noting that " despite its mass appeal , however , So also presented compelling challenges . " Stereogum placed it at number one on its list of Gabriel 's best albums , writing , " Peter Gabriel 's fifth studio album is a mesmerizing dichotomy : simultaneously hooky and experimental ; timeless , yet completely <unk> its moment in history ... It 's a masterpiece . It has been profiled in the Classic Albums series and featured in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die . Slant Magazine listed the album at 41 on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1980s , describing it as " Gabriel 's most accessible yet ambitious work . A chronicle of political , emotional , and artistic exploration , the album [ attempts ] to balance standard pop orthodoxy with his still @-@ rumbling desire for sonic experimentation " . Conversely , The Guardian 's lead critic Alexis Petridis claimed Gabriel " suffered a musical mid @-@ life crisis " , describing it as " an album packed with ultra @-@ commercial <unk> cod @-@ funk " and " a ruthless bid for mainstream success " . 
 It is Gabriel 's best @-@ selling album , having been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) . [ 1 ] In 2002 , So was re @-@ issued and remastered . In 2011 , several of tracks from So were featured on Gabriel 's ninth studio release New Blood , a project of orchestral re @-@ recordings from Gabriel 's discography . In 2012 , for the album 's twenty @-@ fifth anniversary , a limited edition box set was released . It includes the remastered So album , the Live at Athens ( 1987 ) album and a So DNA album which examines its production , as well as new liner notes , photographs , vinyl collectibles and the So : Classic Albums documentary . In the same year , Gabriel embarked on the Back to Front Tour where Gabriel plays every song on the So album with several of the session musicians from its recording .

 = Eurasian sparrowhawk = 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk ( Accipiter nisus ) , also known as the northern sparrowhawk or simply the sparrowhawk , is a small bird of prey in the family Accipitridae . Adult male Eurasian sparrowhawks have bluish grey upperparts and orange @-@ barred underparts ; females and juveniles are brown above with brown barring below . The female is up to 25 % larger than the male – one of the largest differences between the sexes in any bird species . Though it is a predator which specialises in catching woodland birds , the Eurasian sparrowhawk can be found in any habitat and often hunts garden birds in towns and cities . Males tend to take smaller birds , including tits , finches , and sparrows ; females catch primarily thrushes and starlings , but are capable of killing birds weighing 500 g ( 18 oz ) or more . 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk is found throughout the temperate and subtropical parts of the Old World ; while birds from the northern parts of the range migrate south for winter , their southern counterparts remain resident or make dispersive movements . Eurasian sparrowhawks breed in suitable woodland of any type , with the nest , measuring up to 60 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) across , built using twigs in a tree . Four or five pale blue , brown @-@ spotted eggs are laid ; the success of the breeding attempt is dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male brings her food . The chicks hatch after 33 days and fledge after 24 to 28 days . 
 The probability of a juvenile surviving its first year is 34 % , with 69 % of adults surviving from one year to the next . Mortality in young males is greater than that of young females and the typical lifespan is four years . This species is now one of the most common birds of prey in Europe , although the population crashed after the Second World War . <unk> insecticides used to treat seeds before sowing built up in the bird population and the concentrations in Eurasian sparrowhawks were enough to kill some outright and incapacitate others ; affected birds laid eggs with fragile shells which broke during incubation . However , its population recovered after the chemicals were banned , and it is now relatively common , classified as being of Least Concern by BirdLife International . 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk 's hunting behaviour has brought it into conflict with humans for hundreds of years , particularly racing pigeon owners and people rearing poultry and gamebirds . It has also been blamed for decreases in passerine populations . The increase in population of the Eurasian Sparrowhawk coincides with the decline in House Sparrows in Britain . Studies of racing pigeon deaths found that Eurasian sparrowhawks were responsible for less than 1 % . Falconers have utilised the Eurasian sparrowhawk since at least the 16th century ; although the species has a reputation for being difficult to train , it is also praised for its courage . The species features in Teutonic mythology and is mentioned in works by writers including William Shakespeare , Alfred , Lord Tennyson and Ted Hughes . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Within the family Accipitridae , the Eurasian sparrowhawk is a member of the large genus Accipiter , which consists of small to medium @-@ sized woodland hawks . Most of the Old World members of the genus are called sparrowhawks or goshawks . The species ' name dates back to the Middle English word <unk> and Old English <unk> , a hawk which hunts sparrows . The Old Norse name for the Eurasian sparrowhawk , <unk> , was thought to have been coined by Vikings who encountered falconry in England . English folk names for the Eurasian sparrowhawk include blue hawk , referring to the adult male 's colouration , as well as hedge hawk , spar hawk , spur hawk and stone falcon . 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk was described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work , Systema Naturae , as Falco nisus , but moved to its present genus by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 . The current scientific name is derived from the Latin accipiter , meaning ' hawk ' and nisus , the sparrowhawk . According to Greek mythology , Nisus , the king of Megara , was turned into a sparrowhawk after his daughter , Scylla , cut off his purple lock of hair to present to her lover ( and Nisus ' enemy ) , Minos . 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk forms a superspecies with the rufous @-@ chested sparrowhawk of eastern and southern Africa , and possibly the Madagascan sparrowhawk . Geographic variation is clinal , with birds becoming larger and paler in the eastern part of the range compared to the west . Within the species itself , six subspecies are generally recognised : 
 A. n. nisus , the nominate subspecies , was described by Linnaeus in 1758 . It breeds from Europe and west Asia to western Siberia and Iran ; northern populations winter south to the Mediterranean , north @-@ east Africa , Arabia and Pakistan . 
 A. n. <unk> was described by Samuel Tickell in 1833 . It breeds from central and eastern Siberia east to Kamchatka and Japan , and south to northern China . This subspecies is wholly migratory , wintering from Pakistan and India eastwards through South @-@ East Asia and southern China to Korea and Japan ; some even reach Africa . It is very similar to , but slightly larger than , the nominate subspecies . 
 A. n. melaschistos was described by Allan Octavian Hume in 1869 . It breeds in mountains from Afghanistan through the Himalayas and southern Tibet to western China , and winters in the plains of South Asia . Larger and longer tailed than <unk> , it has dark slate @-@ coloured upperparts , and more distinct rufous barring on the underparts . 
 A. n. <unk> , described by Otto Kleinschmidt in 1900 , is resident in Sardinia and Corsica . It is the smallest of all the races , darker on the upperparts and more barred below than the nominate subspecies . 
 A. n. granti , described by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1890 , is confined to Madeira and the Canary Islands . It is small and dark . 
 A. n. <unk> , described by Erlanger in 1897 , is resident in north @-@ west Africa , north of the Sahara . It is very similar to nisus , being large and pale . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey with short , broad wings and a long tail , both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees . Females can be up to 25 % larger than males and weigh up to twice as much . Marked size difference in this direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey , and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds . 
 The adult male is 29 – 34 cm ( 11 – 13 in ) long , with a wingspan of 59 – 64 cm ( 23 – 25 in ) and a mass of 110 – 196 g ( 3 @.@ 9 – 6 @.@ 9 oz ) . He has slate @-@ grey upperparts ( sometimes tending to bluish ) , with finely red @-@ barred underparts , which can look plain orange from a distance ; his irides are orange @-@ yellow or orange @-@ red . The female is much larger at 35 – 41 cm ( 14 – 16 in ) long , with a wingspan of 67 – 80 cm ( 26 – 31 in ) , and a mass of 185 – 342 g ( 6 @.@ 5 – 12 @.@ 1 oz ) . She has dark brown or greyish @-@ brown upperparts , and brown @-@ barred underparts , and bright yellow to orange irides . The juvenile is warm brown above , with rusty fringes to the upperparts ; and coarsely barred or spotted brown below , with pale yellow eyes ; its throat has dark streaks and lacks a mesial ( midline ) stripe . 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk 's pale underparts and darker upperparts are an example of countershading , which helps to break up the bird 's outline . Countershading is exhibited by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast @-@ moving animals . The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks is typical of woodland @-@ dwelling predatory birds , while the adult male 's bluish colour is also seen in other bird @-@ eating raptors , including the peregrine falcon , the merlin and other Accipiters . 
 A study , using stuffed bird models , found that small birds are less likely to approach common cuckoos ( a brood parasite ) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk . Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk @-@ like , meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts . 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk 's small bill is used for plucking feathers and pulling prey apart , rather than killing or cutting . Its long legs and toes are an adaptation for catching and eating birds . The outer toe is " fairly long and slender " ; the inner toe and back toe are relatively short and thick . The middle toe is very long and can be used to grasp objects , while a protuberance on the underside of the toe means that the digit can be closed without leaving a gap , which helps with gripping . 
 The flight is a characteristic " flap @-@ flap @-@ glide " , with the glide creating an undulating pattern . This species is similar in size to the Levant sparrowhawk , but larger than the <unk> ( the calls are however different ) ; the male is only slightly larger than the merlin . Because of the overlap in sizes , the female can be confused with the similarly @-@ sized male northern goshawk , but lacks the bulk of that species . Eurasian sparrowhawks are smaller , more slender and have shorter wings , a square @-@ ended tail and fly with faster wingbeats . A confusion species in China is the <unk> , although A. n. melaschistos is considerably larger . 
 In Great Britain , Eurasian sparrowhawks living further north are bigger than their more southerly counterparts , with wing length ( the most reliable indicator of body size ) increasing by an average of 0 @.@ 86 mm ( 0 @.@ 034 in ) in males , and 0 @.@ 75 mm ( 0 @.@ 030 in ) in females , for each degree further north . 
 = = Lifespan and demography = = 
 The oldest known wild Eurasian sparrowhawk lived more than two decades ; it was found dead in Denmark 20 years and 3 months after having been ringed . The typical lifespan is four years . Data analysis by the British Trust for Ornithology shows that the proportion of juveniles surviving their first year of life is 34 % ; adult survival from one year to the next is 69 % . Birds in their first year of life weigh less than adults , and are especially light in the first two months after reaching independence . There is probably high mortality , especially for young males , during this time . A study in southern Scotland suggested that the greater mortality in young male birds may be due to their smaller size and the smaller size of their prey , which means that they can " last less long between meals . " Their size also means that their range of prey is restricted . It has been estimated that a female Eurasian sparrowhawk of average weight could survive for seven days without feeding – three days longer than a male of average weight . 
 A study of female Eurasian sparrowhawks found " strong evidence " that their rate of survival increased for the first three years of life , and declined for the last five to six years . Senescence ( ageing ) was the cause of the decline as the birds became older . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 A widespread species throughout the temperate and subtropical parts of the Old World , the Eurasian sparrowhawk is resident or breeds in an estimated global range of 23 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 km2 ( 9 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 sq mi ) and had an estimated population of 1 @.@ 5 million birds in 2009 . Although global population trends have not been analysed , numbers seem to be stable , so it has been classified as being of Least Concern by IUCN . The race granti , with 100 pairs resident on Madeira and 200 pairs on the Canary Islands , is threatened by loss of habitat , egg @-@ collecting and illegal hunting , and is listed on Annex I of the European Commission Birds Directive . It is one of the most common birds of prey in Europe , along with the common kestrel and common buzzard . The Norwegian and Albanian populations are declining and , in many parts of Europe , Eurasian sparrowhawks are still shot . However , this low @-@ level persecution has not affected the populations badly . In the UK , the population increased by 108 % between 1970 – 2005 , but saw a 1 % decline over 1994 – 2006 . In Ireland it is the most common bird of prey , breeding even near the city centre of Dublin , where it frequents parks and large gardens . 
 This species is prevalent in most woodland types in its range , and also in more open country with scattered trees . Eurasian sparrowhawks prefer to hunt the edges of wooded areas , but migrant birds can be seen in any habitat . The increased proportion of medium @-@ aged stands of trees created by modern forestry techniques have benefited Accipiter nisus , according to a Norwegian study . Unlike its larger relative the northern goshawk , it can be seen in gardens and in urban areas and will even breed in city parks . 
 Eurasian sparrowhawks from colder regions of northern Europe and Asia migrate south for the winter , some to north Africa ( some as far as equatorial east Africa ) and India ; members of the southern populations are resident or disperse . Juveniles begin their migration earlier than adults and juvenile females move before juvenile males . Analysis of ringing data collected at Heligoland , Germany , found that males move further and more often than females ; of migrating birds ringed at Kaliningrad , Russia , the average distance moved before recovery ( when the ring is read and the bird 's whereabouts reported subsequently ) was 1 @,@ 328 km ( 825 mi ) for males and 927 km ( 576 mi ) for females . 
 A study of Eurasian sparrowhawks in southern Scotland found that ringed birds which had been raised on " high grade " territories were recovered in greater proportion than birds which came from " low grade " territories . This suggested that the high grade territories produced young which survived better . The recovery rate also declined with increased elevation of the ground . After the post @-@ fledging period , female birds dispersed greater distances than did males . 
 = = Food , feeding and predation = = 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a major predator of smaller woodland birds , though only 10 % of its hunting attacks are successful . It hunts by surprise attack , using hedges , tree @-@ belts , copses , orchards and other cover near woodland areas ; its choice of habitat is dictated by these requirements . It also makes use of gardens in built @-@ up areas , taking advantage of the prey found there . 
 It waits , hidden , for birds to come near , then breaks cover and flies out fast and low . A chase may follow , with the hawk even flipping upside @-@ down to grab the victim from below or following it on foot through vegetation . It can " stoop " onto prey from a great height . Ian Newton describes seven modes of hunting used by Eurasian sparrowhawks : 
 Short @-@ stay @-@ perch @-@ hunting 
 High soaring and stooping 
 Contour @-@ hugging in flight 
 Still @-@ hunting 
 Low quartering 
 Hunting by sound 
 Hunting on foot 
 Male Eurasian sparrowhawks regularly kill birds weighing up to 40 g ( 1 @.@ 4 oz ) and sometimes up to 120 g ( 4 @.@ 2 oz ) ; females can tackle prey up to 500 g ( 18 oz ) or more . The weight of food consumed by adult birds daily is estimated to be 40 – 50 g ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 8 oz ) for males and 50 – 70 g ( 1 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 5 oz ) for females . During one year , a pair of Eurasian sparrowhawks could take 2 @,@ 200 house sparrows , 600 common blackbirds or 110 wood pigeons . Species that feed in the open , far from cover , or are conspicuous by their behaviour or coloration , are taken more often by Eurasian sparrowhawks . For example , great tits and house sparrows are vulnerable to attack . Eurasian sparrowhawks may account for more than 50 % of deaths in certain species , but the extent varies from area to area . 
 Males tend to take tits , finches , sparrows and buntings ; females often take thrushes and starlings . Larger quarry ( such as doves and magpies ) may not die immediately but succumb during feather plucking and eating . More than 120 bird species have been recorded as prey and individual Eurasian sparrowhawks may specialise in certain prey . The birds taken are usually adults or fledglings , though chicks in the nest and carrion are sometimes eaten . Small mammals , including bats , are sometimes caught but insects are eaten only very rarely . 
 Small birds are killed on impact or when squeezed by the Eurasian sparrowhawk 's foot , especially the two long claws . Victims which struggle are " kneaded " by the hawk , using its talons to squeeze and stab . When dealing with large prey species which peck and flap , the hawk 's long legs help . It stands on top of its prey to pluck and pull it apart . The feathers are plucked and usually the breast muscles are eaten first . The bones are left , but can be broken using the notch in the bill . Like other birds of prey , Eurasian sparrowhawks produce pellets containing indigestible parts of their prey . These range from 25 to 35 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 to 1 @.@ 38 in ) long and 10 – 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 71 in ) wide and are round at one end and more narrow and pointed at the other . They are usually composed of small feathers , as the larger ones are plucked and not consumed . 
 During hunting , this species can fly 2 – 3 km ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 9 mi ) per day . It rises above tree level mostly to display , soar above territory and to make longer journeys . A study in a forested area of Norway found that the mean size of the home ranges was 9 @.@ 2 km2 ( 3 @.@ 6 sq mi ) for males , and 12 @.@ 3 km2 ( 4 @.@ 7 sq mi ) for females , which was larger than studies in Great Britain had found , " probably due to lower land productivity and associated lower densities of prey species in the [ Norwegian study area ] " . 
 A study looked at the effect on the population of blue tits in an area where a pair of Eurasian sparrowhawks began to breed in 1990 . It found that the annual adult survival rate for the tits in that area dropped from 0 @.@ 485 to 0 @.@ 376 ( the rate in adjacent plots did not change ) . The size of the breeding population was not changed , but there were fewer non @-@ breeding blue tits in the population . In woodland , Eurasian sparrowhawks account for the deaths of a third of all young great tits ; the two alarm calls given by great tits when mobbing a predator , and when fleeing from a nearby hawk , are within the optimum hearing range of both prey and predator ; however , the high @-@ pitched alarm call given when a distant flying Eurasian sparrowhawk is seen " can only be heard well by the tit . " Research carried out in Sussex , England , found that the impact of Eurasian sparrowhawk predation on grey partridges was highest when the partridge density was lowest , while a 10 @-@ year study in Scotland found that Eurasian sparrowhawks did not select the common redshanks they predated according to the waders ' size or condition , probably because of the hawks ' surprise @-@ attack hunting technique . 
 Another study found that the risk of predation for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or northern goshawk increased 25 @-@ fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite Leucocytozoon , and birds with avian malaria were 16 times more likely to be killed . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 Natural predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk include the barn owl , the tawny owl , the northern goshawk , the peregrine falcon , the golden eagle , the eagle owl , the red fox , the stone marten and the pine marten . 
 = = Breeding = = 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk breeds in well @-@ grown , extensive areas of woodland , often coniferous or mixed , preferring forest with a structure neither too dense nor too open , to allow a choice of flight paths . The nest can be located in the fork of a tree , often near the trunk and where two or three branches begin , on a horizontal branch in the lower canopy , or near the top of a tall shrub . If available , conifers are preferred . A new nest is built every year , generally close to the nest of the previous year , and sometimes using an old wood pigeon ( A. n. melaschistos frequently uses the old nests of jungle crows ) nest as a base ; the male does most of the work . The structure , made of loose twigs up to 60 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) long , has an average diameter of 60 cm ( 24 in ) . When the eggs are laid , a lining of fine twigs or bark chippings is added . 
 During the breeding season , the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses a small amount of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs , and also when the young are large and require more food . The weight of the adult female is highest in May , when laying eggs , and lowest in August after the breeding cycle is complete . A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her . 
 Sexual maturity is reached at between 1 – 3 years . Most Eurasian sparrowhawks stay on the same territory for one breeding season , though others keep the same one for up to eight years . A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory . Older birds tend to stay in the same territory ; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely . The birds which kept the same territories had higher nest success , though it did not increase between years ; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory . 
 = = = Eggs = = = 
 The eggs are pale blue with brown spots and each measure 35 – 46 x 28 – 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 8 x 1 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 4 inches ) , and weigh about 22 @.@ 5 g ( 0 @.@ 79 oz ) of which 8 % is shell in a healthy egg . Usually a clutch of four or five eggs is laid . The eggs are generally laid in the morning with an interval of 2 – 3 days between each egg . If a clutch is lost , up to two further eggs may be laid that are smaller than the earlier eggs . 
 = = = Young = = = 
 The altricial , downy chicks hatch after 33 days of incubation . After hatching , the female cares for and feeds the chicks for the first 8 – 14 days of life , and also during bad weather after that . The male provides food , up to six kills per day in the first week increasing to eight per day in the third and 10 per day in the last week in the nest , by which time the female is also hunting . 
 By 24 – 28 days after hatching , the young birds start to perch on branches near the nest and take their first flight . They are fed by their parents for a further 28 – 30 days , staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying . At this stage they are extremely vocal , and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away . The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them . Though they receive the same amount of food , male chicks ( roughly half the size of females ) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner . In a study in the Forest of Ae , south @-@ west Scotland , it was found that 21 % of nestlings over two days old died , with the causes of death being starvation , wet weather , predation and desertion by the parents . The parasite Leucocytozoon <unk> can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest , possibly because of the number of birds sharing a small space , thus allowing transmission .

 The Eurasian sparrowhawk population in Europe crashed in the second half of the 20th century . The decline coincided with the introduction of <unk> insecticides – <unk> , dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956 . The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain @-@ eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon : the shells of eggs they laid were too thin , causing them to break during incubation ; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides . Sub @-@ lethal effects of these substances include irritability , convulsions and disorientation . In west Germany , around 80 % of nests before the 1950s produced young , but only 54 % were successful in the 1960s and ' 70s . 
 In the United Kingdom , for example , the species almost became extinct in East Anglia , where the chemicals were most widely used ; in western and northern parts of the country , where the pesticides were not used , there were no declines . The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds bought its Coombes Valley nature reserve in Staffordshire because it was the only Eurasian sparrowhawk breeding site left in the English Midlands . 
 In the UK , the use of <unk> as seed dressings for autumn @-@ sown cereals was banned in 1975 and the levels of the chemicals present in the bird population began to fall . The population has largely recovered to pre @-@ decline levels , with an increase seen in many areas , for example northern Europe . In Sweden , the population also decreased drastically from the 1950s , but recovered again once organochlorines were banned in the 1970s . 
 In the UK , the failure rate at the egg stage had decreased from 17 % to 6 % by the year 2000 , and the population had stabilised after reaching a peak in the 1990s . A study of the eggs of Dutch Eurasian sparrowhawks found that contamination with <unk> ( DDE ) – a " very persistent compound " produced when DDT breaks down – continued into the 1980s , though a decline in the number of clutches with broken eggs during the 1970s suggested decreasing levels of the chemical . 
 Body tissue samples from Eurasian sparrowhawks are still analysed as part of the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme conducted by the UK government 's Joint Nature Conservation Committee . Although the average liver concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in Eurasian sparrowhawks were lower in birds that died in 2005 compared to those that died in 2004 , there was not a significant or consistent decline in residues between 2000 – 2005 . 
 = = = Conflict with human interests = = = 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk 's adaptation for feeding on birds has brought it into conflict with humans ; in the 19th century it was described as " the great enemy of small quadrupeds and birds , and often very destructive to young chicks in poultry @-@ yards in the breeding season " and " very destructive to partridges . " Writing for gamekeepers in 1851 , T.B. Johnson recommended that : " The nest of this bird should be diligently sought ... and destroyed , shooting the parent birds first , if possible . " 
 It was written in 1870 that " The sparrowhawk is perhaps only the true enemy of the game @-@ preserver ; though at the same time it is probable that if the good and evil it does were justly weighed , the balance would be in favour of the hawk , its favourite quarry being the wood pigeon , which is now increasing to an extent injurious to agriculture . " 18th century parish records for Aldworth , Berkshire , in southern England , show that payments were made for 106 Eurasian sparrowhawks ' heads , at the same time as efforts were being made to control the numbers of sparrows . 
 The species suffered heavy persecution by 18th century European landowners and gamekeepers , but withstood attempts to eradicate it . For example , on the estate at Sandringham in Norfolk , 1 @,@ 645 ' hawks ' were killed between 1938 and 1950 , with 1 @,@ 115 taken between 1919 – 1926 at <unk> and <unk> in Caithness , Scotland . 
 The population was able to quickly replace lost birds – there is a high proportion of non @-@ breeding , non @-@ territorial birds able to fill vacant territories . The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey ; gamekeepers ' more successful efforts to wipe out the northern goshawk and pine marten – predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk – may have benefited it . The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed , for example during the First and Second World Wars . 
 In the United Kingdom , research into the effect of predators on bird populations has been " a contentious issue , " with " perceived conflict between the interests of nature conservationists and those involved in game shooting . " Declines in the populations of some British songbirds since the 1960s have coincided with considerable changes in agricultural practices and also large increases in the numbers of Eurasian sparrowhawks and European magpies . When the Eurasian sparrowhawk population declined because of organochlorine use , there was no great increase in the populations of songbirds . In a 1949 – 1979 study of 13 passerine species breeding in a 40 – acre ( 16 @-@ hectare ) <unk> at Bookham Commons , Surrey , England , none was present in significantly greater numbers when Eurasian sparrowhawks were absent from the wood . 
 Many studies , mostly short @-@ term , failed to find an effect on songbird populations caused by predatory birds such as Eurasian sparrowhawks . But analysis of long @-@ term , large @-@ scale national data from the UK 's Common Bird Census demonstrated that the declines in farmland songbird populations since the 1960s are unlikely to have been caused by increased predation by Eurasian sparrowhawks and magpies . The results of the study indicated that patterns of year @-@ to @-@ year songbird population change were the same at different sites , whether the predators were present or not . Another study , which examined the effects of predators – including the Eurasian sparrowhawk and introduced grey squirrel – on UK passerine populations , found that " whilst a small number of associations may suggest significant negative effects between predator and prey species , for the majority of the songbird species examined there is no evidence that increases in common avian predators or grey squirrels are associated with large @-@ scale population declines . " 
 Racing pigeon owners in Great Britain have said for many years that Eurasian sparrowhawks and peregrine falcons " cause serious and escalating losses " of pigeons and some have called for these birds of prey to be killed or removed from areas surrounding homing pigeon lofts . 
 In Scotland , a two @-@ year study published in 2004 , and funded by Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Homing Union ( SHU ) , found there was " no evidence that birds of prey cause major losses of racing pigeons at lofts or during races . " It reported that 56 % of racing pigeons were lost each year but that the proportion taken by Eurasian sparrowhawks – " often blamed for major losses " – was less than 1 % , with at least 2 % taken by peregrine falcons . The study was carried out by the Central Science Laboratory ; researchers worked with SHU members who provided data , information on pigeon rings found at peregrine falcon nests and pigeon carcasses . 
 From January to April 2009 , the Scottish Government conducted a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow , Edinburgh , Kilmarnock , Stirling and Dumfries . The trial , which cost £ 25 @,@ 000 , was supported by the Scottish Homing Union , representing the country 's 3 @,@ 500 pigeon fanciers . The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds ' breeding season . It was criticised by the government 's own ecological adviser , Dr Ian Bainbridge , the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . 
 The findings , released in January 2010 , showed that only seven Eurasian sparrowhawks had been removed from the area from five pigeon lofts . One hawk returned twice to the area of the loft , while new birds began to visit two other lofts . The report found that “ The quantity and quality of the observational data collected meant that it was impossible to draw any firm conclusions ” and the government stated that “ no further research involving the trapping or translocation of raptors ” would take place , while the SHU maintained that it was " very optimistic that licensed trapping and translocation could at last provide some protection . " 
 = = = Falconry = = = 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk has been used in falconry for centuries and was favoured by Emperor Akbar the Great ( 1542 – 1605 ) of the Mughal Empire . There is a tradition of using migrant Eurasian sparrowhawks to catch common quail in Tunisia and Georgia , where there are 500 registered <unk> ( <unk> ) and a monument to <unk> in the city of Poti . Eurasian sparrowhawks are also popular in Ireland . At Cap Bon in Tunisia , and in Turkey , thousands are captured each year by falconers and used for hunting migrant common quails . Although they were formerly released at the end of the season , many are now kept because of the scarcity of migrants . 
 In 17th century England , the Eurasian sparrowhawk was used by priests , reflecting their lowly status ; whereas in the Middle Ages , they were favoured by ladies of noble and royal status because of their small size . The falconer 's name for a male Eurasian sparrowhawk is a " musket " ; this is derived from the Latin word <unk> , meaning ' a fly ' , via the Old French word <unk> . The famous list in the mediaeval Book of Saint Albans refers to the female sparrowhawk as the " priest 's bird " and the musket as " the clerk 's bird " . 
 " An <unk> [ falconer ] undertaking to train a sparrowhawk should be in doubt that he is taking on one of the most difficult hawks available . " A female Eurasian sparrowhawk is considered a bad choice for a novice and the male is very difficult and demanding , even for an experienced handler . They have been described as " hysterical little hawks " but are also praised as courageous and providing " sport of the highest quality . " Philip Glasier describes Eurasian sparrowhawks as " in many ways superior to hunting with a larger short @-@ wing [ hawk ] " and " extremely hard to tame . " They are best suited for small quarry such as common starlings and common blackbirds but are also capable of taking common teal , Eurasian magpies , pheasants and partridges . A 19th century author remarked that this species was " the best of all hawks for <unk> " , now known as corn crakes . In 1735 , the Sportsman 's Dictionary noted that " ... she will serve in the winter as well as in the summer , and will fly at all kind of game more than the falcon . If a winter sparrowhawk prove good , she will kill the pye , the chough , the jay , woodcock , thrush , black @-@ bird , fieldfare , and divers [ e ] other birds of the like nature . " 
 = = = In culture = = = 
 In Teutonic mythology , the sparrowhawk , known as <unk> or <unk> , is a sacred bird in Old Bohemian songs and lives in a grove of the gods . Holy sparrowhawks perch on the branches of an oak tree that grows from the grave of a murdered man , and " publish the foul deed . " In some areas of England , it was believed that the common cuckoo turned into a Eurasian sparrowhawk in winter . The name Spearhafoc ( later Sparhawk , Sparrowhawk ) was in use as a personal name in England before the Norman conquest in 1066 . 
 In 1695 , John Aubrey wrote in his Miscellanies : 
 <unk> long before the Death of King Charles II a sparrow @-@ hawk escaped from the Perch , and pitched on one of the Iron Crowns of the White Tower , and entangling its string in the Crown , hung by the heels and died . T <unk> considered very ominous , and so it <unk> 
 The musket , or <unk> , originally a kind of crossbow bolt , and later a small cannon , was named after the male Eurasian sparrowhawk because of its size . The British Gloster Aircraft Company named one of their Mars series craft the Sparrowhawk . 
 In William Shakespeare 's The Merry Wives of Windsor , Mrs Ford greets Robin , Falstaff 's page , with the words " How now , my eyas musket " , eyas musket meaning a lively young man ( an eyas is a hawk nestling ) . The British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes wrote a poem entitled Sparrow Hawk which refers to this species . Hermann Hesse mentioned this bird in his book Demian and the bird is also referred to in One Thousand and One Nights by Richard Francis Burton : 
 Good sooth my bones , <unk> they hear thy name 
 Quail as birds <unk> when Nisus o 'er them flew 
 The Eurasian sparrowhawk was written about by Alfred , Lord Tennyson : 
 A <unk> proud did hold in wicked jail 
 Music 's sweet chorister , the Nightingale 
 To whom with sighs she said : ' O set me free , 
 And in my song I 'll praise no bird but <unk> 
 The Hawk replied : ' I will not lose my diet 
 To let a thousand such enjoy their <unk> 
 = Luis Muñoz Rivera = 
 Luis Muñoz Rivera ( July 17 , 1859 – November 15 , 1916 ) was a Puerto Rican poet , journalist and politician . He was a major figure in the struggle for political autonomy of Puerto Rico . 
 In 1887 , Muñoz Rivera became part of the leadership of a newly formed Autonomist Party . In 1889 , he successfully ran a campaign for the position of delegate in the district of Caguas . Subsequently , Muñoz Rivera was a member of a group organized by the party to discuss proposals of autonomy with Práxedes Mateo Sagasta , who would grant Puerto Rico an autonomous government following his election . He served as Chief of the Cabinet of this government . 
 On August 13 , 1898 , the Treaty of Paris transferred possession of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States and a military government was established . In 1899 , Muñoz Rivera resigned his position within the cabinet and remained inactive in politics for some time . In 1909 , he was elected as Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico and participated in the creation of the Jones @-@ Shafroth Act , proposing amendments before its final approval . Shortly after , Muñoz Rivera contracted an infection and traveled to Puerto Rico , where he died on November 15 , 1916 . His son , Luis Muñoz Marín would subsequently become involved in politics , becoming the first democratically elected Governor of Puerto Rico . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Luis Muñoz Rivera was born in Barranquitas , Puerto Rico , to Luis Muñoz Barrios and Monserrate Rivera Vazquez . He was the couple 's first child and a banquet was offered in celebration . He came from a middle @-@ class family and was not part of Puerto Rico 's elite . His father came from one of the first patriarchal lines in Puerto Rico 's politics . 
 ( His Paternal Grandfather ) decided to make his career in the army and received several recognitions after participating against Simón Bolívar during the Admirable Campaign , and followed his commanding officer Miguel de la Torre to Puerto Rico . He settled in a 400 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 6 km2 ) farm in Cidra , Puerto Rico , married María Escolástica Barrios and fathered twelve children . He became the town 's first mayor from 1818 to 1820 and again in 1840 to 1850 . 
 During Muñoz Rivera 's childhood , Barranquitas was a small rural town . The family 's house was moderately large for the time ; it was built with wood and its roof was made with zinc . When he was four , his mother home @-@ schooled him with books from a private library owned by his father . By the age of ten , Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town 's school , and finished first in his class . He was educated in Spanish and French , and took music classes with Jorge <unk> . His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction . Muñoz Rivera was a serious student with a strong interest in Miguel de Cervantes ' works , in particular Don Quixote . Other authors that he studied include Fernando de Herrera , Tirso de Molina , Luis de Góngora , and Lope de Vega . 
 When Muñoz Rivera was twelve years old , his mother fell ill and died . By this time , the family had grown to include nine more siblings , whom he taught . By the age of fourteen , Muñoz Rivera was managing legal documents , working with the local church clergy , and helping in his father 's store . There were no institutions of higher learning on the island at that time , and most families sent their children to Cuba ( University of la Habana , founded in 1728 ) , Spain or North America to complete their university education . Muñoz Rivera wanted to travel to Spain and study law , but his father wanted him to take care of the family 's business . 
 = = Political career = = 
 = = = Early involvement in politics and poetry = = = 
 Early in his life , Muñoz Rivera began writing poetry . However , he did not publish any of his work until he was 23 years old . In 1882 , Mario Braschi , an editor working for a newspaper named El Pueblo , accepted to publish a poem titled ¡ Adelante ! . Braschi advised Muñoz Rivera to continue writing , urging him to concentrate on science and politics , instead of authoring love poems . Muñoz Rivera then began writing about Puerto Rico 's political status , promoting the necessity of an autonomous government . 
 Even though his father was a member of the Conservative Party , Muñoz Rivera decided to follow his uncle , Vicente Muñoz Barrios ideals and in 1883 joined the Liberal Party . While working within the organization , Muñoz Rivera established a store along <unk> Negrón Sanjurjo , which had limited success . He gained the confidence of the Liberal Party and was named president of Barranquitas ' committee and became a member of the municipal council . In 1885 , Muñoz Rivera ran for a position in the Juana Diaz district 's representation in the Provincial Assembly , but he was not elected . That same year , he began publishing his writings in newspapers and magazines , including El <unk> del Pueblo , La Revista de Puerto Rico and El Pueblo . Other poems published by Muñoz Rivera were : <unk> , <unk> , Horas de <unk> , El <unk> del <unk> , Minha terra , Cuba <unk> , A <unk> <unk> , Las <unk> , Turba <unk> , Alea <unk> est , Judas , El general , <unk> , Patriota , Himno , <unk> and <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Establishing an autonomous government = = = 
 In January 1887 , members of the Liberal Party organized a convention in Coamo where they discussed the reorganization of the party . In this activity he met Román Baldorioty de Castro , who became his mentor , regarding Muñoz Rivera as a " disciple " . A new party called the Autonomist Party was created following this reunion , which also included José Celso Barbosa and José de Diego . The organization 's ideology pursued the creation of a separate government for Puerto Rico , while keeping some relationship with Spain . 
 The Autonomist Party 's base grew rapidly , in part due to Muñoz Rivera 's writings and speeches directed toward the <unk> population . The Conservative Party considered this a threat and closed the newspapers where he published his work , sending part of their staff to jail in Fort San Felipe del Morro . After Francisco Cepeda <unk> , editor of La Revista de Puerto Rico 's was jailed , the position was offered to Muñoz Rivera , who accepted it . After being released from prison , Cepeda criticized Baldorioty de Castro 's policies . Cepeda was elected secretary of the party and Baldorioty de Castro was named honorary president . This action angered Muñoz Rivera , who challenged him to a duel . Cepeda originally accepted the challenge , but later declined the same once the preparations were underway , losing his position within the party 's hierarchy . 
 As 1887 progressed , the conflicts between liberals and conservatives worsened , with governor Palacio ordering the arrest of more than a hundred liberals . The political tension increased and the year became known as " The Terrible Year " . <unk> also prohibited any person from leaving Puerto Rico with the intention of preventing any actions from Spain . However , the liberals were able to send Juan Arrillaga Roque to Madrid , where he made the situation public . Upon learning of this , Alfonso XII replaced Palacio with Juan Contreras Martinez . In 1889 , Muñoz Rivera was nominated as the Liberal Party 's delegate for the district of Juana Diaz . However , his father was nominated for the same position by the Conservative Party and he moved his nomination to the district of Caguas out of respect . He won the election , which was admitted with the conservatives ' opposition . 
 On July 1 , 1890 , he founded the party 's newspaper , La <unk> , in Ponce , Puerto Rico . The publication was mostly directed towards politics , but it also included poetry and stories published by Puerto Rican artists . The newspaper brought immediate controversy , which eventually led to Muñoz Rivera 's arrest . Protest were organized throughout Puerto Rico and he was released after his father paid 15 @,@ 000 pesetas as bond . Muñoz Rivera sold his half of the store , in order to raise funds for the publication 's establishment . 
 In 1893 , he married Amalia Marín in a ceremony that took place in Ponce Cathedral . Later that year , he traveled to Spain to learn about its political system . There he realized that Práxedes Mateo Sagasta , president of the Fusion Party , was the better option to help in this task . While in Spain , Muñoz Rivera received notice that his father had died , which heavily affected him . Upon returning to Puerto Rico , he published an article about his father in La Democracia . He subsequently noticed that his travel had caused controversy within the Autonomist Party , which became divided between followers of Barbosa and Muñoz Rivera , with the two factions becoming known as <unk> and Barbosistas . 
 Barbosa 's group opposed allying with Sagasta , claiming that he was a monarchist while they were supporting the establishment of a republic . Meanwhile , Muñoz Rivera participated in the writing of the Plan de Ponce which proposed administrative autonomy for the island . After several debates , the Autonomist Party agreed to send four men to reunite with Libera Fusion Party in the organization 's behalf , including Muñoz Rivera . Sagasta proposed that if he won the premiership of Spain , Puerto Rico would receive a Chapter of Autonomy which would give it the same degree of sovereignty that the Spanish provinces had . Upon learning of this , most of the Barbosistas resigned , forming a new institution named the Orthodox Autonomist Party . Sagasta became Spain 's prime minister following the power vacuum that occurred after the assassination of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo , and in December 1897 he granted the promised autonomous government . Muñoz Rivera changed the party 's name to Liberal Party of Puerto Rico and served as Secretary of Grace , Justice and Government and Chief of the Cabinet for the independent government of Puerto Rico . 
 = = = American invasion and military government = = = 
 On February 18 , 1898 , Muñoz Rivera 's son , Luis Muñoz Marín , was born . By this time the family had moved to Old San Juan , where Luis was born . On February 16 , 1898 , Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera 's home . He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk off the coast of Cuba , which would most likely spark a war between Spain and the United States . Barbosa expected the American government to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control . However , Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news , knowing that the United States was planning to build a canal in Panama , and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure . Barbosa insisted that this would not happen , continuing his support towards a military operation . 
 On May 12 , 1898 , the United States Navy bombarded San Juan , initiating the Puerto Rican Campaign . Initially , the Liberal Party supported the Spanish government , although several members agreed with Barbosa . Muñoz Rivera took possession of Chief of the Cabinet 's position for the Autonomous Government on July 21 . Four days later , on July 25 , the United States Army landed in Guánica led by Nelson A. Miles , beginning the land offensive . On August 13 , the signing of the Treaty of Paris was made public , bringing a halt to all military offensives in Puerto Rico . As part of this amnesty , Spain ceded Cuba and Puerto Rico , converting the archipelago into a possession of the United States under military governorship . The Barbosistas welcomed the American government , but Muñoz Rivera expected them to keep Puerto Rico as a possession . He refused to cooperate with the military government and returned to Barranquitas , where he wrote a poem titled <unk> , comparing Puerto Rico 's political situation to Sisyphus ' punishment . He subsequently returned to San Juan , accepting a request made by John R. Brooke to continue in his office within the new cabinet . Muñoz Rivera assisted in establishing an insular police . Brooke was replaced by Guy Vernon Henry as military governor . Following this change , both men began having violent discussions , with each one trying to push their positions . Muñoz Rivera would vocally debate several of Brooke 's decisions , with both communicating via an interpreter . 
 On February 4 , 1899 , he resigned from the position of president of the Council of Secretaries . Puerto Rico was experiencing a serious economic crisis , many problems arising from the population 's inability to communicate with the Americans . Universal election suffrage was canceled , reducing the voting population by more than 85 % . Henry eventually dissolved the Cabinet , removing the final remnants of recognition of the autonomous government established under Spanish rule . Muñoz Rivera opposed the military structure and promoted autonomy . Later that year , he founded the newspaper El <unk> , which voiced the concerns of landowners that were being affected by a blockade imposed by the United States . On April 12 , 1900 , William McKinley signed the Foraker Act , which proposed the end of the military government and the establishment of a civil government . A Supreme Court was created with five members , all of which were American functionaries appointed by the United States President . The position of Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico was also enacted . The Barbosistas considered this law an advance , eventually creating a new institution named the Republican Party of Puerto Rico . Muñoz Rivera published heavy criticism towards them in El Diario , which angered the members of the new organization . Rumors of an assassination attempt became widespread , and several of his friends visited his house armed . A discussion between both sides concluded with gunfire , leaving no one injured , some of the perpetrators escaped . Muñoz Rivera and those present were arrested and charged with " armed assault " , but the charge was dropped when he established that he acted in self @-@ defense . The Foraker act failed to prevent the monopolization of land , and allowed four American corporations to control of most of Puerto Rico 's agricultural terrains . 
 = = Last years and death = = 
 The United States eventually designed a program to " Americanize " Puerto Rico . One day while working for an article in El Diario , a friend of Muñoz Rivera brought a newspaper informing that all education in Puerto Rican public schools would be taught in English . He was surprised by the announcement , expressing that the plan would fail due to lack of teachers with knowledge in the language . Muñoz Rivera began publishing articles directed towards the <unk> population , in which he promoted self @-@ government for Puerto Rico . 
 In 1901 , a group of statehood supporters broke into the El Diario 's building , vandalizing most of the equipment . Following this incident , the family moved to Caguas where he reopened La Democracia . After receiving further threats from the statehood movements , Muñoz Rivera decided to move to New York City , not before leaving the paper 's editing in charge of one of his followers . There he founded the bilingual newspaper Puerto Rico Herald , in which he heavily criticized the United States ' stance on Puerto Rico . During the following years , the family constantly traveled between both locations . Muñoz Rivera , together with Rosendo <unk> Cintrón , Antonio R. Barceló and José de Diego , founded the Union of Puerto Rico party , which won the election in 1904 . Following the party 's victory , he was selected as a member the House of Delegates . 
 In 1910 , Muñoz Rivera ran for Resident Commissioner in the United States House of Representatives representing the Union of Puerto Rico party , and served from 1911 to 1916 . After spending nearly a year perfecting his English , Muñoz Rivera began forming friendships with some congressmen . Among these were Henry L. Stimpson and Felix Frankfurter . In 1915 Muñoz Rivera proposed granting Puerto Rico greater autonomy without requesting independence from the United States , and equal rights without becoming a state . His proposal was greeted by opposition from many members of his party including José de Diego . Still in the end , his party agreed on his proposal . 
 On March 2 , 1917 , the Jones @-@ Shafroth Act was signed , granting United States citizenship to Puerto Ricans and creating a bicameral Legislative Assembly . Still , he was not pleased with the Jones Act since the judicial and executive branches were still controlled by the United States . On March 16 , 1916 , he gave a speech in the house floor that seemed to argue in favor and against American citizenship . He declared that if the earth were to swallow the island , Puerto Ricans would prefer American citizenship to any citizenship in the world . But as long as the island existed , the residents preferred Puerto Rican citizenship . 
 Shortly afterwards , he became ill and returned to Puerto Rico to recuperate . In late 1916 , Eduardo <unk> , a friend of the family , summoned his wife and son to Puerto Rico and informed them that he was suffering from an infection that had begun in the <unk> , before expanding throughout his body . Luis Muñoz Rivera died on November 15 , 1916 in the town of San Juan , before the Jones Act was enacted into law . When he died , the town 's bells were tolled and La <unk> was sung by those present . The funeral procession began five days after his death It traveled throughout Puerto Rico and was attended by thousands of people along the way . Some <unk> traveled between municipalities to attend more than one part of the activity . At his request , Muñoz ' remains were buried at San Antonio De <unk> Cemetery in Barranquitas , Puerto Rico .

 Muñoz Rivera 's son , Luis Muñoz Marín , also became an important figure in politics , taking part in the foundation of the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico . He was elected in 1948 as the first democratically elected Governor of Puerto Rico in 1948 . 
 In 1923 , the municipality of Ponce erected a statue in honor of Munoz Rivera and renamed the northern plaza of the city 's main square Plaza Muñoz Rivera for him . * Sixteen Puerto Rican schools were named for Muñoz . 
 = Hugh Culverhouse = 
 Hugh Franklin Culverhouse , Sr. ( February 20 , 1919 – August 26 , 1994 ) was the longtime owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League ( NFL ) . He was a successful tax lawyer , and his real estate investments made him one of the nation 's wealthiest men . His work brought him into contact with National Football League team owners , and his failed purchase of the Los Angeles Rams placed him in line to become the owner of the fledgling Buccaneer franchise . He owned the team from its inception until his death . 
 Culverhouse became one of the most influential team owners in the NFL , and was credited with modernizing the league , even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field . He oversaw the league 's course of direction through two player strikes , and the modern league 's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership . He held influence for over a decade , before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly @-@ secretive ways . 
 Culverhouse was initially lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area , but eventually came to be blamed for the team 's struggles . His refusal to pay Doug Williams at a salary level comparable to that of the league 's top quarterbacks insulted fans , and was seen as the beginning of the team 's decline during the 1980s . It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team , as long as it was financially profitable . The Buccaneers ' NFL @-@ record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception , although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team . 
 Culverhouse was diagnosed with cancer in 1992 , and died in 1994 . His apparent attempt to exclude his wife from his inheritance led to posthumous revelations of extramarital affairs . Ensuing lawsuits caused an ownership crisis that almost required the team to relocate to another city , before the Glazer family stepped forward with a purchase offer . 
 = = Early life = = 
 A native of Birmingham , Alabama , Culverhouse attended the University of Alabama , where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity ( Psi chapter ) . On the University of Alabama boxing team , he competed together with future governor George Wallace , an experience to which he attributed his confidence in later life . He graduated in 1941 . After serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II , he earned a law degree from his alma mater in 1947 . He immediately took a job as an assistant state attorney general , serving there for two years . After serving in the Korean War , he became legal counsel for the Internal Revenue Service , where he prosecuted many of the cases resulting from the organized crime investigations of Senator Estes Kefauver . He resigned from the IRS in 1962 after a decade of service , and moved to Jacksonville , Florida , where he entered private practice , specializing in tax law . Although he was considered to be one of the nation 's top tax lawyers , one whose cases were sometimes cited by the Supreme Court of the United States , his fortune was built on real estate investments . Listed by Forbes magazine as one of the 250 wealthiest people in the United States , he eventually had investments in 37 companies and was worth over $ 380 million at his death . He served as a personal representative of President Gerald Ford , bearing the title of U.S. Ambassador , at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck , Austria . The University of Alabama 's Culverhouse College of Commerce and Business Administration is named for him . 
 Culverhouse 's investments included several banks , Provincetown @-@ Boston Airlines , the Palmer Ranch real estate development near Sarasota , Florida , and movie productions including A Chorus Line and The Emerald Forest . He was criticized over a planned extension of Interstate 75 into South Florida , as its route went directly past land owned by numerous powerful investors , including Culverhouse , Governor Bob Graham , State Attorney General Jim Smith , and the <unk> Corporation . 
 = = Ownership of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers = = 
 In 1972 , Culverhouse had a handshake deal to buy the Los Angeles Rams from owner Dan Reeves for $ 17 million , only to learn that Reeves later sold the team to Robert Irsay for $ 19 million . When Irsay then traded teams with Baltimore Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom , Culverhouse sued , claiming that the others had conspired to prevent his purchase of the team . An out @-@ of @-@ court settlement guaranteed Rosenbloom 's aid in getting an expansion franchise for Culverhouse . The opportunity came two years later , when the league expanded to Seattle and Tampa . Culverhouse was offered the Seattle expansion franchise , but declined it due to his residence in Jacksonville . Philadelphia construction company owner Thomas McCloskey was originally awarded the Tampa franchise , but soon found the business arrangement to be different than what he had expected , and backed out of the deal . Culverhouse was then awarded the franchise by the Art Rooney @-@ chaired NFL Expansion Committee , ahead of Fort Lauderdale furniture chain ( and future Boston Celtics ) owner Harry T. <unk> , Jr . The name " Tampa Bay Buccaneers " was chosen as a nod to the team representing not only the city of Tampa , but the entire Florida Suncoast area ; and to the pirates who once inhabited the area . 
 Culverhouse quickly became one of the most influential NFL owners ; he served as a member of the Player Club Relations Committee that handled player grievances , and of the NFL Congressional Committee . He was a member of the Executive Committee that handled negotiations during the 1982 NFL strike , an experience that earned him great praise from NFL negotiator Jack Donlan . Donlan praised Culverhouse 's logic , analytical , and problem @-@ solving skills , and his effectiveness " at getting his way " . Culverhouse was credited with having a big hand in the owners ' course of direction during the strike , and was responsible for recruiting Donlan as negotiator . He repeated the role during the 1987 players ' strike , after which NFLPA President Gene Upshaw described him as " formidable " , and said that " at times , the whole league seemed to flow from this one guy " . He was chairman of the NFL Finance Committee and the Management Council Executive Committee . His efforts were instrumental in bringing Super Bowl XVIII to Tampa , despite a lack of adequate hotel space in the city . Culverhouse was also a pioneer in using computers to handle team finances and scouting reports . He was a member of the four @-@ man committee that stripped ownership of the New England Patriots from the Sullivan family when their debt became too great . Patriots founder Billy Sullivan later accused Culverhouse of blocking his effort to propose a stock sale that would have eased the debt . Culverhouse distanced himself from the NFL power core in later years , stung by other owners ' criticisms of the Management Council . NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue credited Culverhouse for building much of the strength and unity of the modern NFL . 
 = = = General criticism = = = 
 Culverhouse was criticized by other team owners as the team prepared for its debut season , who said that his involvement in day @-@ to @-@ day team operations was reminiscent of the owners of the expansion Falcons and Saints , teams which had yet to qualify for the playoffs after a decade of play . Buccaneer employees were described as living in an " atmosphere of fear " , especially after the firings during the 1977 offseason of executives who had been involved with unpopular decisions that Culverhouse had supported at the time . In one case , marketing director Bill Marcum was fired due to public backlash over the team 's $ 12 ticket prices for an exhibition in Jacksonville , even though Culverhouse had set the ticket prices , and Marcum had opposed them . 
 = = = Conflict of interest accusations = = = 
 Culverhouse was named one of the executors of Rosenbloom 's estate , and after Rosenbloom 's death , Culverhouse continued a business relationship with his widow , Georgia . Georgia 's marriage to composer Dominic Frontiere took place at Culverhouse 's home , with Culverhouse himself , a notary public , performing the ceremony . The relationship , in which Culverhouse served as an advisor to the Los Angeles Rams while maintaining ownership of the Buccaneers , was criticized as a conflict of interest . The Los Angeles Coliseum Council accused the Rams of seeking Culverhouse 's counsel when several players held out during the 1980 preseason ; the Buccaneers won a 10 – 9 victory over that same unprepared Rams team early that season . Culverhouse also oversaw a reorganization of the Rams ' front office ; the relationship earned him the nickname of " Godfather " of the Rams . Culverhouse and Frontiere were two of the owners named in a lawsuit brought by Al Davis , who alleged that their campaign contributions to Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia were an attempt to buy his support in helping to prevent Davis ' planned move of the Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles . 
 Culverhouse 's relationships with other NFL owners were occasionally , as in his relationship with the Rams , alleged to constitute conflicts of interest . His $ 3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example , as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws . On other occasions , he was criticized for his overly @-@ secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman , as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent . In particular , owners were upset about not being informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5 @-@ year extension of his contract . The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982 , even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract . 
 = = = Loss of popular support = = = 
 Culverhouse was described as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players , coaches , and fans . He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference , and for having the patience to allow John McKay to follow through with his building plan despite the franchise 's 0 – 26 start . This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players ' strike . A report issued by the National Football League Players Association prior to the start of negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth @-@ highest gross income of all NFL teams , while their average salary was only the 21st @-@ highest . This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980 , in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest @-@ paid teams . The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest @-@ paying team , based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income . Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike , when some of the team 's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened . 
 Culverhouse was considered to have drawn a closer friendship than an owner should to his coach , having guaranteed John McKay employment for life . When the team began to lose , area fans blamed McKay , and felt that there was no hope for any change . He was , however , credited with recognizing the need for a change in leadership , as he went outside of the organization in seeking a replacement when McKay retired . He then upset fans by broadcasting advertisements thanking fans for their support , while simultaneously raising ticket prices . \ 
 However , while Culverhouse 's relationship with Tampa had been problematic for years , the Bo Jackson 1986 draft debacle permanently ruined the owner 's reputation in his home city . Jackson , the Heisman Trophy @-@ winning running back from Auburn , was the consensus # 1 player headed into the draft . But Jackson disliked Culverhouse from their first meeting , later writing in his book " Bo Knows Bo " that the Bucs ' owner had a miserable record and also that after Jackson 's agents requested Tampa Bay not pick him , the Bucs refused all trade offers ( including what Jackson described as a generous offer from Al Davis ) and later told Jackson they would cut their contract offer in half if he didn 't accept a below @-@ market deal . Jackson announced he would play major league baseball instead , signing a contract with the Kansas City Royals and leaving the Bucs as the NFL 's laughingstock . 
 = = Doug Williams = = 
 Culverhouse 's treatment of quarterback Doug Williams caused resentment not only on the team , but in the entire Bay Area community . Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team , and was considered to be their single most important player . However , he was only paid $ 120 @,@ 000 a year , which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks , was less than what some teams ' third @-@ string quarterbacks made , and was lower than the salary of <unk> Middleton , a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay . After the 1982 season , Williams asked for a $ 600 @,@ 000 contract that would pay him among the league 's top quarterbacks . Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $ 400 @,@ 000 , which he said would make Williams one of the five highest @-@ paid quarterbacks in the league . Williams ' agent disputed this , saying that Culverhouse 's offer was substantially less than what several other quarterbacks made . With negotiations at a standstill , the Buccaneers traded the following season 's first @-@ round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson , a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson , as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign , or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery . Williams interpreted this as a sign that the team did not want him , and instead signed a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League . 
 His hard line with Williams created the perception that Culverhouse was more concerned with profits than with putting a winning team on the field . It aroused suspicions that Culverhouse 's main concern was the Buccaneers ' salary structure , and that this was related to the frequency with which the team traded away its first @-@ round draft choices . Williams ' comments that he would have been treated differently had he been white resonated with the Bay Area African American community , who saw the Buccaneers ' ensuing on @-@ field woes as retribution , boycotted Buccaneer games by the thousands , and commented that Culverhouse throws parties that cost more than what Williams was asking for . The Buccaneers missed Williams ' confidence and ability to make big plays at key times , and lost their first nine games in 1983 , when they had been expected to contend for the playoffs . They finished 2 – 14 , the first of what would be 14 consecutive losing seasons — the longest since the merger between the NFL and the All @-@ America Football Conference in 1950 — and would not have another winning season in Culverhouse 's lifetime . They would lose 10 or more games in 13 of those years , including 12 in a row from 1983 to 1994 — an NFL record . The timing of the situation coincided with the ascendance of the Tampa Bay Bandits , who led the USFL in attendance with a wide @-@ open , crowd @-@ pleasing offense led by local hero Steve Spurrier , while the Buccaneers were losing games with a conservative offense that fans found boring . Attendance having dropped sharply , Culverhouse then further alienated fans by berating them , accusing them of apathy . 
 = = = Attendance and television availability = = = 
 The long losing streak further penalized fans , as the NFL blackout policy usually prevented poorly attended Buccaneer home games from being shown on local television . No Buccaneer home games were televised on local stations for several years following November 29 , 1982 , including a game on January 1 , 1983 that sold out , but not in time to lift the blackout . In total , the Buccaneers had a streak of 32 consecutive blackouts before a November 9 , 1986 game against the then @-@ reigning Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears sold out in time to allow for local television . At one point , the CBS television network , which had the rights to NFC television broadcasts , correctly anticipated poor seasons from all of the Southern ( Buccaneers , Falcons , and Saints ) teams , and reorganized their viewing markets in such a way that Buccaneers games were not broadcast anywhere in the state of Florida . Culverhouse went so far as to dictate that Miami Dolphins games also be blacked out , sometimes even when Buccaneer games were sellouts . He further inflamed fans in 1989 by proposing to move some of the team 's games to Orlando , due to poor attendance . Several local radio stations responded with billboards saying " Hugh gotta go ! " , and with a picture of a screw next to Culverhouse 's name . The Tampa Chamber of Commerce countered with a billboard thanking Culverhouse for bringing Super Bowl XXV to Tampa . 
 = = = Profitability = = = 
 Although enjoyment factored into Culverhouse 's purchase of the Buccaneers , it was first and foremost a business decision which he expected to be profitable . He admitted to being known for his frugality , due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing , and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on projection screens . This was not initially a problem for the franchise , even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game ; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals , even those involving a great amount of money . Later , however , the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and / or demanded more money , including Dave Pear , Doug Williams , Ricky Reynolds , Reggie Cobb , Mark Carrier , and Jeris White . First @-@ round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value , as when the team traded for often @-@ injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination . Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay . He also fired well @-@ regarded personnel director Ken <unk> , when <unk> demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league . 
 Despite the losing and the poor attendance , the Buccaneers were one of the NFL 's most profitable teams for most of Culverhouse 's ownership . In 1989 , only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5 – 11 Buccaneers , who profited $ 6 @.@ 3 million with the league 's second @-@ lowest payroll , while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $ 16 @.@ 2 million . The team attributed their low salaries to the players ' youth , stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players , who drew lower salaries than veterans . This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team , although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners , while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest @-@ paid NFL head coaches . He also offered Bill Parcells $ 6 @.@ 5 million to coach the team , offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five @-@ year , $ 7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie , paid Keith <unk> an NFL @-@ record $ 2 @.@ 5 million signing bonus , and paid Steve Young $ 6 million in salary , plus another $ 1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract .

 Culverhouse was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992 . After a successful operation to remove a tumor and part of his lung , he began chemotherapy a few months later , when a routine exam revealed a recurrence of the cancer . Despite his health problems , he remained a hard worker until the end , and even went hunting in Tanzania only four days after having part of his lung removed . An experimental procedure failed to stop the cancer , and he died on August 25 , 1994 , at the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans . He was survived by wife Joy , daughter Gay , and son Hugh , Jr . 
 = = = Sale of the Buccaneers = = = 
 Several investors stepped forward with offers to buy the Buccaneers after Culverhouse 's death , including Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos , New York Yankees owner ( and Tampa resident ) George Steinbrenner , and Massachusetts developer Socrates <unk> . In response to the ensuing publicity , the trust administering Culverhouse 's estate then issued a statement that the team was not for sale . They reversed their position two months later , as a poor early @-@ season record led to declining fan support and revenues . The decision to sell the franchise came on the same day that Joy filed a $ 25 million claim against Hugh 's estate . Hugh had paid $ 16 million for the franchise , which was now valued at $ 142 million . With Barnett Bank filing claims for $ 20 @.@ 8 million against the Culverhouse estate , the trustees came very close to accepting Angelos ' $ 200 million offer , which would have involved relocating the team to Baltimore , Maryland . Fearful of losing the team , civic leaders presented a proposal guaranteeing ticket sales of at least 55 @,@ 000 for all home games for the next two years . The team was eventually sold to Palm Beach , Florida businessman Malcolm Glazer for $ 192 million , at that moment the largest price ever paid for a professional sports franchise . 
 = = = Lawsuits over the Culverhouse estate = = = 
 Before Culverhouse 's death , his wife , Joy , had signed a post @-@ nuptial agreement to surrender her half of the estate . This was done on the advice of lawyer Fred F. Cone , Jr . , who would later become one of the three trustees handling the Culverhouse estate . Joy charged that the trustees were mishandling the estate , and not paying her share . She filed a malpractice suit against Cone for advising her to give up her marital rights , and a second suit asking for accounting of the estate and removal of the trustees . She said that Hugh and Cone advised her to sign the agreement for tax reasons , and falsely claimed that Culverhouse was on the brink of bankruptcy . She charged that the three trustees , Cone , Jack Donlan , and Stephen F. Story , paid themselves $ 4 @.@ 35 million in bonuses for arranging the Buccaneers ' sale , sums far in excess of what Culverhouse himself had specified , and that they paid Story a sum that was comparable to the salary of a Fortune 500 executive for managing the estate and included a 10 @-@ year golden parachute clause . She also alleged that the value of Culverhouse 's estate had been misrepresented to her at the time that she signed the agreement . The lawsuits made the details of the Culverhouse estate public . When it was discovered that the trust had paid hush money to a mistress of Hugh 's , Joy 's lawyer alleged that Hugh had planned to divorce Joy , and that the trust was created to deprive her of her rightful assets . Court depositions revealed three extramarital affairs , including Susan Brinkley , wife of broadcaster David Brinkley . The suits were eventually settled , with each of the three trustees being paid $ 3 million to remove themselves from the handling of his estate , and Joy being allowed to appoint her own trustees . Joy then said of Hugh , " I 'd like to pull him out of the grave and shoot him with every bullet I could get " .

 In contrast with his frugal ways in business , Culverhouse frequently contributed to the community . Some of his notable donations include : 
 A $ 4 @.@ 6 million gift to the University of South Florida , which established the Culverhouse Chair in Education at the University of South Florida Sarasota @-@ Manatee and was the largest donation in school history ;

 Culverhouse was also a member of the board of trustees who administered the annual Florida Prize award for outstanding work in the visual or performing arts . 
 = Palm Island , Queensland = 
 Palm Island is an Aboriginal community located on Great Palm Island , also called by the Aboriginal name " Bwgcolman " , an island on the Great Barrier Reef in North Queensland , Australia The settlement is also known by a variety of other names including " the Mission " , Palm Island Settlement or Palm Community . 
 Palm Island is often termed a classic " tropical paradise " given its natural endowments , but it has had a troubled history since the European settlement of Australia . For much of the twentieth century it was used by the Queensland Government as a settlement for Aboriginals considered guilty of such infractions as being " disruptive " , being pregnant to a white man or being born with " mixed blood " . 
 The community created by this history has been beset by many problems and has often been the discussion point of political and social commentators . Of significant sociological concern is a lack of jobs and housing . Since its creation as an Aboriginal reserve , Palm Island has been considered synonymous with Indigenous disadvantage and violence . At the same time it has been at the forefront of political activism which has sought to improve the conditions and treatment of Australia 's Indigenous peoples as well as redress injustices visited on them broadly as a race and on Palm Island specifically . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ settlement = = = 
 In Manbarra folklore the Palm Island group were formed in the Dreamtime from the broken up fragments of an ancestral spirit , Rainbow Serpent . 
 The island was named by explorer James Cook in 1770 as he sailed up the eastern coast of Australia on his first voyage . It is estimated that the population of the island at the time of Cook 's visit was about 200 Manbarra people . Cook sent some of his men to Palm Island and ' they returned on board having met with nothing worth <unk> 
 From the 1850s locals were recruitment targets to leave the island to be involved with bêche @-@ de @-@ mer and pearling enterprises with Europeans and Japanese . 
 By the end of the 19th century the population had been reduced to about 50 . In 1909 the Chief Protector of Aborigines visited the Island , apparently to check on the activities of Japanese pearling crews in the area , and reported the existence of a small camp of Aborigines . 
 In 1916 Queensland 's Chief Protector of Aborigines found Palm Island to be ' the ideal place for a delightful holiday ' and that its remoteness also made it suitable for use as a penitentiary ' for ' individuals we desire to punish ' . 
 = = = ' Penal settlement ' 1920s – 60s = = = 
 In 1914 the Government established an Aboriginal settlement on the Hull River near Mission Beach on the Australian mainland . On 10 March 1918 , the structures were destroyed by a cyclone and were never rebuilt . Subsequently , the settlement relocated to Palm Island with the new population referred to as the Bwgcolman people . In the first two decades of its establishment the population of Indigenous inmates increased from 200 to 1 @,@ 630 . People from at least 57 different language speaking regions throughout Queensland were relocated to Palm . 
 By the early 1920s Palm Island had become the largest of the Government Aboriginal settlements . Administrators found its location attractive as Aboriginal people could be isolated , but Palm Island quickly gained a reputation amongst Aborigines as a penal settlement . They were removed from across Queensland as punishment ; being " disruptive " , falling pregnant to a white man or being born with " mixed blood " were included in infringements which could lead to the penalty of being sent to Palm Island . New arrivals came after being sentenced by a court , or released from prison , or were sent by administrators of other missions wishing to weed out their more ill @-@ mannered or disruptive Aboriginals . These removals to the Palm Island Mission continued until the late 1960s . 
 On arrival , children were separated from their parents and then segregated by gender . Aborigines were forbidden to speak their language and from going into " white " zones . Every day activity was highly controlled by administrators including nightly curfews and the vetting of mail . 
 In the 1930s a local doctor highlighted malnutrition on the island , and demanded that the Government triple rations for the islanders and that children be provided with fruit juice , but the request was denied . 
 A bell tower was built to dictate the running of the mission . It would ring each morning at eight ; a signal for everyone to line up for parade in the mission square . Those who failed to line up had their food allocation cut . At nine each evening the bell would ring again signalling the shutting down of the island 's electricity . The bell tower still stands in the local square to this day , a relic of Palm 's history . It was recorded at the time that there was almost military @-@ like discipline in the segregation between white and black , and that inmates " were treated as rather dull retarded children " . 
 In 1927 a hospital was built at nearby Fantome Island ; Aborigines were sent there mainly for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases . In 1936 Fantome Island became a medical clearing station where people sent to Palm Island were examined and treated if necessary . A leprosarium was established on Fantome in 1939 . After World War II the hospital was closed , and by 1965 only the leprosarium remained on Fantome , it was administered by a Roman Catholic nursing order until 1973 when the inhabitants were moved to Palm Island . 
 The administrators had complete and unaccountable control over the lives of residents , punishments included the shaving of the girls ' heads . On a surprise inspection of the Palm Island Prison during an official visit in the late 1960s , Senator Jim <unk> and academic Henry Reynolds discovered two 12- to 13 ‑ year ‑ old schoolgirls incarcerated in the settlement 's prison by the senior administrator on the island ( the superintendent ) , because " they swore at the teacher " . 
 The following letter was written to a new bride by the ' Protector ' ; 
 " Dear Lucy , Your letter gave me quite a shock , fancy you wanting to draw four pounds to buy a brooch , ring , bangle , work basket , tea set , etc , etc . I am quite sure Mrs. Henry would expend the money carefully for you , but I must tell you that no Aborigine can draw 4 / 5 of their wages unless they are sick and in hospital and require the money to buy comforts ... However , as it is Christmas I will let you have 1 / 5 / – out of your banking account to buy <unk> with . "

 On 26 October 1986 ownership of the island was transferred to a newly formed Palm Island Community Council under a Deed of Grant in Trust from the Queensland government . 
 Self @-@ appointed " president " of Palm Island , Jeremy Geia , symbolically declared independence from Australia in 2001 . The " Peoples Democratic Republic of Palm Island " was an expression of grievances against the Australian and Queensland Governments for neglect of Palm Islanders . There were concerns at the time that this activism would interfere in a major Government investigation into sexual abuse by making victims too uncomfortable to come to the mainland for examination . 
 In 2001 The Palm Island State Emergency Services Cadet Group was formed . 
 The Palm Island Community Council became the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council in 2004 under the Queensland Local Government ( Community Government Areas ) Act . Like the other Aboriginal Shire Councils that were created , this Act gave the Council full status as a Local Government on a par with other Councils in Queensland .

During the trial the Crown Prosecutor was directed by the trial judge to drop the charges , stating that the shooting was justified . 
 = = = World War 2 use as a Catalina airbase = = = 
 In July 1943 the US Navy built a Naval Air Station at Palm Island , with facilities to operate and overhaul Catalina flying boats and patrol boats . The air station was built at Wallaby point , an isolated area of Palm Island , overlooking a large stretch of sheltered water in Challenger Bay , which was ideal for flying boat operations . The station was built by two officers and 122 enlisted men of Company C of the 55th Naval Construction Battalion ( Seabee ) that arrived 6 July 1943 , and a similar detachment that left Brisbane later with 1 @,@ 500 tons of construction material . 
 A 1 @,@ 000 man camp was constructed at the point . Concrete flying boat ramps to the ocean were built with a tarmac parking area for up to 12 flying boats . <unk> for 18 flying boats were provided in Challenger Bay , and 3 nose hangars were also built . Coral aggregate from coral reefs at low tide was used to manufacture concrete . 
 A series of fuel tanks were constructed to hold 60 @,@ 000 barrels of aviation fuel . Steel rail lines were installed to launch the PBY Catalinas back into the water . 
 By September 1943 the majority of the facilities were finished , and large numbers of operational and maintenance personnel began to arrive to commission the station . The Palm Island US Naval Air Station was fully operational from 25 October 1943 , and could repair an average of four aircraft per day . The last personnel of the 55th Seabees left Palm Island on 8 November 1943 .

The squadron comprised 13 PBY @-@ 5 Catalinas , 46 officers and 99 enlisted men . They carried out training and routine flights between Port Moresby , Samarai and Brisbane . They were assigned to Fleet Air Wing 17 while at Palm Island , and left in February 1944 . 
 The Naval Air Station closed in May 1944 . On 18 June 1944 one hundred seventy seven men and four officers of Company B , 91st Naval Construction Battalion ( Seabee ) , arrived from Milne Bay to dismantle station 's buildings and facilities , <unk> and <unk> over 5 @,@ 000 tons of materials and equipment and loading it aboard ship before departing 31 August 1944 and their return to Brisbane .

 = = = 1957 Strike = = = 
 All Islanders were required to work 30 hours each week , and up until the 1960s no wages were paid for this work . The catalyst for the strike was the attempted deportation of Indigenous inmate Albie Geia who committed the offence of disobeying the European overseer . The strike continued for five days and was broken with dawn raids to remove the families involved by boat to the mainland . 
 Seven families were banished from the Palm Island in 1957 for taking part in a strike organised to protest against the Dickensian working conditions imposed by the Queensland Government under the reserve system . Athlete Cathy Freeman 's mother , Cecilia Barber , and the family of strike ringleader Frederick William Doolan including Billy Doolan <unk> were among those banished from the island . 
 In a 2007 commemorative ceremony the Queensland Government apologised to the surviving wives of two of the strikers for the actions of the Government in the 1950s . 
 = = = Wilson 's <unk> analysis = = = 
 In 1985 then Associate Professor of Sociology Paul Wilson published a <unk> analysis of criminal statistics averaged over the period of January 1977 to May 1984 . 
 Wilson considered the Palm Island rates to be a gross underestimate , as the figures provided by the Legal Aid Office only counted cases that went to court , whereas the Queensland rates , provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics , were based on reported incidents . 
 The Palm Island figures demonstrated that 86 % of violence involved the offender exhibiting heavy drinking patterns and in most cases the victim was also drinking . 38 % of incidents involved people who were married or in a de facto relationship , and , of those , 90 % of the offenders were male . 
 Wilson attributed the extreme crime rates to historical , social , economic , housing and educational factors , and an " alcohol culture " that perceived not drinking to be antisocial . Further contributing factors were the employment circumstances of Palm Island and the destruction of society and traditional culture and structures . He cited research rejecting an Aboriginal propensity for violence and contrasted the <unk> community where no homicides had been recorded in the period from the 1950s . 
 At the time alcohol was limited to beer sold in the canteen between the hours of 5 pm and 9 pm . Spirits were banned , however there was a flourishing sly @-@ grog trade .

 A burial site and headstone is located in the " Mission " area of Palm Island .

He was toured along with eight other <unk> , three of whom were from Hinchinbrook Island and five from Palm . 
 In 1884 Kukamunburra died at 21 years old of pneumonia in Cleveland , United States of America . The rest of the circus group carried on to the European leg of the tour ; by the end of 1885 only three of the <unk> were still alive . 
 Kukamunburra 's body was embalmed ; 109 years later , in 1993 , the body was discovered in a local funeral parlour . His remains were returned to his homeland and buried on Palm Island in February 1994 . 
 = = = Palm Island Vision Plan = = = 
 In December 1997 Queensland Health and the Palm Island Council initiated the Palm Island Public Mental Health Project aimed at overcoming serious social problems , particularly the suicide rate . 
 This Project led to the May 1998 community development of a planning document , Palm Island Vision Plan . The planning document contained a series of visions and objectives as well as the nominated action group responsible for <unk> each of them . 
 Objectives included strategies to address a broad range of issues such as ; significantly ' <unk> ' the local hospital within ten years , establishing a whole @-@ of @-@ government forum , economic development strategy and a program to combat youth suicide . 
 The Queensland Health initiative gained momentum and support throughout 1998 and 1999 implementing a consultative process and it was met with optimism from a cross section of the community . Unfortunately the project did not gain full support from other Departments and had objectives and timeframes which were in retrospect seen as unrealistically ambitious . The project failed to secure funding for training for the community ‘ facilitators ’ and key people were forced to withdraw . The project became unsustainable by the end of 1999 due to ad hoc funding and high demand on human resources . 
 A subsequent Federal ( Dillon ) report alleged that Queensland Health employees appeared to question the program 's worth and began to undermine it . In response to a perception of this undermining , community leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Vision Plan and requested the Department to instruct their Palm Island employees to ‘ cease denigrating it ’ in November 1999 . By February 2000 Queensland Health withdrew from the project . 
 The Dillon Report acknowledged that both the community and Queensland Health had invested a considerable amount into this project to provide developmental support to residents . However it observed that the project was overly ambitious and the strain this placed on staff and resources meant that it was not likely to succeed . Particularly where the projects objectives came into conflict with government bureaucracy which presented conflicts for Queensland Health .

 In 1999 the Queensland Government apologised and gave $ 7 @,@ 000 compensation each to former Indigenous Palm Islander employees in recompense for underpaid wages between 1975 and 1986 .

 = = = Guinness Book of Records controversy = = = 
 The 1999 edition of the Guinness Book of Records brought international attention to Palm Island when it named the island the most violent place on earth outside a combat zone . To support this claim it stated statistics such as a murder rate 15 times higher than that of the entire state of Queensland , a life expectancy of 40 years , the highest rate of youth suicide per capita in the world , and a total of 40 suicide fatalities over a period of only five years . 
 The Australian newspaper hypothesised that the Guinness Book of Records statement was based on an article in a London newspaper . The article from The Sunday Times stated that Palm Island had one of the highest crime rates in the world and that " boys ride bareback on horses through the near @-@ derelict civic centre as infants ambush passing cars with slingshots . " It referred to violence statistics and stated that " the white overseers " left the island in 1985 removing most of the island 's assets and resources , only allowing a pub to remain . The Sunday Times claimed that up to 30 people live in each house , without sufficient drinking water . 
 The Guinness Book of Records figures were strongly disputed at the time by the Queensland Government , the Police Commissioner and the Palm Island Community Council . However , it was conceded by the Queensland Aboriginal Policy Minister , Judy Spence , that Palm Island " can be violent at times " , particularly for women and children , but that the situation was being improved .

 Zen Pearls Pty Ltd and Indian Pacific Pearls Pty Ltd ( both controlled by Michael Crimp ) established pearl farms in 1998 with the permission of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority ( which controls the sea waters around the islands ) , despite the opposition of , at least some , of the people of Palm Island . On 24 September 1998 the Manbarra elders passed a resolution opposing the farms on the basis of ; 
 " the historical and cultural significance of the Juno Bay site for both the Manbarra and Bwgcolman Peoples , the sense of trespass on traditional ownership rights , concerns that the cultural connection to the area would slip away and a strong feeling that the provision of a small number of employment opportunities offered by the pearling operations would not adequately compensate the damage to cultural values . " 
 Subsequently the Park Authority refused to extend the pearl farming permits and Crimp took action before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have this decision reversed . On 15 March 2004 the Tribunal agreed that the permits should be terminated but allowed the existing pearling operations to continue to 1 December 2005 . This decision was substantially upheld by the Federal Court on 21 October 2004 . 
 = = = 2004 death in custody controversy and riot = = = 
 Australian Aboriginal Palm Island resident , Mulrunji ( known as Cameron Doomadgee while alive ) , aged 36 , died in November 2004 in a police cell on Palm Island , one hour after being picked up for allegedly causing a public nuisance . The family of the deceased were informed by the Coroner that the death was the result of " an intra @-@ abdominal haemorrhage caused by a ruptured liver and portal vein " . 
 A week after the death the results of the autopsy report were read to a public meeting by then Palm Island Council Chairwoman Erykah Kyle . A succession of angry young Aboriginal men subsequently spoke to the crowd and encouraged immediate action be taken against the police . Mulrunji 's death was repeatedly branded " cold @-@ blooded murder " , and a riot erupted . The local courthouse , police station and police barracks were burned down and 18 local police and their families were forced to withdraw and barricade themselves in the hospital . Later the same day approximately 80 police from Townsville and Cairns were flown to Palm to restore order . 
 In April 2005 , in response to the riot , Premier Beattie established the Palm Island Select Committee to investigate issues leading to the riot and other problems . Their report was tabled on 25 August 2005 , detailing 65 recommendations which seek to reduce violence and overcrowding , and improve standards of education and health . In achieving these objectives , issues such as drug and alcohol abuse and unemployment would also be addressed . 
 In late September 2006 , coroner Christine Clements found that Doomadgee was killed as a result of punches by the Senior Sergeant arresting officer . Despite the finding of the coroner , Leanne Clare , the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) , announced on 14 December 2006 that no charges would be laid . After media and public pressure , the Queensland Attorney @-@ General appointed former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales , Sir Laurence Street to review the decision . The Street Review resulted in the overturning of the DPP 's decision , with a finding that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute for manslaughter . A high profile trial in the Townsville Supreme Court ensued . In June 2007 the jury found the Senior Sergeant not guilty of manslaughter and assault charges . On 24 October 2008 , a jury found Lex Wotton , a two @-@ time councillor on the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council , guilty of inciting the 2004 riot that resulted in the destruction of the island 's police station , the courthouse , and an officer 's residence . Wotton then was sentenced to seven years in prison , reduced to six years for time already served . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Local government on the island is provided by the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council , created under the Local Government ( Community Government Areas ) Act ( 2004 ) . Previously , Palm Island was a community council without the same powers as other Queensland Shire Councils . It was constituted under the authority of the Queensland Community Services ( Aborigines ) Act 1984 as the Palm Island Aboriginal Council and had a Deed of Grant in Trust ( DOGIT ) for ten islands in the Palm Island Group . 
 The Current civic Cabinet consists of the Mayor , Deputy Mayor and three Councilors : 
 Mayor : Alfred Lacey ( Administration & Finance , Alcohol Management , Youth Affairs , Health , Government Coordination & Community Engagement ) 
 Deputy Mayor : Raymond Sibley ( Education , Land , Sea & Environment , Housing ) 
 CEO : Ross Norman 
 Councilors ( undivided council without divisions ) : 
 Ruth Gorringe ( Commerce & Economic Development , Education , Employment & Training , Health ) 
 Zina Prior ( Commerce & Economic Development , Sports & Recreation , Land , Sea & Environment , Housing ) 
 Mick Thaiday ( Community Justice , Cultural Heritage Events & Planning , Emergency Services , Planning & Infrastructure ) 
 The structure of the Aboriginal Shire Council ( or Community Council as it was previously ) has been criticised for the following reasons : 
 Comparatively broad responsibility : it holds responsibility for policy portfolios which go far beyond what is expected of other Local Government Authorities , such as being the trustee of the DOGIT land , the provision of housing infrastructure , previously the running of the canteen and currently the running of the general store , law and justice , health , maintenance of culture and language , etc . The Council is designed under the model of a mainstream Local Government Authority which structurally does not provide the latitude to address those functions which are not normally expected of mainstream Councils . 
 Culturally inappropriate decision making : The Organisation is not designed to deal with cultural issues or complex social problems ; the normal Indigenous decision @-@ making processes and protocols such as consultation and input from family groupings are not structurally accommodated . 
 <unk> local expectations : It is of concern that even greater expectations are put on the Community Council by their own constituents . The Council is seen to have responsibility for all the community 's needs and issues , ignoring the legislative limitations of the Council , the complexity of issues impacting on the community , the impact of past and present governments ' policies and the skill level of respective Councillors . This leads to Palm Island Councillors having far higher expectations put on them than mainstream Councillors and deflects responsibility away from Government Agencies , which could lead to Councillors considering that their role was a do ' what @-@ ever ' was required to meet the diverse needs of residents . 
 Red tape : The Council is overburdened with accountability and reporting requirements which detract from the role of consulting with constituents over their needs and aspirations and strategies to address them . 
 Final transition to full Shire Council status was completed in January 2007 . The Shire 's core business is the provision of housing . It recently conducted an audit of its houses and the people living in them ; the audit found that 120 new homes were needed , however the Council primarily relies on income from rent and Government subsidies and can only afford to build one or two new houses a year . The Council has jurisdiction over the islands of the Palm Island Group other than Orpheus and Pelorus Islands . 
 Palm Island falls in the federal Division of Herbert and the Electoral district of Townsville . Peter Lindsay ( Liberal Party of Australia ) is the Federal Member and Mike Reynolds ( Australian Labor Party ) is the State Member . 
 Peter Lindsay has claimed that Palm Island is a hopelessly dysfunctional community and that either the Island economy / landholdings should be mainstreamed or the Indigenous population should be relocated to the mainland . The Palm Island Council and Mike Reynolds reacted with outrage calling the idea racist and lacking cultural competency , the Queensland Government has ruled out forced relocation . 
 = = Economy = = 
 There is no freehold land title on Palm Island , with property owned by either the Local or State Government . More than 90 % of the adult population is unemployed . There is no industry on the island despite rich natural resources such as crayfish worth $ 150 each and enormous tourism potential . 
 Carpentaria Land Council chief executive Brad Foster in 2004 summarised their economic standing thus ; " This island has 4000 residents , and the services applicable to a community with 500 people . That has to change and businesses have to be able to invest here , make profits , employ and train locals – get part of the real world . " 
 Cost of living is relatively very high on Palm Island due to the remoteness of island living and the general lack of private enterprise . At the island store bread costs approximately $ 4 @.@ 20 a loaf , about twice the average in Australia . Goods in general , particularly essential food items , cost considerably more than similar products in mainstream Queensland , sometimes two to three times higher . The cost of living issue is exacerbated by economic loss to alcohol , drug dependence and gambling , and the fact that crops and livestock are not cultivated locally on the island . 
 Around the island there are failed or abandoned ventures , the relics of which are still there ; a piggery , chicken farm , disused stockyards , market garden and a joinery works . 
 A presently abandoned oyster farm is an example of one of the failed ventures on Palm Island . The natural environment of Palm Island and adjacent Halifax Bay is ideal for the aquaculture of oysters , shrimp , prawns and mackerel . Over a five @-@ year period in the 1970s Applied Ecology Pty Ltd ( an organisation designed to assist Aboriginal communities to develop sustainable industries , funded by the Government ) established an oyster lease on Palm Island . At one point the lease had $ 600 @,@ 000 worth of oysters . Unfortunately due to alleged poor management and lack of interest among the community the oyster lease fell into disrepair . The farm is purported to have cost $ 20 million . 
 Research by the Centre for Tropical Urban and Regional Planning at James Cook University has concluded that Palm Island has most of the resources it needs to be largely self @-@ sufficient through housing , agriculture and tourism . However Barry Moyle the Chief Executive Officer of the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council and former Mayor of Johnstone Shire Council suggests that the tourism potential of the island is hindered by the negative reputation that Palm Island is considered to have . Moyle asserts that once potential tourists get past that negative image " they will find really nice and beautiful people , with a rich culture , living on this untouched tropical gem of North Queensland " . Further , according to Moyle , " it could be considered a big ask that people will get past the perception that the people are all no @-@ <unk> alcoholics and perpetrators of domestic violence , which is considered to be the general reputation that Palm Islanders have in broader Australia . Locals say that there are bad eggs , but that is the same in all communities . " 
 = = = Land title = = = 
 Native Title claims do not apply to most residents as they are not the original inhabitants of the land , the general community ( Bwgcolman people ) do have a strong historical connection to the land , most having been born there . Having historical ( as opposed to traditional ) rights recognised is a legally grey area . Free hold title does not apply either ; most land is controlled by the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council . The land is held by the Council for the benefit of the community in trust , through a " Deed of Grant in Trust " ( DOGIT ) . This in practice means that , for example , a third party would not be able to lease and develop land on Palm Island without the permission of the community and even then leases are limited to 30 years . 
 A basic three bedroom house costs approximately $ 350 @,@ 000 to $ 400 @,@ 000 to build on Palm Island ( not including sewerage , power , phone and water , and the cost of the land ) . Federal Minister Mal Brough has stated that building prices on Palm ( or in indigenous communities in general ) are over inflated and that it could be done for half the cost . All homes are on crown land and are owned by the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council and are rented at a Government @-@ subsidised rate of $ 44 to $ 60 a week to residents . There are 320 rental houses under this arrangement . 
 Most businesses are owned by the Council and land title restrictions hinder private investment ; approval to build a house or start a business can take up to three years . 
 There is widespread frustration with the land title system . <unk> home ownership and the creation of a market economy with long term leases is seen by some commentators as the best option to move forward on Palm . This proposal is described as giving Indigenous people " skin in the game " and empowerment . In the period 1999 to 2007 35 houses were replaced due to damage . Noel Pearson of the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership argues that housing degradation in these communities has more to do with overcrowding and poor construction than it does with poor tenancy . However he adds that Aboriginal people naturally take much better care of property that they have constructed or paid for themselves , than they do that which has been handed to them ' on a plate ' and which they have had little personal engagement in . The push for privatisation of title was led by the Australian Government ( through Mal Brough , Indigenous Affairs Minister ) , Noel Pearson , and some families on the island ( the community is very divided on this issue ) . The proposal had partial ( or cautious ) support from the then Federal Australian Labor Party Opposition . 
 However other Islanders are suspicious of these moves as an opportunity for the more powerful families to gain more power through land ownership or even worse a way of taking land off the Palm Islanders , who in desperation may sell to the highest bidding developer even if that bid significantly <unk> the land in question . Professor Mick Dodson , director of the Centre for Indigenous Studies at the ANU , argues that the people on Palm Island do not have the financial capacity to compete in the housing market on a commercial basis : He asserts that the only solution to the problem of overcrowding lies in increasing the level of public housing , there are not the jobs to build capacity among locals to become home owners . 
 There is an alternative option under the push for privatising landholdings which addresses fears of the land being lost from the community : a closed market system where caveats restricting ownership to members of the community are placed on 99 @-@ year leases . This would mean that land could be bought and sold but only between Palm Islanders . It is unclear whether this arrangement would allow for mortgages as the banks who give the loans are outside the community and would require security for their loan that they can legally collect . 
 Traditional ownership of the Manbarra people complicates debate about Palm Island land title . There is no registered Native Title claim and only seven traditional owners still live on the island , however there could be a valid claim . Professor Dodson argues that the historical international experience is that once communal title is extinguished then the indigenous people lose the land permanently . Minister Brough argues that 100 @-@ year leases will not extinguish Native Title over the land . 
 The Queensland Government , which has constitutional responsibility for land tenure , holds the position that this issue is extremely complex and that it will not be bullied by the Commonwealth . The former state Minister for Indigenous Affairs , Warren Pitt , in 2007 said that all parties have matured since Native Title was introduced and can recognise that while the issues are complex , the betterment of Aboriginal people can be realised . 
 = = Law and order = = 
 Palm Island has an extreme level of theft , domestic violence , sexual assaults against children and abject drunkenness . This behaviour is attributed locally to boredom , aimlessness , lack of education , absence of role models and a complete loss of self @-@ worth . Another important factor is bitter family divisions which rule the social fabric of the island and a complex web of historical disputes between those families , some going back decades . Criminologist Dr Paul Wilson found Palm Island to have one of the highest rates of violent crime in the world . He suggested that the problems could be tied to repression of the past and colonial practices . In the December 2004 to December 2005 period there were 76 admissions to the hospital for assault involving residents , 26 times the standard Queensland rate . 
 These figures do not necessarily reflect the war @-@ like violence that is commonly associated with Palm Island . St Michael 's Catholic School Principal , Lil <unk> , has stated that people visiting or living on the Island just need to take sensible precautions such as not walking alone at night , similar to precautions that people should exercise in most places . 
 The most successful program implemented to reduce the high levels of crime is the Palm Island Community Justice Group . The Justice Group has existed since 1992 ; it is a committee of elders on the island who , it is said , have far more influence over young offenders on the island than the police or courts . The Justice group has a statutory role within the judicial system in administering justice on the island . The group is funded by the Queensland Government to administer the program , created in response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody , with the aim of keeping indigenous children on Palm out of the criminal justice system . Under the program , the Palm Island community is encouraged to devise their own systems for dealing with offenders . In the three years after the Community Justice Group was established , Palm Island juveniles appearing before magistrates courts fell by a third . Police and the courts often refer offenders to the Community Justice Group . 
 " These older ones have the wisdom and knowledge , and they can sit around the table and talk , and bring feuding parties together . .. When they come before us they can 't bluff us , because it 's black on black . " <unk> Geia , Chairwoman of the Community Justice Group , 2001 
 In December 2001 , the Community Justice Group assisted a five @-@ day investigation by a team of Queensland police and Department of Families officers . The investigation discreetly collected information from islanders about suspected child sexual abuse in the community , resulting in a number of arrests . The investigation was accompanied by a series of allegations suggesting that almost 100 % of girls between 13 and 16 years old had contracted sexually transmitted diseases . It was also alleged that girls as young as 12 had been trading sex for cigarettes and alcohol and that children as young as five were being molested . 
 There are various other local programs which have assisted with lowering the crime rate of Palm Island : The Men 's Group , coordinated by former Mayor Robert Blackley , runs a prison cell visitors program , a support service , and a children 's night patrol . In 2000 , the Palm Island Council used a $ 40 @,@ 000 state government grant to establish a community @-@ run re @-@ orientation program for youths to help reduce youth crime and suicide , by relocating wayward youths to a new youth and cultural camp where they would be taught their culture , language and art on neighbouring Fantome Island , a former leprosarium . The Coolgaree nippers club is the first indigenous club in Surf Lifesaving Queensland ; Coolgaree is affiliated to Arcadian surf lifesaving club in the first year of the nippers club operating ( 1999 ) juvenile crime rates on Palm Island dropped from 186 offences to 99 . 
 Tony Fitzgerald QC investigated alcohol abuse in indigenous communities and was shocked by the extent of the statewide problem . He recommended to the Queensland government that unless things improved dramatically within a period of three years , that alcohol should be banned in consultation with the communities . Like other community councils ( in 2001 ) , the Palm Island Community Council relied on revenue generated by alcohol sales at the hotel ; the investigation report recommended this perceived conflict of interest end . 
 The Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Policy commissioned a further report in 2005 and , as a result of its recommendations , the islands in the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council became the 19th Queensland community to become a restricted area for possession of alcohol from 19 June 2006 . These restrictions include a limit of one carton of beer disembarking from the ferry service . The alternative source of alcohol is the Palm Island Hotel / canteen , for either on @-@ site consumption or on a retail basis . Alcohol sales from the canteen are again restricted to one carton per person , or per vehicle . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 At the 2006 census Palm Island had 1 @,@ 984 residents , 93 @.@ 4 % of whom are of indigenous origin . However , there are various conflicting estimates of the population size ; 3 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 500 residents is a figure which has been regularly quoted by local , state and federal politicians . There is controversy over the common practice of referring to Palm Island as the largest Indigenous community in Australia , with census figures from 2001 and 2006 showing the <unk> community as slightly larger . 
 The indigenous population generally identify with either the Bwgcolman ( historical connection with Palm Island ) or Manbarra ( traditional connection ) people . Compared with other parts of Australia , the Palm Island community is young with 35 @.@ 6 % under 15 and only 6 @.@ 4 % over 55 . Only 5 @.@ 1 % of the population describe themselves as being non @-@ religious compared with 18 @.@ 7 % of Australians , 42 @.@ 6 % are Catholic ( 25 @.@ 8 % Australia wide ) , 23 @.@ 2 % Anglican and 11 @.@ 2 % being other Protestant . 
 The community , consisting of approximately 42 mainland and Torres Strait Islander clan or family groups , suffers from chronic alcohol , drug and domestic abuse , has an unemployment rate of 90 % and an average life expectancy of 50 years , thirty less than the Australian average . 
 The 2006 census was conducted on 8 August ; unlike mainstream Australia , Palm Island figures were not be based on forms filled out by each household on census evening . Instead Palm Island was singled out for the population to be verbally interviewed individually over a ten @-@ day period due to past controversy about the accuracy of census details for Palm Island . Between ten and fifteen Indigenous census interviewers took the households ' details from one adult from each house , interviews took between an hour and an hour and a half each and were conducted during business hours . 
 = = Culture and sport = = 
 Many residents consider that the introduction of Western culture and the subsequent Mission policies of prohibiting the expression of traditional cultural has seriously eroded the cultural base of Palm Island . Many of the contemporary issues of substance abuse , law and order problems and the high suicide rate have been attributed in part to this absence of culture . 
 Amongst sporting activities on Palm Island boxing features prominently ( both men 's and women 's ) in 2006 11 young Palm Islanders represented Queensland at national boxing championships for the first time . The Barracudas are the local rugby league team , with Vern Daisy as a notable ex @-@ player . In June 2005 the inaugural 3 on 3 Basketball competition was held , attracting over 300 locals . 
 Many of the sporting activities are actively supported by or managed through the Queensland Police Citizens Youth Welfare Association facility ; the Palm Island Community and Youth Centre ( PICYC ) . The Centre was opened by the then Premier Peter Beattie in February 2005 over strong community objections due to animosity towards the Queensland Police following the November 2004 death in custody and the Police response to the subsequent riot . Having moved on from a dispute between the State Government and the Palm Island Council over who should run the facility , the situation has become very positive and cooperative , the Centre is used for its intended purpose of youth and community engagement through sport and education . Adults and youth use the facility heavily , including a gym for boxing training , facilities for ; women 's aerobics , ballroom dancing , Indoor Volleyball , 5 on 5 Indoor Soccer , Old @-@ time Dancing , and a mix of conventional and traditional games . 
 The PICYC , home to the Palm Island Police Citizens Youth Club , is considered to be a great success story , especially considering its controversial beginnings soon after the 2004 death in custody and riot . The Centre is mostly staffed by community members who teach the younger generation both traditional and life skills such as weaving and cooking in a safe and comfortable environment . The Centre has an atmosphere of respect and traditional culture which tries to build children 's confidence and self @-@ esteem . Additionally to the sporting activities , the Centre hosts community growth projects , services and facilities such as a radio service ( Bwgcolman Radio ) , an Internet Café , TAFE cooking classes , after @-@ school and vacation care , monthly discos , drumming groups ( $ 8 @,@ 000 worth of drums donated by the Queensland Police ) , Family Movie Nights , and Bingo . The PICYC employs a paid staff of nine locals and one volunteer . 
 = = Infrastructure = = 
 Palm Island has no urban planning to speak of ( most of the town has not been surveyed ) , although they officially have names there are no street signs or even traffic signs which are standard on most other Queensland roads . 
 Facilities operated by the State Government on the island include a hospital , a Prep to Grade 10 school , the Palm Island Community and Youth Centre ( PICYC ) , a sewage treatment plant , a local supermarket store and ( new ) police station and courthouse . 
 The Palm Island Council operates the Palm Island Hotel ( also known as the Coolgaree Bay Hotel and previously known as the canteen ) , the community 's only outlet with a liquor license . The Council owns various other local services and businesses such as the garage and the Commonwealth Bank agency . 
 Private retail enterprise on the Island is limited to a butcher , a fish @-@ and @-@ chip shop , a clothes shop , the Post Office and a BP service station that sells petrol at about $ .50 a litre more than Townsville . Non @-@ Government services which are standard for population bases of this size in Australia are absent on Palm Island include a baker , hairdresser and newsagent . 
 In 2004 the army completed $ 10 million worth of work constructing a permanent water @-@ supply dam on the island and upgrading a number of roads . Other transport infrastructure includes Palm Island Airport on the South @-@ West of the Island from which <unk> flies to and from Townsville up to four times each day . Palm Island 's pier is in Challenger Bay , a ferry @-@ boat service operated by <unk> makes a return trip from Townsville four times a week . A barge service operates twice a week from Townsville operated by Palm Island Barge Services bringing food , machinery and fuel to the island . Also there is another barge that operates from Lucinda . 
 Transport on Palm Island is primarily walking with few private cars on the island , in 2005 the Police Citizens Youth Club ( PCYC ) , with Queensland Transport , purchased a 23 @-@ seat community bus which runs a school bus service and transport to PCYC events . 
 = = Education = = 
 Education infrastructure is comparatively high on Palm Island for a remote low population base . There is State and private primary education locally and secondary education offered up to year twelve on the Island and a campus of the Barrier Reef Institute of TAFE . Some students chose to board on the main land at private schools . 
 However educational outcomes are adversely affected by problems faced in home life , particularly ; being exposed to serious alcohol and other substance abuse , family violence , exposure to suicides and attempted suicides , balancing cultural and educational demands , living with poverty , child abuse and overcrowded housing . These problems can result in high rates of absenteeism , low self @-@ esteem and little concentration on education . Alternatively , school can be a haven from these external problems ; there are many dedicated educators and concerned parents interested in contributing to an effective , viable and culturally appropriate education system on Palm . 
 The island has two schools ; St Michael 's Catholic School ( Prep to grade 7 ) and the Education Queensland Bwgcolman Community School ( Prep to Grade 12 ) . The Bwgcolman Community School includes the Bwgcolman Community Library which is jointly managed and funded by the Council and State Government . 
 The Bwgcolman Community School has 350 students with 50 Indigenous and 27 non @-@ Indigenous staff . Palm Island , like most Aboriginal communities , has difficulties with school attendance , the Principal of St. Michael 's has stated that absenteeism averages about 30 % among their 160 students . A 2005 test at Bwgcolman school ( leaked to the media ) showed that the primary school students score " significantly less " than Queensland average in literacy and numeracy . St Michael 's have a program of teaching students " dainty " ( Australian English ) as a third language in addition to the communally spoken " Island English " and the particular language group that the child belongs to . 
 = = Health = = 
 Palm Island is serviced by the Joyce Palmer Health Service based at the Palm Island Hospital , completed in 2000 , which has an emergency department and a 15 @-@ bed general ward . The service is named for Joyce Palmer , a health worker who commenced her work in the 1940s at the Island 's old grass hospital , and provided health care to the people of Palm Island for over 40 years . 
 The hospital provides a primary level of acute care services and provides secondary services such as community health , X @-@ ray , pharmacy , dental , child health , sexual health , and antenatal and specialist clinics . There are two doctors based on Palm Island . Critical patients are stabilised and transferred to Townsville Hospital by Royal Flying Doctors Service or the Air Sea Rescue . There is a community mental health team based at the Palm Island Hospital with nurses and indigenous health workers . A consultant psychiatrist visits for one day every 6 weeks . 
 The Queensland Ambulance Service ( QAS ) began operations on Palm Island in 2000 and took over from the hospital based service . Presently staffed by two paramedics and three ambulance attendants , they average approx 2200 cases per year . One paramedic is qualified as a Paramedic Practitioner and practices under the guidelines of paramedic practitioners giving the community more health resources and options – this officer assists with sexual health cases and general medical cases including suturing at the local Joyce Palmer Health Service . The QAS is also involved in teaching First Aid to the community , " Adopt an Ambo " programs with both schools , motivational camps for teenagers and local football competitions and works closely with allied health services on the island . The QAS has also started a stinger prevention program with stinger stations having been established in different locations around the island . Funding has been raised to provide stinger suits to the communities children and adults through the PCYC and through funding grants obtained for the cause with the main one being the medicare benefit fund . A Joint Emergency Services Complex has now been completed and is located opposite the <unk> and at the old piggery site at the Farm Area – this complex house 's the Qld Ambulance Service , The Qld Rural Fire Brigade and the Local SES unit , and is fully functional . 
 Despite the healthcare facilities , a report tabled in the Queensland Parliament on 21 April 2006 claimed that conditions at Palm Island resembled those of a third world country . 
 In 1979 an outbreak of <unk> , also known as the Palm Island mystery disease , was reported and described a hepatitis @-@ like illness ( associated with dehydration and bloody diarrhoea ) in 138 children and 10 adults of Indigenous descent . This was proposed to have been caused by the toxin <unk> , which was released from <unk> cyanobacterial cells after the addition of excessive doses of copper sulfate to the water supply of Solomon Dam to target a bloom of <unk> <unk> . A later report alternatively proposed that the excess copper in the water was the cause of the disease . The excessive dosing was following the use of least @-@ cost contractors to control the algae , who were unqualified in the field . 
 In December 1934 there was a major outbreak of Influenza with a large number of residents hospitalised . 
 = Interstate 270 ( Maryland ) = 
 Interstate 270 ( abbreviated I @-@ 270 ) is a 34 @.@ 70 @-@ mile ( 55 @.@ 84 km ) auxiliary Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of Maryland that travels between I @-@ 495 ( the Capital Beltway ) just north of Bethesda , Montgomery County and I @-@ 70 in the city of Frederick in Frederick County . It consists of the 32 @.@ 60 @-@ mile ( 52 @.@ 46 km ) mainline as well as a 2 @.@ 10 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 38 km ) spur that provides access to and from southbound I @-@ 495 . I @-@ 270 is known as the Washington National Pike , and makes up the easternmost stretch of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Highway . Most of the southern part of the route in Montgomery County passes through suburban areas around Rockville and Gaithersburg that are home to many biotech firms . This portion of I @-@ 270 is up to twelve lanes wide and consists of a local @-@ express lane configuration as well as high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes that are in operation during peak travel times . North of the Gaithersburg area , the road continues through the northern part of Montgomery County , passing Germantown and Clarksburg as a six- to eight @-@ lane highway with a HOV lane in the northbound direction only . North of here , I @-@ 270 continues through rural areas into Frederick County and toward the city of Frederick as a four @-@ lane freeway . 
 The freeway was built between 1953 and 1960 as the Washington National Pike between Bethesda and Frederick and carried U.S. Route 240 ( US 240 ) , which was rerouted off what is now Maryland Route 355 ( MD 355 ) between these two points . With the creation of the Interstate Highway System a few years later , the road was designated as I @-@ 70S along with US 240 . There were plans to extend I @-@ 70S to I @-@ 95 in Washington , D.C. on the North Central Freeway from the Capital Beltway ; however , they were cancelled in the 1970s due to opposition from residents in the freeway ’ s path . The concurrent US 240 designation was removed in 1972 and I @-@ 70S became I @-@ 270 in 1975 . Increasing traffic levels led to a $ 200 million widening of the road in Montgomery County to its current configuration and further increased traffic . Many improvements are slated for I @-@ 270 , including the construction of three new interchanges and the widening of the route between Shady Grove Road and Frederick that would add high @-@ occupancy vehicles lanes and high @-@ occupancy toll lanes .

It reaches the Urbana area , where the route has an interchange with MD 80 ( Fingerboard Road ) . The highway briefly runs along the east side of MD 80 past this interchange before continuing through agricultural areas . It features a scenic overlook in the northbound direction as the road passes through Monocacy National Battlefield , which was the site of the Battle of Monocacy Junction . I @-@ 270 eventually leaves the battlefield area and continues into the commercial outskirts of Frederick . Here , the road interchanges with MD 85 ( Buckeystown Pike ) near the Francis Scott Key Mall . I @-@ 270 continues through commercial areas before coming to its northern terminus at an interchange with I @-@ 70 and US 40 ( Baltimore National Pike ) . Past this interchange , the freeway continues north as the Frederick Freeway , a part of US 40 that interchanges with US 15 and US 340 a short distance north of I @-@ 270 ’ s northern terminus . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1947 , plans were made to construct a freeway called the Washington National Pike parallel to US 240 ( present @-@ day MD 355 ) between Bethesda and Frederick . In 1953 , the US 240 freeway was completed between MD 121 in Clarksburg and US 15 ( now MD 85 ) in Frederick . A year later , the freeway was extended down to MD 118 in Germantown . The US 240 freeway was extended south to MD 28 in Rockville in 1956 . Also , the US 240 freeway was completed from US 15 north to US 40 . The US 240 freeway was extended south to Montrose Road in 1958 . I @-@ 70S was designated onto the US 240 freeway in 1959 . In 1960 , I @-@ 70S / US 240 was extended south to the Capital Beltway . With the completion of this freeway , MD 355 was designated onto the original alignment of US 240 . The construction of the Washington National Pike resulted in suburban growth along the corridor between Washington , D.C. and Frederick , with several federal agencies including the United States Atomic Energy Commission , the National Bureau of Standards , and the National Institutes of Health moving their headquarters to Montgomery County . A western spur that provided access to southbound I @-@ 495 was eventually built and became I @-@ 270 . 
 I @-@ 70S was projected to continue past the Capital Beltway into Washington , D.C. on the North Central Freeway to connect directly to I @-@ 95 . Plans for this freeway initially began in 1959 when a freeway was called for along the Georgia Avenue corridor . In the mid @-@ 1960s , a study was proposed for the freeway that recommended several different routings between Washington , D.C. and the Capital Beltway . By 1966 , a route for the North Central Freeway was planned along a Baltimore & Ohio Railroad line running through the northeastern part of Washington and Takoma Park north to the Capital Beltway . In a 1971 study by <unk> , Cather Associates and Harry <unk> & Associates , LTD , I @-@ 70S was planned to run from its southern terminus at I @-@ 495 and run concurrent with that route before turning south on the North Central Freeway and ending at I @-@ 95 in Washington . The routing of the freeway through residential areas of Washington drew opposition from residents of the Takoma Park , <unk> , and Michigan Park neighborhoods who were successful in getting the freeway cancelled through their neighborhoods in 1970 . The North Central Freeway within Maryland was cancelled by the MDSHA in 1972 due to opposition from officials in Montgomery County . In 1975 , the Federal Highway Administration officially approved withdrawal of plans to construct the road south of the Capital Beltway . 
 The concurrent US 240 designation was removed from I @-@ 70S in 1972 . On May 18 , 1975 , I @-@ 70S was designated I @-@ 270 . The western spur is now signed and publicly known simply as I @-@ 270 Spur . By the 1980s , traffic congestion had grown on I @-@ 270 in Montgomery County ; as a result , a $ 200 million project widened the road between I @-@ 495 and MD 118 to its current configuration , with some portions being widened to twelve lanes . This widening led to growth of residences and businesses along the I @-@ 270 corridor as far north as Germantown and increased traffic counts along the road . Much of I @-@ 270 in Montgomery County is now a hub for biotech firms . By 1999 , congestion on the road grew to then @-@ projected 2010 levels .

 The MDSHA is studying improvements for the I @-@ 270 corridor between Shady Grove Road and Frederick . Options for improvement include widening the highway to include more lanes with HOV and HOT lanes , as well as initiating rapid bus or light rail service along I @-@ 270 between Shady Grove and Clarksburg . In addition , two new interchanges are planned for I @-@ 270 in Frederick County . The first planned interchange is with MD 75 near the Montgomery County border , which would involve extending MD 75 from MD 355 to the interchange with I @-@ 270 at a projected cost of $ 57 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 . The other planned interchange is with Park Mills Road in Urbana , which has a projected cost of $ 48 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 . In Montgomery County , an interchange is being proposed with an extension of Watkins Mill Road in Gaithersburg . This proposed interchange , which is being pushed by Montgomery County , will see $ 125 million in construction spending . Funding for this interchange first disappeared in September 2008 after the state of Maryland announced it was cutting $ 1 @.@ 1 billion that was to go to transportation projects , later reinstated with the Transportation Infrastructure Investment Act of 2013 proposed to raise $ 4 @.@ 4 billion Statewide over 6 years .

 = Chloe Sullivan = 
 Chloe Sullivan is a fictional character in the television series Smallville , which is based on the Superman and Superboy comics published by DC Comics . Portrayed by series regular Allison Mack , the character was created exclusively for Smallville by series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar . Other than main character Clark Kent , Chloe is the only main character to last the duration of the show , though Mack only signed on for five episodes in the tenth and final season . The character has also appeared in various literature based on Smallville , an internet series , and was then later adapted back into the original Superman comics which inspired Smallville . 
 In Smallville , Chloe is Clark Kent 's best friend , and the editor of the high school newspaper the Torch ; she notices that the meteor rocks ( kryptonite ) are mutating the citizens of Smallville . She generally teams up with Clark and Pete Ross in tracking and stopping meteor @-@ infected people from harming other citizens . In the first five seasons , Chloe harbors an unrequited love for Clark , but eventually accepts her place as his best friend and nothing more . In later seasons , Chloe discovers she has a meteor rock power of her own , until she apparently loses them during an encounter with the alien supervillain Brainiac . In terms of romantic storylines , after Superman supporting character Jimmy Olsen is introduced to the show , he becomes Chloe 's boyfriend and later husband , but the pair later divorce . In the show 's final seasons , Chloe finds romance with Oliver Queen , otherwise known as the costumed vigilante @-@ archer Green Arrow , whom she eventually marries and has a son with . 
 Chloe Sullivan has been characterized as independent , intelligent , curious and impulsive by both the writers and the actress that portrays her . The latter two characteristics often cause Chloe to get into trouble with both her friends and with local industrialists Lionel Luthor and his son Lex , two of the show 's primary antagonists . Mack has been recognized with multiple award nominations and wins for her portrayal of Chloe .

 Introduced in the series pilot , Chloe spends much of season one helping her best friend Clark Kent ( Tom Welling ) stop the citizens of Smallville who have developed special abilities from genetic mutations , caused by the meteor rocks that fell to Smallville in 1989 , from committing crimes . It is established that Chloe is the editor of the school newspaper the Torch at the start of the first season . Her journalistic curiosity — always wanting to " expose falsehoods " and " know the truth " — causes tension with her friends , especially when she is digging into Clark 's past in the season two episode " Lineage " . In the early seasons , Chloe hides the fact that she is in love with Clark , although the feeling is not reciprocated ; she confesses her true feelings to Clark in season two 's " Fever " while he is sick , but he calls out Lana Lang 's name in his delirium . Her feelings for Clark get in the way of her better judgment as she betrays his trust in the season two finale , after witnessing him and Lana Lang ( Kristin Kreuk ) sharing a kiss in his barn , and agrees to uncover information on Clark for Lionel Luthor ( John Glover ) in exchange for a job at the Daily Planet .

In the season four episode " Pariah " , Chloe discovers Clark 's secret when Alicia Baker ( Sarah Carter ) , Clark 's girlfriend , decides that it needs to be exposed to the world in order for him to feel more comfortable about who he really is . Alicia hopes that Chloe will write a story exposing Clark , but Chloe decides that Clark kept his secret for a reason and decides not to write the story . 
 Chloe finally reveals to Clark in the season five premiere that she has known his secret , but that she wanted him to be comfortable enough to tell her on his own . At the same time , Clark reveals that he was not infected by the meteor rocks in Smallville , as Chloe initially suspected , but that he is in fact an alien who was sent to Earth as a baby during the meteor shower of 1989 . In season five 's " Thirst " , Chloe earns her dream job at the Daily Planet , starting in the basement . In the season six episode " Justice " , Chloe begins assisting Green Arrow ( Justin Hartley ) and his team of superheroes under the codename " Watchtower " . In " Freak " , she discovers she herself is meteor @-@ infected , with an unknown ability , and begins to worry that she is a " time bomb " heading towards insanity . She later discovers in " Progeny " that her institutionalized mother , Moira Sullivan ( Lynda Carter ) , is meteor @-@ infected as well .

 At the start of season eight , it is revealed that Chloe was not arrested by DDS , but Lex 's security personnel impersonating DDS agents . While subjected to their tests , Chloe discovers that her altercation with Brainiac has apparently caused to her to lose her meteor @-@ related powers , but instilled two new abilities : vast super intelligence and <unk> . Returning to Smallville , Chloe reopens the Isis Foundation . Though she loves Jimmy , she finds herself attracted to paramedic Davis Bloome ( Samuel Witwer ) . In the episode " Abyss " , Brainiac 's infestation causes Chloe to lose her memories . Clark takes Chloe to his biological father Jor @-@ El , who restores her memories . After Chloe marries Jimmy in " Bride " , she is kidnapped by Doomsday , a genetically engineered killing machine bent on destroying Earth and becomes Brainiac 's vessel once again .

In a flashforward in the series finale , Chloe is now the mother to a young boy , but remains in touch with Clark and Lois . 
 = = Portrayal = = 
 Chloe Sullivan was introduced by the show 's creators to be a " Lois Lane archetype " , as well as be Smallville 's " outsider " , which series developers Gough and Millar felt the show needed in order to have a character that notices the strange happenings in Smallville . She is the original creation of Al Gough and Miles Miller , having not been produced first in the DC Comics Universe , unlike the other main characters Clark Kent , Lana Lang , Lex Luthor , and Pete Ross . When they first began developing the series , Gough and Millar had intended for Chloe to have an " ethnic background " . After learning about Smallville from the show 's casting director , Dee Dee Bradley , Allison Mack toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang , but chose instead to audition for the role of Chloe Sullivan . Gough and Millar felt she had a " rare ability to deliver large chunks of <unk> [ sic ] dialogue conversationally " , and decided to cast her against their initial intention to give the character an ethnic origin . According to Mack , the reason she got the role was because she went into her second audition with a " very flippant attitude " . Kristen Bell also auditioned for the role of Chloe Sullivan ; she would eventually go on to star in the television series Veronica Mars . Aside from Allison Mack , Roan Curtis portrayed Chloe as a child in the season six episode " Progeny " , with Victoria Duffield taking on the role in the eighth season episode " Abyss " . Mack enjoys the fact that her character was created specifically for the show , because she feels like she does not have to worry about being compared to someone else in the same role , which she likens to people comparing Michael Rosenbaum 's performance as Lex Luthor to Gene Hackman 's portrayal in the Superman film series of the 1970s – 1980s . Mack only signed on for five episodes of the tenth and final season .

 = = = Storyline progression = = = 
 Allison Mack was disappointed that the character " lost some of her backbone " in the second season . The second season was about exploring Chloe 's heart , and the idea of her being this " lovelorn [ … ] angsty teenager " . As Mack describes her , " [ Chloe ] was a little spineless and a little bit too much of a pushover [ in season two ] . " Mack does believe that by the end of the season Chloe manages to get some of that integrity back . The actress likes to make sure that her character is kept " smart " and " ambitious " , but at the end of season two Chloe 's impulsiveness causes her to get stuck under Lionel 's control , when she " spitefully " agrees to uncover Clark 's secrets for Lionel Luthor after Clark is not honest with her about his newly established relationship with Lana . 
 For season three , Mack wanted the character to be given a major obstacle to overcome , something that would help the character mature . The obstacle in question became Lionel 's control over Chloe , after she made a deal to spy on Clark . Allison Mack believes that Chloe is in her own comfort zone while she is working at the Torch , as she is in complete control , but likens Chloe being under Lionel 's control to that of a " caged animal " . When she ruins the lives of a mother and her son in season three 's " Truth " , after exposing the mother as a fugitive from the law , Chloe is forced to look deeper into her own self . Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe 's maturity ; it is the moment that she realizes that there needs to be a line she should never cross . After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret , the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show . Knowing Clark 's secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark , and recognize where their relationship will always be ; Chloe 's acceptance of her place in Clark 's life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship , without the concerns of Chloe 's unrequited love . According to Mack , Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more " genuine " and " selfless " . 
 For the actress , having Chloe become part of the meteor infected community in season six allowed Mack 's character to continue to evolve . Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people — the meteor infected — she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public . Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark , as she can better understand what it feels like to live in a world where you have a special ability . Writer Holly Harold believes that , in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks , bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development . Lois 's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself , and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends . The competition that Lois provides is beneficial , as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself . 
 = = = Characterization = = = 
 Allison Mack characterizes Chloe as being a " misfit " during the first season ; more of " a really smart girl with attitude " . She goes on to describe Chloe as intelligent and independent . Another of Chloe 's defining characteristics is her need to " expose falsehoods " and find the truth in every situation . The character is curious , and wants to be honest with people . She is always trying to make sense of the situation . Next to her curiosity , her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor , when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel . The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe 's love for Clark . As Allison Mack explains , Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes . It is this unrequited love for Clark that " drives [ Chloe ] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is " . 
 A leading theory among audiences was that Chloe would eventually change her name to Lois Lane , Clark 's wife in the comics , as she embodies various characteristics that Lois Lane has in the comic books . The creative team removed the notion that Chloe was going to turn into Clark 's future wife when they introduced Lois Lane in season four . Though the characters share similarities , according to Mack , Chloe and Lois are more " different shades of the same color [ … ] Chloe is a softer version of Lois " . Chloe 's upbringing allows her to be less jaded than Lois . Chloe also looks to the future , whereas Lois is more shortsighted . 
 The season six finale reveals that Chloe has the ability to heal others . Mack describes Chloe 's newfound meteor power as similar to " empathy " . The actress further defines the power as the ability to heal others by taking their pain and making it her own . Writer Todd Slavkin contends that giving Chloe the power to heal was the best choice for the character . According to Slavkin , Chloe has sacrificed so much in her life for the greater good that it only seemed natural that her meteor power would reflect that . For the writer , it did not make sense for her ability to be something " malicious and evil and destructive " . In season eight , Chloe discovers that she also has super @-@ intelligence – being able to solve complex algorithms faster than LuthorCorp 's most powerful supercomputer . She and Clark later deduce that her newfound intelligence was brought on during her encounter with Brainiac , who infected her with a part of himself during his attack . 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 One of Chloe 's key relationships is with the series protagonist , Clark Kent . Although believers in the " <unk> " theory initially suspected that Chloe would eventually become Lois Lane , Clark 's future wife in the comics , Mack contends that Clark does not love Chloe in the way that she loves him . The actress does not believe that Clark 's feelings will ever change . Regardless of Clark 's feelings , Mack recognizes that Chloe is blinded by her love for Clark , which ultimately affects her judgment in not only seeing Clark 's faults , but making choices that place her character in danger . In season five , Clark finally discovers that Chloe knows his secret , and this revelation allows Chloe the opportunity to come to terms with her feelings for Clark ; this also provided a means for the two have a more meaningful friendship , without the concerns of Chloe 's unrequited love . 
 Speaking on the evolving relationship of Clark and Chloe , Mack believes that the season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe 's life increased her value to Clark . Before , Chloe would drop anything for Clark , but now that Chloe has other priorities , it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him . The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with . The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark 's secret , as well as keeping the fact that she is meteor @-@ infected hidden . Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe 's heart that Clark occupied for so long . 
 Chloe 's relationship with her mother is one tackled both off @-@ screen and behind the scenes . In a brainstorming session , Mack , Gough and Millar came up with the idea that Chloe 's mother had left her at a young age . Mack wanted to make the character a " latchkey kid " , in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night . Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues , which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone . These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him , as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends . One of Chloe 's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution , and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility . This fear also affects Clark , who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe , like it did Pete .

The web series eventually made its way to Britain 's Channel 4 website . Smallville : Chloe Chronicles was created by Mark Warshaw , with the scripts written by Brice Tidwell ; Allison Mack was given final script approval .

 In 2012 , the Smallville series was continued through the comic book medium with Smallville : Season 11 . Written by Bryan Q. Miller , who also wrote for the television series , the first issue reveals that Chloe and Oliver Queen are living in Star City . Chloe is working for the Star City Gazette , but remains a friend and ally to the heroes . She and Lois discover a spacecraft in Earth 's atmosphere , later revealing the pilot is Chloe 's counterpart from a parallel reality ( the same universe where Clark Luthor and alternate @-@ Lionel Luthor was from ) . She was sent by her cousin , Lois Queen ( the alternate version of Lois Lane and Clark 's ally of that world ) , to warn Clark of the coming " Crisis " , which destroyed her world . She dies after Oliver and Chloe take her to a hospital . After Chloe asks Lois to steal the components and plans of Lionel Luthor 's memory device , Project Intercept , with Oliver , Chloe had Emil Hamilton build it with upgrades so she can find information from the remnants of her deceased counterpart 's memories .

 Although Chloe appeared alongside her television cohorts in the Smallville comic books , which featured tie @-@ ins to the Chloe Chronicles webisodes , the character did not appear in the mainstream DC Comics Universe until 2010 , though DC representatives and writers initially hoped to bring Chloe into DC continuity in 2007 . According to writer Kurt Busiek , the problem of bringing Chloe into the mainstream comic book universe , and keeping her television background , was that she would have filled two roles : " the Girl from Back Home and the Reporter " . Those roles were already filled by the adult comic book versions of Lana Lang and Lois Lane , so the plan was to give the character a new background . Busiek hoped to make Chloe the younger sister of someone Clark had gone to school with , who was a now interning at the Daily Planet . Busiek believed that this would make her different from Lana and Lois , but still familiar to readers who also watched the show . Another distinguishing feature would be that this version of Chloe would not know Clark 's secret , nor would she be meteor infected . These ideas never came to fruition . 
 Chloe first appeared in " Jimmy Olsen 's Big Week " , a serialized Jimmy Olsen story written by Nick Spencer , beginning in Action Comics # 893 ( November 2010 ) . Spencer stated that introducing Chloe has been his first " positive contribution " to the DC Universe . Because of the continuity differences between Smallville and the comic book Superman stories , Spencer chose to stay " as true to the character " as he could by honoring her romantic history with Jimmy Olsen from later Smallville seasons , as well as her journalistic background from its early seasons . Spencer decided to introduce Chloe after he began conceiving of a clever , dogged female reporter for Jimmy Olsen to interact with , and realized that he had been subconsciously writing about Chloe .
