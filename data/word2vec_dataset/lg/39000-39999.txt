 = Fanny Bullock Workman = 
 Fanny Bullock Workman ( January 8 , 1859 â€“ January 22 , 1925 ) was an American geographer , cartographer , explorer , travel writer , and mountaineer , notably in the Himalayas . She was one of the first female professional mountaineers ; she not only explored but also wrote about her adventures . She set several women 's altitude records , published eight travel books with her husband , and championed women 's rights and women 's suffrage . 
 Born to a wealthy family , Workman was educated in the finest schools available to women and traveled in Europe . Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages , and , after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire , Fanny Workman traveled the world with him . They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe , North Africa , and Asia . The couple had two children , but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type ; they left their children in schools and with nurses , and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man . The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland , France , Italy , Spain , Algeria and India . They cycled thousands of miles , sleeping wherever they could find shelter . They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented on the state of the lives of women that she saw . Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books . 
 At the end of their cycling trip through India , the couple escaped to the Western Himalaya and the Karakoram for the summer months , where they were introduced to high @-@ altitude climbing . They returned to this then @-@ unexplored region eight times over the next 14 years . Despite not having modern climbing equipment , the Workmans explored several glaciers and reached the summit of several mountains , eventually reaching 23 @,@ 000 feet ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) on Pinnacle Peak , a women 's altitude record at the time . They organized multiyear expeditions but struggled to remain on good terms with the local labor force . Coming from a position of American privilege and wealth , they failed to understand the position of the native workers and had difficulty finding and negotiating for reliable porters . 
 After their trips to the Himalaya , the Workmans gave lectures about their travels . They were invited to learned societies ; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and the second to speak at the Royal Geographical Society . She received many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was recognized as one of the foremost climbers of her day . She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Workman was born January 8 , 1859 , in Worcester , Massachusetts , to a wealthy and elite family descended from the Pilgrims ; she was the youngest of three children . Her mother was Elvira Hazard , and her father was Alexander H. Bullock , businessman and Republican Massachusetts governor . Fanny was educated by governesses before attending Miss Graham 's Finishing School in New York City , after which she spent time in Paris and then Dresden . Thomas Pauly writes in his short biography of Workman that " early on Fanny chafed at the constraints of her privilege " . A small number of her stories from this time survive , describing her interest in adventure . In one , " A Vacation Episode " , she describes a beautiful and aristocratic English girl who is contemptuous of society . She runs away to Grindelwald , becoming an excellent alpinist and marrying an American . The story encapsulates much of Fanny 's own life : wanderlust , a love of the mountains , and a commitment to women 's rights . In 1886 , she published a short story , set during the First Indian War , in New York Magazine about " the capture and rescue of a white girl " ; a reviewer of the story stated that it was " told in a very pleasant and infatuating style " . 
 In 1879 , Fanny returned to the United States and on June 16 , 1882 married William Hunter Workman , a man 12 years her senior . He was also from a wealthy and educated family , having attended Yale and having received his medical training at Harvard . In 1884 they had a daughter , Rachel . 
 William introduced Fanny to climbing after their marriage , and together they spent many summers in the White Mountains in New Hampshire ; here she summited Mount Washington ( 6 @,@ 293 feet or 1 @,@ 918 metres ) several times . Climbing in the Northeastern United States allowed Fanny to develop her abilities together with other women . Unlike European clubs , American climbing clubs in the White Mountains allowed women to be members and encouraged women to climb . They promoted a new vision of the American woman , one who was both domestic and athletic , and Workman took to this image with enthusiasm . By 1886 , women sometimes outnumbered men on hiking expeditions in New England . In her paper on the gender dynamics of climbing in the region , Jenny Ernie @-@ Steighner states that this formative experience shaped Workman 's commitment to women 's rights , pointing out that " no other well @-@ known international mountaineers of the time , male or female , spoke as openly and fervently about women 's rights " . However , both of the Workmans disliked the provincial nature of life in Worcester , where they resided , and yearned to live in Europe . After both Fanny 's and William 's fathers died , leaving them enormous estates , the couple embarked on their first major European trip , a tour of Scandinavia and Germany . 
 = = Move to Europe and cycling tours = = 
 In 1889 the Workman family relocated to Germany citing William 's health , although Pauly speculates that this may have been merely a pretext , for he recovered surprisingly quickly . The couple 's second child , Siegfried , was born shortly after they arrived in Dresden . Although Fanny and William now had two children , Fanny refused to conform to the socially accepted role of a wife and mother , and instead became an author and adventurer . She lived a vigorous life that diverged from idealized femininity in the 1800s . As a feminist , Fanny considered herself an example of the idea that women could equal and excel over men in the arduous life , and embodied the New Woman ethos of the day . Moreover , as Miller points out in her book about women explorers , since the ideal family of the time was a large one and information about birth control was not easily available , William 's medical knowledge must have been invaluable . The Workmans left their children with nurses while they took long trips . In 1893 , Siegfried died from a combination of influenza and pneumonia . After his death , according to Pauly , Workman , through her bicycle tours , " aggressively pursued an alternative identity , one that liberated her from the conventional responsibilities of wife and mother and allowed for her interests and ambitions " . They missed their daughter 's wedding to Sir Alexander MacRobert in 1911 while exploring in the Karakoram . 
 Together , the Workmans explored the world and co @-@ wrote eight travel books , which describe the people , art , and architecture of the areas in which they journeyed . The Workmans were aware of their contribution to the genre of travel writing as they commented on other writers in their own works . Their mountaineering narratives said little about the culture of those remote and sparsely inhabited regions ; they included both lyrical descriptions of the sunset , for example , for their popular audience and detailed explanations of geographical features , such as glaciers , for their scientific readership . Fanny and William added scientific elements to their writings to appeal to authoritative organizations such as the Royal Geographical Society ; Fanny also believed the science would make her more legitimate in the eyes of the climbing community , but it cost her readers . In general , their bicycling tour narratives were better received than those about their mountaineering exploits . Fanny wrote the majority of these travel books herself , and in them she commented extensively on the plight of women wherever she traveled . 
 Stephanie Tingley writes , in her encyclopedia entry on Workman 's travel writing , that there is an implied feminist criticism of the hardships women experienced and the inferior status of the women in the societies she encountered . As a strong @-@ willed , outspoken supporter of women 's rights , Workman used their travels to demonstrate her own abilities and to highlight the inequities other women lived under . However , their travel books are written in the first @-@ person plural or third @-@ person singular , so it is difficult to decisively attribute views or voices to either William or Fanny . The Workmans ' works are colonialist in that they describe the people they meet and observe as " exotic or unusual , at worst as primitive or even subhuman " . However , at times they make it clear that the people they encounter see them in a similar light , demonstrating that they were sometimes aware of their own biases . 
 Between 1888 and 1893 , the Workmans took bicycling tours of Switzerland , France , and Italy . In 1891 , Fanny became one of the first women to climb Mont Blanc . She also was one of the first women to climb the Jungfrau and the Matterhorn ; her guide was Peter <unk> , who had made the first ascent with Edward Whymper . In 1893 , the couple decided to explore areas beyond Europe and headed for Algeria , Indochina , and India . These longer trips were Fanny 's idea . The couple 's first extended tour was a 2 @,@ 800 @-@ mile ( 4 @,@ 500 km ) bicycle trip across Spain in 1895 ; each of them carried 20 pounds ( 9 @.@ 1 kg ) of luggage and they averaged 45 miles ( 72 km ) a day , sometimes riding up to 80 miles ( 130 km ) . Afterwards , they co @-@ wrote Sketches <unk> in Modern Iberia about their trip . In it , they described Spain as " rustic , quaint , and charming " , a common travel writing motif that did not make their book fresh or original . In Algerian Memories Fanny focused on the beauty and romance of the countryside , avoiding any commentary on the appalling urban conditions . However , she did highlight the abuse and neglect of women in Algerian society . 
 = = India = = 
 The Workmans ' trip to India , Burma , Ceylon , and Java lasted two and a half years , beginning in November 1897 , and covered 14 @,@ 000 miles ( 23 @,@ 000 km ) . At the time , Fanny was 38 and William 50 . They bicycled about 4 @,@ 000 miles ( 6 @,@ 400 km ) from the southernmost tip of India to the Himalaya in the north . In order to ensure that they had access to supplies , they rode along major thoroughfares near railways , and were sometimes forced to sleep in railway waiting rooms if no other accommodation was available . They carried minimal supplies , including tea , sugar , biscuits , cheese , tinned meats , water , pillows , a blanket for each of them , writing materials , and medical and repair kits . They dispensed with their bicycles at the northern end of their trip and hiked over passes between 14 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) and 18 @,@ 000 feet ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) . The trip was grueling . They often had little food or water , dealt with swarms of mosquitoes , fixed as many as 40 bicycle tire punctures per day , and slept in rat @-@ infested quarters . Fanny Workman 's book , written after the trip , highlighted the ancient architecture that they had seen rather than the contemporary local cultures . Mrs Workmans mentions in " My Asiatic Wanderings " about India " I have wheeled through much enchanting scenery , in the palm and banyan grooves of Orissa , Over the green and scarlet slopes of the Terai ... But I have never cycled 1200 miles in a country so continuously beautiful . " The Workmans possessed an unusual amount of historical knowledge about India for Westerners of the time and had read the <unk> , Mahabharata , and Ramayana before their trip . They were eager to learn about the culture that had produced these epics and spent more time learning about ancient history than interacting with living people . 
 = = = Labor issues = = = 
 During the summer of 1898 , the couple decided to escape the heat and explore the western Himalaya and Karakoram . After that , they intended to explore the area around Kanchenjunga in Sikkim , and then finally travel to the mountains bordering Bhutan on the east . Bureaucratic difficulties and weather problems abounded and impeded their plans . The most serious problems concerned labor . They hired 45 porters , outfitted them for basic mountain travel , and bought provisions , but costs skyrocketed as news of wealthy Americans circulated in the villages . They could not leave until October 3 and by then cold weather was approaching . The Workmans complain in their writings about the porters they hired , who were difficult to work with and refused to trek more than five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) per day . Three days into their journey the Workmans reached snow and the porters rebelled ; they refused to work in such cold conditions and forced the entire party to return to Darjeeling . 
 The Workmans struggled with labor problems continually , needing local porters to carry gear for them because they could not carry a sufficient amount for themselves for a multi @-@ month expedition . They had to transport <unk> tents , eider sleeping bags , camera equipment , scientific instruments , and a large supply of food . The porters were skeptical of the entire venture . The locals rarely climbed mountains and were not used to taking orders from a woman , which made Fanny 's position difficult . The Workmans tried to solve these problems with condescension and high @-@ handedness . Kenneth Mason maintains in his history of Himalayan mountaineering , written in 1955 , that " The Workmans were , on their journeys , the victims of their own faults . They were too impatient and rarely tried to understand the mentality of the porters and so did not get the best out of them . " Labor problems beset all of their expeditions because , as Miller puts it , " Almost alone of Victorian travellers , the Workmans had absolutely no sympathy or even common @-@ sense understanding of the local people , into whose poor and remote villages they burst with trains of followers demanding service and supplies . " In her chapter on Workman , Miller argues that the couple , being American , did not have the same sense of caste or class that British explorers had : " the Workmans , like most of their countrymen , plunged in their enterprises headlong , expecting their enormous energy to overcome all obstacles . They were justifiably criticized by the British for their callous , incompetent behavior toward the Indians . " 
 = = Mountaineering in the Himalayas = = 
 After travelling to the Himalaya the first time , the Workmans became entranced with climbing and mountaineering . Over a span of 14 years , they traveled eight times to the area , which at the time was almost completely unexplored and unmapped . Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment , freeze @-@ dried foods , sunblock , or radios . On each expedition , they explored , surveyed , and photographed , ultimately reporting on their findings and creating maps . The couple shared and alternated responsibilities ; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles . 
 After their first trip to the Himalaya and subsequent labor problems , the Workmans hired Matthias Zurbriggen , the best and most experienced mountain climbing guide of the time . Thus , in 1899 , with 50 local porters and Zurbriggen , the Workmans began to explore the Biafo Glacier in the Karakoram , but dangerous crevasses and poor weather forced them instead to shift to the <unk> La Glacier and the unclimbed peaks around it . They reached <unk> , an 18 @,@ 600 @-@ foot ( 5 @,@ 700 m ) summit that she named after her son , giving Fanny an altitude record for women at the time . They next camped at 17 @,@ 000 feet ( 5 @,@ 200 m ) and climbed a higher peak of 19 @,@ 450 feet ( 5 @,@ 930 m ) , naming it Mount Bullock Workman . Admiring the view of a far @-@ off mountain , they commented on the grand view : they were looking at K2 , the second @-@ highest mountain in the world . Fanny Workman may have been the first woman recorded to have seen it . Finally , they climbed <unk> Gunge ( 20 @,@ 997 feet or 6 @,@ 400 metres ) , giving Fanny her third successive altitude record . It was very challenging : they had to hire new porters , establish a new base camp , and remain overnight at around 18 @,@ 000 feet ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) . In the morning , they climbed a wall that measured 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) , and were buffeted by winds . During the summit push , Fanny 's fingers were so numb that she could no longer hold her ice ax and one of the porters abandoned them . Pauly writes , " propelled to the summit by adrenalin and desperation , the foursome lingered only long enough for their instruments to assess that the temperature was ten degrees Fahrenheit [ âˆ’ 12 Â° C ] and their elevation was 21 @,@ 000 feet . " Fanny was a " slow , relentless , and intrepid " climber ; " bearlike , she solidly planted one foot and then groped for another secure grip with the other " . Climbing at the beginning of the 20th century , she did not have specialized equipment like <unk> or carabiners . She was able to climb to such heights , Pauly argues , because of " her dauntless persistence and her immunity to altitude sickness " . 
 As soon as she was able , Fanny Workman published accounts of her feats , such as an article in the Scottish Geographical Magazine . Writing about this trip at length in In the Ice World of the Himalayas , Fanny made efforts to include scientific information and experiments , touting her own modified barometer as superior , but scholarly critics were unimpressed and pointed out her lack of scientific knowledge . Popular reviewers , on the other hand , enjoyed the book , with one concluding , " We have no hesitation in saying that Dr. and Mrs. Workman have written one of the most remarkable books of travel of recent years . " 
 In 1902 , the Workmans returned to the Himalaya and became the first Westerners to explore the <unk> <unk> Glacier , starting in <unk> . They hired 80 porters and took four tons of supplies , but their explorations were limited by near @-@ constant snow and a 60 @-@ hour storm . In 1903 , they trekked to the Hoh Lumba Glacier with guide Cyprien Savoye . They also attempted to climb the nearby mountain they called Pyramid Peak ( later renamed Spantik , as part of the Spantik @-@ <unk> Mountains ) . They camped the first night at 16 @,@ 200 feet ( 4 @,@ 900 m ) and the second at 18 @,@ 600 feet ( 5 @,@ 700 m ) . An ailing porter forced them to camp the third night at 19 @,@ 355 feet ( 5 @,@ 899 m ) rather than 20 @,@ 000 feet ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) and they eventually left him behind . They ascended a 22 @,@ 567 @-@ foot ( 6 @,@ 878 m ) peak , giving Fanny a new altitude record . William and a porter climbed toward the needle @-@ like spire that was the expedition 's goal . However , he abandoned the summit attempt a few hundred feet from the top because he realized they could not have descended to a safe altitude before altitude sickness set in . 
 After returning from their travels , the Workmans lectured all over Europe . Fanny lectured in English , German , or French , as the occasion required . At one talk in Lyon , France , 1000 people crowded into the auditorium and 700 were turned away . In 1905 Fanny became the second woman to address the Royal Geographical Society . ( Isabella Bird Bishop had been the first in May 1897 . ) Her talk was mentioned in The Times . 
 The Workmans returned to Kashmir in 1906 , and were the first Westerners to explore the Nun Kun massif . For this trip , the couple hired six Italian porters from the Alps , 200 local porters , and Savoye returned as guide . As Isserman , Weaver and Molenaar explain in their history of Himalayan mountaineering , the Workmans despised the local porters but were forced to recruit them ; " their otherwise invaluable books read like one long , anguished harangue against the lazy , lying , thieving , mutinous cheats on whom they unhappily depended for local support " . They planned a sequence of four camps from 17 @,@ 657 feet ( 5 @,@ 382 m ) to 21 @,@ 000 feet ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) . Despite labor problems , the Workmans spent the night higher than any previous mountaineers â€” 20 @,@ 278 feet ( 6 @,@ 181 m ) on top of Z1 on Nun Kun â€” at what they called " Camp America " . William wrote of Fanny : 
 She concentrated her attention on the end in view , often disregarding the difficulties and even the dangers that might lie in the way of accomplishment . She went forward with a determination to succeed and a courage that won success where a less determined effort would have failed . She believed in taking advantage of every opportunity . She was no quitter , and was never the first to suggest turning back in the face of discouraging circumstances . 
 The map the Workmans made during this trip was of low quality . According to Mason , the couple did not have a good sense of topographical direction , which meant that their measurements were inaccurate and unusable by the Survey of India . 
 = = = Pinnacle Peak and altitude record = = = 
 From 20 @,@ 278 feet ( 6 @,@ 181 m ) , at the age of 47 in 1906 , Workman climbed up to Pinnacle Peak ( 22 @,@ 735 feet or 6 @,@ 930 metres ) ( which she believed to be 23 @,@ 263 feet or 7 @,@ 091 metres ) , a subsidiary peak in the Nun Kun massif of the western Himalaya . It was her greatest mountaineering achievement . As Isserman , Weaver and Molenaar point out , the fact that she " climbed the mountain at all , without benefit of modern equipment and encumbered by her voluminous skirts , speaks to both her ability and resolve " . She set an altitude record for women that would stand until Hetti <unk> 's 1934 ascent of Sia <unk> C ( 23 @,@ 861 feet or 7 @,@ 273 metres ) . Believing that they had both climbed above the 23 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) mark , Fanny and William now considered themselves the leading experts on climbing at altitude . 
 Workman vigorously defended her Pinnacle Peak altitude record against all other claimants , especially Annie Smith Peck . In 1908 , Peck claimed a new record with her climb of Peru 's <unk> , which she believed to be 23 @,@ 000 feet ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) . However , she was misinformed as to the peak 's height and exaggerated distances she could not measure . Workman was so competitive that she paid a team of French surveyors from the Service GÃ©ographique de l 'ArmÃ©e US $ 13 @,@ 000 to measure the elevation of the mountain , which was actually 22 @,@ 205 feet ( 6 @,@ 768 m ) , confirming her record . Pauly explains , " Ironically , her determination to prove herself the equal of any man at lofty elevations culminated with a withering attack on an American woman who tried to surpass her " . Determined to be the best woman , Workman was also a meticulous record @-@ keeper so that she could prove her accomplishments . Pauly concludes , " If Fanny Workman ever receives the recognition she deserves for her feminist determination to excel at this then @-@ male sport , she will surely be remembered as much for her insistence upon accurate record @-@ keeping as for the elevations she achieved . " 
 = = = Hispar and Siachen Glaciers = = = 
 In 1908 , the Workmans returned to the Karakoram and explored the 38 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 61 km ) Hispar Glacier in the <unk> Nagar region ; they went from Gilgit to <unk> over the Hispar pass ( 17 @,@ 500 feet or 5 @,@ 300 metres ) and onto the 37 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 60 km ) Biafo Glacier to <unk> . Their total traverse of the glaciers was another record , and Fanny became the first woman to travel across any Himalayan glacier of this size . They were the first to explore its many side glaciers and the maps created by their Italian porters helped map the region for the first time . They recorded the physiological effects of high altitude , studied glaciers and ice pinnacles , and took meteorological measurements , including altitude data recorded with both aneroid barometers and boiling point thermometers . 
 The Workmans ' exploration of the Rose Glacier and the 45 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 72 km ) Siachen Glacier in Baltistan around <unk> in 1911 and 1912 was the most important achievement of their careers because it was the widest and longest subpolar glacier in the world and at the time , the least explored and accessible glacier as well . For two months , the Workmans explored the 45 @-@ mile glacier , climbed several mountains , and mapped the area . They spent the entire time over 15 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) , the high point being Indira Col which they summitted and named . On this expedition , one of their Italian guides fell into a crevasse and died ; Fanny was lucky to escape . The others were badly shaken but decided to carry on . Fanny led them across the Sia La pass ( 18 @,@ 700 feet or 5 @,@ 700 metres ) near the head of the Siachen Glacier and through a previously unexplored region to the <unk> Glacier . This exploration and the resulting book were among her greatest accomplishments . As she wrote in her book about the trip , Two Summers in the Ice @-@ Wilds of Eastern Karakoram , she organized and led this expedition : " Dr. Hunter Workman accompanied me , this time , in charge with me of commissariat and as photographer and <unk> , but I was the responsible leader of this expedition , and on my efforts , in a large measure , must depend the success or failure of it " . At one 21 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) plateau , Fanny unfurled a " Votes for Women " newspaper and her husband snapped an iconic picture . They took trained Alpine guides and surveyors including Grant Peterkin and Surjan Singh , whose contributions ensured that , unlike numerous other maps the Workmans helped create , their map of the Siachen Glacier remained unchallenged for many years . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 After their 1908 â€“ 12 trip , the couple stopped exploring and turned to writing and lecturing , primarily because of the onset of World War I in 1914 . Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris . She was also one of the first women to be admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society , a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena . She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the American Alpine Club , Royal Asiatic Society , Club Alpino Italiano , Deutscher und Ã–sterreichischer <unk> , and Club <unk> franÃ§ais . She was very proud of these achievements , listing them on the title pages of her books . 
 Fanny Workman fell ill in 1917 and died after a long illness in 1925 in Cannes , France . Her ashes were buried in Massachusetts , and are now reinterred along with her husband 's , under a monument in Worcester Massachusetts ' Rural Cemetery that reads " Pioneer Himalayan Explorers " . In her will , she left $ 125 @,@ 000 to four colleges , Radcliffe , Wellesley , Smith , and Bryn Mawr ; the bequests were demonstrative of her long @-@ lasting interest in the advancement of women 's rights , and her belief that women were the equals of men .

 Along with Annie Smith Peck , Workman was recognized during the early 20th century as one of the most famous female climbers in the world . Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet , and achieve the same accomplishments as male mountaineers . It was not until Peck and Workman 's feats that women had been involved in mountaineering , though they had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s . In the Himalaya , in particular , mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy Englishmen . No other women , however , climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I , by which time improvements in equipment and organization had reduced the risk and the difficulty of the expeditions . 
 Workman , herself an ardent feminist and a supporter of women 's suffrage , wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women 's potential . In her writings , Workman described herself as " questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety " . She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing how easy it was for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot , humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes . Workman challenged a masculine realm ; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced , saying that she " felt that she suffered from ' sex antagonism ' " . The author of the piece added : " it is possible that some unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman 's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man , may in some quarters have existed ... there tended to arise ... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness ? " However , in her study of Victorian mountaineering , Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations , such as in the Himalaya . Colley states , " Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures , up high , above the snow line or in distant regions , women climbers could more fully experience equality and power ... If they chose , they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men . " In her entry about Workman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography , Tingley sums Workman up as " an aggressive , determined , and uncompromising turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ century American woman traveler " and " one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya . She was an outspoken advocate of woman 's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself to be a role model for other women travelers and mountaineers . " 
 As a result of the money Workman left in her will , Wellesley College offers a $ 16 @,@ 000 fellowship named after Fanny Workman for graduate study in any discipline to a Wellesley graduate each year . Bryn Mawr established a Fanny Bullock Workman Traveling Fellowship , which is awarded to Ph.D candidates in Archaeology or Art History when funds permit .

 The many books and articles produced by the Workmans are " still useful " according to Mason , especially for their photographs and illustrations , but their maps are " deceptive and not always reliable " . One assessment states that although the Workmans excelled at describing meteorological conditions , glaciology , and how high altitudes affected human health and fitness , they were poor <unk> . The Workmans were some of the first mountaineers to grasp that the Himalaya were the place for the ultimate climbing challenge and their explorations helped evolve mountaineering from strenuous recreation into a serious , regulated competitive sport . According to Isserman , Weaver and Molenaar , " that the Workmans were intrepid explorers and climbers none could possibly doubt , but they were also aggressive self @-@ promoters who in their eagerness for recognition and honors sometimes exaggerated the originality and significance of what they had done . " In their final assessment , Isserman , Weaver and Molenaar say " they had logged more miles and climbed more peaks than anyone to date ; they had produced five sumptuously illustrated and widely read expedition volumes ; and by simple virtue of her sex Fanny of course had set an invaluable Himalayan precedent . But the Workmans were not great mountaineers . At their best they were vigorous and competent patrons who followed capably in the hard @-@ won steps of their Italian guides . " However , in his chapter on Workman , Pauly writes that " the few recent accounts of Fanny Workman have tended to slight or belittle her achievements , but contemporaries , unaware of the far greater accomplishments to come , held the Workmans in high regard . " They were the first Americans to explore the Himalaya in depth and break the British monopoly over Himalayan mountaineering .

 = Grammy Award for Video of the Year = 
 The Grammy Award for Video of the Year was an honor presented to recording artists at the 24th Grammy Awards in 1982 and the 25th Grammy Awards in 1983 for music videos . The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to " honor artistic achievement , technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position " . 
 First presented in 1982 to Michael Nesmith for Elephant Parts , the award was reserved for quality " video cassettes or discs in any format created specifically for the home video market " . In 1983 , Olivia Newton @-@ John was presented the award for Olivia Physical . Beginning with the 1984 Grammy Awards , the Video of the Year award category was replaced with the categories Best Video , Short Form and Best Video Album ( now known as Best Music Video and Best Music Film , respectively ) . 
 = = Recipients = = 
 Nominees for the 24th Grammy Awards ( 1982 ) , Video of the Year included : Eubie Blake for One Night Stand : A Keyboard Event , the band Blondie for Eat to the Beat , Bruce Seth Green for the <unk> video collection of puzzles and games known as The First National Kidisc , and Michael Nesmith , former member of The Monkees , for the hour @-@ long video Elephant Parts ( also known as Michael Nesmith in Elephant Parts ) . One Night Stand was a recording of a jazz program billed as " an evening of all @-@ stars " at Carnegie Hall , with appearances by Kenny Barron , Arthur Blythe , George Duke , Herbie Hancock , Roland Hanna , Bobby Hutcherson and ten other musicians . Blondie 's video cassette Eat to the Beat accompanied their 1979 album of the same title . The First National Kidisc , one of the first interactive and educational <unk> , contained activities designed for children . Without " fancy digital effects " , Green 's Kidisc provided five to ten hours of interactive capability within a 30 @-@ minute video through the use of dual audio tracks , freeze framing , slow motion , and other techniques . Features included plane flying , jokes , paper plane construction , music performance , and other games . 
 The award went to Nesmith , who is known for creating one of the first companies to distribute television programs and films on home video , and for establishing the television music video format that eventually became MTV . In 1976 , Nesmith produced a video for his song " Rio " , and later incorporated it into the " montage of music and gags " called Elephant Parts after starting the company Pacific Arts Video Records . In 1985 , Elephant Parts was adapted into a seven @-@ episode summer series on NBC titled Michael Nesmith in Television Parts . 
 Nominees for the 25th Grammy Awards included : Elton John for Visions : Elton John , Olivia Newton @-@ John for Olivia Physical , the rock band The Tubes for The Tubes Video , a recording of Jacques Offenbach 's opera The Tales of Hoffman by the Royal Opera conducted by Georges PrÃªtre with PlÃ¡cido Domingo , and the interactive disc for children Fun and Games by various artists ( produced by Margaret Murphy ) . Both Visions and The Tubes Video were directed by Russell Mulcahy . Visions consisted of " artistic " videos for all of the songs on John 's 1981 album The Fox . According to The Tubes ' official site , the now out of print video collection contained music videos primarily for tracks that appeared on their 1981 album The Completion Backward Principle . The award was presented to Newton @-@ John ( then her fourth Grammy Award ) in February 1983 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles . Released a few years following her role in the 1978 film Grease , the aerobics video contained songs from her 1981 album Physical as well as enough sexual innuendo and provocation to generate controversy .

 The Video of the Year category was discontinued with the establishment of the MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 , whose top award is also presented for Video of the Year . The Academy replaced the category with awards for Best Video , Short Form and Best Video Album beginning with the 26th Grammy Awards . For the awards held in 1988 and 1989 , the criteria changed and honors were presented for the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video . The Academy returned to the previous format in 1990 , though the two categories were renamed Best Long Form Music Video ( changed to Best Music Film in 2014 ) and Best Short Form Music Video ( shortened to Best Music Video in 2014 ) respectively .

 = = Background = = 
 In an interview with Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday , lead singer Bart Millard said the idea behind the song was related to the theme of the album The Generous Mr. Lovewell . Millard stated , " The entire album deals with three main aspects of love . The theme of the record is to ' love well ' as Jesus commands us in the greatest commandment . There are songs about inward love such as in our song ' Beautiful . ' There are songs based on ' we love because He first loved us , ' which is the basis of this first single , ' All of Creation ' . " Millard also said , " I set out to write a song that was confessional and refers to the birth , death and resurrection of Jesus in each verse . It was my intent to mention every stage of Christ â€™ s condescension and atoning sacrifice throughout the song . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 " All of Creation " is a Christian rock song with a length of 3 minutes and 56 seconds . It is set in common time and the key of B â™­ major with a steady rock tempo of 104 beats per minute . The song has also been described as ' pop ' and ' worship ' . 
 Lyrical themes in the song include love , life , and belief . Lead singer Bart Millard intended the song to refer to the birth , death , and resurrection of Jesus in each verse . Guitarist Mike Scheuchzer said the song is " a picture of the change we want to see in our own lives . Without love like this , everything we do , everything we are , is in vain . " 
 Millard also noted , " Not a lot of songs mention the foundation of what we believe in . The whole idea that Christ was born of a virgin , he died on the cross , he rose again . Just the basic principles of Christianity " . He also commented that " the song kind of takes us there , I say ' kind of ' because the first line used to be talking about until a child was born , but it was instantly a Christmas song ... but it does , the first verse goes through talking about how we were completely separated until the cross , basically . " Regarding the chorus of the song , Millard said " the whole idea of the chorus and the sense that it brings in , with the tons of voices singing , is the fact that there 's a day thats going to come when we are going to worship and be as one . "

 = Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy = 
 The assassination of Robert Francis " Bobby " Kennedy , a United States Senator and brother of assassinated President John Fitzgerald " Jack " Kennedy , took place shortly after midnight on June 5 , 1968 , in Los Angeles , California , during the campaign season for the 1968 presidential election . 
 After winning the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States , Kennedy was fatally shot as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died in the Good Samaritan Hospital twenty @-@ six hours later . Sirhan Sirhan , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Palestinian / Jordanian immigrant , was convicted of Kennedy 's murder and is serving a life sentence for the crime . The shooting was recorded on audio tape by a freelance newspaper reporter , and the aftermath was captured on film . 
 Kennedy 's body lay in repose at St. Patrick 's Cathedral in New York for two days before a funeral Mass was held on June 8 . His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery . His death prompted the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service . Hubert Humphrey later went on to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency , but ultimately lost the election to Republican Richard Nixon . 
 As with his brother John 's death , Kennedy 's assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned a variety of conspiracy theories . Kennedy remains one of only two sitting United States Senators to be assassinated , the other being Huey Long . 
 = = Background = = 
 Kennedy visited the British Mandate of Palestine in 1948 and wrote dispatches at the time for the Boston Post about his trip and the effect it had on him when he was twenty @-@ two years old . During his stay , he wrote that he grew to admire the Jewish inhabitants of the area . As a Senator , he later became a strong supporter and advocate for Israel . 
 Kennedy was United States Attorney General from January 1961 until September 3 , 1964 , when he resigned to run for election to the United States Senate . He took office as Senator from New York on January 3 , 1965 . 
 The run up to the 1968 presidential election saw the incumbent president , Lyndon B. Johnson , serving during a period of social unrest . There were riots in the major cities despite Johnson 's attempts to introduce anti @-@ poverty and anti @-@ discrimination legislation , and there was significant opposition to the ongoing military action in Vietnam . 
 The assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr. on April 4 , 1968 led to further riots across the US . Kennedy entered the race for the Democratic Party 's nomination for president on March 16 , 1968 â€” four days after Senator Eugene McCarthy received a large percentage of the vote in the New Hampshire primary against the incumbent President ( 42 % to Johnson 's 49 % ) . Two weeks later , a demoralized Johnson announced he was no longer seeking re @-@ election . One month later , Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced he would seek the presidency . Humphrey did not participate in any primaries but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates . Following the California primary , Kennedy was in second place with 393 delegates compared to Humphrey 's 561 and McCarthy â€™ s 258 . 
 = = Assassination = = 
 The 1968 presidential primary elections in California were held on Tuesday , June 4 . The statewide results gave Kennedy 46 % and McCarthy 42 % . Four hours after the polls closed in California , Kennedy claimed victory in the state 's Democratic presidential primary . He spoke by phone with South Dakota Senator George McGovern . At approximately 12 : 10 a.m. PDT on June 5 , he addressed his campaign supporters in the Ambassador Hotel 's Embassy Room ballroom , in the Mid @-@ Wilshire district of Los Angeles . At the time , the government provided Secret Service protection for incumbent presidents but not for presidential candidates . Kennedy 's only security was provided by former FBI agent William Barry and two unofficial bodyguards , former professional athletes . During the campaign , Kennedy had welcomed contact with the public , and people had often tried to touch him in their excitement . 
 Kennedy had planned to walk through the ballroom when he had finished speaking , on his way to another gathering of supporters elsewhere in the hotel . However , with deadlines fast approaching , reporters wanted a press conference . Campaign aide Fred Dutton decided that Kennedy would forgo the second gathering and instead go through the hotel 's kitchen and pantry area behind the ballroom to the press area . Kennedy finished speaking and started to exit when William Barry stopped him and said , " No , it 's been changed . We 're going this way . " Barry and Dutton began clearing a way for Kennedy to go left through swinging doors to the kitchen corridor , but Kennedy , hemmed in by the crowd , followed maÃ®tre d 'hÃ´tel Karl Uecker through a back exit . 
 Uecker led Kennedy through the kitchen area , holding Kennedy 's right wrist but frequently releasing it as Kennedy shook hands with those he encountered . Uecker and Kennedy started down a passageway narrowed by an ice machine against the right wall and a steam table to the left . Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with busboy Juan Romero just as Sirhan Sirhan stepped down from a low tray @-@ stacker beside the ice machine , rushed past Uecker , and repeatedly fired what was later identified as a .22 caliber Iver @-@ Johnson Cadet revolver . 
 After Kennedy had fallen to the floor , Agent Barry saw Sirhan holding a gun and hit him twice in the face while others , including <unk> d ' Uecker and Edward Minasian , writer George Plimpton , Olympic gold medal decathlete Rafer Johnson and former professional football player Rosey Grier of the Los Angeles Rams , forced Sirhan against the steam table and disarmed him as he continued firing his gun in random directions . Five other people were also wounded : William Weisel of ABC News , Paul Schrade of the United Auto Workers union , Democratic Party activist Elizabeth Evans , Ira Goldstein of the Continental News Service and Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll . 
 After a minute , Sirhan wrestled free and grabbed the revolver again , but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued . Barry went to Kennedy and laid his jacket under the candidate 's head , later recalling : " I knew immediately it was a .22 , a small caliber , so I hoped it wouldn 't be so bad , but then I saw the hole in the Senator 's head , and I knew " . Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions , contributing to the confusion and chaos . As Kennedy lay wounded , Juan Romero cradled the senator 's head and placed a rosary in his hand . Kennedy asked Romero , " Is everybody OK ? " and Romero responded , " Yes , everybody 's OK . " Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said , " Everything 's going to be OK . " Captured by Life photographer Bill <unk> and Boris <unk> of the Los Angeles Times , this moment became the iconic image of the assassination . There was some initial confusion in who was shot , one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy 's campaign manager , Stephen Edward Smith . This was quickly realized to be untrue . 
 Kennedy 's wife Ethel stood outside the crush of people at the scene , seeking help . She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him . He turned his head and seemed to recognize her . Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor . After several minutes , medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher , prompting him to whisper , " Don 't lift me ... " which were to become his last words . He lost consciousness shortly thereafter . Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital , where he arrived near death . One doctor slapped his face , calling , " Bob , Bob " , while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy 's heart . After obtaining a good heartbeat , doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband 's heart beating , much to her relief . 
 After about 30 minutes , Kennedy was transferred several blocks to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan for surgery . A gymnasium near the hospital was set up as temporary headquarters for the press and news media to receive updates on the senator 's condition . Surgery began at 3 : 12 a.m. PDT and lasted three hours and 40 minutes . Ten and a half hours later , at 5 : 30 p.m. PDT on Wednesday , spokesman Frank Mankiewicz announced that Kennedy 's doctors were " concerned over his continuing failure to show improvement " ; his condition remained " extremely critical as to life " . 
 Kennedy had been shot three times . One bullet , fired at a range of about 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) , entered behind his right ear , dispersing fragments throughout his brain . The other two entered at the rear of his right armpit ; one exited from his chest and the other lodged in the back of his neck . Despite extensive neurosurgery at the Good Samaritan Hospital to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain , Kennedy died at 1 : 44 A.M. PDT on June 6 , nearly 26 hours after the shooting . 
 After receiving word of Senator Kennedy 's death , his spokesman Frank Mankiewicz left the hospital and walked to the gymnasium where the press and news media were set up for continuous updates on the situation . At 2 : 00 AM PDT on June 6 , Mankiewicz approached the podium , took a few moments to compose himself and made the official announcement : 
 I have , uh , a short ..... I have a short announcement to read , which I will read , uh ..... at this time . Senator Robert Francis Kennedy died at 1 : 44 AM today , June 6 , 1968 . With Senator Kennedy at the time of his death were his wife Ethel , his sisters Mrs. Stephen Smith , Mrs. Patricia Lawford , his brother @-@ in @-@ law Mr. Stephen Smith , and his sister @-@ in @-@ law Mrs. John F. Kennedy . He was 42 years old . Thank you .

 Sirhan Sirhan was a Palestinian Arab with Jordanian citizenship , born in Jerusalem , who held strongly anti @-@ Zionist beliefs . A diary found during a search of Sirhan 's home stated for the entry on May 19 : " My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more and more of an unshakable obsession . RFK must die . RFK must be killed . Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated ..... Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated before 5 June 68 . " It has been suggested that the date of the assassination is significant , because it was the first anniversary of the start of the Six Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors . When Sirhan was booked by police , they found in his pocket a newspaper article that discussed Kennedy 's support for Israel , and at his trial , Sirhan testified that he began to hate Kennedy after learning of this support . In 1989 , he told David Frost : " My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians " . Some scholars believe the assassination was one of the first major incidents of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab â€“ Israeli conflict in the Middle East . 
 The interpretation that he was mostly motivated by Middle Eastern politics has been criticized as an oversimplification that ignores Sirhan 's deeper psychological problems . During his trial , Sirhan 's lawyers attempted to use a defense of diminished responsibility , while their client tried to confess to the crime and change his plea to guilty on several occasions . Sirhan testified that he had killed Kennedy " with 20 years of malice aforethought " . The judge did not accept this confession and it was later withdrawn . 
 Sirhan pleaded guilty on April 17 , 1969 , and six days later , he was sentenced to death . The sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972 after the California Supreme Court , in its decision in California v. Anderson , invalidated all pending death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972 . Since that time , Sirhan has been denied parole fifteen times and is currently confined at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in southern San Diego County . Sirhan 's lawyers have claimed that he was framed , and Sirhan claims to have no memory of his crime . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 As the shooting took place , ABC News was signing off from its electoral broadcast , while the CBS broadcast was already over . It was not until 21 minutes after the shots that CBS 's coverage of the shooting would begin . The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy 's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability . ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC , all of ABC 's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white . CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting 's aftermath on color film , which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident . 
 Reporter Andrew West of <unk> , a Mutual Broadcasting System radio affiliate in Los Angeles , captured on audio tape the sounds of the immediate aftermath of the shooting but not the actual shooting itself . Using his reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape recorder and attached microphone , West had just recorded the senator 's victory speech . With the audio still rolling , West asked the Senator the following question : 
 Andrew West : " Senator , how are you going to counter Mr. Humphrey and his <unk> you as far as the delegate votes go ? " 
 Senator Kennedy : " It just goes back to the struggle for it . " 
 After this brief exchange , West turned off his tape recorder and followed Kennedy and his entourage to the kitchen pantry . Just a few minutes later , seconds after Kennedy was shot , West turned his recorder on again and started reporting the sudden developments ..... 
 Andrew West : " Senator Kennedy has been shot ! Senator Kennedy has been shot ; is that possible ? Is that possible ? It 's ..... is it possible , ladies and gentlemen ? It is possible , he has ..... not only Senator Kennedy , oh my God . Senator Kennedy has been shot , and another man , a Kennedy campaign manager , and possibly shot in the head . " 
 Several seconds later , West gave an on @-@ the @-@ spot account of the struggle with Sirhan in the hotel kitchen pantry , shouting at Rafer Johnson to " Get the gun , Rafer , get the gun ! " and telling others to " get a hold of [ Sirhan 's ] thumb and break it , if you have to ! Get his thumb ! Hold him , hold him ! We don 't want another Oswald ! " 
 Over the following week , NBC devoted 55 hours to the shooting and aftermath , ABC 43 , and CBS 42 , with all three networks preempting their regular coverage and advertisements to cover the story . 
 = = Conspiracy theories = = 
 As with the 1963 assassination of his brother , President John F. Kennedy , Robert Kennedy 's death has been the subject of widespread analysis . Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative scenarios for the crime , or have argued that there are serious problems with the official case . 
 = = = CIA involvement theory = = = 
 In November 2006 , the BBC 's Newsnight program presented research by filmmaker Shane O 'Sullivan alleging that several CIA officers were present on the night of the assassination . Three men who appear in films and photographs from the night of the assassination were positively identified by former colleagues and associates as former senior CIA officers who had worked together in 1963 at JMWAVE , the CIA 's main anti @-@ Castro station based in Miami . They were JMWAVE Chief of Operations David Morales , Chief of Maritime Operations Gordon Campbell and Chief of Psychological Warfare Operations George <unk> . 
 The program featured an interview with Morales 's former attorney Robert Walton , who quoted him as having said , " I was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard . " O 'Sullivan reported that the CIA declined to comment on the officers in question . It was also alleged that Morales was known for his deep anger toward the Kennedys for what he saw as their betrayal during the Bay of Pigs Invasion . 
 = = = Second gunman theory = = = 
 The location of Kennedy 's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him , but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east . This has led to the suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot , a possibility supported by coroner Thomas Noguchi who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy 's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch . Other witnesses , though , said that as Sirhan approached , Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands , facing north and so exposing his right side . During a re @-@ examination of the case in 1975 , the Los Angeles Superior Court ordered expert examination of the possibility of a second gun having been used , and the conclusion of the experts was that there was little or no evidence to support this theory . As recently as 2008 , eyewitness John Pilger asserted his belief that there must have been a second gunman . 
 In 2007 , analysis of an audio tape recording of the shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw <unk> appeared to indicate , according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag , that thirteen shots were fired , even though Sirhan 's gun held only eight rounds . Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible . The presence of more than eight shots on the tape was corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul <unk> of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena , California , forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen , Denmark , and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , Georgia . Some other acoustic experts , however , have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on the audio tape . 
 On February 22 , 2012 , Sirhan 's lawyers , William Pepper and Laurie <unk> , filed a court brief in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles claiming that a second gunman fired the shots that killed Kennedy . It was the fourth and final in a series of federal briefs filed under the writ of habeas corpus by Pepper and <unk> beginning in October 2010 . A ruling is now pending in the Sirhan federal case .

 Kennedy 's younger brother , Edward Moore " Ted " Kennedy , eulogized him with the words : 
 My brother need not be idealized , or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life ; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man , who saw wrong and tried to right it , saw suffering and tried to heal it , saw war and tried to stop it . Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today , pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world . As he said many times , in many parts of this nation , to those he touched and who sought to touch him : " Some men see things as they are and say why . I dream things that never were and say why not . " 
 Immediately following the mass , Kennedy 's body was transported by a slow @-@ moving train to Washington , D.C. , and thousands of mourners lined the tracks and stations , paying their respects as the train passed by . 
 On the way to the cemetery , the funeral procession passed through Resurrection City , a shantytown protest set up as part of the Poor People 's Campaign . The procession stopped in front of the Lincoln Memorial , where residents of Resurrection City joined the group and sang " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " . 
 Kennedy was buried near his older brother John , in Arlington National Cemetery , in the first burial ever to take place there at night ; the second was the burial of his younger brother Ted . 
 After Kennedy 's assassination , Congress altered the Secret Service 's mandate to include protection for presidential candidates . The remaining candidates were immediately protected under an executive order issued by Lyndon Johnson , putting a strain on the poorly resourced Secret Service .

 At the time of his death , Kennedy was substantially behind Humphrey in convention delegate support , but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary . Only thirteen states held primaries that year , meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference . Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr . , and others have argued that Kennedy 's broad appeal and charisma would have been sufficiently convincing at the 1968 Democratic National Convention to give him the nomination . Historian Michael <unk> believed , however , that Kennedy would not have secured the nomination . Humphrey , after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets , was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground . He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of 43 @.@ 4 % to 42 @.@ 7 % . Nixon won by a more decisive 301 @-@ 191 margin in the electoral vote .

 Kennedy 's assassination was a blow to the optimism for a brighter future that his campaign brought for many Americans who lived through the turbulent 1960s . Juan Romero , the busboy who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot , later said , " It made me realize that no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second . " 
 Jack Newfield , a reporter that had been traveling with the campaign , expressed his feelings on the effect of the assassination , closing his memoir on Kennedy with : 
 Now I realized what makes our generation unique , what defines us apart from those who came before the hopeful winter of 1961 , and those who came after the murderous spring of 1968 . We are the first generation that learned from experience , in our innocent twenties , that things were not really getting better , that we shall not overcome . We felt , by the time we reached thirty , that we had already glimpsed the most compassionate leaders our nation could produce , and they had all been assassinated . And from this time forward , things would get worse : our best political leaders were part of memory now , not hope . 
 The stone was at the bottom of the hill and we were all alone .

 After the failed campaign of preservationists to preserve the Ambassador Hotel where Kennedy was shot , the hotel was demolished in 2005 â€“ 2006 , with the last section of the Ambassador falling in January 2006 , leaving only the annex that housed the hotel entrance , a shopping arcade , the coffee shop , and the historic Cocoanut Grove , all of which were promised to be preserved in some manner . From 2006 to 2010 , six new schools were built on the site and named the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools . Plans to re @-@ create the pantry in the area of the school complex and create a museum , dedicated to Kennedy 's assassination , fell through after commission chairman Cruz Reynoso , a former state Supreme Court justice , said in court , " We didn 't want to celebrate the death . We wanted to celebrate his life , particularly his ideals . " 
 The handcuffs that were used by now @-@ retired police officer Arturo <unk> to arrest Sirhan Sirhan are now part of the collection of the upcoming National Law Enforcement Museum in Washington , D.C .. 
 The blood @-@ stained suit coat , shorts , shirt , belt , tie and socks which Kennedy wore when he was shot are now in the possession of the Los Angeles County District Attorney . Controversy arose in 2010 when Kennedy 's clothing was transported to the California Homicide Investigators Association conference in Las Vegas , where they were included in a temporary public display of never @-@ before @-@ seen artifacts from famous crime scenes , related to prolific serial killers and infamous murders , such as the Black Dahlia murder and the murder of Hollywood actress Sharon Tate . The items and Kennedy 's clothing were subsequently removed from the exhibit and returned to the LAPD vault , with the LAPD apologizing to the Kennedy family . 
 Until 1987 , the LAPD retained the original files , reports , transcripts , fragments of the bullets that struck Kennedy and the four other bystanders in the kitchen pantry , the .22 caliber Iver @-@ Johnson handgun used by Sirhan , Kennedy 's blood @-@ stained clothes , and numerous other artifacts related to the assassination . In 1987 , the LAPD donated the entire evidence collection ( except for Kennedy 's clothes which remain in possession of the LAPD ) to the California State Archives in Sacramento for permanent preservation . The collection remains in the California State Archives . 
 The Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Archives at Southeastern Massachusetts University also contain a large collection of materials on the Robert Kennedy assassination . Included among these records are files donated by several writers and researchers and materials purchased from the National Archives and Records Administration @-@ Pacific Southwest Region , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office , and the FBI . Another source of information on the case is the Assassination Archives and Research Center . The Center maintains an extensive collection of government documents , interviews , unpublished manuscripts , photographs , audio tapes , and secondary works . 
 Some items - such as the bullet @-@ pocked ceiling tiles - were removed long ago and intentionally destroyed by the LAPD and not used in Sirhan 's trial . A large number of the photographs of the pantry area and the tapes of the recorded interviews with individuals who were present during the assassination suffered a similar fate . Conspiracy theorists today believe that the destroyed evidence was vital as it proved that Sirhan Sirhan may have had an accomplice and there has been a cover @-@ up , similar to the assassination of John Kennedy , Robert Kennedy 's brother . Furnishings from the defunct Ambassador Hotel , ranging from bedroom furniture to silver champagne buckets , were auctioned off over the years until the hotel 's demolition . 
 = Watchmen = 
 Watchmen is an American comic @-@ book limited series published by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 , and collected in 1987 . The series was created by a British collaboration consisting of writer Alan Moore , artist Dave Gibbons , and colorist John Higgins . Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics . As Moore 's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories , managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead . 
 Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct and parody the superhero concept . Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s , helping the United States to win the Vietnam War . In 1985 , the country is edging toward nuclear war with the Soviet Union , freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government . The story focuses on the personal development and moral struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement . 
 Creatively , the focus of Watchmen is on its structure . Gibbons used a nine @-@ panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood @-@ stained smiley face . All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series ' backstory , and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story , an in @-@ story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter , which one of the characters reads . Structured , at times , as a nonlinear narrative , the story skips through space , time and plot . In the same manner , entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity , coincidence and repeated imagery . 
 A commercial success , Watchmen has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press , and is considered by several critics and reviewers to be one of the most significant works of 20th @-@ century literature . Watchmen was recognized in Time 's List of the 100 Best Novels as one of the best English language novels published since 1923 , and placed # 91 on The Comics Journal 's list of the top 100 comics of the 20th century . 
 After a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film , director Zack Snyder 's Watchmen was released in 2009 . A video game series , Watchmen : The End Is Nigh , was released in the same year to coincide with the film 's release . In 2012 , DC Comics published Before Watchmen , a comic @-@ book series acting as a prequel to the original Watchmen series , without Moore and Gibbons ' involvement . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Watchmen , created by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons , was first published as a 12 @-@ issue miniseries from DC Comics , cover @-@ dated September 1986 to October 1987 . It was subsequently collected in 1987 as a DC Comics trade paperback that has had at least 22 printings as of September 2008 ; as well , a trade paperback was published by Warner Books , a DC sister company , in 1987 . 
 In February 1988 , DC published a limited @-@ edition , slipcased hardcover volume , produced by Graphitti Design , that contained 48 pages of bonus material , including the original proposal and concept art . In 2005 , DC released Absolute Watchmen , an oversized slipcased hardcover edition of the series in DC 's Absolute Edition format . Assembled under the supervision of Dave Gibbons , Absolute Watchmen included the Graphitti materials , as well as restored and recolored art by John Higgins . That December DC published a new printing of Watchmen issue # 1 at the original 1986 cover price of $ 1 @.@ 50 as part of its " Millennium Edition " line . 
 In 2012 , DC launched a prequel line , with various creative teams producing the characters ' early adventures before the events of the graphic novel . 
 In 2016 DC Universe : Rebirth one @-@ shot , numerous symbols of Watchmen , such as the blood @-@ splattered smiley face , and the dialogue between Doctor Manhattan and Ozymandias in the last issue of Watchmen is shown . Further Watchmen imagery was added in the DC Universe : Rebirth Special # 1 second printing , which featured an update to Gary Frank 's cover , better revealing the outstretched hand of Doctor Manhattan in the top right corner . 
 = = Background and creation = = 
 In 1985 , DC Comics acquired a line of characters from Charlton Comics . During that period , writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp , as he had done in his <unk> series in the early 1980s . Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics ' Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project , so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbour . The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used , as long as readers recognized them " so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was " . Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker , and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano . Giordano was receptive to the proposal , but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story . Moore said , " DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional . " Instead , Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters . Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers , but later changed his mind . He said , " Eventually , I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough , so that they seemed familiar in certain ways , certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super @-@ hero resonance or familiarity to the reader , then it might work . " 
 Artist Dave Gibbons , who had collaborated with Moore on previous projects , recalled he " must have heard on the grapevine that he was doing a treatment for a new miniseries . I rang Alan up , saying I â€™ d like to be involved with what he was doing . " and Moore sent him the story outline . Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved . Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his " unusual " style ; Higgins lived near the artist , which allowed the two to " discuss [ the art ] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean " . Len Wein joined the project as its editor , while Giordano stayed on to oversee it . Both Wein and Giordano stood back and " got out of their way " ; Giordano remarked later , " Who copy @-@ edits Alan Moore , for God 's sake ? " 
 After receiving the go @-@ ahead to work on the project , Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter 's house creating characters , crafting details for the story 's milieu and discussing influences . The pair was particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named " Superduperman " ; Moore said , " We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees â€” dramatic , instead of comedic " . Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take " familiar old @-@ fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm " ; the writer said his intention was to create " a superhero Moby Dick ; something that had that sort of weight , that sort of density " . The writer came up with the character names and descriptions , but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons . Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately , but rather " did it at odd times ... spend [ ing ] maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches . " Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw ; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because " you just have to draw a hat . If you can draw a hat , then you 've drawn Rorschach , you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you 're done . " 
 Moore began writing the series very early on , hoping to avoid publication delays such as those faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000 . When writing the script for the first issue , Moore said he realized , " I only had enough plot for six issues . We were contracted for 12 ! " His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters . Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from . Gibbons recalled that " [ t ] he script for the first issue of Watchmen was , I think , 101 pages of typescript â€” single @-@ spaced â€” with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or , indeed , even between the pages . " Upon receiving the scripts , the artist had to number each page " in case I drop them on the floor , because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order " , and used a <unk> pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions ; he remarked , " It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper . " Despite Moore 's detailed scripts , his panel descriptions would often end with the note " If that doesn 't work for you , do what works best " ; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore 's instructions . In fact , Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script : a compression of Ozymandias ' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach , as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed ; Moore agreed and re @-@ wrote the scene . Gibbons had a great deal of autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen , and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later . Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues . 
 Despite his intentions , Moore admitted in November 1986 that there were likely to be delays , stating that he was , with issue five on the stands , still writing issue nine . Gibbons mentioned that a major factor in the delays was the " piecemeal way " in which he received Moore 's scripts . Gibbons said the team 's pace slowed around the fourth issue ; from that point onward the two undertook their work " just several pages at a time . I 'll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end , call him up and say , ' Feed me ! ' And he 'll send another two or three pages or maybe one page or sometimes six pages . " As the creators began to hit deadlines , Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50 miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons . On later issues the artist even had his wife and son draw panel grids on pages to help save time . 
 Near the end of the project , Moore realized that the story bore some similarity to " The Architects of Fear " , an episode of The Outer Limits television series . The writer and Wein argued over changing the ending , and when Moore refused to give in , Wein quit the book . Wein explained , " I kept telling him , ' Be more original , Alan , you 've got the capability , do something different , not something that 's already been done ! ' And he didn 't seem to care enough to do that . " Moore acknowledged the Outer Limits episode by referencing it in the series ' last issue . 
 = = Story = = 
 Watchmen is set in an alternate reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s . The primary difference is the presence of superheroes . The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938 . Their existence in this version of America is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real @-@ world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon . In keeping with the realism of the series , although the costumed <unk> of Watchmen are commonly called " superheroes " , only one ( Doctor Manhattan ) possesses any superhuman powers . The war in Vietnam ends with a U.S. victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 . The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan occurs approximately six years later than in real life . When the story begins , the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union , which has increased tensions between the two nations . Eventually , superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public , leading to the passage of legislation ( the Keene Act ) in 1977 to outlaw them . While many of the heroes retired , Doctor Manhattan and a veteran superhero known as The Comedian operate as government @-@ sanctioned agents . Another , Rorschach , continues to operate outside the law . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 In October 1985 , New York City police are investigating the murder of Edward Blake . With the police having no leads , costumed vigilante Rorschach decides to probe further . Discovering Blake to be the face behind The Comedian , a costumed hero employed by the United States government , Rorschach believes he has discovered a plot to terminate costumed adventurers and sets about warning four of his retired comrades : Dan Dreiberg ( formerly the second Nite Owl ) , the superpowered and emotionally detached Doctor Manhattan and his lover Laurie Juspeczyk ( the second Silk Spectre ) , and Adrian Veidt ( once the hero Ozymandias , and now a successful businessman ) . 
 After Blake 's funeral , Manhattan is accused on national television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues . When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously , Manhattan exiles himself to Mars . As Manhattan is one of the United States ' greatest military powers , his departure throws humanity into political turmoil , with the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness . Rorschach 's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt , and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch , a former supervillain . 
 Neglected in her relationship with the once @-@ human Manhattan , whose now @-@ godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government , Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg ; they begin a romance , don their costumes , and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together . With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach 's conspiracy theory , the pair take it upon themselves to break him out of prison . Manhattan , after looking back on his own personal history , places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk 's hands . He teleports her to Mars to make the case for emotional investment . During the course of the argument , Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake , who once attempted to rape her mother , was in fact her biological father following a second , consensual relationship . This discovery , reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships , re @-@ sparks Manhattan 's interest in humanity . 
 On Earth , Nite Owl and Rorschach continue to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Manhattan into exile . They discover evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan . Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal , in which he has been recording his entire investigation , and mails it to New Frontiersman , a local right @-@ wing newspaper . The pair then leave New York and confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat . Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City , which will annihilate half the city 's population . He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived common enemy . He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian , arranged for Dr. Manhattan 's past associates to contract cancer , staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion , and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach . This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed . Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt 's logic callous and abhorrent , but Veidt has already enacted his plan . 
 When Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on Earth , they are confronted by mass destruction and wide scale death in New York City , with a gigantic Cthulhu @-@ like creature , created by Veidt 's laboratories , dead in the middle of the city . Manhattan notices his abilities are limited by <unk> emanating from the Antarctic , and the pair teleport there . They discover Veidt 's involvement and confront him . Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming the cessation of global hostilities and cooperation against a new threat ; this leads almost all present to agree that concealing Veidt 's truth from the public is in the best interests of the world to keep it united . Rorschach refuses to compromise and leaves , intent on revealing the truth . As he is making his way back , he is confronted by Manhattan . Rorschach tells Manhattan that he will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt and his actions , and Manhattan responds by vaporizing him . Manhattan then wanders through the base and finds Veidt , who asks him if he did the right thing in the end . In response , Manhattan states that " Nothing ever ends " before leaving the Earth to create life elsewhere . Dreiberg and Juspeczyk go into hiding under new identities and continue their romance . Back in New York , the editor at New Frontiersman complains about having to pull a two @-@ page column about Russia due to the new political climate . He asks his assistant to find some filler material from the " crank file " , a collection of rejected submissions to the paper , many of which have not been reviewed yet . The series ends with the young man reaching toward the pile of discarded submissions , near the top of which is Rorschach 's journal . 
 = = Characters = = 
 With Watchmen , Alan Moore 's intention was to create four or five " radically opposing ways " to perceive the world and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible . Moore did not believe in the notion of " [ cramming ] regurgitated morals " down the readers ' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light . Moore said , " What we wanted to do was show all of these people , warts and all . Show that even the worst of them had something going for them , and even the best of them had their flaws . " 
 Walter Joseph Kovacs / Rorschach 
 A vigilante who wears a white mask that contains a symmetrical but constantly shifting ink blot pattern , he continues to fight crime in spite of his outlaw status . Moore said he was trying to " come up with this quintessential Steve Ditko character â€” someone who 's got a funny name , whose surname begins with a ' K , ' who 's got an oddly designed mask " . Moore based Rorschach on Ditko 's creation Mr. A ; Ditko 's Charlton character The Question also served as a template for creating Rorschach . Comics historian Bradford W. Wright described the character 's world view " a set of black @-@ and @-@ white values that take many shapes but never mix into shades of gray , similar to the ink blot tests of his namesake " . Rorschach sees existence as random and , according to Wright , this viewpoint leaves the character " free to ' scrawl [ his ] own design ' on a ' morally blank world ' " . Moore said he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in him not surviving the story . 
 Edward Blake / The Comedian 
 One of two government @-@ sanctioned heroes ( along with Doctor Manhattan ) who remain active after the Keene Act is passed in 1977 to ban superheroes . His murder , which occurs shortly before the first chapter begins , sets the plot of Watchmen in motion . The character appears throughout the story in flashbacks and aspects of his personality are revealed by other characters . The Comedian was based on the Charlton Comics character Peacemaker , with elements of the Marvel Comics spy character Nick Fury added . Moore and Gibbons saw The Comedian as " a kind of Gordon Liddy character , only a much bigger , tougher guy " . Richard Reynolds described The Comedian as " ruthless , cynical , and nihilistic , and yet capable of deeper insights than the others into the role of the costumed hero . " He attempts to rape the first Silk Spectre in the 1940s . Issue nine reveals that years later he fathered her daughter Laurie as part of a consensual sexual relationship . 
 Dr. Jon Osterman / Doctor Manhattan 
 A superpowered being who is contracted by the United States government . Scientist Jon Osterman gained power over matter when he was caught in an " Intrinsic Field <unk> " in 1959 . Doctor Manhattan was based upon Charlton 's Captain Atom , who in Moore 's original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat . However , the writer found he could do more with Manhattan as a " kind of a quantum super @-@ hero " than he could have with Captain Atom . In contrast to other superheroes who lacked scientific exploration of their origins , Moore sought to delve into nuclear physics and quantum physics in constructing the character of Dr. Manhattan . The writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective , which would influence the character 's perception of human affairs . Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like Spock from Star Trek , so he sought for Dr. Manhattan to retain " human habits " and to grow away from them and humanity in general . Gibbons had created the blue character Rogue Trooper , and explained he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it resembles white skin tonally , but has a different hue . Moore incorporated the color into the story , and Gibbons noted the rest of the comic 's color scheme made Manhattan unique . Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude , which partially influenced how they portrayed the character . Gibbons wanted to be tasteful in depicting Manhattan 's nudity , selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him " understated " genitals â€” like a classical sculpture â€” so the reader would not initially notice it . 
 Daniel Dreiberg / Nite Owl 
 A retired superhero who utilizes owl @-@ themed gadgets . Nite Owl was based on the Ted Kord version of the Blue Beetle . Paralleling the way Ted Kord had a predecessor , Moore also incorporated an earlier adventurer who used the name " Nite Owl " , the retired crime fighter Hollis Mason , into Watchmen . While Moore devised character notes for Gibbons to work from , the artist provided a name and a costume design for Hollis Mason he had created when he was twelve . Richard Reynolds noted in Super Heroes : A Modern Mythology that despite the character 's Charlton roots , Nite Owl 's modus operandi has more in common with the DC Comics character Batman . According to Klock , his civilian form " visually suggests an impotent , middle @-@ aged Clark Kent . " 
 Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias 
 Drawing inspiration from Alexander the Great , Veidt was once the superhero Ozymandias , but has since retired to devote his attention to the running of his own enterprises . Veidt is believed to be the smartest man on the planet . Ozymandias was based on Peter Cannon , Thunderbolt ; Moore liked the idea of a character who " us [ ed ] the full 100 % of his brain " and " [ had ] complete physical and mental control " . Richard Reynolds noted that by taking initiative to " help the world " , Veidt displays a trait normally attributed to villains in superhero stories , and in a sense he is the " villain " of the series . Gibbons noted , " One of the worst of his sins [ is ] kind of looking down on the rest of humanity , scorning the rest of humanity . " 
 Laurie Juspeczyk / Silk Spectre 
 The daughter of Sally Jupiter ( the first Silk Spectre , with whom she has a strained relationship ) and The Comedian . Of Polish heritage , she had been the lover of Doctor Manhattan for years . While Silk Spectre was based partially on the Charlton character Nightshade , Moore was not impressed by the character and drew more from heroines such as Black Canary and Phantom Lady . 
 = = Art and composition = = 
 Moore and Gibbons designed Watchmen to showcase the unique qualities of the comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths . In a 1986 interview , Moore said , " What I 'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating " , and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film . Moore said that Watchmen was designed to be read " four or five times " , with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings . Dave Gibbons notes that , " [ a ] s it progressed , Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself . The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin , a gimmick ... So really the plot itself is of no great consequence ... it just really isn 't the most interesting thing about Watchmen . As we actually came to tell the tale , that 's where the real creativity came in . " 
 Gibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of Watchmen so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and " not some other comic book " . He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different than that commonly seen in comics . The artist tried to draw the series with " a particular weight of line , using a hard , stiff pen that didn 't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin " which he hoped " would differentiate it from the usual lush , fluid kind of comic book line " . In a 2009 interview , Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons ' training as a former surveyor for " including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel , so we could choreograph every little thing " . Gibbons described the series as " a comic about comics " . Gibbons felt that " Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [ the presence of super @-@ heroes ] and I 've gotten involved in the technical implications . " The story 's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape , such as adding electric cars , slightly different buildings , and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants , which Moore said , " perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would " . Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books . 
 Colorist John Higgins used a template that was " moodier " and favored secondary colors . Moore stated that he had also " always loved John 's coloring , but always associated him with being an airbrush colorist " , which Moore was not fond of ; Higgins subsequently decided to color Watchmen in European @-@ style flat color . Moore noted that the artist paid particular attention to lighting and subtle color changes ; in issue six , Higgins began with " warm and cheerful " colors and throughout the issue gradually made it darker to give the story a dark and bleak feeling . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Structurally , certain aspects of Watchmen deviated from the norm in comic books at the time , particularly the panel layout and the coloring . Instead of panels of various sizes , the creators divided each page into a nine @-@ panel grid . Gibbons favored the nine @-@ panel grid system due to its " authority " . Moore accepted the use of the nine @-@ panel grid format , which " gave him a level of control over the storytelling he hadn 't had previously " , according to Gibbons . " There was this element of the pacing and visual impact that he could now predict and use to dramatic effect . " <unk> Stewart of The Comics Journal mentioned to Gibbons in 1987 , that the page layouts recalled those of EC Comics , in addition to the art itself , which Stewart felt particularly echoed that of John Severin . Gibbons agreed that the echoing of the EC @-@ style layouts " was a very deliberate thing " , although his inspiration was rather Harvey Kurtzman , but it was altered enough to give the series a unique look . The artist also cited Steve Ditko 's work on early issues of The Amazing Spider @-@ Man as an influence , as well as Doctor Strange , where " even at his most psychedelic [ he ] would still keep a pretty straight page layout " . 
 The cover of each issue serves as the first panel to the story . Gibbons said , " The cover of the Watchmen is in the real world and looks quite real , but it 's starting to turn into a comic book , a portal to another dimension . " The covers were designed as close @-@ ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present . The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents . Gibbons drew issue five , titled " Fearful Symmetry " , so the first page mirrors the last ( in terms of frame disposition ) , with the following pages mirroring each other before the center @-@ spread is ( broadly ) symmetrical in layout . 
 The end of each issue , with the exception of issue twelve , contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore . Among the contents are fictional book chapters , letters , reports , and articles written by various Watchmen characters . DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen , which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue . DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space , but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series . He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series ' backstory . Moore said , " By the time we got around to issue # 3 , # 4 , and so on , we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page . It looks less like a comic book , so we stuck with it . " 
 = = = Tales of the Black Freighter = = = 
 Watchmen features a story within a story in the form of Tales of the Black Freighter , a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three , five , eight , ten , and eleven . The fictional comic 's story , " Marooned " , is read by a youth in New York City . Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of Watchmen experience superheroes in real life , " they probably wouldn 't be at all interested in superhero comics . " Gibbons suggested a pirate theme , and Moore agreed in part because he is " a big Bertolt Brecht fan " : the Black Freighter alludes to the song " <unk> " ( " Pirate Jenny " ) from Brecht 's Threepenny Opera . Moore theorized that since superheroes existed , and existed as " objects of fear , loathing , and scorn , the main superheroes quickly fell out of popularity in comic books , as we suggest . Mainly , genres like horror , science fiction , and piracy , particularly piracy , became prominent â€” with EC riding the crest of the wave . " Moore felt " the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of Watchmen " . The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presentation in the story would add subtext and allegory . The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of Tales of the Black Freighter at the end of issue five credits real @-@ life artist Joe Orlando as a major contributor to the series . Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the Watchmen universe that DC editor Julius Schwartz might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book . Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were a page from the fake title to the supplemental piece . 
 In " Marooned " , a young mariner ( called " The Sea Captain " ) journeys to warn his home town of the coming of the Black Freighter , after he survives the destruction of his own ship . He uses the bodies of his dead shipmates as a makeshift raft . When he finally returns home , believing it to be already under the occupation of the Black Freighter 's crew , he kills an innocent couple and then attacks his own wife in their darkened home , mistaking her for a pirate . After realizing what he has done , he returns to the sea shore , where he finds that the Black Freighter has not come to claim the town ; it has come to claim him . He swims out to sea and climbs aboard the ship . According to Richard Reynold , the mariner is " forced by the urgency of his mission to shed one inhibition after another . " Just like Adrian Veidt , he " hopes to stave off disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means of reaching his goal " . Moore stated that the story of The Black Freighter ends up specifically describing " the story of Adrian Veidt " and that it can also be used as a counterpoint to other parts of the story , such as Rorschach 's capture and Dr. Manhattan 's self @-@ exile on Mars . 
 = = = Symbols and imagery = = = 
 Moore named William S. Burroughs as one of his main influences during the conception of Watchmen . He admired Burroughs ' use of " repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning " in Burroughs ' only comic strip , " The Unspeakable Mr. Hart " , which appeared in the British underground magazine Cyclops . Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore , who remarked that " there 's stuff in there Dave had put in that even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read " , while other " things ... turned up in there by accident . " 
 A stained smiley face is a recurring image in the story , appearing in many forms . In The System of Comics , Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as a recurring motif that produces " rhyme and remarkable configurations " by appearing in key segments of Watchmen , notably the first and last pages of the series - spattered with blood on the first , and sauce from a hamburger on the last . Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story , as a " recurrent geometric motif " and due to its symbolic connotations . Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian 's costume in order to " lighten " the overall design , later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder . Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood @-@ stained smiley face as " a symbol for the whole series " , noting its resemblance to the Doomsday Clock ticking up to midnight . Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of behaviorism , explaining that the tests had presented the face as " a symbol of complete innocence " . With the addition of a blood splash over the eye , the face 's meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue 's cover to avoid human detail . Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose , others were coincidental . Moore mentioned in particular that " the little plugs on the spark hydrants , if you turn them upside down , you discover a little smiley face " . 
 Other symbols , images and allusion that appeared throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly . Moore mentioned that " [ t ] he whole thing with Watchmen has just been loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping up all over the place " . Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic , citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl 's airship . In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars , Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater , which resembles a happy face , which they worked into an issue . Moore said , " We found a lot of these things started to generate themselves as if by magic " , in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the " Gordian Knot Lock Company " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The initial premise for the series was to examine what superheroes would be like " in a credible , real world " . As the story became more complex , Moore said Watchmen became about " power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society . " The title of the series refers to the question " Who watches the watchmen ? " , famously posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal ( as " Quis <unk> <unk> <unk> ? " ) , although Moore was not aware of the phrase 's classical origins until Harlan Ellison informed him about them . Moore commented in 1987 , " In the context of Watchmen , that fits . ' They 're watching out for us , who 's watching out for them ? ' " The writer stated in the introduction to the Graphitti hardcover of Watchmen that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes , and instead he found an interest in real human beings . 
 Bradford Wright described Watchmen as " Moore 's obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular . " Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context , Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore 's " admonition to those who trusted in ' heroes ' and leaders to guard the world 's fate . " He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to " the Reagans , Thatchers , and other ' Watchmen ' of the world who supposed to ' rescue ' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process " . Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be " not anti @-@ Americanism , [ but ] anti @-@ Reaganism " , specifically believing that " at the moment a certain part of Reagan 's America isn 't scared . They think they 're invulnerable . " Before the series premiered , Gibbons stated " There 's no overt political message at all . It 's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America , then they 're reading it into the comic .... " While Moore wanted to write about " power politics " and the " worrying " times he lived in , he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would " switch off " if he attacked a leader they admired . Moore stated in 1986 that he " was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy . " 
 Citing Watchmen as the point where the comic book medium " came of age " , Iain Thomson wrote in his essay " Deconstructing the Hero " that the story accomplished this by " developing its heroes precisely in order to deconstruct the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground " . Thomson stated that the heroes in Watchmen almost all share a nihilistic outlook , and that Moore presents this outlook " as the simple , unvarnished truth " to " deconstruct the would @-@ be hero 's ultimate motivation , namely , to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality " . He wrote that the story " develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us if we would not in fact be better off without heroes " . Thomson added that the story 's deconstruction of the hero concept " suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed " , which he feels distinguishes " this postmodern work " from the deconstructions of the hero in the existentialism movement . Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story , the superheroes of Watchmen are forced to confront " more intangible social and moral concerns " , adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre . Reynolds concludes that the series ' ironic self @-@ awareness of the genre " all mark out Watchmen either as the last key superhero text , or the first in a new maturity of the genre " . 
 Geoff Klock eschewed the term " deconstruction " in favor of describing Watchmen as a " revisionary superhero narrative . " He considers Watchmen and Frank Miller 's Batman : The Dark Knight Returns to be " the first instances ... of [ a ] new kind of comic book ... a first phase of development , the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature . " He elaborates by noting that " Alan Moore 's realism ... performs a kenosis towards comic book history ... [ which ] does not ennoble and empower his characters ... Rather , it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history ... devalue [ ing ] one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world " . First and foremost , " Moore 's exploration of the [ often sexual ] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories , and forces the reader to reevaluate â€” to revision â€” every superhero in terms of Moore 's kenosis â€” his emptying out of the tradition . " Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself . The deconstructive nature of Watchmen is , Klock notes , played out on the page also as , " [ l ] ike Alan Moore 's kenosis , [ Veidt ] must destroy , then reconstruct , in order to build ' a unity which would survive him . ' " 
 Moore has expressed dismay that " [ t ] he gritty , <unk> postmodern superhero comic , as exemplified by Watchmen ... became a genre " . He said in 2003 that " to some degree there has been , in the 15 years since Watchmen , an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim , pessimistic , nasty , violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are , in effect , often just some very nasty stories that don 't have a lot to recommend them . " Gibbons said that while readers " were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing " , he said in his view the series was " a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else . " 
 = = Publication and reception = = 
 Watchmen was first mentioned publicly in the 1985 Amazing Heroes Preview . When Moore and Gibbons turned in the first issue of their series to DC , Gibbons recalled , " What really clinched it ... was [ writer / artist ] Howard Chaykin , who doesn 't give praise lightly , and who came up and said , ' Dave what you 've done on Watchmen is fuckin ' A. ' " Speaking in 1986 , Moore said , " DC backed us all the way ... and have been really supportive about even the most graphic excesses . " To promote the series , DC Comics released a limited @-@ edition badge ( " button " ) display card set , featuring characters and images from the series . Ten thousand sets of the four badges , including a replica of the blood @-@ stained smiley face badge worn by the Comedian in the story , were released and sold . Mayfair Games introduced a Watchmen module for its DC Heroes Role @-@ playing Game series that was released before the series concluded . The module , which was endorsed by Moore , adds details to the series ' backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966 . 
 Watchmen was published in single @-@ issue form over the course of 1986 and 1987 . The limited series was a commercial success , and its sales helped DC Comics briefly overtake its competitor Marvel Comics in the comic book direct market . The series ' publishing schedule ran into delays because it was scheduled with three issues completed instead of the six editor Len Wein believed were necessary . Further delays were caused when later issues each took more than a month to complete . One contemporaneous report noted that although DC solicited issue # 12 for publication in April 1987 , it became apparent " it won 't debut until July or August " . 
 After the series concluded , the individual issues were collected and sold in trade paperback form . Along with Frank Miller 's 1986 Batman : The Dark Knight Returns miniseries , Watchmen was marketed as a " graphic novel " , a term that allowed DC and other publishers to sell similar comic book collections in a way that associated them with novels and dissociated them from comics . As a result of the publicity given to the books like the Watchmen trade in 1987 , bookstore and public libraries began to devote special shelves to them . Subsequently , new comics series were commissioned on the basis of reprinting them in a collected form for these markets . 
 Watchmen received critical praise , both inside and outside of the comics industry . Time magazine , which noted that the series was " by common assent the best of breed " of the new wave of comics published at the time , praised Watchmen as " a superlative feat of imagination , combining sci @-@ fi , political satire , knowing evocations of comics past and bold reworkings of current graphic formats into a <unk> [ sic ] mystery story . " In 1988 , Watchmen received a Hugo Award in the Other Forms category . 
 = = = Ownership disputes = = = 
 Disagreements about the ownership of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics . Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement , Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen . Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic @-@ Con , Moore said , " The way it works , if I understand it , is that DC owns it for the time they 're publishing it , and then it reverts to Dave and me , so we can make all the money from the Slurpee cups . " For Watchmen , Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series ' earnings . Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when " DC have not used the characters for a year , they 're ours . " Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them " a substantial amount of money " to retain the rights . Moore added , " So basically they 're not ours , but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be . On the other hand , if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn 't want to do anything with them , then after a year we 've got them and we can do what we want with them , which I 'm perfectly happy with . " 
 Moore said he left DC in 1989 due to the language in his contracts for Watchmen and his V for Vendetta series with artist David Lloyd . Moore felt the reversion clauses were ultimately meaningless , because DC did not intend to let the publications go out of print . He told The New York Times in 2006 , " I said , ' Fair enough , ' [ ... ] ' You have managed to successfully swindle me , and so I will never work for you again . ' " In 2000 , Moore publicly distanced himself from DC 's plans for a 15th anniversary Watchmen hardcover release as well as a proposed line of action figures from DC Direct . While DC wanted to mend its relationship with the writer , Moore felt the company was not treating him fairly in regards to his America 's Best Comics imprint ( launched under the WildStorm comic imprint , which was bought by DC in 1998 ; Moore was promised no direct interference by DC as part of the arrangement ) . Moore added , " As far as I 'm concerned , the 15th anniversary of Watchmen is purely a 15th Anniversary of when DC managed to take the Watchmen property from me and Dave [ Gibbons ] . " Soon afterward , DC Direct cancelled the Watchmen action @-@ figure line , despite the company having displayed prototypes at the 2000 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International . 
 = = Prequel projects = = 
 Moore stated in 1985 that if the limited series was well @-@ received , he and Gibbons would possibly create a 12 @-@ issue prequel series called Minutemen featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story . DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series , such as Rorschach 's Journal or The Comedian 's Vietnam War Diary , as well as hinting at the possibility of other authors using the same universe . Tales of the Comedian 's Vietnam War experiences were floated because The ' Nam was popular at the time , while another suggestion was , according to Gibbons , for a " Nite Owl / Rorschach team " ( in the manner of Randall and Hopkirk ( Deceased ) ) . Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere , with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals . Gibbons was more attracted to the idea of a Minutemen series , because it would have " [ paid ] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books â€” with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known . It would be , perhaps , interesting to see how we got to the conclusion . " 
 In 2010 , Moore told Wired that DC offered him the rights to Watchmen back , if he would agree to prequel and sequel projects . Moore said that " if they said that 10 years ago , when I asked them for that , then yeah it might have worked ... But these days I don 't want Watchmen back . Certainly , I don 't want it back under those kinds of terms . " DC Comics co @-@ publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee responded , " DC Comics would only revisit these iconic characters if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago , and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves . " Following months of rumors about a potential Watchmen follow @-@ up project , in February 2012 DC announced it was publishing seven prequel series under the " Before Watchmen " banner . Among the creators involved are writers J. Michael Straczynski , Brian Azzarello , <unk> Cooke , and Len Wein , and artists Lee Bermejo , J. G. Jones , Adam Hughes , Andy Kubert , Joe Kubert , and Amanda Conner . Though Moore has no involvement , Gibbons gave the project his blessing .

 = = = Film adaptation = = = 
 There have been numerous attempts to make a film version of Watchmen since 1986 , when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox . Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story , but he declined , so the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm . Hamm took the liberty of re @-@ writing Watchmen 's complicated ending into a " more manageable " conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox . Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991 , and the project was moved to Warner Bros. , where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct and Charles McKeown to rewrite it . They used the character Rorschach 's diary as a voice @-@ over and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed . Gilliam and Silver were only able to raise $ 25 million for the film ( a quarter of the necessary budget ) because their previous films had gone over budget . Gilliam abandoned the project because he decided that Watchmen would have been unfilmable . " Reducing [ the story ] to a two or two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hour film [ ... ] seemed to me to take away the essence of what Watchmen is about . " he said . After Warner Bros. dropped the project , Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently . The director again declined , believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five @-@ hour miniseries . 
 In October 2001 , Gordon partnered with Lloyd Levin and Universal Studios , hiring David Hayter to write and direct . Hayter and the producers left Universal due to creative differences , and Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up Watchmen at Revolution Studios . The project did not hold together at Revolution Studios and subsequently fell apart . In July 2004 , it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen , and they attached Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter 's script . Producers Gordon and Levin remained attached , collaborating with Aronofsky 's producing partner , Eric Watson . Aronofsky left to focus on The Fountain and was replaced by Paul Greengrass . Ultimately , Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround . 
 In October 2005 , Gordon and Levin met with Warner Bros. to develop the film there again . Impressed with Zack Snyder 's work on 300 , Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen . Screenwriter Alex Tse drew from his favorite elements of Hayter 's script , but also returned it to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic . Similar to his approach to 300 , Snyder used the comic book panel @-@ grid as a storyboard and opted to shoot the entire film using live @-@ action sets instead of green screens . He extended the fight scenes , and added a subplot about energy resources to make the film more topical . Although he intended to stay faithful to the look of the characters in the comic , Snyder intended Nite Owl to look scarier , and made Ozymandias ' armor into a parody of the rubber muscle suits from the 1997 superhero film Batman & Robin . After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008 , DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had to print more than 900 @,@ 000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated , with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies . While 20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit to block the film 's release , the studios eventually settled , with Warner agreeing to give Fox 8 @.@ 5 percent of the film 's worldwide gross , including from sequels and spin @-@ offs in return . The film was released to theaters in March 2009 . 
 The Tales of the Black Freighter segments was adapted as a direct @-@ to @-@ video animated feature to be released that same month . Gerard Butler , who starred in 300 , voices the Captain in the film . The film itself was released on DVD four months after Tales of the Black Freighter , and in November 2009 , a four @-@ disc set was released as the " Ultimate Cut " with the animated film edited back into the main picture . Len Wein , the comic 's editor , wrote a video game prequel entitled Watchmen : The End Is Nigh . 
 Dave Gibbons became an adviser on Snyder 's film , but Moore has refused to have his name attached to any film adaptations of his work . Moore has stated he has no interest in seeing Snyder 's adaptation ; he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008 , " There are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic , and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can 't " . While Moore believes that David Hayter 's screenplay was " as close as I could imagine anyone getting to Watchmen " , he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made .

 A critical and commercial success , Watchmen is highly regarded in the comics industry and is frequently considered by several critics and reviewers as comics ' greatest series and graphic novel . In time , the series has also become one of the best @-@ selling graphic novels ever published . Watchmen was the only graphic novel to appear on Time 's 2005 " All @-@ Time 100 Greatest Novels " list , where Time critic Lev Grossman described the story as " a heart @-@ pounding , heartbreaking read and a watershed in the evolution of a young medium . " It later appeared on Time 's 2009 " Top 10 Graphic Novels " list , where Grossman further praised Watchmen , proclaiming " It â€™ s way beyond clichÃ© at this point to call Watchmen the greatest superhero comic ever written @-@ slash @-@ drawn . But it â€™ s true . " In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly placed Watchmen at number 13 on its list of the best 50 novels printed in the last 25 years , describing it as " The greatest superhero story ever told and proof that comics are capable of smart , emotionally resonant narratives worthy of the label ' literature ' . " The Comics Journal , however , ranked Watchmen at number 91 on its list of the Top 100 English @-@ language comics of the 20th century . 
 In Art of the Comic Book : An Aesthetic History , Robert Harvey wrote that , with Watchmen , Moore and Gibbons " had demonstrated as never before the capacity of the [ comic book ] medium to tell a sophisticated story that could be engineered only in comics " . In his review of the Absolute Edition of the collection , Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times wrote that the dark legacy of Watchmen , " one that Moore almost certainly never intended , whose DNA is encoded in the increasingly black inks and bleak storylines that have become the essential elements of the contemporary superhero comic book , " is " a domain he has largely ceded to writers and artists who share his fascination with brutality but not his interest in its consequences , his eagerness to tear down old boundaries but not his drive to find new ones . " Alan Moore himself said his intentions with works like Marvelman and Watchmen were to liberate comics and open them up to new and fresh ideas , thus creating more diversity in the comics world by showing the industry what could be done with already existing concepts . Instead it had the opposite effect , causing the superhero comic to end up stuck in a " depressive ghetto of grimness and psychosis " . In 2009 , Lydia Millet of The Wall Street Journal contested that Watchmen was worthy of such acclaim , and wrote that while the series ' " vividly drawn panels , moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well @-@ deserved , if disproportionate " , that " it 's simply bizarre to assert that , as an illustrated literary narrative , it rivals in artistic merit , say , masterpieces like Chris Ware 's ' Acme Novelty Library ' or almost any part of the witty and brilliant work of Edward Gorey " . 
 Watchmen was one of the two comic books , alongside Batman : The Dark Knight Returns , that inspired designer Vincent <unk> when he created the Comic Sans font . 
 In 2009 , Brain Scan Studios released the parody <unk> , a comic in which writer Rich Johnston chronicled " the debate surrounding Watchmen , the original contracts , the current legal suits over the Fox contract " . 
 = Ro Laren = 
 Ro Laren is a fictional character who appears on a recurring basis in the fifth , sixth and seventh series of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation . Portrayed by Michelle Forbes , she is a member of the Bajoran race who joins the crew of the USS Enterprise @-@ D at the invitation of Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) . The character was intended to both be at odds with the series regulars , as well as to replace Wesley Crusher at the conn officer post on the bridge . Forbes was cast to portray Ro , after previously appearing in the series as Dara in the episode " Half a Life " . 
 The character first appears in the fifth season episode " Ensign Ro " , which reveals elements of Ro 's backstory . She continued to appear throughout that season , and made a further appearance in each of the sixth and seventh seasons . Starfleet sought her aid to help the Cardassians apprehend a Bajoran terrorist . After joining the Enterprise crew , she wants to abandon the engineering section of the vessel following a series of power failures in " Disaster " . Alongside Geordi La Forge ( LeVar Burton ) , she is affected by a Romulan experiment in " The Next Phase " and must help prevent the aliens from destroying the Enterprise . In " Rascals " , she is one of the crew who are transformed into children and helps prevent a Ferengi plot . When making her final appearance in " Preemptive Strike " , she is tasked by Starfleet to infiltrate the Maquis , eventually defecting and joining them permanently . 
 Ro was also planned to be a main character in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . However , Forbes turned down the role , so Kira Nerys was created to replace her . In the non @-@ canonical novels , Ro eventually joins the Bajoran militia and is posted onto Deep Space Nine . She re @-@ joins Starfleet when Bajor joins the Federation , and eventually becomes captain of the station . Reviewers discussed the religious views of Ro , comparing her views to those of Kira . Ro has been received positively by both critics and fans alike . Critics have praised the performances of Forbes , and the interaction of Ro with the existing characters . She has been placed in several polls listing the most popular characters , with Jordan Hoffman calling her the second strongest female character in the franchise . 
 = = Concept and development = = 
 During the course of planning out the fifth season of Star Trek : The Next Generation , the producers were looking to add a recurring character who could conflict with the regular cast at times as well as a new conn officer to replace Wesley Crusher . With that in mind , the episode " Ensign Ro " was written by Michael Piller , from a story idea created in conjunction with Rick Berman , to specifically introduce the character of Ensign Ro Laren . The episode was designed to show a backstory for the character , who would be at odds with series creator Gene Roddenberry 's ideal that Starfleet officers should all work together seamlessly . One of her major character traits was that she would be a member of an oppressed people , whose homeworld had been conquered by another . Supervising producer Jeri Taylor explained that they had sought to add some " fresh life " using a darker character . 
 Michelle Forbes was asked to return to the series , after impressing the producers with her performance as Dara in the episode " Half a Life " . The character was the daughter of Timicin , played by David Ogden Stiers , and supported the tradition that her father should commit ritual suicide upon reaching a certain age . The Bajoran make @-@ up was created on her , with Michael Westmore seeking to make her look different from the rest of the crew but in a way that would not detract from her appearance . Westmore created an appliance over Forbes ' nose , before adding a row of ridges while it was on her face . It was designed to be as thin and weightless as possible , as he wanted the piece to move with Forbes ' facial expressions . Her version of the make @-@ up had seven ridges , while other actors in " Ensign Ro " had different numbers , between five and nine , with the male actors wearing larger pieces . 
 Piller described the addition of Ro to the cast as one of that season 's biggest accomplishments , and was pleased that it was well received . He added that in " Ensign Ro " , they made a deliberate decision to have Ro embraced by Guinan in order to ensure that the fans warmed to the new addition . Piller felt that when Guinan took Ro to meet Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard in that episode , the character was effectively presenting Ro to the fans of the series and endorsing her . During the writing process , he felt that once he came across the friendship between Guinan and Ro that he believed " we had really done something magnificent " . Forbes , meanwhile , praised the writing and the cast of the series , saying that she had " become very attached to Star Trek " . 
 Piller was disappointed with the following Ro episode , " Disaster " , as it put her in the position of disbelieving Councillor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of " victories " in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions . But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in " Conundrum " . Forbes shared the view of that episode , later saying " When you have amnesia , you wonder if that brings out a side of you that 's always wanted to come out . Would you really be comfortable with that ? It 's an interesting thing . I had a really good time with that episode . " Later in the season , " The Next Phase " was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi , but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters . Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel 's original pitch for the episode " The Inner Light " . This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker . Instead , the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard . 
 Forbes made a single appearance in the sixth season , in the episode " Rascals " . In the plot of the episode , a transporter accidentally turns Ro , among others , in a child . There was some consideration after the episode about whether or not to keep Ro as a child , as her return to adulthood was never shown on screen . Taylor said that the change would have been " too drastic for us " , and the idea was abandoned . Her final appearance , in the penultimate episode of the series , " Preemptive Strike " , had been considered a long shot by the producers . After the failure to agree her appearances on Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Forbes ' agent had warned them to stay away from her . A week prior to filming , there was no story created for the episode other than the idea it would follow on from the Deep Space Nine episode " The Maquis " , and no agreement had been reached with Forbes to appear . Her agent indicated that Forbes wanted to talk directly to the producers , so she made the phone call , making up a story for the episode as the conversation went on . Forbes agreed , making her final appearance in the franchise . The character was promoted to Lieutenant , and Forbes wore updated Bajoran makeup developed by Westmore for Deep Space Nine .

 " Ensign Ro " proved influential on the creation of Deep Space Nine , with the Bajorans and Cardassians taken directly from the episode . The character was included in the original series description , stationed on the Bajor @-@ based Starfleet station and the producers had planned for her to be promoted to Lieutenant in an episode of The Next Generation prior to the start of Deep Space Nine . Taylor had expected Ro to be written out of The Next Generation , and so had taken some steps to see that the character was replaced . She said that " We all just love Michelle Forbes " , but the plans to replace Ro would not seek to add someone with the type of fire shown by the character in such episodes as " The Next Phase " . She also said that if Ro to remain on The Next Generation , then the character would have naturally evolved away from that conflicted position anyway . 
 The intention was that Ro would be one of a handful of The Next Generation characters moving over to the new series , alongside Miles and Keiko O 'Brien . At this stage , the other characters were only described as a wheelchair @-@ bound science officer , a brash doctor , a civilian law enforcer , a bar owner and the station commander and his son . Ro 's position on the station would have been to act as the liaison between the station and the Bajoran government . As described in the series bible , the producers had planned for Ro to be a point of conflict with " by @-@ the @-@ book Starfleet officers " . Regarding the other main characters , she was planned to have a friendship with Odo and be mentored by Jadzia Dax . 
 Both Berman and Piller sought to have Forbes sign on to portray Ro as a main character in the series , but she turned them down . She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation , but did not want to tie herself down to a five to six year main cast contract at that point in her career . She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series , and did not want to undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine . The producers of Deep Space Nine decided create a new character to fit a similar mould , which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys , who was played by Nana Visitor . This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time , which was already under production . During the course of the series , Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one @-@ off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role .

 In accordance with Bajoran tradition , her family name precedes her personal name . When she first joins the crew of the Enterprise @-@ D during the course of " Ensign Ro " , Captain Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) addresses her as " Ensign Laren " . She corrects him , saying that Laren is her given name and Ro is her family name . She is then referred to as " Ensign Ro " . Over the course of her several appearances in The Next Generation , information is revealed about her backstory . Bajor had been under the occupation of the Cardassians during her early life , and at the age of seven she watched as one of the occupiers tortured her father to death . This led to a life @-@ long hatred of Cardassians . 
 Ro joined Starfleet , and after being posted to the USS Wellington , she formed part of an away team . During that mission , she disobeyed orders , resulting in the death of eight crewmen . She was subsequently court @-@ martialled , and was imprisoned on Jaros II . Admiral Kennelly ( Cliff Potts ) later gave her a pardon and allowed her to return to Starfleet service , in return for convincing the Bajoran terrorist Orta ( Jeffrey <unk> ) to call off his attacks after a raid on a Federation colony . He brings her to the USS Enterprise for the purpose of completing this mission . 
 = = = Star Trek : The Next Generation = = = 
 As shown in " Ensign Ro " , during an away team mission to capture Orta , Ro manages to get the team taken hostage . As a result , Picard confines her to her quarters . But Picard discovers that the Bajorans were not responsible for the attack on the Federation colony , and Guinan ( Whoopi Goldberg ) convinces Ro to tell Picard of Kennelly 's plan . Ro was under orders to offer arms to Orta , to trick him to revealing his presence so the Cardassians can destroy his vessel . At that point , Kennelly would intervene and order Picard not to intervene to keep the peace treaty with the Cardassians . Picard allows the plan to proceed , but the Cardassians destroy an empty ship before revealing that the Cardassians had staged the attack in order to enlist aid against the Bajorans . At the conclusion of the episode , Picard offers Ro a position on the crew of the Enterprise , which she accepts . 
 In " Disaster " , Ro is one of the crew trapped on the bridge of the Enterprise when it undergoes a series of power failures . The ship is placed at risk of destruction because of the potential failure of the containment fields on the antimatter pods . Ro argues that they need to separate the saucer section to save those on @-@ board it as they have no way knowing if anyone is still alive on the engineering part of the vessel . When the crew undergo group amnesia in " Conundrum " , Ro and Riker act on a mutual attraction until their memories are restored . In " The Next Phase " , Ro and La Forge apparently die after a transporter accident after returning from a Romulan Warbird . But they have suffered the side effects of a Romulan cloaking experiment . Ro initial questions whether or not she has died and is now in the afterlife . But together with La Forge they discover a Romulan plot and defeating a similarly cloaked Romulan operative , Ro and La Forge alert the crew and return to normal , warning Picard and averting disaster . 
 In the episode " Rascals " , Ro , Picard , Guinan and Keiko O 'Brien ( Rosalind Chao ) are transformed into adolescent versions of themselves while retaining their adult intelligence . As children , they foil a Ferengi plot to steal the Enterprise and sell the crew as slave labor . In her final episode , " Preemptive Strike " , Ro returns to the Enterprise as a Lieutenant after spending a year at Starfleet Advanced Tactical Training . During the course of the training , her commanding officer , Lieutenant Commander Chakotay , resigned from Starfleet to join the Marquis when his father is killed by the Cardassians . She is asked by Starfleet to infiltrate the rebel Maquis , who are undermining the Federation treaty with Cardassia . During the mission , she finds her loyalties in conflict with her duties as she becomes increasingly sympathetic to the plight of the Maquis . Despite Picard 's effort to force her to do her duty , she joins the rebel group . Riker says she seemed pretty sure she was doing the right thing , though she regretted disappointing Picard .

 Ro makes a series of appearances in the non @-@ canonical novel series based on The Next Generation . These include an expansion on her background and early life in the book Night of the Wolves by S. D. Perry and Britta Dennison . The events of the away mission while she was serving on the USS Wellington were shown in the second special issue of DC Comics ' The Next Generation series . Ro 's career with the Maquis is also chronicled in the novels . In Rogue Saucer , she is responsible for planning out the attack on the Enterprise in which the Maquis steal a prototype saucer section . Ro appears in the novel Tunnel Through the Stars , set during the events of the Dominion War , Ro and the remaining Maquis join forces with Picard and the USS Enterprise @-@ E to defeat the Dominion forces that are attempting to build an artificial wormhole to bypass the one near Deep Space Nine . 
 She began to appear in the Deep Space Nine relaunch novels beginning with the two @-@ part Avatar by Perry . The relaunch novels show the events that occur after the final episode of the television series . In Avatar , Ro enlists in the Bajoran Militia with the rank of Lieutenant , and is assigned to Deep Space Nine as the new Security Chief under the command of Colonel Kira . This move for Ro is also chronicled in the background to the massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game Star Trek Online . 
 In Twilight by David R. George III , the first part of the Mission : Gamma mini @-@ series , Quark and Ro start to develop romantic feelings for each other . In Perry 's Unity , Ro re @-@ joins Starfleet after Bajor joins the Federation and it 's military forces are merged .

Over time , Ro was promoted to Captain and as of the Star Trek : The Fall series of books , is in command of the new Deep Space Nine following the destruction of the original at the hands of a rogue element of the Typhon Pact . Ro was also one of the characters included at launch in the strategy video game Star Trek Timelines by Disruptor Beam .

 The Bajorans have been described as analogues for a variety of displaced peoples , with Star Trek novelist Keith DeCandido comparing them to " Palestinians , Jews , Kurds , Haitians ; the sad reality is that you can pretty much pick and choose . History is full of people who have had their homes taken from them , forced to become refugees . " The Cardassian occupation of Bajor ( the Bajoran homeworld ) has been compared to the Holocaust , with Ro singled out as a Holocaust survivor . In his chapter " Speakers for the Dead : Star Trek , the Holocaust , and the Representation of Atrocity " within the book Star Trek as Myth , writer Matthew Wilheim <unk> compared the experiences and reactions of Ro Laren and Kira Nerys following the Cardassian occupation of Bajor . He said that the impact on Ro represented the " non @-@ american view of the holocaust " in that she does not fully recover from the trauma and continues to affect in , for example preventing her from connecting with her religious beliefs in " The Next Phase " . He explains that Kira is a far more " Americanize [ d ] " character , acting as a " resister and even liberator " during the occupation . As a result , unlike Ro , Kira retains her religious beliefs and does not typically show any ongoing emotional trauma . Further commentary of Ro 's relationship to religion have been made . In The Literary Galaxy of Star Trek , James F. Broderick compared the situation in which Ro and La Forge are trapped out of phase in " The Next Phase " to that of the purgatory dweller in Dante Alighieri 's Inferno .

 When reviewing " Ensign Ro " for Tor.com , DeCandido described Michelle Forbes as " stellar " and called Ro " one of TNG 's best recurring characters " . He also added the the character was " a bit of piss and vinegar to add to the syrupy mix of homogeneity that the TNG cast tends to be " . In his review of " Preemptive Strike " , he said that the Ro character arc " comes full circle : once again making a decision that puts her on the outs with Starfleet . " He praised Forbes again , saying that she " inhabits the character so completely , from her awkwardness at the reception in her honor to her playing the role of rebel , to her pain at thinking about her father ... to her decision to betray Starfleet and the Enterprise . " He did criticise the episode for not wrapping up the Riker @-@ Ro relationship in the same way that closure had been given to her friendship with Picard . Zack Handlen reviewed " Ensign Ro " for The A.V. Club , and described Ro as " terrific " and said that the role represented " one of the rare times that TNG has managed to have a frustrated character who doesn 't immediately seem overly hateful or falsely confrontational " . But he criticized the manner in which her opinion changed to be more favourable of Picard and the Enterprise , as he felt that Guinan 's intervention was detrimental to the plot . 
 Ro Laren has placed in several polls featuring the characters of the franchise over the course of several years . In a list of the strongest female characters on the official Star Trek website by Jordan Hoffman in 2012 , Ro Laren was placed second behind Edith Keeler from the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " The City on the Edge of Forever " . He said that Ro was one of the " richest figures in Trek " , and wished to be able to see an alternative timeline where Forbes had accepted the main cast position on Deep Space Nine . A poll at the Creation Entertainment official Star Trek convention in 2013 , conducted by Hoffman , placed Ro Laren as the fifth most popular recurring character among fans , behind Elim Garak , Q , Gul Dukat and General Martok . Hoffman expressed a view that he had expected her to place higher in the rankings , due to the number of her vocal supporters , however she also had many booing her . On a poll run on the official Star Trek website in 2014 regarding the fans ' favourite supporting character , Ro came eighth out of ten . In 2015 , she was included in a list of the 21 " most interesting " supporting characters in the franchise by Lisa Granshaw at Blastr . Granshaw called Ro " a complicated , strong character " , and said her " different layers and motivations made her a great character to watch interact with the loyal crew of the Enterprise . "

The pumpkin bomb was a close , but non @-@ nuclear replication of the Fat Man plutonium bomb with the same ballistic and handling characteristics . Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a Silverplate B @-@ 29 bomber and be fuzed to be effective against actual targets . 
 Pumpkin bombs were produced in both inert and high explosive variants . The inert versions were filled with a cement @-@ plaster @-@ sand mixture that was combined with water to 1 @.@ 67 to 1 @.@ 68 grams per cubic centimetre ( 0 @.@ 060 to 0 @.@ 061 lb / cu in ) , the density of the Composition B high explosive versions . The filler of both variants had the same weight and weight distribution as the inner sphere of the plutonium bomb . The concept for the high explosive pumpkin bomb was originated in December 1944 by U.S. Navy Captain William S. Parsons , the head of the Ordnance Division at Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory , and United States Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets , commander of the 509th Composite Group . Prior testing was carried out with an inert version . 
 The name " pumpkin bomb " was given to the training bombs by Parsons and Dr. Charles C. Lauritsen of the California Institute of Technology , who managed the development team . The name was used in official meetings and documents , and probably referred to its large ellipsoidal shape . Although anecdotal sources attribute the naming of the bombs to painting them a pumpkin color , the bombs were actually painted olive drab or khaki . Photographs indicate that the units delivered to Tinian were painted in the same zinc chromate primer color ( i.e. , yellow ) worn by Fat Man . 
 While many Manhattan scientists expected that the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward , Parsons , with his experience of the proximity fuze program , expected that it would involve considerable effort . The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren , Virginia , where a scale model of the Fat Man plutonium bomb was developed . On 3 March 1944 , testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field , California . The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight , and that its fuzes did not work properly . 
 = = Production = = 
 The shells of the pumpkin bomb were manufactured by two Los Angeles firms , Consolidated Steel Corporation and Western Pipe and Steel Company , while the tail assembly was produced by Centerline Company of Detroit . After initial development , management of the program was turned over to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ordnance in May 1945 . A total of 486 live and inert training bombs were eventually delivered , at a cost of between $ 1 @,@ 000 and $ 2 @,@ 000 apiece . 
 All of the inert versions went from the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field , Utah , by rail , where they were used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb . Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group 's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises . The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot , McAlester , Oklahoma , for filling with explosives . The Composition B was poured as a slurry , solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours , sealed , and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine , California , for shipment by sea to Tinian . 
 = = Description = = 
 The pumpkin bombs were externally similar to the Fat Man bomb in size and shape , and both had the same 52 @-@ inch ( 130 cm ) California Parachute square tail assembly and single @-@ point attachment lug . The pumpkin bomb had three contact fuzes arranged in an equilateral triangle around the nose of the bomb while the atomic bomb had four fuse housings . The atomic bomb had its shell sections bolted together , but most if not all of the pumpkin bombs were welded with a 4 inches ( 100 mm ) hole used for filling the shell . The Fat Man also had four external mounting points for radar antennae which the pumpkin bombs did not have . 
 The pumpkin bombs were 10 feet 8 inches ( 3 @.@ 25 m ) in length and 60 inches ( 1 @,@ 500 mm ) in maximum diameter . They weighed 5 @.@ 26 long tons ( 5 @,@ 340 kg ) , consisting of 3 @,@ 800 pounds ( 1 @,@ 700 kg ) for the shell , 425 pounds ( 193 kg ) for the tail assembly , and 6 @,@ 300 pounds ( 2 @,@ 900 kg ) of Composition B filler . The shells were made of .375 @-@ inch ( 9 @.@ 5 mm ) steel plate and the tail assemblies from .200 @-@ inch ( 5 @.@ 1 mm ) aluminum plate . 
 = = Combat missions = = 
 Combat missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group on 20 , 23 , 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945 , using the bombs against individual targets in Japanese cities . A total of 49 bombs were dropped on 14 targets , one bomb was jettisoned into the ocean , and two were aboard aircraft that aborted their missions . 
 Mission parameters and protocols were similar to those of the actual atomic bomb missions , and all targets were located in the vicinity of the cities designated for atomic attack . The bombs were released at an altitude of 30 @,@ 000 feet ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) and the aircraft then went into the sharp turn required on a nuclear mission . After the war , the Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that the pumpkin bombs were " a reasonably effective weapon against Japanese plants when direct hits were scored on vital areas , or when the near miss was sufficiently close to important buildings to cause severe structural damage .

 = Barton Aqueduct = 
 The Barton Aqueduct , opened on 17 July 1761 , carried the Bridgewater Canal over the River Irwell at Barton @-@ upon @-@ Irwell in Greater Manchester , England . Designed largely by James Brindley under the direction of John Gilbert , it was the first navigable aqueduct to be built in England , " one of the seven wonders of the canal age " according to industrial archaeologist Mike <unk> . 
 Construction proceeded quickly , but disaster almost struck when the aqueduct was first filled with water and one of its three arches began to buckle under the weight . Remedial work took several months , but the aqueduct was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament had been passed , on 17 July 1761 . It remained in use for more than 100 years , until the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893 , replaced by the Barton Swing Aqueduct . 
 = = Background = = 
 The original intention was for the Bridgewater Canal to reach Salford from the Duke of Bridgewater 's coal mines in Worsley , by remaining on the north bank of the Irwell . Work began in 1759 , but it was quickly decided to alter the route by building a masonry aqueduct to carry the waterway over the Irwell at Barton , and terminate instead in Manchester , to the south of the river . A Bill to authorise the new route was presented to parliament on 13 November 1759 , and in January the following year Brindley travelled to London to give evidence before a parliamentary committee in support of the proposal . 
 Although a gifted engineer Brindley had no formal education and rarely , if ever , committed his designs to paper . When questioned by the parliamentary committee about the composition of the puddle he frequently referred to in his evidence , he had a mass of clay brought into the committee room . He then formed the clay into a trough and showed how it would only form a watertight seal if it had been worked with water to form puddle . " Thus it is " said Brindley " that I form a watertight @-@ trunk to carry water over rivers and valleys wherever they cross the path of the canal . " Later , when asked to produce a drawing of the bridge or aqueduct he proposed to build , he replied that he had no representation of it on paper but would demonstrate his intention by use of a model . He then went out and bought a large round of Cheshire cheese , which he divided into two equal halves saying " Here is my model " . Then , to the amusement of the committee , he used the two halves of cheese to represent the semicircular arches and laid a long , rectangular object over the top to demonstrate the position of the river flowing under the aqueduct and the canal flowing over it . 
 Although the duke had seen navigable aqueducts in use on canals when travelling abroad on his Grand Tour , the idea of an such a structure carrying a canal over a river was new to England and was ridiculed by contemporary engineers . One brought in to review the plans , at Brindley 's request , commented in a report to the Duke of Bridgewater that " I have often heard of castles in the air , but never before saw where one was to be erected . " The necessary Act of Parliament was passed in March 1760 , and was quite specific about the form the aqueduct had to take , to protect the viability of the Mersey & Irwell Navigation below . There was already a three @-@ arch road bridge , Barton Bridge , passing over the Irwell , and the aqueduct was required not to restrict traffic on the river any more than the road bridge already did . It had to have the same number of arches , the foundations for which had to be fixed in the river bed , and the arches had to be at least as wide and high as those of the road bridge . 
 = = Construction = = 
 At about 200 yards ( 180 m ) long , 12 yards ( 11 m ) wide and 39 feet ( 12 m ) above the river at its highest point , the aqueduct was , for its time , an enormous construction . Early illustrations show the aqueduct 's piers to have been flat @-@ faced , but an engraving of 1864 shows them to have pointed cutwaters extending beyond the spring of the arch ; it is likely that the piers were refaced in the early 1820s . The arches were composed of several rings of brickwork , with masonry used for decorative keystones . All the masonry used in the structure was coursed ashlar . 
 On the day it was first tested the water was allowed to flow in , but one of the arches began to buckle under the weight . Brindley , overcome with anxiety , retired to his bed at the Bishop Blaize tavern in nearby Stretford . Gilbert , realising that Brindley had placed too much weight on the sides of the arch , removed the clay and laid layers of straw and freshly puddled clay ; when the water was allowed to flow in again the masonry held firm . According to a statement by Francis Egerton , 8th Earl of Bridgewater printed in 1820 , his uncle , the duke , had told him that there was a distortion of one of the arches , and that Gilbert had addressed the problem by placing more weight on the crown of the arch and less on the haunches . The arch was then covered with straw and allowed to stand until the following spring , when the mortar was set and the arch had become stable , but its curve remained irregular . 
 = = Operation and legacy = = 
 The aqueduct was opened to traffic on 17 July 1761 , only 15 months after the enabling Act had been passed , and it was soon being used by the duke 's barges to carry coal to Manchester from his mines at Worsley . The construction of the aqueduct excited great admiration , and writers of the day often remarked on the strange and novel sight afforded by the canal where it crossed the Irwell . The structure became one of the wonders of the age and crowds came from all over the country to view it , along with the drilling of the <unk> for the duke 's Worsley navigable levels . Those who saw it were often struck by the advantages of still @-@ water navigation when they saw ten or twelve men slowly hauling a single barge against the flow of the Irwell , while 40 feet ( 12 m ) above a horse , mule , or perhaps two men , could be seen hauling several linked barges across the still waters of the aqueduct . 
 Although the aqueduct was 12 yards ( 11 m ) wide overall , the waterway it carried was only half that width . The Bridgewater Canal had been built to accommodate the Mersey flat boats then in common use , which had a beam of about 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) , making two @-@ way traffic impossible . A signalling system was therefore installed to control access to the aqueduct . A pole 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high in the centre of the arch at the Stretford bank supported a semaphore system with two arms on each side , operated by levers at ground level . 
 Although Gilbert later had to resurface the aqueduct , the structure remained in use for more than 100 years . In the first volume of his Lives of the Engineers ( 1862 ) Scottish author Samuel Smiles said of the construction that " Humble though it now appears , it was parent of the magnificent aqueducts of Rennie and Telford , and the viaducts of Stephenson and Brunel " . 
 = = Replacement = = 
 Barton Aqueduct 's fate was sealed with the passage of the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885 , which allowed for the construction of a navigable waterway large enough to accommodate ocean @-@ going vessels from the estuary of the River Mersey the 36 miles ( 58 km ) into Manchester , partly along the Irwell . As the arches of the aqueduct were too small to allow large ships to pass through it was demolished in 1893 , and replaced by the Barton Swing Aqueduct still in use today . So solidly built was the old aqueduct that dynamite had to be used to expedite its demolition . 
 Some of the stonework of Brindley 's aqueduct has been preserved in the nearby Barton Memorial Arch , a monument to his " castle in the air " . 
 = Worlebury Camp = 
 Worlebury Camp is the name of the place where an Iron Age hill fort once stood atop Worlebury Hill , which is north of the town of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare in Somerset , England . This fort was designed for defence , as is evidenced the number of walls and ditches around the site . Archaeologists have found several large triangular platforms around the sides of the fort , lower down on the hillside . They have found nearly one hundred storage pits of various sizes cut into the bedrock , and many of these had human remains , coins , and other artefacts in them . However , in more recent times , the fort has suffered damage and been threatened with complete destruction on multiple occasions . This location has been designated an Scheduled Ancient Monument , and it falls within the Weston Woods Local Nature Reserve which was declared to Natural England by North Somerset Council in 2005 . 
 = = History = = 
 In The Ancient <unk> and Camps of Gloucestershire , Edward J. Burrow mentions that probably either the <unk> or <unk> people initially built Worlebury Camp . The Belgae people subsequently overthrew the initial inhabitants and occupied the camp for a time , but they were finally destroyed at the hands of the Romans . 
 Worlebury Camp has been explored at various times over a period of 150 years . From 1851 to 1852 , Charles Dymond , Edwin Martin Atkins , and Francis Warre excavated and surveyed Worlebury Camp . Dymond returned in 1880 to continue the excavation , which lasted until 1881 . Another century passed before the Woodspring Museum from Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare excavated more of Worlebury camp in 1987 to 1988 . Finally , in 1998 , the Avon Extensive Urban Study team performed the latest ( as of 2008 ) assessment of the site . 
 = = Hill fort = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age , roughly the start of the first millennium BC . The reason for their emergence in Britain , and their purpose , has been a subject of debate . It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , sites built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze , and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status . Power passed into the hands of a new group of people . Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated " [ the forts ] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [ of an increasing population ] burst out into open warfare . But I wouldn 't see them as having been built because there was a state of war . They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction " . 
 = = = Location = = = 
 The fort is located on the summit of Worlebury Hill , 109 metres ( 358 ft ) above sea level . It is in the present @-@ day North Somerset , above the seaside resort of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare and close to the village of Worle . 
 Its occupants would have had a view of the countryside as well as any potential invaders . They would have been able to see out over to Sugar Loaf Mountain , the Black Mountains , the Mendip Hills , Dunkery Beacon , Sand Point , and Wales . This view is no longer as unobstructed as it once was because there are so many trees spread over the hill . 
 = = = Triangular stone platforms = = = 
 There are a number of triangular platforms on the slopes around the hill fort . The apexes of these triangles are flush with the hillside , with the base projecting in the downhill direction . However , the upper surface is approximately level . The front faces of these platforms are about 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) above the hillside , and they have ditches in front of them to improve their defence . In a letter to Warre , Atkins theorised that the structures were slingers ' platforms or archers ' stations . Several sling stones have been found around them , offering some credence to the theory that slingers stood upon these platforms . Dymond mentions the stones in his book : 
 Several of them were broken , as though they had been used in the attack [ on the fort ] , as , indeed , many of them probably were . 
 = = = Walls and ditches = = = 
 Worlebury Hill is bordered on its north and west sides by steep cliffs dropping down into the Bristol Channel between Weston Bay and Sand Bay . These would have rendered the fort nearly invulnerable to attack from those directions . Nevertheless , the fort still has one wall on its north side and one on its west side , both very near the edge of the cliffs . On the south side , a single rampart and a ditch guarded the fort . The level east side was protected by two stone ramparts and five ditches . Parts of these ramparts were over 11 metres ( 35 ft ) high measuring from the bottom of the ditch as of 1875 . 
 The walls themselves are around 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) thick . However , because they are dry @-@ laid stone , the removal of a few stones would be sufficient to bring the entire wall collapsing down . To prevent access to the walls themselves , the inhabitants of the fort raised large breastworks around the base of the walls by piling up rock rubble against the bases . These rubble barriers are over 1 @.@ 22 metres ( 4 @.@ 0 ft ) high , and in places they are over 1 @.@ 22 metres ( 4 @.@ 0 ft ) thick . Attackers would have had to clear away the rubble before being able to attack the wall , and all the while they would be under direct fire from defenders on the top of the wall . 
 = = Archaeological findings = = 
 = = = Storage pits = = = 
 The area inside the outer wall has a series of hut circles and 93 storage pits cut directly into the bedrock , which is only around 60 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) beneath the surface of the soil in most places . Eighteen of the Storage pits are in what Dymond calls the " keep " , one is in the transverse fosse ( a fosse is a ditch usually dug for protection ) , and seventy @-@ four of the pits are outside the " keep " but still enclosed within the exterior walls . The average size of the pits is around 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) long by 2 metres wide and 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) deep . The largest pit is roughly triangular , with sides measuring 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) , 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) , and 2 @.@ 4 metres ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) long . The smallest pit is 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) long by .7 metres ( 2 @.@ 3 ft ) wide . The inhabitants used them to store grain , as is evidenced by the kernels of barley and wheat and the shards of pots that were found in the pits . Several of the pits contained the remnants of peas and the remains of burned woven baskets . In addition , researchers also found sling stones and spindle whorls dated to the 1st or 2nd century BC in them . 
 Eighteen of these pits were found to contain the remains of human skeletons , which are now stored in the Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare Museum in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . Eighteen full skeletons were found , of which ten show evidence of a violent death ( including sword cuts in the skulls ) . It is possible that the Romans or the Belgic raiders attacked the fort and killed the inhabitants . 
 = = = Artefacts = = = 
 A cast copper alloy penannular collar of special interest to archaeologists has been found at the campsite . It may indicate that this hilltop site was used even before the Iron Age , since related artefacts tend to be found with Bronze Age items , and it was the first of its type found in Britain . In 2006 , a related copper penannular brooch dating to the 5th or 6th century AD was found in a spring between Brecon Beacons and the Black Mountains in Wales . A gold penannular bracelet was found in the Perry River . 
 Roman coins have been found at Worlebury Camp since the Romans had established a presence by the end of the 1st century AD . Many of the Roman coins bear the image of the Western Roman Emperor Honorius . This was inside the fort proper . Another coin was located by Trinity Path which leads towards the fort . 
 Other findings at the Worlebury campsite include animal remains , including the bones of pigs , oxen , horses , deer , goats , and even small birds . Limpet shells have also been found near the bones . Archaeologists found iron objects , adding further credibility to the idea that this fort is from the Iron Age . These objects include a chisel or borer , several spearheads and javelin heads , and an iron cone with charred wood inside and a rivet hole through the cone . Dymond assumes that this cone was once a plowshare . Stone artefacts , mainly <unk> and scrapers , have been discovered at the site . Just less than 36 flint chips have been found , of which some may be arrowheads . One good @-@ quality arrowhead has been found . In addition to these , Dymond recorded finding a lead lump about the size of a walnut that he decided was probably a sling bullet . Glastonbury type bead @-@ rim pottery was also found at this site . A socketed bronze axe from the late Bronze Age , which was found at Worlebury Hill in 1883 , is in the Ashmolean Museum . 
 = = Damage to the site = = 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 Development of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare since the 19th century has resulted in three episodes of potentially irreversible damage to the site . A quarry started operation in the southern side of Worlebury Hill in 1815 to mine for galena , calamine , and stone . The Bristol and Exeter Railway arrived in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare in 1841 , making it profitable to expand the village into a town . In 1842 , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare became a town with the granting of the Improvement and Market Act of May 1842 . This act also proposed developing houses right over the brow of the hill . This would have gone straight through Worlebury Camp ; however , the actual expansion never reached the site . By 1853 , some development had occurred according to the proposed expansion , but it had skirted the hillfort and continued to the east . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 In the early 20th century , the Worlebury fort itself was damaged by boys rolling stones , including some from the walls of the fort , down the hill on which it stands . The Axbridge District of the Somerset Archaeological Society was taking steps to prevent such damage from happening again . 
 Some of the trees planted in the early 19th century had become very large , and their roots were growing into the archaeological structures . In 2005 , the Forestry Commission gave permission for North Somerset Council to fell 300 trees to reduce the subsequent risks . A member of the North Somerset Council , Christopher Richards , said : " If we had a storm up here and these trees came down , then the entire hillfort could be destroyed . " 
 = Daniel Day @-@ Lewis = 
 Sir Daniel Michael Blake Day @-@ Lewis ( born 29 April 1957 ) is an English actor . He holds both British and Irish citizenship . Born and raised in London , he excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre , before being accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School , which he attended for three years . Despite his traditional actor training at the Bristol Old Vic , he is considered to be a method actor , known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles . He often remains completely in character for the duration of the shooting schedules of his films , even to the point of adversely affecting his health . He is one of the most selective actors in the film industry , having starred in only five films since 1998 , with as many as five years between roles . Protective of his private life , he rarely gives interviews and makes very few public appearances . 
 Day @-@ Lewis shifted between theatre and film for most of the early 1980s , joining the Royal Shakespeare Company and playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night 's Dream , before appearing in the 1984 film The Bounty . He starred in My Beautiful Laundrette ( 1985 ) , his first critically acclaimed role , and gained further public notice with A Room with a View ( 1985 ) . He then assumed leading man status with The Unbearable Lightness of Being ( 1988 ) . 
 One of the most acclaimed actors of his generation , Day @-@ Lewis has earned numerous awards , including three Academy Awards for Best Actor for his performances in My Left Foot ( 1989 ) , There Will Be Blood ( 2007 ) and Lincoln ( 2012 ) , making him the only male actor in history to have three wins in the lead actor category and one of only three male actors to win three Oscars . He was also nominated in this category for In the Name of the Father ( 1993 ) and Gangs of New York ( 2002 ) . He has also won four BAFTA Awards for Best Actor , three Screen Actors Guild Awards and two Golden Globe Awards . In November 2012 , Time named Day @-@ Lewis the " World 's Greatest Actor . " In June 2014 , he received a knighthood at Buckingham Palace for services to drama . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Day @-@ Lewis was born in Kensington , London , the son of poet Cecil Day @-@ Lewis and English actress Jill Balcon . His father , who was born in <unk> , County Laois , Ireland , was of Protestant Anglo @-@ Irish and English background , lived in England from the age of two , and later became the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom . Daniel 's mother was Jewish , and his maternal grandparents ' families had emigrated to England from Latvia and Poland . His maternal grandfather , Michael Balcon , an important figure in the history of British cinema , was the head of Ealing Studios . Two years after his birth , the family moved to Croom 's Hill , Greenwich , south @-@ east London , where Day @-@ Lewis grew up along with his older sister , Tamasin , who became a documentary filmmaker and television chef . 
 Living in Greenwich , Day @-@ Lewis found himself among tough South London children , and , being partially Jewish and " posh " , he was often bullied . He mastered the local accent and mannerisms and credits that as being his first convincing performance . Later in life , he has been known to speak of himself as very much a disorderly character in his younger years , often in trouble for shoplifting and other petty crimes . 
 In 1968 , Day @-@ Lewis ' parents , finding his behaviour to be too wild , sent him to the independent Sevenoaks School in Kent as a boarder . At the school , he was introduced to his three most prominent interests : woodworking , acting , and fishing . His disdain for the school grew , and after two years at Sevenoaks , he was transferred to another independent school , Bedales in Petersfield , Hampshire , which his sister attended , and which had a more relaxed and creative ethos . The transfer led to his film debut at the age of 14 in Sunday Bloody Sunday in which he played a vandal in an uncredited role . He described the experience as " heaven " , for getting paid Â£ 2 to vandalise expensive cars parked outside his local church . 
 For a few weeks in 1972 , he and his parents and sister lived at Lemmons , the north London home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard . Cecil Day @-@ Lewis had cancer and Howard invited the family to Lemmons as a place they could use to rest and recuperate . Cecil died there in May that year . 
 Leaving Bedales in 1975 , Day @-@ Lewis 's unruly attitude had diminished and he needed to make a career choice . Although he had excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre in London , he applied for a five @-@ year apprenticeship as a cabinet @-@ maker , but was rejected due to lack of experience . He was then accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School , which he attended for three years , eventually performing at the Bristol Old Vic itself . At one point he played understudy to Pete Postlethwaite , with whom he would later co @-@ star in the film In the Name of the Father . John <unk> , Day @-@ Lewis 's acting teacher at Bristol Old Vic , recalls , " There was something about him even then . He was quiet and polite , but he was clearly focused on his acting â€“ he had a burning quality . He seemed to have something burning beneath the surface . There was a lot going on beneath that quiet appearance . There was one performance in particular , when the students put on a play called Class Energy , when he really seemed to shine â€“ and it became obvious to us , the staff , that we had someone rather special on our hands .

 During the early 1980s , Day @-@ Lewis worked in theatre and television including Frost in May ( where he played an impotent man @-@ child ) and How Many Miles to Babylon ? ( as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland ) for the BBC . Eleven years after his film debut , Day @-@ Lewis continued his film career with a small part in Gandhi ( 1982 ) as Colin , a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character , only to be immediately chastised by his high @-@ strung mother . In late 1982 he had his big theatre break when he took over the lead in Another Country . The following year , he had a supporting role as the conflicted , but ultimately loyal first mate in The Bounty , after which he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company , playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night 's Dream . 
 In 1985 , Day @-@ Lewis gave his first critically acclaimed performance playing a gay man in an interracial relationship in the film My Beautiful Laundrette , set in 1980s London during the period when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister . Day @-@ Lewis gained further public notice with A Room with a View ( 1985 ) . Set in the Edwardian period of turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ twentieth @-@ century England , he portrayed an entirely different character : Cecil Vyse , the proper upper class fiancÃ© of the main character . In 1987 , Day @-@ Lewis assumed leading man status by starring in Philip Kaufman 's adaptation of Milan Kundera 's The Unbearable Lightness of Being , where he portrayed a Czech surgeon whose hyperactive sex life is thrown into disarray when he allows himself to become emotionally involved with a woman . During the eight @-@ month shoot he learned Czech and first began to refuse to break character on or off the set for the entire shooting schedule . During this period , Day @-@ Lewis and other young British actors of the time such as Gary Oldman , Colin Firth , Tim Roth , and Bruce Payne , were dubbed the " Brit Pack " . 
 Day @-@ Lewis threw his personal version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan 's My Left Foot , which garnered him numerous awards , including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor . Brown , a writer and painter , was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot . Day @-@ Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin , where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities , some of whom had no speech . During filming , he refused to break character . Playing a severely paralysed character on screen , off screen Day @-@ Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair , and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires , all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown 's life , including the embarrassments . Crew members were also required to spoon @-@ feed him . It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched @-@ over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks , something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival . 
 Day @-@ Lewis returned to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre , in Hamlet at the National Theatre , London , but collapsed during the scene where the ghost of Hamlet 's father appears before him . He began sobbing uncontrollably and refused to go back on stage ; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam who finished the performance word @-@ and @-@ action @-@ perfect and received a standing ovation . Ian Charleson then formally replaced Day @-@ Lewis for the rest of the run , except that ill @-@ health forced Northam to stand in again many times . Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion , Day @-@ Lewis later claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father . He has not appeared on stage since . The media attention following his breakdown on @-@ stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid @-@ 1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame .

 In 1992 , three years after his Oscar win , The Last of the Mohicans was released . Day @-@ Lewis 's character research for this film was well @-@ publicized ; he reportedly underwent rigorous weight training and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived , camping , hunting and fishing . Day @-@ Lewis also added to his wood @-@ working skills and learned how to make canoes . He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character and learned how to skin animals . 
 He returned to work with Jim Sheridan on In the Name of the Father , in which he played Gerry Conlon , one of the Guildford Four who were wrongfully convicted of a bombing carried out by the Provisional IRA . He lost <unk> for the part , kept his Northern Irish accent on and off the set for the entire shooting schedule , and spent stretches of time in a prison cell . He also insisted that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him . The film earned him his second Academy Award nomination , third BAFTA nomination , and second Golden Globe nomination . 
 Day @-@ Lewis returned in 1993 , playing Newland Archer in Martin Scorsese 's adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel The Age of Innocence . To prepare for the film , set in America 's Gilded Age , he wore 1870s @-@ period aristocratic clothing around New York City for two months , including top hat , cane and cape . 
 In 1996 , Day @-@ Lewis starred in The Crucible , a film version of the play by Arthur Miller . During the shoot he met his future wife , Rebecca Miller , the author 's daughter . He followed that with Jim Sheridan 's The Boxer as a former boxer and IRA member recently released from prison . His preparation included training with former boxing world champion Barry McGuigan , and attending professional boxing matches such as the Nigel Benn vs. Gerald McClellan world title fight at London Arena . 
 Following The Boxer , Day @-@ Lewis took a leave of absence from acting by going into " semi @-@ retirement " and returning to his old passion of woodworking . He moved to Florence , Italy , where he became intrigued by the craft of shoemaking , eventually apprenticing as a shoemaker with Stefano Bemer . For a time his exact whereabouts and actions were not made publicly known .

 After a five @-@ year absence from filming , Day @-@ Lewis returned to act in Gangs of New York ( 2002 ) , directed by Scorsese and produced by Harvey Weinstein . In his role as the villainous gang leader William " Bill the Butcher " Cutting , he starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio , who played Bill 's young protÃ©gÃ© . He began his lengthy , self @-@ disciplined process by taking lessons as an apprentice butcher , hiring a butcher from Peckham , south London to instruct him in carving up carcasses . He also hired circus performers to teach him to throw knives . While filming , he was never out of character between takes ( including keeping his character 's New York accent ) . At one point during filming , having been diagnosed with pneumonia , he refused to wear a warmer coat or to take treatment because it was not in keeping with the period ; however , he was eventually persuaded to seek medical treatment . His performance in Gangs of New York earned him his third Academy Award nomination and won him his second BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . 
 After Gangs of New York , Day @-@ Lewis 's wife , director Rebecca Miller offered him the lead role in her film The Ballad of Jack and Rose , in which he played a dying man with regrets over how his life had evolved and over how he had brought up his teenage daughter . During filming he arranged to live separately from his wife to achieve the " isolation " needed to focus on his own character 's reality . The film received mixed reviews . 
 In 2007 , Day @-@ Lewis starred in director Paul Thomas Anderson 's loose adaptation of the Upton Sinclair novel Oil ! , titled There Will Be Blood . Day @-@ Lewis received the Academy Award for Best Actor , BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role , Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Motion Picture Drama , Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role ( which he dedicated to Heath Ledger , saying that he was inspired by Ledger 's acting and calling the actor 's performance in Brokeback Mountain " unique , perfect " ) , and a variety of film critics ' circle awards for the role . In winning the Best Actor Oscar , Day @-@ Lewis joined Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson as the only Best Actor winners awarded an Oscar in two non @-@ consecutive decades . 
 In 2009 , Day @-@ Lewis starred in Rob Marshall 's musical adaptation Nine as film director Guido <unk> .

 Day @-@ Lewis played Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg 's film Lincoln ( 2012 ) . Based on the book Team of Rivals : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln , the film began shooting in Richmond , Virginia in October 2011 . Day @-@ Lewis spent a year in preparation for the role , a time he had requested from Spielberg . He read over 100 books on Lincoln , and long worked with the makeup artist to achieve a physical likeness to Lincoln . Lincoln received widespread critical acclaim , much of it directed to Day @-@ Lewis ' performance . It also became a commercial success , grossing over $ 275 million worldwide . In November 2012 , Day @-@ Lewis received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Excellence in Film . 
 At the 70th Golden Globe Awards on 14 January 2013 , Day @-@ Lewis won his second Golden Globe Award for Best Actor , and at the 66th British Academy Film Awards on 10 February , he won his fourth BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . At the 85th Academy Awards , Day @-@ Lewis became the first three @-@ time recipient of the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lincoln . 
 John <unk> , Day @-@ Lewis 's acting teacher at Bristol Old Vic theatre school , lauded his achievement , " Although we have quite an impressive alumni â€“ everyone from Jeremy Irons to Patrick Stewart â€“ I suppose he is now probably the best known , and we 're very proud of all he 's achieved . I certainly hold him up to current students of an example , particularly as an example of how to manage your career with great integrity . He 's never courted fame , and as a result he 's never had his private life impeached upon by the press . He 's clearly not interested in celebrity as such â€“ he 's just interested in his acting . He is still a great craftsman . " Shortly after winning the Oscar for Lincoln , Day @-@ Lewis announced he would be taking a break from acting , retreating back to his Georgian farmhouse in County Wicklow for the next five years , before making another movie .

 LW11 is a para @-@ Alpine and para @-@ Nordic sit skiing sport class , a classification defined by the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC for people with paralysis in the lower extremities and people with cerebral palsy that affects the lower half of the body . Outside of skiing , the competitor in this class is unable to walk . For international competitions , classification is done through IPC Alpine Skiing or IPC Nordic Skiing . For sub @-@ international competitions , classification is done by a national federation such as Alpine Canada . 
 In para @-@ Alpine skiing , the skier uses a mono @-@ ski , while para @-@ Nordic skiers use a two ski sit @-@ ski . Skiers in this class use outriggers , and are required to wear special helmets for some para @-@ Alpine disciplines . In learning to ski , one of the first skills learned is getting into and out of the ski , and how to position the body in the ski in order to maintain balance . The skier then learns how to fall and to get up . 
 A factoring system is used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when there are too few individual competitors in one class in a competition . The factoring for LW11 alpine skiing classification during the 2011 / 2012 skiing season was 0 @.@ 785 for Slalom , 0 @.@ <unk> for Giant Slalom , 0 @.@ <unk> for Super @-@ G and 0 @.@ <unk> for downhill . The percentage for the 2012 / 2013 para @-@ Nordic season was 94 % and for <unk> was 98 % . This classification has been able to compete at different skiing competitions including the Paralympics , IPC Alpine World Championships and the IPC Nordic Skiing World Championships . Skiers in this class include Austrian Robert <unk> . 
 = = Definition = = 
 This is a para @-@ Alpine and para @-@ Nordic sit @-@ skiing classification , where LW stands for Locomotor Winter . This classification is for people with paralysis in the lower extremities and includes people with cerebral palsy that affects the lower half of the body . Outside of skiing , the competitor in this class is unable to walk , the skier " may have loss of buttock sensibility S1 @-@ 25 " . For the 1998 Winter Paralympics , the classification was described as " Disability of lower limbs with a fair sitting balance @-@ paraplegia and standing classes with impairment in the lower limbs together with functional impairment of trunk / hip . " Adapted Physical Education and Sport described this class as " Athletes with disabilities in the lower limbs and fair sitting balance ( e.g. , para classes lower 3 and 4 ) , standing I. classes with impairment of the lower limbs together with significant functional impairment of the trunk and hips , any function in the lower limbs may not be used outside of the equipment at any time during the race ; point score 9 to 15 points . " This classification is comparable to para classes lower 3 and 4 . 
 Generally to be eligible for a sit @-@ skiing classification , a skier needs to meet a minimum of one of several conditions including a single below knee but above ankle amputation , monoplegia that exhibits similar to below knee amputation , legs of different length where there is at least a 7 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) difference , combined muscle strength in the lower extremities less than 71 . 
 The International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) defines this para @-@ Alpine classification as " a . Athletes with disabilities in the lower limbs and a fair sitting balance b . CP with disabilities in lower extremities " In 2002 , the Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification for para @-@ Alpine as a sit skiing classification for " athletes with disabilities in their lower limbs and fair sitting balance . " The IPC defines this class for para @-@ Nordic skiing as for " those with impairments in the lower limbs and trunk . The athlete retains the use of abdominal muscles and trunk extensor muscles , especially those muscle attaching to the pelvis . " Cross Country Canada described this para @-@ Nordic classification as " Impairment in the lower limbs and trunk with fair upper abdominal and trunk muscle activity with some functional sitting balance . Athlete is unable to stand . " 
 For international para @-@ Alpine skiing competitions , classification is done through IPC Alpine Skiing . A national federation such as Alpine Canada handles classification for domestic competitions . For para @-@ Nordic skiing events , classification is handled by IPC Nordic Skiing Technical Committee on the international level and by the national sports federation such as Cross @-@ Country Canada on a country by country level . When being assessed into this classification , a number of things are considered including reviewing the skiers medical history and medical information on the skier 's disability , having a physical and an in person assessment of the skier training or competing . During the assessment process , a testing board is used for this classification with six different tests being conducted that look for balance on different planes and to test for upper body strength and levels of mobility . The guideline scores for people to be assessed in this classification are 9 - 15 . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The IPC defines this class for para @-@ Nordic skiing as for " with impairments in the lower limb ( s ) and the trunk . Athletes have near normal trunk muscles activation . " Cross Country Canada defined this para @-@ Nordic classification as " <unk> in the lower limbs and trunk . With good upper abdominal and trunk muscle activity and good sitting balance . Athlete may be able to stand " in 2012 . Skiers in this class may be able to " stand or walk with or without aid of <unk> " . They may also have Grade 2 or less hip extension . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 In para @-@ Alpine skiing , the skier uses a mono @-@ ski , which are required to have breaks on both sides of the ski . The chair can detach from a ski . Helmets are required for this class in para @-@ Alpine competition , with slalom helmets required for slalom and crash helmets required for the giant slalom . The para @-@ Nordic sit @-@ ski configuration has two skis . Skiers in this classification can use a sit @-@ ski and outriggers , which are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base . In the Biathlon , athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting . 
 = = Technique = = 
 In learning to ski , one of the first skills learned is getting into and out of the ski , and how to position the body in the ski in order to maintain balance . The skier then learns how to fall and to get up . The skier then works with the instructor on learning to ski on flat terrain , with the purpose of this exercise being to learn how to use the outriggers . The skier next learns how to get into and out of a chairlift . After this , the skier learns how to make basic turns , edging , medium radius turns and advance skiing techniques . 
 Skiers use outriggers for balance and as leverage when they fall to right themselves . Outriggers are also used for turning , with the skier using the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn . In para @-@ Nordic skiing , outriggers or ski poles are used top propel the skier forward . If a skier falls , they may require assistance in righting themselves to get back to the fall line . Doing this on their own , the skier needs to position their mono @-@ ski facing uphill relative to the fall line . 
 In the Biathlon , all Paralympic athletes shoot from a prone position . 
 = = Sport = = 
 A factoring system is used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when there are too few individual competitors in one class in a competition . The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels , where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number . The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used . During the 1997 / 1998 ski season , the percentage for this para @-@ Nordic classification was 93 % . For the 2003 / 2004 para @-@ Nordic skiing season , the percentage for was 93 % . The percentage for the 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 ski seasons was 94 % and 98 % for <unk> The factoring for LW11 alpine skiing classification during the 2011 / 2012 skiing season was 0 @.@ 785 for slalom , 0 @.@ <unk> for giant slalom , 0 @.@ <unk> for Super @-@ G and 0 @.@ <unk> for downhill . The percentage for the 2012 / 2013 para @-@ Nordic season was 94 % and for <unk> was 98 % . 
 In para @-@ Alpine events , this classification is grouped with sitting classes who are seeded to start after visually impaired classes and classes in the slalom and giant slalom . In downhill , Super @-@ G and Super Combined , this same group competes after the visually impaired classes and before standing classes . A skier is allowed one push from the starting position at the start of a para @-@ Alpine race : no one is allowed to run while pushing them . In cross @-@ country and biathlon events , this classification is grouped with other sitting classes . The IPC advises event organisers to run the men 's sit @-@ ski group first , and the women 's sit @-@ ski group section , with the visually impaired and standing skiers following . If the competitor skis off the course during a para @-@ Nordic race , they may be assisted back onto the course where they left it by a race official . Skiers cannot use their legs to break or steer during the race . 
 Skiers in this class may injure themselves while skiing . Between 1994 and 2006 , the German national para @-@ Alpine skiing team had three skiers in the LW11 class that had injuries while skiing . It occurred at the 1998 Winter Paralympics when the fell and extended their arm in abduction , which resulted in an <unk> @-@ clavicular separation type Rockwood II . Another 1998 Paralympic skier had a <unk> @-@ Fracture . In 2003 , a skier dislocated their shoulder . This class has a higher rate of " plexus brachialis distorsion and a higher rate of shoulder injuries " compared to able bodied skiers .

 This classification has been able to compete at different skiing competitions . At the 2002 Winter Paralympics in alpine @-@ skiing , this classification was not grouped with others for the men 's downhill , Giant Slalom , slalom and Super @-@ G events while the women were grouped with LW10 and LW12 for their events with the exception of the Giant Slalom where they were only grouped with LW10 . At the 2004 Alpine World Championships , LW10 , LW11 and LW12 women competed against each other in a competition with factored results during the downhill event . At the 2005 IPC Nordic Skiing World Championships , this class was grouped with other sit @-@ skiing classifications . In cross country , this class was eligible to compete in the men 's 5 km , 10 km and 20 km individual race , with women eligible to compete in the 2 @.@ 5 km , 5 km and 10 km individual races . In the men and women 's biathlon , this classification was again grouped with sit @-@ ski classes in the 7 @.@ 4 km race with 2 shooting stages 12 @.@ 5 km race which had four shooting stages .

 = Bates method = 
 The Bates method is an alternative therapy aimed at improving eyesight . Eye @-@ care physician William Horatio Bates , M.D. ( 1860 â€“ 1931 ) attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual strain of the eyes , and felt that glasses were harmful and never necessary . Bates self @-@ published a book , Perfect Sight Without Glasses , as well as a magazine , Better Eyesight Magazine , ( and earlier collaborated with Bernarr MacFadden on a correspondence course ) detailing his approach to helping people relax such " strain " , and thus , he claimed , improve their sight . His techniques centered on visualization and movement . He placed particular emphasis on imagining black letters and marks , and the movement of such . He also felt that exposing the eyes to sunlight would help alleviate the " strain " . 
 Despite continued anecdotal reports of successful results , including well @-@ publicised support by Aldous Huxley , Bates ' techniques have not been objectively shown to improve eyesight . His main physiological proposition â€” that the eyeball changes shape to maintain focus â€” has consistently been contradicted by observation . In 1952 , optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates , " Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists . " Marg concluded that the Bates method owed its popularity largely to " flashes of clear vision " experienced by many who followed it . Such occurrences have since been explained as a contact lens @-@ like effect of moisture on the eye , or a flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles . 
 The Bates method has been criticized not only because there is no good evidence it works , but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it : they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight , put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving , or neglect conventional eye care , possibly allowing serious conditions to develop . 
 = = Underlying concepts = = 
 = = = Accommodation = = = 
 Accommodation is the process by which the eye increases optical power to maintain focus on the retina while shifting its gaze to a closer point . The long @-@ standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the ciliary muscle , a muscle within the eye , which adjusts the curvature of the eye 's crystalline lens . This explanation is based in the observed effect of atropine temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the ciliary muscle , as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point , indicating a change in the lens ' shape . Bates rejected this explanation , and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus , concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation . However , optometrist Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as " so blurred that it is impossible to tell whether one image is larger than the other " , in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images , just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century . 
 Bates adhered to a different explanation of accommodation that had already been generally disregarded by the medical community of his time . Bates ' model had the muscles surrounding the eyeball controlling its focus . In addition to their known function of turning the eye , Bates maintained , they also affect its shape , elongating the eyeball to focus at the near @-@ point or shortening it to focus at a distance . Commenting on this hypothesis in an interview with <unk> , ophthalmologist Richard E. Bensinger stated " When we put drops in the eye to dilate the pupil , they paralyze the focusing muscles . The evidence of the anatomical fallacy is that you can 't focus , but your eye can move up and down , left and right . The notion that external muscles affect focusing is totally wrong . " Science author John Grant writes that many animals , such as fishes , accommodate by elongation of the eyeball , " it 's just that humans aren 't one of those animals . " 
 Laboratory tests have shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be necessary to accomplish what Bates described . Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball ( 18 @.@ 6 â€“ 19 @.@ 2 micrometres ) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation . However , these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus , producing changes of only âˆ’ 0 @.@ 036 <unk> . 
 = = = Causes of sight problems = = = 
 Medical professionals characterize refractive errors such as nearsightedness , farsightedness , astigmatism , and <unk> ( the age @-@ related blurring of near @-@ point vision ) as consequences of the eye 's shape and other basic anatomy , which there is no evidence that any exercise can alter . Bates , however , believed that these conditions are caused by tension of the muscles surrounding the eyeball , which he believed prevents the eyeball from sufficiently changing shape ( per his explanation of accommodation ) when gaze is shifted nearer or farther . Bates characterized this supposed muscular tension as the consequence of a " mental strain " to see , the relief of which he claimed would instantly improve sight . He also linked disturbances in the circulation of blood , which he said is " very largely influenced by thought " , not only to refractive errors but also to double vision , crossed @-@ eye , lazy eye , and to more serious eye conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma . His therapies were based on these assumptions . 
 Bates felt that corrective lenses , which he characterized as " eye crutches " , are an impediment to curing poor vision . In his view , " strain " would increase as the eyes adjust to the correction in front of them . He thus recommended that glasses be discarded by anyone applying his method . 
 = = Treatments = = 
 In his writings , Bates discussed several techniques that he claimed helped patients to improve their sight . He wrote " The ways in which people strain to see are infinite , and the methods used to relieve the strain must be almost equally varied , " emphasizing that no single approach would work for everyone . His techniques were all designed to help disassociate this " strain " from seeing and thereby achieve " central fixation " , or seeing what is in the central point of vision without staring . He asserted that " all errors of refraction and all functional disturbances of the eye disappear when it sees by central fixation " and that other conditions were often relieved as well . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Bates suggested closing the eyes for minutes at a time to help bring about relaxation . He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by " palming " , or covering the closed eyes with the palms of the hands , without putting pressure on the eyeballs . If the covered eyes did not strain , he said , they would see " a field so black that it is impossible to remember , imagine , or see anything blacker " , since light was excluded by the palms . However , he reported that some of his patients experienced " illusions of lights and colors " sometimes amounting to " kaleidoscopic appearances " as they " palmed " , occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous " strain " and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed . This phenomenon , however , was almost certainly caused by <unk> or " dark light " . In fact , even in conditions of perfect darkness , as inside a cave , neurons at every level of the visual system produce random background activity that is interpreted by the brain as patterns of light and color . 
 = = = Visualization = = = 
 Bates placed importance on mental images , as he felt relaxation was the key to clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight . He claimed that one 's poise could be gauged by the visual memory of black ; that the darker it appeared in the mind , and the smaller the area of black that could be imagined , the more relaxed one was at the moment . He recommended that patients think of the top letter from an eye chart and then visualize progressively smaller black letters , and eventually a period or comma . But he emphasized his view that the clear visual memory of black " cannot be attained by any sort of effort " , stating that " the memory is not the cause of the relaxation , but must be preceded by it , " and cautioned against " concentrating " on black , as he regarded an attempt to " think of one thing only " as a strain . 
 While Bates preferred to have patients imagine something black , he also reported that some found objects of other colors easiest to visualize , and thus were benefited most by remembering those , because , he asserted , " the memory can never be perfect unless it is easy . " Skeptics reason that the only benefit to eyesight gained from such techniques is itself imagined , and point out that familiar objects , including letters on an eye chart , can be recognized even when they appear less than clear . 
 = = = Movement = = = 
 He thought that the manner of eye movement affected the sight . He suggested " shifting " , or moving the eyes back and forth to get an illusion of objects " swinging " in the opposite direction . He believed that the smaller the area over which the " swing " was experienced , the greater was the benefit to sight . He also indicated that it was usually helpful to close the eyes and imagine something " swinging " . By alternating actual and mental shifting over an image , Bates wrote , many patients were quickly able to shorten the " shift " to a point where they could " conceive and swing a letter the size of a period in a newspaper " . One who mastered this would attain the " universal swing " , Bates believed . 
 Perhaps finding Bates ' concepts of " shifting " and " swinging " too complicated , some proponents of vision improvement , such as Bernarr Macfadden , suggested simply moving the eyes up and down , from side to side , and shifting one 's gaze between a near @-@ point and a far @-@ point . 
 = = = Sunning = = = 
 Bates believed that the eyes were benefited by exposure to sunlight . He stated that " persons with normal sight can look directly at the sun , or at the strongest artificial light , without injury or discomfort , " and gave several examples of patients ' vision purportedly improving after <unk> â€“ this is at variance with the well @-@ known risk of eye damage that can result from direct sunlight observation . 
 Bates cautioned that , just as one should not attempt to run a marathon without training , one should not immediately look directly at the sun , but he suggested that it could be worked up to . He acknowledged that looking at the sun could have ill effects , but characterized them as being " always temporary " and in fact the effects of strain in response to sunlight . He wrote that he had cured people who believed that the sun had caused them permanent eye damage . In his magazine , Bates later suggested exposing only the white part of the eyeball to direct sunlight , and only for seconds at a time , after allowing the sun to shine on closed eyelids for a longer period . 
 Posthumous publications of Bates ' book omitted mention of the supposed benefits from direct sunlight shining on open eyes . 
 = = Results and criticism = = 
 Bates ' techniques have never been scientifically established to improve eyesight . Several of Bates ' techniques , including " sunning " , " swinging " , and " palming " , were combined with healthy changes to diet and exercise in a 1983 randomized controlled trial of myopic children in India . After 6 months , the experimental groups " did not show any statistically significant difference in refractive status " , though the children in the treatment group " subjectively â€¦ felt relieved of eye strain and other symptoms " . 
 In 1967 the British Medical Journal observed that " Bates [ â€¦ ] advocated prolonged sun @-@ gazing as the treatment of myopia , with disastrous results . " 
 The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt has argued that the method Bates described would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization . Leavitt asked " How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something , or just thinks that he or she has imagined it ? " In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial , Leavitt commented " I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while we know that he has not . " 
 = = After Bates = = 
 After Bates died in 1931 , his methods of treatment were continued by his widow Emily and other associates , some of whom incorporated exercises and dietary recommendations . Most subsequent proponents did not stand by Bates ' explanation of how the eye focuses mechanically , but nonetheless maintained that relieving a habitual " strain " was the key to improving sight . 
 = = = Margaret Darst Corbett = = = 
 Margaret Darst Corbett first met Bates when she consulted him about her husband 's eyesight . She became his pupil , and eventually taught his method at her School of Eye Education in Los Angeles . She was of the stated belief that " the optic nerve is really part of the brain , and vision is nine @-@ tenths mental and one @-@ tenth only physical . " 
 In late 1940 , Corbett and her assistant were charged with violations of the Medical Practice Act of California for treating eyes without a licence . At the trial , many of her students testified on her behalf , describing in detail how she had enabled them to discard their glasses . One witness testified that he had been almost blind from cataracts , but that , after working with Corbett , his vision had improved to such an extent that for the first time he could read for eight hours at a stretch without glasses . Corbett explained in court that she was practicing neither optometry nor ophthalmology and represented herself not as a doctor but only as an " instructor of eye training " . Describing her method she said " We turn vision on by teaching the eyes to shift . We want the sense of motion to relieve staring , to end the fixed look . We use light to relax the eyes and to accustom them to the sun . " 
 The trial attracted widespread interest , as did the " not guilty " verdict . The case spurred a bill in the Californian State Legislature that would have then made such vision education illegal without an optometric or medical licence . After a lively campaign in the media , the bill was rejected . 
 = = = Aldous Huxley = = = 
 Perhaps the most famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley . At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis , which , after an 18 @-@ month period of near @-@ blindness , left him with one eye just capable of light perception and the other with an unaided Snellen fraction of 10 / 200 . This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas , complicated by <unk> and astigmatism . He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine , to allow that eye to see around an opacity in the center of the cornea . 
 In 1939 , at the age of 45 and with eyesight that continued to deteriorate , he happened to hear of the Bates method and sought the help of Margaret Corbett , who gave him regular lessons . Three years later he wrote The Art of Seeing , in which he related : " Within a couple of months I was reading without spectacles and , what was better still , without strain and fatigue .... At the present time , my vision , though very far from normal , is about twice as good as it used to be when I wore spectacles . " Describing the process , Huxley wrote that " Vision is not won by making an effort to get it : it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert passivity , of dynamic relaxation . " He expressed indifference regarding the veracity of Bates ' explanation of how the eye focuses , stating that " my concern is not with the anatomical mechanism of accommodation , but with the art of seeing . " 
 His case generated wide publicity as well as scrutiny . Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster , for example , suggested in 1944 that Huxley had " learned how to use what he has to better advantage " by training the " cerebral part of seeing " , rather than actually improving the quality of the image on the retina . 
 In 1952 , ten years after writing The Art of Seeing , Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet , wearing no glasses and , according to Bennett Cerf , apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty . In Cerf 's words : 
 Then suddenly he faltered â€” and the disturbing truth became obvious . He wasn 't reading his address at all . He had learned it by heart . To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes . When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn 't read it , and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him . It was an agonizing moment . 
 In response to this , Huxley wrote " I often do use magnifying glasses where conditions of light are bad , and have never claimed to be able to read except under very good conditions . " This underscored that he had not regained anything close to normal vision , and in fact never claimed that he had . 
 = = = Modern variants = = = 
 " Natural vision correction " or " natural vision improvement " continues to be marketed by practitioners offering individual instruction , many of who have no medical or optometric credentials . Most base their approach in the Bates method , though some also integrate vision therapy techniques . There are also many self @-@ help books and programs , which have not been subjected to randomized controlled trials , aimed at improving eyesight naturally . <unk> of such approaches argue that they lack the funds to formally test them . 
 The heavily advertised " See Clearly Method " ( of which sales were halted by a court order in November 2006 , in response to what were found to be dishonest marketing practices ) included " palming " and " light therapy " , both adapted from Bates . The creators of the program , however , emphasized that they did not endorse Bates ' approach overall . 
 In his 1992 book The Bates Method , A Complete Guide to Improving Eyesight â€” Naturally , " Bates method teacher " Peter Mansfield was very critical of eye care professionals for prescribing corrective lenses , recommending most of Bates ' techniques to improve vision . The book included accounts of twelve " real cases " , but did not report any information about refractive error . 
 Czech native John Slavicek claims to have created an " eye cure " that improves eyesight in three days , borrowing from ancient yogic eye exercises , visualizations from the Seth Material , and the Bates method . Although he has testimonials from his neighbor and others , several of his students indicate that he has greatly exaggerated their cases . Slavicek 's self @-@ published manual , Yoga for the Eyes , was rejected by an ophthalmologist who evaluated it , and evinced no interest from the World Health Organization and St. Erik 's Eye Foundation in Sweden as he had not conducted double @-@ blind tests . 
 = = Anecdotal support = = 
 In support of the effectiveness of the Bates method , proponents point to the many accounts of people allegedly having improved their eyesight by applying it . While these anecdotes may be told and passed on in good faith , several potential explanations exist for the phenomena reported other than a genuine reversal of a refractive error due to the techniques practiced : 
 Some cases of nearsightedness are recognized as due to a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle , rather than a misshapen eyeball . These are classed as <unk> , of which spontaneous reversal may account for some reports of improvement . 
 Research has confirmed that when nearsighted subjects remove their corrective lenses , over time there is a limited improvement ( termed " blur adaptation " ) in their unaided visual resolution , even though refraction indicates no corresponding change in refractive error . This is believed to occur due to adjustments made in the visual system . One who has been practicing Bates ' techniques and notices such improvement may not realize that simply leaving the glasses off would have had the same effect , which may be especially pronounced if the prescription was too strong to begin with . 
 Visual acuity is affected by the size of the pupil . When it constricts ( such as in response to an increase in light ) , the quality of focus will improve significantly , at the cost of a reduced ability to see in dim light . This is known as the " pinhole effect " . This concept is also used in photography when changing the aperture size . 
 Some eye defects may naturally change for the better with age or in cycles ( ophthalmologist Stewart Duke @-@ Elder suggested that this is what happened with Aldous Huxley ) . A cataract when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time . One who happens to have been practicing the Bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause . 
 Some studies have suggested that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may account for perceived improvements in eyesight . Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster had this to say : " Since seeing is only partly a matter of the image on the retina and the sensation it produces , but is in still larger part a matter of the cerebral processes of synthesis , in which memories play a principal role , it follows that by repetition , by practice , by exercises , one builds up a substratum of memories useful for the interpretation of sensations and facilitates the syntheses which are the major part of seeing . " Lancaster faulted ophthalmologists in general for neglecting the role of the brain in the process of seeing , " leaving to irregular , half @-@ trained workers the cultivation of that field " . 
 A 1952 study involving 100 subjects claiming to experience " flashes " of clear vision , in which eyesight momentarily becomes much sharper , found only one subject who " demonstrated unusually good transient acuity ( a flash ) but she was unable to maintain it or repeat it for measurement of refraction " and concluded that " ' <unk> ' ( those who can obtain remarkably large transient increases in visual acuity ) are uncommon " . A 2004 study proposed that such flashes may be caused by " negative accommodation " ( i.e. an active flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles ) . 
 A 1982 study of subjects who underwent computer @-@ based visual training concluded that any perceived resulting improvement in visual acuity is best explained as a contact lens @-@ like effect of moisture on the eye , based on increased tear action exhibited by 15 out of 17 subjects who experienced such improvement . 
 A 2003 study of claims that " positive suggestion ( e.g. , using hypnosis ) can significantly improve visual acuity " found that " neither suggestion nor hypnotic phenomena are likely to significantly improve myopic vision " . 
 = = General research = = 
 In 2004 the American Academy of Ophthalmology ( AAO ) published a review of various research regarding " visual training " , which consisted of " eye exercises , muscle relaxation techniques , biofeedback , eye patches , or eye massages " , " alone or in combinations " . No evidence was found that such techniques could objectively benefit eyesight , though some studies noted changes , both positive and negative , in the visual acuity of nearsighted subjects as measured by a Snellen chart . In some cases noted improvements were maintained at subsequent follow @-@ ups . However , these results were not seen as actual reversals of nearsightedness , and were attributed instead to factors such as " improvements in interpreting blurred images , changes in mood or motivation , creation of an artificial contact lens by tear film changes , or a pinhole effect from <unk> of the pupil . " 
 In 2005 the Ophthalmology Department of New Zealand 's Christchurch Hospital published a review of forty @-@ three studies regarding the use of eye exercises . They found that " As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises " to improve visual acuity , and concluded that " their use therefore remains controversial . "

 A frequent criticism of the Bates method is that it has remained relatively obscure , which is seen as proof that it is not truly effective . Writer Alan M. MacRobert concluded in a 1979 article that the " most telling argument against the Bates system " and other alternative therapies was that they " bore no fruit " . In regards to the Bates method , he reasoned that " If palming , shifting , and swinging could really cure poor eyesight , glasses would be as obsolete by now as horse @-@ drawn carriages . "

 Discarding one 's corrective lenses , as Bates recommended , or wearing lenses weaker than one 's prescribed correction , as some Bates method advocates suggest , poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations , especially when one is operating a motor vehicle . James Randi related that his father , shortly after discarding glasses on the advice of Bates ' book , wrecked his car . Bates method teachers often caution that when driving , one should wear the correction legally required .

 One of the greatest potential dangers of faith in the Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight @-@ threatening condition requiring prompt treatment , such as glaucoma . Also , children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye . Such treatment may include exercises , but which are different from those associated with the Bates method , and parents who subscribe to Bates ' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late . It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction . 
 = Maneater ( 2007 film ) = 
 Maneater is a 2007 American television natural horror film directed by Gary Yates and produced by RHI Entertainment , starring Gary Busey , Ty Wood , and Ian D. Clark . The film aired on various video on demand channels , before officially premiering in the United States on the Syfy Channel on September 8 , 2007 . This film lends its name to the film series to which it belongs and is the third film in the series . Filmed in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada , the film is produced under an agreement with Syfy . Based on Jack Warner 's novel Shikar , the film details the killing spree of an escaped Bengal tiger after it gets loose in a small town along the Appalachian Trail . Trying to stop it are Sheriff Barnes ( Busey ) and big game hunter Colonel Graham ( Clark ) , while a young boy named Roy ( Wood ) who has a strange connection to the tiger , tries to save it . It is the 4th film in the Maneater Series . 
 Maneater is one of the few films in the series to break the standard formula of Syfy natural horror films with its use of a normal , living tiger rather than a CG animal or excusing its behavior by having it be a mutant or genetically altered . Critics heavily panned the film citing substandard acting , heavy use of stereotypical characters , a hole @-@ filled plot , unused subplots , and the use of a live tiger resulting in almost all attacks being implied rather than seen . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Two people disappear along the Appalachian Trail : a young man jogging with his girlfriend and a hermit who rarely leaves his home . Sheriff Grady Barnes ( Gary Busey ) finds a trail in the woods which leads him to parts of the hermit 's body . That night , young Roy Satterly ( Ty Wood ) is reading by flashlight when a Bengal tiger briefly appears in front of his bedroom window . In the morning , his mother , Rose ( Marina Stephenson Kerr ) , finds him sleepwalking in the woods in front of their house . A cast taken at the next victim 's scene points to a tiger as the hermit 's killer , so Sheriff Barnes holds a press conference to warn the public . The Bengal Tiger visits Roy 's home again that night . 
 A tabloid paper offers a $ 10 @,@ 000 reward for the tiger causing the town to be inundated with hunters and reporters . The sheriff forbids anyone from going in the woods and hunting the tiger , but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman ( Sarah <unk> ) , he sees Roy in the woods . They give chase , but instead find a dead tabloid reporter . The National Guard is called in to help . The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning . After he leaves , she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him . 
 Six National Guardsmen arrive , led by Sergeant Winshiser ( Aleks Paunovic ) , as does Colonel James Livingston @-@ Graham ( Ian D. Clark ) , an experienced big game hunter and tracker from England who specializes in hunting man @-@ eating tigers . Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff 's advice and help . Graham tells the sheriff the soldiers will fail due to their arrogance and that he will start his hunt for the tiger when they finish . When the guardsmen search for the tiger , it kills one silently . Graham appears and explains how the tiger did it and helps them find the body . Later , Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt ( Karl Thordarson ) , the mayor 's son , find one of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road . They investigate and Weinman tells Hundt to call their position in to headquarters . She finds that the two guardsmen were attacked by the tiger , one being killed and the other shot by his partner . Hearing Hundt blowing the patrol car horn , she runs back to the car , but the Tiger has already killed him . Meanwhile , Roy encounters Graham in the woods and they discuss the tiger . When Roy asks if Graham is going to kill the Tiger , Graham tells him that he must because it can 't chose not to hunt whatever is around it , including people . They shake hands and part ways with Graham continuing to the scene of the National Guard attack . When he arrives , he explains how the tiger attacked the guardsmen and deputy . 
 Later , at another press conference , a reporter reveals that Graham was exiled from India , his former home , after he failed to kill a tiger that slaughtered over 200 people . The sheriff visits Graham that night and he explains that the situation had been beyond his control . Later that night , Roy dreams the tiger killed Graham and runs to his tent to check on him . Graham offers to walk him home , but they end up going to the store where Rose works when Roy says she is working late . 
 When they arrive , the Tiger attacks and kills her . They run into the store , but are separated . Graham calls for Roy , but the Tiger gets into the building and attacks him , Graham barely failing to kill the tiger with both shots he fires . Sheriff Barnes arrives after being alerted about a break @-@ in alarm and is chased into the store by the tiger . He finds Graham 's hat and a blood trail and tries to find him before hearing Roy calling out from under a truck outside . The sheriff dives under the truck and shields the boy as the Tiger tries to attack . When the Tiger jumps into the bed of the truck , they run to the sheriff 's truck . The sheriff shoots at the tiger , but hits a gasoline tank causing it to explode and kill the Tiger . Graham appears beside the building , bloody but alive . Deciding his hunting days are over , Graham returns home . Sheriff Barnes and his wife adopt the orphaned Roy .

 = = Production = = 
 In October 2006 , RHI Entertainment made a deal with the Sci Fi Channel to produce a series of ten made @-@ for @-@ television natural horror films to air on the network the following year . Though the film series was dubbed " Maneater " by RHI Entertainment , the actual Maneater film is the third in the series . Although the agreement called for the films to premiere on Sci Fi , the first six films in the series actually premiered on various video on demand channels months ahead of their Sci Fi airings . 
 Based on Jack Warner 's 2003 debut novel Shikar , Maneater was filmed in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada . The film uses no CGI special effects at all , with the " killer tiger " portrayed by actual trained tigers . In scenes where the tiger is chasing various characters , the tiger is actually on a leash with his trainer behind him . The leash and trainer were edited out of the scenes during post @-@ production . While Gary Busey said the tigers were a " joy " to work with , Clark joked that he was hoping they would not think he was lunch , noting that it was his first time working with tigers . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Maneater premiered in Canada on the subscription @-@ based video on demand channel Movie Central on Demand earlier in 2007 before it aired in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on September 8 , 2007 as its Saturday night " Movie of the Week " premiere . On January 8 , 2008 , Genius Entertainment released the film on DVD . It included no extras , an anamorphic widescreen transfer , and a Dolby Digital 5 @.@ 1 audio track . The film was re @-@ released on July 22 , 2008 as part of the first volume of the " Maneater Series Collection " sets . The volume also included Blood Monkey and In the Spider 's Web , the first and second films in the series , respectively . 
 = = Reception = = 
 As with many other films in the series , Maneater was heavily panned by critics . Felix Gonzalez , Jr. of <unk> referred to the film as " another Z @-@ grade extravaganza of gore and mayhem " and felt that it was typical of most Sci Fi original movies in that it contained " horrendous writing and nonsensical characters . " He considered Busey 's being the headliner was the first sign of trouble , stating that " with his ill @-@ fitting suit and incomprehensible facial expressions , ( Busey ) is actually more frightening than the tiger . " Matt Paprocki from Blogcritics felt the original novel was superior to its film adaptation , and felt the movie was " an appallingly bad creature feature that barely qualifies as such " with multiple plot holes , unexplored subplots , and stereotypical characters plagued by bad acting . 
 Staci Layne Wilson of <unk> also felt the film was full of stereotypes , including a " stupid circus trainer ; bible @-@ thumping <unk> ; the great white hunter ; small @-@ minded mayor ; <unk> press ; wise Indian sage ; [ and ] military sorts " but felt they were depicted in such an extreme manner that they were simply boring . She found the films conclusion to be predictable and " corny " . She did praise the film 's cinematography and visual appeal despite the limited number of filming locations actually used . In reviewing the film for DVD Talk , film instructor and critic Justin Felix found the use of a real tiger one of the only original elements of the film , while feeling the plot , setting , and characters followed the set Sci Fi Channel movie of the week formula . At the same time , he notes that the use of a live tiger results in most attacks occurring off screen and the tiger being rarely seen at all , taking away the " usual " fun of laughing at badly done " CG terrors . " Monsters and <unk> 's Jeff Swindoll felt the film was a poor attempt at replicating Jaws with the tiger taking on the role of a " land shark . " While he felt the character of Colonel Graham was contrived and seemed to come from another era , Swindoll did think Ian D. Clark did portray the character decently . Like other critics , Swindoll praised the use of a live tiger , but also notes that it was obvious the tiger was playing with the actors like a " sweet pussycat " and that the post @-@ production editing did a bad job of trying to make it look like the tiger was a vicious killer . 
 Several reviewers praised the film for being more subdued than most of Sci @-@ Fi 's gore @-@ filled creature films and for its use of a live tiger rather than poor CGI effects . However , David Johnson of DVD Verdict , heavily criticized the film for " its significant dearth of righteous tiger @-@ attack action " . He found the implied violence resulted in a boring film that will not satisfy more horror film buff : " the gore @-@ hounds that might be attracted to the promise of a big @-@ ass tiger sinking his teeth into some hapless rednecks will be almost certainly disappointed . The big bummer is that we don 't even get any tiger on human direct action until the very end , and that 's boilerplate Lassie stuff with a stuntman fending off a laid @-@ back stunt tiger " . Conversely , unlike other reviewers , he praised the characters , feeling they were interesting and ended up being ones he " somewhat cared about . " 
 = SM U @-@ 41 ( Austria @-@ Hungary ) = 
 SM U @-@ 41 or U @-@ XLI was a U @-@ 27 class U @-@ boat or submarine for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . U @-@ 41 , built by the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino ( CNT ) at the Pola Navy Yard , was launched in November 1917 . When she was commissioned in February 1918 , she became the last boat of her class to enter service . She was also the last domestically constructed Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boat to enter service . 
 She had a single hull just over 122 feet ( 37 m ) in length . She displaced 280 metric tons ( 276 long tons ) when surfaced and over 325 metric tons ( 320 long tons ) when submerged . Her two diesel engines moved her at up to 9 knots ( 17 km / h ) on the surface , while her twin electric motors propelled her at up to 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while underwater . She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and a machine gun . 
 During a short service career marred by repeated engine breakdowns , U @-@ 41 sank one ship , the French steamer Amiral Charner of 4 @,@ 604 gross register tons ( GRT ) . U @-@ 41 was at Cattaro at war 's end , and was ceded to France as a war reparation in 1920 . She was towed to Bizerta and broken up within a year . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Austria @-@ Hungary 's U @-@ boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I. The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five Type UB I submarines that comprised the U @-@ 10 class from Germany , by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine Curie as U @-@ 14 , and by building four submarines of the U @-@ 20 class that were based on the 1911 Danish Havmanden class . 
 Once these steps had alleviated their most urgent needs , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915 . The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro @-@ Hungarian construction , but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria @-@ Hungary . The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen , one of the two German shipyards building UB II submarines . 
 U @-@ 41 displaced 280 metric tons ( 276 long tons ) surfaced and 326 metric tons ( 321 long tons ) submerged . She had a single hull with saddle tanks , and was planned to be 121 feet 1 inch ( 36 @.@ 91 m ) long with a beam of 14 feet 4 inches ( 4 @.@ 37 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 2 inches ( 3 @.@ 71 m ) . For propulsion , she had two shafts , twin diesel engines of 270 bhp ( 200 kW ) for surface running , and twin electric motors of 280 shp ( 210 kW ) for submerged travel . She was capable of 9 knots ( 16 @.@ 7 km / h ) while surfaced and 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific notation of a range for U @-@ 41 in Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships , 1906 â€“ 1921 , the German UB II boats , upon which the U @-@ 27 class was based , had a range of over 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ) surfaced , and 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ) submerged . U @-@ 27 @-@ class boats were designed for a crew of 23 â€“ 24 . 
 U @-@ 41 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and could carry a complement of four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm / 26 ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun . 
 U @-@ 41 was ordered from Cantiere Navale Triestino ( CNT ) as a replacement for U @-@ 6 ( which had been sunk in May 1916 ) . She was laid down on 23 February 1917 at the Pola Navy Yard . During construction , U @-@ 41 was lengthened by nearly 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) to accommodate diesel engines that had been ordered for U @-@ 6 before her loss . U @-@ 41 was launched on 11 November . 
 = = Service career = = 
 On 19 February 1918 , SM U @-@ 41 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Edgar Wolf . Previously in command of U @-@ 4 for a week in April 1915 , the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Wolf was a native of Fiume ( present @-@ day Rijeka , Croatia ) . When she entered service , U @-@ 41 was the last boat of her class to do so . She was also the last domestically constructed U @-@ boat completed and commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . Wolf and U @-@ 41 departed Pola on 17 March for a patrol in the Mediterranean . On 30 March , Wolf attempted to torpedo a steamer off the coast of Africa , but missed his target . Three days later , the left diesel engine failed and Wolf steered his boat back to port , arriving at Cattaro on 5 April . U @-@ 41 sailed for Pola on 9 April and , completing the journey two days later , underwent repairs over the next six weeks . While conducting a diving trial out of Pola on 25 May , the boat sprang a leak at the depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . She returned to Pola and underwent more extensive repairs , remaining there until August . 
 After making way to the submarine base at Brioni , U @-@ 41 set out on another patrol into the Mediterranean on 29 August , but put into Sebenico the next day for engine repairs . Resuming her patrol after a day 's delay , U @-@ 41 reached her patrol area east of Malta . Wolf and U @-@ 41 scored their first success on 13 September , when they torpedoed and sank the steamer Amiral Charner west of Pantellaria . The 4 @,@ 604 @-@ ton French ship was carrying horses and a general cargo from Marseilles for Salonika when she was attacked . Six were killed in the attack on the French ship . On 26 September , U @-@ 41 attacked another steamer west of Kefalonia , but was apparently unsuccessful . U @-@ 41 ended her patrol at Cattaro on 28 September . 
 On October 6 , Wolf and U @-@ 41 set out from Cattaro to patrol off Durazzo and the Albanian coast . After nine days without success , the boat returned to Cattaro , and remained there through the end of the war . On 1 November , U @-@ 41 was taken over by a British commission , who controlled the vessel until she was ceded to France as a war reparation in 1920 . U @-@ 41 and sister boats U @-@ 29 and U @-@ 31 were towed to Bizerta . U @-@ 29 foundered en route , but U @-@ 31 and U @-@ 41 reached their destination and were scrapped within the next year . 
 = Hurricane Carla = 
 Hurricane Carla ranks as the most intense U.S. tropical cyclone landfall on the Hurricane Severity Index . The third named storm and first Category 5 hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season , Carla developed from an area of squally weather in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 3 . Initially a tropical depression , it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward , and by September 5 , the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carla . About 24 hours later , Carla was upgraded to a hurricane . Shortly thereafter , the storm curved northward while approaching the YucatÃ¡n Channel . Late on September 7 , Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico while passing just northeast of the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula . By early on the following day , the storm became a major hurricane after reaching Category 3 intensity . Resuming its northwestward course , Carla continued intensification and on September 11 , it was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane . Later that day , Carla weakened slightly , but was still a large and intense hurricane when the storm made landfall near Port O 'Connor , Texas . It weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on September 12 . Heading generally northward , Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 13 , while centered over southern Oklahoma . Rapidly moving northeastward , Carla 's remnants reached the Labrador Sea , Canada and dissipated on September 17 , 1961 . 
 While crossing the YucatÃ¡n Channel , the outer bands of Carla brought gusty winds and severe local flooding in western Cuba and the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula , though no damage or fatalities were reported . Although initially considered a significant threat to Florida , the storm brought only light winds and small amounts of precipitation , reaching no more than 3 @.@ 15 in ( 80 mm ) . In Texas , wind gusts as high as 170 mph ( 280 km / h ) were observed in Port Lavaca . Additionally , several tornadoes spawned in the state caused notable impacts , with the most destructive twister resulting in 200 buildings severely damaged , of which at least 60 were destroyed , and 8 deaths and 55 injuries . Throughout the state , Carla destroyed 1 @,@ 915 homes , 568 farm buildings , and 415 other buildings . Additionally , 50 @,@ 723 homes , 5 @,@ 620 farm buildings , and 10 @,@ 487 other buildings suffered damage . There were 34 fatalities and at least $ 300 million ( 1961 USD ) in losses in Texas alone . Several tornadoes also touched down in Louisiana , causing the destruction of 140 homes and 11 farms and other buildings , and major damage to 231 additional homes and 11 farm and other buildings . Minor to moderate damage was also reported to 748 homes and 75 farm and other buildings . Six deaths and $ 25 million in losses in Louisiana were attributed to Carla . Heavy rainfall occurred in several other states , especially in Kansas , where flash flooding severely damaged crops and drowned 5 people . Overall , Carla resulted in $ 325 @.@ 74 million in losses and 43 fatalities .

 As early as September 1 , a tropical disturbance â€“ an area of convective activity â€“ was observed tracking westward across the Caribbean Sea within the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) . Around that time , an anticyclone was situated over the western Caribbean Sea at the upper @-@ tropospheric levels . Surface charts indicate that a low @-@ level circulation was developing early on September 3 . Thus , it is estimated that a tropical depression â€“ a tropical cyclone with sustained winds with winds of less than 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) â€“ developed about 175 miles ( 282 km ) northwest of Barranquilla , Colombia at 1200 UTC . Initially , the center of circulation remained difficult to locate on surface charts due to lack of data . At San AndrÃ©s , winds shifted west at about 12 mph ( 19 km / h ) , while barometric pressures dropped to 1 @,@ 007 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . The Weather Bureau Office in Miami , Florida issued its first bulletin at 1600 UTC on September 4 , while the depression was centered about 250 miles ( 400 km ) east @-@ southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios , Nicaragua . 
 It is estimated that sustained winds reached 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) at 1200 UTC on September 5 , thus the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Carla , while located just northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios . A reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that Carla was continuing to intensify , with surface winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Radars reported an unusually large tropical cyclone , with convective bands extending about 520 miles ( 840 km ) outward from the center . Around 0000 UTC on September 6 , Carla passed near Swan Island , which reported a barometric pressure of about 995 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) and wind gusts of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) from the southwest . Based on observations obtained by a reconnaissance aircraft at 1100 UTC on September 6 â€“ namely a barometric pressure of 982 mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) â€“ a bulletin issued by the Weather Bureau an hour later indicated that the storm had " probably reached hurricane intensity " . According to post @-@ season analysis , Carla reached hurricane status at that time . 
 Shortly after becoming a hurricane on September 6 , Carla curved northward in the northwestern Caribbean Sea . At 1200 UTC on September 7 , the storm intensified into a Category 2 hurricane while located east @-@ northeast of Cozumel , Quintana Roo , Mexico ( actual use of the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale , which was developed in 1971 , was not in effect ) . Shortly thereafter , Carla crossed the YucatÃ¡n Channel and entered the Gulf of Mexico . A strong high pressure area forced Carla to resume its original northwesterly course . Early on September 8 , the storm strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane while located just north of the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula . Thus , Carla was the third major hurricane of the season . Carla was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane early on September 10 , while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States . At 0000 UTC on September 11 , Carla strengthened into a Category 5 while located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico . Six hours later , the storm reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) . 
 Although it weakened back to a Category 4 hurricane late on September 11 , Carla reached its minimum barometric pressure of 931 mbar ( 27 @.@ 5 inHg ) . Later that day , the storm struck Matagorda Island , Texas ( seven miles south of Port O 'Connor ) with winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) . Carla rapidly weakened inland , and degenerated to a Category 2 hurricane on September 12 , while passing just east of Port Lavaca . Six hours later , the storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane near Shiner , shortly before being downgraded to a tropical storm between Taylor and Coupland . Beginning late on September 12 , the storm curved just east of due north . After reaching Oklahoma early on September 13 , Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located over rural Johnston County . The extratropical remnants of Carla moved rapidly northeastward and brought heavy rainfall to some areas of the Great Plains and Midwestern United States . By September 14 , it entered Canada near Sault Ste . Marie , Ontario . Continuing swiftly northeastward across Ontario , Quebec , and Labrador , before the remnants dissipated over the Labrador Sea on September 17 .

 Occurring a year after Hurricane Donna , officials in the Florida Keys took precautions to brace for potential impact from the storm . The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West , while Coast Guardsmen evacuated Alligator Reef Light , American Shoal Light , and Sombrero Key Light . Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls . On the morning of September 7 , a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of Louisiana eastward to Apalachicola , Florida . On September 8 , a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from Vermilion Bay westward . It was later extended westward to include the entire coast of Texas , and eastward to Apalachicola , Florida . A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass , Texas to Grand Isle , Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600 UTC on September 9 . An estimated 500 @,@ 000 people fled the coasts of Texas and Louisiana , making it the largest evacuation in the history of the United States , at the time . Further , at least half of those people were from Texas . In small towns along the coast of Texas , 90 â€“ 100 % of their populations evacuated , while 20 % of people left the larger cities . Many in Galveston stayed due to protection from the Galveston Seawall .

 Carla spawned the largest hurricane @-@ related tornado outbreak on record at the time , when 26 tornadoes touched down within its circulation . However , it was overwhelmingly surpassed by Hurricane Beulah in 1967 , which spawned at least 115 tornadoes . Throughout its path , 43 fatalities and about $ 325 @.@ 74 million in damage were attributed to Carla . Most of the impact occurred in Texas , where the storm made landfall as a large and strong Category 4 hurricane .

 Abnormally high tides and storm surge was reported along the coast of Texas , reaching at least 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above mean sea level at many coastal areas between Sabine Pass and Port Aransas . The highest tide reported was 18 @.@ 5 feet ( 5 @.@ 6 m ) at Port Lavaca , with large wave heights including 12 @.@ 6 feet ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) in Matagorda , 10 @.@ 9 feet ( 3 @.@ 3 m ) in Port Aransas , 10 @.@ 8 feet ( 3 @.@ 3 m ) in Freeport , 10 @.@ 1 feet ( 3 @.@ 1 m ) in Texas City , and 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in Galveston and Sabine . Because the storm was a Category 4 hurricane at landfall , Carla produced strong winds , especially near its path . The strongest sustained winds include 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) in Matagorda , 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) in Victoria , and 88 mph ( 142 km / h ) . Additionally , the highest wind gust observations include 175 mph ( 282 km / h ) in Port Lavaca , 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) in Matagorda , and 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) in Aransas Pass , Austwell , Edna , Port Aransas , and Victoria . Carla produced heavy rainfall in Texas , peaking at 17 @.@ 48 inches ( 444 mm ) in Bay City . Other significant precipitation totals include 16 @.@ 49 inches ( 419 mm ) at Scholes International Airport at Galveston , 14 @.@ 94 inches ( 379 mm ) in Downtown Galveston , 13 @.@ 05 inches ( 331 mm ) in Wharton , 12 @.@ 55 inches ( 319 mm ) in Liberty , 12 @.@ 47 inches ( 317 mm ) in Dickinson , 11 @.@ 81 inches ( 300 mm ) in <unk> , 10 @.@ 59 inches ( 269 mm ) in Columbus , 8 @.@ 75 inches ( 222 mm ) in <unk> , and 8 @.@ 9 inches ( 230 mm ) in Smithville . 
 The most significant damage to property occurred between Port Arthur and Corpus Christi . Port O 'Connor , lying nearest to the location of Carla 's landfall , was virtually destroyed . In Victoria , the highest sustained wind speed was 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) , while gusts reached 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . About 4 @,@ 260 homes were damaged , with around 500 severely damaged or destroyed . 43 businesses and 26 public buildings were also significantly impacted . Damage in the city of Victoria reached $ 10 million . Of the 26 tornadoes spawned by Carla , eight of them in Texas caused significant impact . A tornado near Bay City destroyed two radio towers and damaged several buildings . Near Jacksonville , a tornado injured three people , caused the destruction of one house and impacted 3 others , resulting in $ 25 @,@ 000 in damage . Twenty @-@ two people were injured , 18 homes and 6 commercial buildings were destroyed , and 40 additional homes were damaged in a tornado in <unk> , located near Houston ; losses reached $ 200 @,@ 000 . In the early morning hours of September 13 , an F4 tornado moved across Galveston Island along a 15 @-@ mile ( 24 @-@ kilometer ) long , 230 @-@ yard @-@ wide path ( it crossed into Galveston Bay as well ) , severely damaging 200 buildings , of which at least 60 were destroyed , and causing eight deaths and 55 injuries . A few hours later , another twister in the area resulted in the destruction of six houses and extensive lesser damage . In Hardin , a tornado damaged six homes . Several structures sustained impact during a tornado in Fulbright . The final twister occurred during the late afternoon hours in Latex . It caused two injuries , and resulted in $ 5 @,@ 000 in losses , after damaging two houses and three garages . 
 Then little @-@ known newsman Dan Rather reported live from the Galveston Seawall during the storm , an act that would be imitated by later reporters . This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane . Rather also alerted the public of the size of Carla in a way that " literally changed the way the world sees hurricanes " , according to a fellow reporter . Broadcasting live at the Weather Bureau Office in Galveston , Rather asked a meteorologist to draw an outline of the Gulf of Mexico on a transparent sheet of plastic . He then held the map over the black and white radar screen , which put the size of Carla into perspective . CBS was so impressed with Rather 's work that he was offered the position of correspondent . Throughout Texas , Carla destroyed 1 @,@ 915 homes , 568 farm buildings , and 415 other buildings . Additionally , 50 @,@ 723 homes , 5 @,@ 620 farm buildings , and 10 @,@ 487 other buildings suffered damage . There were 460 injuries according to the American Red Cross , though the Monthly Weather Review listed a slightly higher number , 465 . The storm caused 34 fatalities in Texas . Causes of death include 20 people drowning , eight from tornadoes , four electrocutions , and one heart attack . Overall , damage in the state was " conservatively " estimated at $ 300 million . A breakdown of damage indicates $ 200 million incurred to property and $ 100 million to crops , mostly from unharvested rice and lesser impact to cotton and citrus .

 Shortly after the storm , Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , a lifelong resident of Texas , toured the devastation in the state and met with officials from 18 different counties , remarking that " as always , Texans are arising to a challenge ... We have suffered hurricane , tornado , and floods , but we in Texas are a bold and brave people . " After his report to President John F. Kennedy and Congress , $ 55 million was approved in aid for Texas , though Kennedy later requested an additional $ 65 million . President Kennedy issued a disaster declaration for Texas , allowing all jurisdictions in the state to apply for public assistance . The president also declared 6 parishes in Louisiana a disaster area . Helicopters deployed 88 United States Marines to Galveston to patrol devastated areas . A United States Navy task force composed of medical and construction work teams was also sent to the area . Members of the United States National Guard assisted refugees in returning to their homes and worked to prevent looting . Owing the hurricane 's intensity and destruction , the name Carla was retired and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane . It was replaced by Carol in the 1965 season . 
 = Wail al @-@ Shehri = 
 Wail Mohammed al @-@ Shehri ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , <unk> ash @-@ <unk> ; also transliterated as <unk> ) ( July 31 , 1973 â€“ September 11 , 2001 ) was one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 , which was hijacked and flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the September 11 attacks . 
 Shehri was an elementary school teacher from Khamis Mushait in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia . In early 2000 he traveled to Medina to seek treatment for mental problems . He and his younger brother Waleed traveled to Afghanistan in March 2000 and joined an Al @-@ Qaeda training camp . The brothers were chosen , along with others from the same region of Saudi Arabia , to participate in the September 11 attacks . Once selected , Shehri returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2000 to obtain a clean passport , then returned to Afghanistan . In March 2001 , he recorded his last will and testament on video . 
 Shehri arrived in the United States in early June 2001 , staying in budget motels in the Boynton Beach area of south Florida . On September 5 , 2001 , Shehri traveled to Boston and checked into a motel with his brother . Six days later , Shehri arrived early in the morning at Boston 's Logan International Airport and boarded American Airlines Flight 11 . Fifteen minutes after take off , the flight was hijacked and deliberately crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8 : 46 a.m. 
 In the aftermath of the attacks , some news reports mistakenly reported Shehri as a trained pilot and son of a Saudi diplomat , who was still alive and well . The Shehri family in Khamis Mushait spoke to the media , denying those early reports , saying that the Shehri brothers had disappeared and have not been heard from since .
