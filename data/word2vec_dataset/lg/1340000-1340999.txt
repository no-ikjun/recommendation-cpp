 Horses are odd @-@ toed ungulates , or members of the order <unk> . This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs , and many extinct families and species . Members of this order walk on either one toe ( like horses ) or three toes ( like rhinos and tapirs ) . This is in contrast to even @-@ toed ungulates , members of the order Artiodactyla , which walk on cloven hooves , or two toes . This order includes many species associated with livestock , such as sheep , goats , pigs , cows and camels , as well as species of giraffes , antelopes and deer . 
 Equine hooves and legs have evolved over millions of years to the form in which they are found today . The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs , terminating in five @-@ toed feet . Over millennia , a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe , while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones . Prairie @-@ dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food . Forest @-@ dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes , which helped them on softer ground . Approximately 35 million years ago , a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change , leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands . This led to a die @-@ out among forest @-@ dwelling equine species , eventually leaving the long @-@ legged , one @-@ toed Equus of today , which includes the horse , as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family . 
 = = = Legs = = = 
 Each forelimb of the horse runs from the scapula or shoulder blade to the navicular bone . In between are the humerus ( arm ) , radius ( forearm ) , elbow joint , ulna ( elbow ) , carpus ( knee ) bones and joint , large metacarpal ( cannon ) , small metacarpal ( splint ) , sesamoid , fetlock joint , first phalanx ( long pastern ) , pastern joint , second phalanx ( short pastern ) , coffin joint and third phalanx ( coffin or pedal ) bones . Each hind limb of the horse runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone . After the pelvis come the femur ( thigh ) , patella , stifle joint , tibia , fibula , tarsal ( hock ) bone and joint , large metatarsal ( cannon ) and small metatarsal ( splint ) bones . Below these , the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints is the same as in the forelimbs . When the horse is moving , the distal interphalangeal joint ( coffin joint ) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body , and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques . Although having a small range of movement , the proximal interphalangeal joint ( pastern joint ) is also influential to the movement of the horse , and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs . Due to the horse 's development as a cursorial animal ( one whose main form of defense is running ) , its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground , without the need for grasping , lifting or swinging . The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow , while the bottom fused with the radius above the <unk> ( knee ) joint , which corresponds to the wrist in humans . A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs . These changes were first seen in the genus <unk> , approximately 17 million years ago . 
 There are three main muscle groups of the forelimb . The triceps muscle straightens the elbow and foreleg , running from the elbow to the bottom of the shoulder blade . The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles , while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles . There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs . The <unk> muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip , while the gluteal muscles , the large muscles in the hip , extend the femur . Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur , while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters , called the hamstring group , provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs . Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon , located above the hock . 
 There are two apparatus in the limbs of the horse - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus . The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments , tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus . This apparatus carries much of the weight of the horse , both when standing and while moving , and prevents the fetlock joint from <unk> , especially when the joint is bearing weight . During movement , the apparatus stores and releases energy in the manner of a spring : stretching while the joint is extended and contracting ( and thus releasing energy ) when the joint flexes . This provides a rebound effect , assisting the foot in leaving the ground . This ability to use stored energy makes horses ' gaits more efficient than other large animals , including cattle . The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament , the check ligament , the deep digital flexor tendon , the superficial flexor tendon , the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones . 
 Horses use a group of ligaments , tendons and muscles known as the stay apparatus to " lock " major joints in the limbs , allowing them to remain standing while relaxed or asleep . The lower part of the stay apparatus consists of the suspensory apparatus , which is the same in both sets of limbs , while the upper portion differs between the fore and hind limbs . The upper portion of the stay apparatus in the forelimbs includes the major attachment , extensor and flexor muscles and tendons . The same portion in the hind limbs consists of the major muscles , ligaments and tendons , as well as the reciprocal joints of the hock and stifle . 
 = = = Hoof = = = 
 The hoof of the horse contains over a dozen different structures , including bones , cartilage , tendons and tissues . The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone , supporting the majority of the weight . Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone , itself cushioned by the navicular bursa , a fluid @-@ filled sac . The digital cushion is a blood vessel @-@ filled structure located in the middle of the hoof , which assists with blood flow throughout the leg . At the top of the hoof wall is the corium , tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell , which is in turn protected by the <unk> , a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out . The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae , a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone . The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon , which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone . The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole , which has an outer , insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer , and the frog , which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow . The final structures are the lateral cartilages , connected to the upper coffin bone , which act as the flexible heels , allowing hoof expansion . These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions . It acts as a support and traction point , shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb . 
 = = Movement = = 
 A sequence of movements in which a horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride . During each step , with each leg , a horse completes four movements : the swing phase , the grounding or impact , the support period and the thrust . While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move , the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact , bearing weight , and providing thrust . Good movement is sound , symmetrical , straight , free and coordinated , all of which depend on many factors , including conformation , soundness , care and training of the horse , and terrain and footing . The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves . The angles of certain bones , especially in the hind leg , shoulders , and pasterns , also affect movement . 
 The forelegs carry the majority of the weight , usually around 60 percent , with exact percentages depending on speed and gait . Movement adds concussive force to weight , increasing the likelihood that a poorly built leg will buckle under the strain . At different points in the gallop , all weight is resting on one front hoof , then all on one rear hoof . In the sport of dressage , horses are encouraged to shift their weight more to their hindquarters , which enables lightness of the forehand and increased collection . While the forelimbs carry the weight the hind limbs provide propulsion , due to the angle between the stifle and hock . This angle allows the hind legs to flex as weight is applied during the stride , then release as a spring to create forward or upward movement . The propulsion is then transmitted to the forehand through the structures of the back , where the forehand then acts to control speed , balance and turning . The range of motion and propulsion power in horses varies significantly , based on the placement of muscle attachment to bone . The muscles are attached to bone relatively high in the body , which results in small differences in attachment making large differences in movement . A change of .5 inches ( 1 @.@ 3 cm ) in muscle attachment can affect range of motion by 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 cm ) and propulsion power by 20 percent . 
 " Form to function " is a term used in the equestrian world to mean that the " correct " form or structure of a horse is determined by the function for which it will be used . The legs of a horse used for cutting , in which quick starts , stops and turns are required , will be shorter and more thickly built than those of a Thoroughbred racehorse , where forward speed is most important . However , despite the differences in bone structure needed for various uses , correct conformation of the leg remains relatively similar . 
 = = Structural defects = = 
 The ideal horse has legs which are straight , correctly set and symmetrical . Correct angles of major bones , clean , well @-@ developed joints and tendons , and well @-@ shaped , properly @-@ proportioned hooves are also necessary for ideal conformation . " No legs , no horse " and " no hoof , no horse " are common sayings in the equine world . Individual horses may have structural defects , some of which lead to poor movement or lameness . Although certain defects and blemishes may not directly cause lameness , they can often put stress on other parts of the body , which can then cause lameness or injuries . Poor conformation and structural defects do not always cause lameness , however , as was shown by the champion racehorse Seabiscuit , who was considered undersized and knobby @-@ kneed for a Thoroughbred . 
 Common defects of the forelegs include base @-@ wide and base @-@ narrow , where the legs are farther apart or closer together on the ground then they are when they originate in the chest ; toeing @-@ in and toeing @-@ out , where the hooves point inwards or outwards ; knee deviations to the front ( buck knees ) , rear ( calf knees ) , inside ( knock knees ) or outside ( <unk> ) ; short or long pasterns ; and many problems with the feet . Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base @-@ wide and base @-@ narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs , as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled ( sickle @-@ hocked ) , too straight ( straight behind ) or having an inward deviation ( cow @-@ hocked ) . Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg , as foals with these defects are generally easy prey for predators . Foals raised by humans have a better chance for survival , as there are therapeutic treatments that can improve even major conformation problems . However , some of these conformation problems can be transmitted to offspring , and so these horses are a poor choice for breeding stock . 
 = = Lameness and injuries = = 
 Lameness in horses is movement at an abnormal gait due to pain in any part of the body . It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders , hips , legs or feet . Lameness can also be caused by abnormalities in the digestive , circulatory and nervous systems . While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are more likely to develop lameness , trauma , infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes . The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is lameness caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems . The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs , with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down . Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and / or stifle 80 percent of the time . 
 There are numerous issues that can occur with horses ' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness . Stocking up is an issue that occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity . Fluid collects in the lower legs , producing swelling and often stiffness . Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems , prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues . Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition . A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow , causing inflammation and swelling . Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue , called a capped elbow , or infections . Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down . <unk> , or swelling to the back of the fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon , appear most often in the rear legs . Soft and fluid @-@ filled , the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain , but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness . Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath , often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces , can cause larger problems and lameness . 
 Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life @-@ threatening because a horse 's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems , laminitis , and other infections . If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily , there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load . While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time , a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human 's " bed rest " because of the risk of developing sores , internal damage , and congestion . 
 = Chamunda = 
 Chamunda ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् <unk> , <unk> ; Kannada : <unk> ) , also known as Chamundi , Chamundeshwari ( <unk> ್ <unk> ) and Charchika , is a fearsome aspect of Devi , the Hindu Divine Mother and one of the seven Matrikas ( mother goddesses ) . She is also one of the chief Yoginis , a group of sixty @-@ four or eighty @-@ one Tantric goddesses , who are attendants of the warrior goddess Durga . The name is a combination of Chanda and Munda , two monsters whom Chamunda killed . She is closely associated with Kali , another fierce aspect of Devi . She is sometimes identified with goddesses Parvati , Chandi or Durga as well . The goddess is often portrayed as haunting cremation grounds or fig trees . The goddess is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine and in the ancient times , human sacrifices were offered too . As the times have changed , meat , and wine are no longer offered . As of today it has been known that animal sacrifices have been discouraged by texts such as the Ramayan . Originally Devi Chamunda was discovered in Hinduism and later entered the Jain pantheon too . Though in Jainism , the rites of her worship include vegetarian offerings , and not the meat and liquor offerings . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar says that Chamunda was originally a form of Devi worshipped by the Munda peoples of the Vindhya range of central India . These tribes were known to offer goddesses animal as well as human sacrifices along with ritual offerings of liquor . These methods of worship were retained in Tantric worship of Chamunda . He proposes the fierce nature of this goddess is due of her association with Vedic Rudra ( identified as Shiva in modern Hinduism ) , identified with fire god Agni at times . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 The black or red coloured Chamunda is described as wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls ( Mundamala ) . She is described as having four , eight , ten or twelve arms , holding a Damaru ( drum ) , trishula ( trident ) , sword , a snake , skull @-@ mace ( khatvanga ) , thunderbolt , a severed head and <unk> ( drinking vessel , wine cup ) or skull @-@ cup ( kapala ) , filled with blood . Standing on a corpse of a man ( <unk> or preta ) or seated on a defeated demon or corpse ( <unk> ) . Chamunda is depicted adorned by ornaments of bones , skulls , serpents . She also wears a Yajnopavita ( a sacred thread worn by mostly Hindu priests ) of skulls . She wears a jata mukuta , that is , headdress formed of piled , matted hair tied with snakes or skull ornaments . Sometimes , a crescent moon is seen on her head . Her socket eyes are described as so intense that it burns the evil of all three worlds . She is accompanied by fiends and goblins . She is also shown to be surrounded by skeletons or ghosts and beasts like jackals , who are shown eating the flesh of the corpse which the goddess sits or stands on . The jackal are her fearsome companions . The severed head and corpse represents the severing of the ego . The corpse hence is conquered by the Devi , showing that the Ego is conquered . The symbolism of the Devi is made as to where one is given the impression of the reality of life . This form as well as many of the other Eight Matrikas all show the reality of life . They show the <unk> , non sugar coated version of reality . At times , she is depicted seated on an owl , her vahana ( mount or vehicle ) . 
 = = Hindu legends = = 
 In Hindu scripture Devi Mahatmya , Chamunda emerged as Chandika Jayasundara from an eyebrow of goddess Kaushiki , a goddess created from " sheath " of Durga and was assigned the task of eliminating the demons Chanda and Munda , generals of demon kings Shumbha @-@ Nishumbha . She fought a fierce battle with the demons , ultimately killing them . Goddess Chandika Jayasundara took the slain heads of the two demons to goddess Kaushiki , who became immensely pleased . Kaushiki blessed Chandika Jayasundara and bestowed upon her the title of “ Chamunda " , to commemorate the latter 's victory over the demons . 
 According to a later episode of Devi Mahatmya , Durga created Matrikas from herself and with their help slaughtered the demon army of Shumbha @-@ <unk> . In this version , Kali is described as a Matrika who sucked all the blood of the demon Raktabija . Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text . Thus , the Devi Mahatmya identifies Chamunda with Kali . 
 In Varaha Purana , the story of Raktabija is retold , but here each of Matrikas appears from the body of another Matrika . Chamunda appears from the foot of the lion @-@ headed goddess <unk> . Here , Chamunda is considered a representation of the vice of tale @-@ telling ( <unk> ) . The Varaha Purana text clearly mentions two separate goddesses Chamunda and Kali , unlike Devi Mahatmya . 
 According to another legend , Chamunda appeared from the frown of the benign goddess Parvati to kill demons Chanda and Munda . Here , Chamunda is viewed as a form of Parvati . 
 Matsya Purana tells a different story of Chamunda 's origins . She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura , who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood . Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks the blood of the demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him . Ratnakara , in his text <unk> , also describes this feat of Chamunda , but solely credits Chamunda , not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka . Having drunk the blood , Chamunda 's complexion changed to blood @-@ red . The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction , playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru , the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon . She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world . 
 = = Association with Matrikas = = 
 Chamunda is included in the Saptamatrika ( seven Matrikas or mothers ) lists in the Hindu texts like Mahabharata ( Chapter ' Vana @-@ parva ' ) , Devi Purana and Vishnudharmottara Purana . She is often depicted in the Saptamatrika group in sculptures , examples of which are Ellora and Elephanta caves . Though she is always portrayed last ( rightmost ) in the group , she is sometimes referred to as the leader of the group . While other Matrikas are considered as Shaktis ( powers ) of male divinities and resemble them in their appearance , Chamunda is the only Matrika who is a Shakti of the great Goddess Devi rather than a male god . She is also the only Matrika who enjoys independent worship of her own ; all other Matrikas are always worshipped together . 
 Devi Purana describe a pentad of Matrikas who help Ganesha to kill demons . Further , sage <unk> is described as worshipping the <unk> ( the five mothers ) , Chamunda being one of them . The mothers are described as established by creator god Brahma for saving king Harishchandra from calamities . Apart from usual meaning of Chamunda as slayer of demons Chanda and Munda , Devi Purana gives a different explanation : Chanda means terrible while Munda stands for Brahma 's head or lord or husband . 
 In Vishnudharmottara Purana - where the Matrikas are compared to vices - Chamunda is considered as a manifestation of depravity . Every matrika is considered guardian of a compas direction . Chamunda is assigned the direction of south @-@ west . 
 Chamunda , being a Matrika , is considered one of the chief Yoginis , who are considered to be daughters or manifestations of the Matrikas . In the context of a group of sixty @-@ four yoginis , Chamunda is believed to have created seven other yoginis , together forming a group of eight . In the context of eighty @-@ one yoginis , Chamunda heads a group of nine yoginis .

 A South Indian inscription describes ritual sacrifices of sheep to Chamunda . In Bhavabhuti 's eighth century Sanskrit play , <unk> describes a devotee of the goddess trying to sacrifice the heroine to Chamunda 's temple , near a cremation ground , where the goddess temple is . A stone inscription at Gangadhar , Rajasthan , deals with a construction to a shrine to Chamunda and the other Matrikas , " who are attended by Dakinis " ( female demons ) and rituals of daily Tantric worship ( <unk> ) like the ritual of Bali ( offering of grain ) . 
 Many Kshatriyas and even the Jain community worship her as her Kuladevi " family deity " . The Chapa dynasty worshiped her as their <unk> . The Kutch <unk> Kshatriyas worship her as <unk> and temples are in <unk> and <unk> . <unk> family , a lineage of <unk> caste — ( Hindu caste of Shudra origin ) in Kerala — worship <unk> in Chandika form , as <unk> and temple is in <unk> village of Thrissur , Kerala . This is an example of Chamunda worship across caste sects .

 In the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh , around 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) west of <unk> , is the renowned Chamunda Devi Temple which depicts scenes from the Devi Mahatmya , the Ramayana and the Mahabharata . The goddess 's image is flanked by the images of Hanuman and Bhairava . Another temple , Chamunda <unk> Dham , also found in Kangra , is dedicated to Shiva and Chamunda . According to a legend , Chamunda was enshrined as chief deity " Rudra Chamunda " , in the battle between the demon Jalandhara and Shiva .

 Early Jainism was dismissive of Chamunda , a goddess who demands blood sacrifice , which is against the principle of Jain vegetarianism . Some Jain legends portray Chamunda as a goddess defeated by monks like <unk> and <unk> . 
 Another legend tells the story of conversion of Chamunda into a Jain goddess . According to this story , Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian , Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the <unk> to Jainism . At the time of Navratri , a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother , Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains . The vegetarian Jains , however , were unable to meet her demand . <unk> intervened , and as a result , Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings , forgoing her demand for meat and liquor . <unk> further named her <unk> , one who had told the truth , as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him . She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess , Kuladevi , of the <unk> . The <unk> Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour .

 Hamilton was given his first professional contract in September 1978 by Jimmy Adamson , who was manager of Football League Second Division side Sunderland . While he was with the Black Cats , Hamilton captained the England youth team , which was coached at the time by Brian Clough and Peter Taylor , to the final of the 1978 UEFA European Under @-@ 19 Football Championship , where they lost to the USSR . He admitted to having a good working relationship with Clough while he was a part of the England youth side . Despite being selected by his country , he failed to play a single first @-@ team match for Sunderland and left to join fellow Second Division side Blackburn Rovers in January 1981 . 
 In his first half @-@ season with Rovers , Hamilton made only three substitute appearances as the team finished fourth in the division . Over the next three seasons , he became a more integral part of the Blackburn side , playing 70 matches and scoring five goals . In the 1984 – 85 season , he found his first @-@ team opportunities limited , being given just three starts . He spent the last two months of the season out on loan at struggling Cardiff City , who were eventually relegated to the Football League Third Division in May 1985 after finishing second @-@ bottom of the Second Division . Upon return from his loan spell in south Wales , Hamilton stayed at Blackburn for one more season , making 33 league appearances and scoring three goals in 1985 – 86 . After a total of 114 league appearances and seven goals for Rovers , he left the club prior to the 1986 – 87 season and joined Third Division club Wigan Athletic for a fee of £ 16 @,@ 000 . In his first season , he helped them to a fourth @-@ placed finish and a place in the play @-@ offs . After losing out to Swindon Town in the play @-@ offs , Hamilton stayed at Wigan for two more seasons , missing just one league game for the Latics in the 1987 – 88 campaign . He played over 100 competitive appearances for Wigan before leaving to join Chester City in August 1989 . 
 He only spent one season with Chester , where he played 30 league matches without scoring , before Frank Casper signed him for Fourth Division club Burnley on a free transfer in August 1990 . He made his debut for the Clarets on the opening day of the 1990 – 91 season , coming on as a substitute for Paul France in a 2 – 2 draw with Lincoln City at Turf Moor . He played a further ten games that season , helping Burnley achieve a play @-@ off place . Injuries limited Hamilton to only five first @-@ team matches in 1991 – 92 as Burnley won the Fourth Division , gaining promotion to the third tier . Hamilton 's final league appearance for the Lancashire club came in the 0 – 2 defeat to Hereford United at Edgar Street on 14 September 1991 . 
 His professional career came to an end when he was released by Burnley in May 1992 , although he subsequently had spells in non @-@ league football with Chorley , Barrow and Great Harwood Town , while taking his coaching qualifications . Towards the end of the 1995 – 96 season , he left Great Harwood and joined Northern Premier League outfit Mossley , where he made 23 league appearances before retiring in 1997 to take up a non @-@ playing position at Rochdale . He returned to Turf Moor on 7 May 2007 to play in a testimonial match for long @-@ serving Burnley player Graham Branch . 
 = = After playing = = 
 Hamilton 's first coaching job came in the 1994 – 95 season , when Eric Whalley appointed him team coach at Accrington Stanley . In late January 1995 , he moved to become a coach at Preston North End . After leaving Preston , he was handed the role of player @-@ assistant manager at Great Harwood Town . However , he left in 1996 when the manager was sacked as the club struggled in the league . In 1997 , after a playing spell with Mossley , he was appointed youth team manager at Rochdale . He stayed at Rochdale for five years , during which time he was promoted to the position of assistant manager and had two spells as caretaker manager of the side ; in 1999 , following the departure of Graham Barrow , and in 2001 after Jamie Hoyland left . He managed Rochdale for eight matches in total , winning two matches , losing two and drawing four . While at Rochdale he uncovered Northern Ireland international Lee McEvilly , who was playing for Burscough part @-@ time while working at McDonald 's . 
 In 2002 , he returned to Wigan Athletic when then manager Paul Jewell , who he had played alongside for Wigan in the 1980s , appointed Hamilton as the club 's first ever full @-@ time chief scout . At Wigan he was united for the first time with Chris Hutchings , who was Jewell 's assistant manager . While scouting for the Latics , he recommended both Jimmy Bullard and Antonio Valencia to Jewell . He followed Jewell and Hutchings to Premier League side Derby County in 2007 following the sacking of Billy Davies . The club were relegated from the Premier League in that season and after a series of indifferent results in the Championship the following term , Jewell and Hutchings left the club in January 2009 , leaving Hamilton to work under Brian Clough 's son Nigel for a short spell . However , Clough brought his own coaching and scouting staff to Derby , and Hamilton was forced to leave the club in March 2009 . 
 On 5 June 2009 , he was given the role of chief scout at League One club Walsall , following the appointment of Chris Hutchings as manager of the team in January 2009 . This is the third club at which Hamilton and Hutchings have worked together . Hamilton was sacked by Walsall , along with Hutchings and assistant manager Martin O 'Connor , in January 2011 with the club at the bottom of League One as a result of three consecutive defeats . On 23 February 2011 , he was reunited with Paul Jewell after being hired as a scout for Championship side Ipswich Town .

 = Andjar Asmara = 
 <unk> Abbas ( [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 26 February 1902 – 20 October 1961 ) , better known by his pseudonym Andjar Asmara ( [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , was a dramatist and filmmaker active in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies . Born in Alahan Panjang , West Sumatra , he first worked as a reporter in Batavia ( modern @-@ day Jakarta ) . He became a writer for the Padangsche Opera in Padang , where he developed a new , dialogue @-@ centric style , which later spread throughout the region . After returning to Batavia in 1929 , he spent over a year as a theatre and film critic . In 1930 he joined the Dardanella touring troupe as a writer . He went to India in an unsuccessful bid to film his stage play Dr Samsi . 
 After leaving Dardanella in 1936 , Andjar established his own troupe . He also worked at a publishers , writing serials based on successful films . In 1940 he was asked to join The Teng Chun 's company , Java Industrial Film , helping with marketing and working as a director for two productions . After the Japanese occupation , during which time he stayed in theatre , Andjar made a brief return to cinema . He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four screenplays , which were produced as films in the early 1950s . He published a novel , Noesa Penida ( 1950 ) . Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism . Historians recognise him as a pioneer of theatre and one of the first native Indonesian film directors , although he had little creative control of his productions . 
 = = Early life and theatre = = 
 Andjar was born <unk> Abbas in Alahan Panjang , West Sumatra , on 26 February 1902 . He gravitated toward traditional theatre at a young age after visits from the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera stambul troupes ; he pretended to act with his friends in stage plays which they had seen . After completing his formal education up to the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs ( junior high school ) level – first in Malay @-@ language schools then Dutch ones – he moved to Batavia ( modern @-@ day Jakarta ) . He worked as a reporter for two daily newspapers , Bintang Timoer and Bintang Hindia ; he may have also worked on a farm . 
 Around 1925 , having had little success in Batavia , Andjar moved to Padang , where he was a reporter for the daily Sinar <unk> . At the same time , he worked with the city 's Padangsche Opera , writing stage plays . In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time , bangsawan , he promoted a more natural style , using dialogue instead of song to convey the story ; he referred to this as toneel , based on the Dutch word for theatre . Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam , a 1923 work by Swan Pen , and Sitti Nurbaya , a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli . These works were well received . 
 In the late 1920s , after spending some two years in Medan with the daily Sinar <unk> , Andjar returned to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine Doenia Film , a Malay adaptation of the Dutch @-@ language magazine Filmland ; although an adaptation , Doenia Film also contained original coverage of the domestic theatre and film industry . At the time , the cinema of the Indies was becoming established : the first domestic film , Loetoeng Kasaroeng ( The Lost Lutung ) , was released in 1926 , and four additional films were released in 1927 and 1928 . Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical productions ; for example , the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar inspired the marketing for 1929 's Njai Dasima , which emphasised the exclusively native cast . In 1930 Andjar left Doenia Film and was replaced by Bachtiar Effendi . 
 Andjar became a writer for the theatrical troupe Dardanella in November 1930 , working under the group 's founder Willy A. <unk> . Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests , as were the earlier stambul troupes . He wrote and published many plays with the group 's backing , including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau ( The Lion of Minangkabau ) . Andjar also worked as a theatre critic , writing several pieces on the history of local theatre , sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym . In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi , which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child . The deal fell through , however , and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna . 
 = = Film career and death = = 
 Upon his return to the Indies , Andjar formed another theatrical troupe , Bolero , with Effendi , but left the troupe around 1940 to work at Kolf Publishers in Surabaya . Effendi was left as the head of Bolero , which then became more politicised . At Kolf Andjar edited the publisher 's magazine Poestaka Timoer . As his work entailed writing synopses and serials based on popular films for Kolf 's magazine , he became increasingly involved in the film industry . He was soon asked by The Teng Chun , with whom he had maintained a business relationship , to direct a film for his company Java Industrial Film ( JIF ) ; with this Andjar became one of several noted theatrical personnel who migrated to film following Albert Balink 's 1937 hit Terang Boelan ( Full Moon ) . 
 After handling the marketing for <unk> <unk> ( <unk> of Aceh , 1940 ) , Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah , a war @-@ time romance starring Ratna Asmara . Academia was critical of the film , believing it to lack educational value . In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida , a tragedy based in Bali , for JIF ; the film was remade in 1988 . In these films , he had little creative control , and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie <unk> describes as a dialogue coach . Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer , who was generally also the producer . 
 During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 , the nation 's film industry nearly ceased to exist : all but one studio were closed , and all films released were propaganda pieces to assist the Japanese war effort and promote the Greater East Asia Co @-@ Prosperity Sphere . Andjar was not involved in these but was excited by the artistic merits of Japanese films . Although he wrote several short stories during this time , three of which were published in the pro @-@ Japanese newspaper Asia Raja in 1942 , Andjar focused on theatre , forming the troupe <unk> Timoer . He often visited the Cultural Centre ( <unk> Bunka <unk> ) in Jakarta , where two employees , D. Djajakusuma and Usmar Ismail , discussed filmmaking with him . Both became influential film directors during the 1950s . 
 After Indonesia 's independence , Andjar moved to Purwokerto to lead the daily <unk> Rakjat . After the paper collapsed , he returned to film , film a piece entitled Djaoeh Dimata for the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration in 1948 . This was followed by two additional films , Anggrek Bulan ( Moon Orchid ; 1948 ) and Gadis Desa ( Maiden from the Village ; 1949 ) , both based on plays he wrote several years earlier . In 1950 , Andjar published his only novel , Noesa Penida , a critique of the Balinese caste system , which followed lovers from different levels of the social hierarchy . Meanwhile , he continued to write and publish paperback serials adapted from local films . 
 Andjar 's screenplay Dr Samsi was finally adapted as a film in 1952 by Ratna Asmara , who had become Indonesia 's first female film director with her 1950 film Sedap Malam ( Sweetness of the Night ) . The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail . It would prove Andjar 's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime . Although no longer writing films , Andjar remained active in the country 's film industry . In 1955 he headed the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival , which was criticized when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films , Usmar Ismail 's Lewat Djam Malam ( After the Curfew ) and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> . Critics wrote that Lewat Djam Malam was easily the stronger of the two and suggested that Djamaluddin Malik , <unk> 's producer , had influenced the jury 's decision . 
 In 1958 Asmara became the head of the entertainment magazine Varia , where the fellow director Raden Ariffien served as his deputy . Asmara held the position until his death ; among other roles , he wrote a series of memoires on the history of theatre in the country . He died on 20 October 1961 in <unk> , West Java , during a trip to Bandung and was buried in Jakarta . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Andjar 's <unk> were generally based on day @-@ to @-@ day experiences , rather than the tales of princes and ancient wars which were standard at the time . Regarding Andjar 's <unk> , the Indonesian literary critic Bakri Siregar writes that Andjar 's stage plays , as well as those of fellow dramatist Njoo Cheong Seng , revitalised the genre and made the works more realistic . However , he considered the conflict in these works to have been poorly developed . Andjar believed that the Padangsche Opera 's performances influenced other troupes in West Sumatra to adapt the toneel format , which later spread throughout the Indies . 
 Matthew Isaac Cohen , a scholar of Indonesian performing arts , describes Andjar as " Indonesia 's foremost theater critic during the colonial period " , noting that he wrote extensively on the history of theatre in the Indies . Cohen also believes that Andjar also worked to justify the toneel style and distance it from the earlier stambul . Even after entering the film industry , Andjar considered the theatre more culturally significant than cinema . However , the Indonesian journalist <unk> <unk> writes that Andjar remains best known for his film work . 
 Andjar was one of the first native Indonesian film directors , with Bachtiar Effendi , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow the whims of the ethnic Chinese film moguls , which resulted in the films ' shift toward commercial orientation , rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit . The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists , upon joining JIF , brought with them new ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese ; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years .

 = Geoffrey of Briel = 
 Geoffrey of Briel , in older literature Geoffrey of Bruyères , was a French knight and the third lord of the Barony of Karytaina in the Principality of Achaea , in Frankish Greece . He led a colourful and turbulent life , narrated in detail in the Chronicle of the Morea . <unk> the finest knight in the Principality , he fought in the wars against the Byzantine Greeks , was captured in the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259 , and was sent back to Achaea bearing the Byzantine terms in 1261 . Geoffrey was twice deprived of his barony , once for rebelling against his uncle , the Prince of Achaea William II of Villehardouin , and then for abandoning the Principality without leave in order to spend time with a mistress , the wife of one of his feudatories , in Italy . He was pardoned both times , but henceforth held his title as a gift of the Prince . He died childless in 1275 , and the Barony of Karytaina was split up . 
 = = Origin = = 
 Geoffrey was the son of Hugh of Briel and Alice of Villehardouin , a daughter of the Prince of Achaea , Geoffrey I of Villehardouin . The family , which hailed from Briel @-@ sur @-@ Barse in the French province of Champagne , is variously named in the sources , e.g. <unk> or <unk> ( <unk> or <unk> in Greek ) , <unk> , Briers , Briel or Brielle . Geoffrey 's father inherited the Barony of Karytaina sometime around 1222 from his brother , Renaud of Briel . The Barony was the third largest ( after Akova and Patras ) in the Principality of Achaea , counting 22 knights ' fiefs and being responsible for keeping watch over the rebellious inhabitants of the mountainous Skorta area . 
 = = Baron of Karytaina and revolt against William of Villehardouin = = 
 Geoffrey was born in Greece , possibly in Karytaina , soon after his father 's arrival there ( about 1222 / 3 ) . Hugh of Briel died in early 1238 , not yet forty years old , and was succeeded by the young Geoffrey . The main source on Geoffrey 's life are the various versions of the Chronicle of the Morea , which , in the words of A. Bon , " narrates with so much detail and indulgence " the " many and colourful adventures " of " a peculiar and charming figure , very representative of the generation of Frankish seigneurs born in Greece " . The Chronicle credits Geoffrey with the construction of the castle of Karytaina , the " Greek Toledo " as William Miller calls it . Geoffrey enjoyed a high reputation as a warrior , and was deemed to be the " best knight in the Morea " . According to the Aragonese version of the Chronicle he maintained a school of chivalry at the castle Karytaina , where the sons of the Greek nobles were trained as knights in the Western manner . 
 Geoffrey married Isabella de la Roche , daughter of the Great Lord of Athens and Thebes , Guy I de la Roche . In 1256 – 58 , he became involved in the War of the Euboeote Succession , at first as a lieutenant of his uncle , Prince William II of Villehardouin , leading an army that laid waste to Euboea and recovered the town of Negroponte for the Prince . Later , however , he sided with his father @-@ in @-@ law Guy de la Roche and the other Frankish lords who opposed William 's hegemonic ambitions . William however prevailed in the Battle of Karydi in 1258 , and a parliament was assembled at Nikli to judge the defeated lords . Geoffrey was pardoned by the Prince and his confiscated lands returned , but this time as a personal grant , rather than a fief held in right of conquest . 
 = = Pelagonia , Byzantine captivity and sojourn in Italy = = 
 In 1259 , Geoffrey participated in the princely army that joined the Achaean – Epirote – Sicilian alliance opposing the Empire of Nicaea . The allied forces , riven by distrust between the Latins and the Epirote Greeks , were dealt a crushing defeat in the Battle of Pelagonia . Prince William and most of his barons , including Geoffrey , were captured in the aftermath of the battle . 
 The Frankish lords remained in captivity until 1261 , when , following the recovery of Constantinople by the Nicaean Greeks , the Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos offered to release them in exchange for an oath of fealty to him , and the cession of a number of fortresses in the southeastern Morea . After William agreed , Geoffrey was released in order to convey the emperor 's proposals to the nobles of the Principality . A parliament was once again held in Nikli , in the presence of Geoffrey , Guy de la Roche , and the Principality 's chancellor Leonard of <unk> . The captive lords were represented by their wives , whereby this assembly became known as the " Parliament of Ladies " . The parliament agreed to the terms , Geoffrey handed over the castles to the Greeks , and returned to Constantinople along with a number of hostages , whereupon Prince William and his barons were released . 
 The surrender of the fortresses began a long period of conflict between the Greeks of the reconstituted Byzantine Empire and the forces of the Principality for control of the Morea . Prince William was absolved by the Pope of his oaths to Palaiologos , and warfare began almost as soon as he returned to the Principality . Despite this precarious situation , Geoffrey absented himself from the Morea , without William 's permission , and spent the years 1263 – 65 in Italy , ostensibly on a pilgrimage , but in reality living with the wife of one of his feudatories , John of <unk> . His absence allowed the inhabitants of Skorta to rise up and aid the Byzantine troops in their offensive , which was halted by the same John of <unk> in the Battle of <unk> . Geoffrey was again deprived of his barony for this act , but was pardoned and restored to it on his return . 
 = = Final years and death = = 
 Geoffrey is mentioned again in the campaigns of the early 1270s , when Palaiologos sent a new commander to the Morea , Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos . In 1270 , Geoffrey and his neighbour , the Baron of Akova , joined the Prince 's army with 150 horsemen and 200 infantry . The Latin force raided the Byzantine holdings in Laconia , but Philanthropenos avoided being drawn into a pitched battle . A period of relative peace followed due to the ongoing Second Council of Lyon , but in 1275 , the mutual truce was broken by the Greeks . Prince William entrusted a force of 50 horse and 200 crossbowmen to Geoffrey , who stationed them to keep watch over the defiles of Skorta , but he died of dysentery in late 1275 . After his death , Karytaina was increasingly subject to the attacks of the Byzantines , and finally fell to them in 1320 . 
 Geoffrey died childless ; the barony , held by grant , was inheritable only by Geoffrey 's direct descendants , and consequently was split upon his death : one half remained with his widow , Isabella de la Roche , who married Hugh , Count of Brienne , before her death in 1279 , and the other reverted to the Prince 's domain . Two pretenders to Geoffrey 's inheritance appeared over the next few years : a certain John <unk> , who achieved nothing , and Geoffrey 's nephew , Geoffrey the Younger , who after much persistence managed to obtain the fief of <unk> . 
 = = Fictional portrayals = = 
 Geoffrey is the eponymous subject of Alfred Duggan 's 1962 novel , Lord Geoffrey 's Fancy . A sympathetic but flawed hero , observed by his distant cousin , an admiring but increasingly disillusioned narrator , the baron of Karytaina is portrayed as a supreme exemplar of both the qualities and the limitations of Frankish chivalry . 
 = U.S. Route 163 = 
 U.S. Route 163 ( also U.S. Highway 163 , US 163 ) is a 64 @-@ mile ( 103 km ) U.S. Highway that runs from US 160 northward to US 191 in the U.S. states of Arizona and Utah . The southernmost 44 miles ( 71 km ) of its length is within the Navajo Nation . The highway forms part of the Trail of the Ancients , a National Scenic Byway . The highway cuts through the heart of Monument Valley and has been featured in numerous movies and commercials . 
 The highway was designated in 1970 , replacing Arizona State Route 464 and Utah State Route 47 as well as a portion of the old alignment of US 160 in Utah . In 1981 , US 191 was routed over the northern section of US 163 , effectively truncating the northern terminus to Bluff , Utah from Crescent Junction . The state of Utah briefly had plans for a different routing of US 163 north of Bluff . These plans were rejected , resulting in discrepancies between the signed route and the official designation by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that were not resolved until 2008 . The route number does not follow the numbering convention for U.S. highways , as the number 163 would normally be used for a spur of U.S. Route 63 ; however , these two highways have never connected .

 = = = Arizona = = = 
 The southern terminus of US 163 is located at a junction with US 160 south of Kayenta in Navajo County and Navajo Nation . The road continues to the south of this junction as Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) Route 591 . US 163 heads north from US 160 to the west of the Kayenta Airport as it passes through the town of Kayenta . The highway curves towards the northeast in Kayenta before it curves back towards the north . As it continues towards the north , the highway goes through an s @-@ curve , resulting in a northeasterly heading . US 163 continues this heading as it heads toward Monument Valley and crosses the border into Utah . An 18 @-@ mile ( 29 km ) stretch of the highway from approximately 5 miles ( 8 km ) north of the US 160 junction to the Utah border has been designated as a scenic route by the state of Arizona . 
 = = = Utah = = = 
 The Utah portion of the highway begins in Monument Valley , in San Juan County . Just after entering Utah the highway junctions with the Monument Valley Visitors center . The highway proceeds northeast until the town of Mexican Hat where the highway both crosses the San Juan River and exits the Navajo Nation . From Mexican Hat , the highway travels due east to towards its signed terminus in Bluff . Formerly , the route continued along what is now signed US 191 to I @-@ 70 , however the portion north of Bluff was not signed after the creation of US 191 and was formally removed in 2008 . The length of US 163 in Utah has been designated the Bluff to Monument Valley Scenic byway by the Utah State Legislature and forms part of the Trail of the Ancients National Scenic Byway . All highways in Utah are codified in law ; US 163 is defined at Utah Code § 72 @-@ 4 @-@ 122 ( 3 ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The modern routing of US 163 in Utah was initially designated as State Route 47 , in 1910 . SR 47 extended to Monticello at a junction with then U.S. Route 160 . In Arizona , the road appeared on maps as early as 1935 , but it was still an unimproved dirt road at the time . The Arizona portion was added to the state highway system in 1960 when it was designated as State Route 464 . 
 In 1970 , US 163 was designated along SR 464 in Arizona and SR 47 in Utah as part of a re @-@ alignment of U.S. highways in the Four Corners region . With the re @-@ alignment , US 160 was re @-@ routed into Arizona instead of Utah . US 163 also absorbed the former route of US 160 to its former terminus at Interstate 70 at Crescent Junction . In 1981 , AASHTO approved a new iteration of U.S. Route 191 that absorbed much of the alignment of US 163 . Utah truncated US 163 at Bluff . The truncation was made without approval from AASHTO , as the AASHTO logs placed the northern terminus of US 163 at I @-@ 70 at Crescent Junction . 
 The state of Utah signed a joint intent with the Navajo Nation and San Juan County in 1986 to construct a new highway to connect Bluff with Montezuma Creek . Businesses in Monument Valley asked the Utah Department of Transportation ( UDOT ) to request extensions of US 163 and US 666 using this new road . The proposal would have US 163 run from Cedar City to US 160 near Cortez , Colorado along the routes of State Route 14 , U.S. Route 89 , Arizona State Route 98 , U.S. Route 160 , the current US 163 , the new road from Bluff to Montezuma Creek , and Colorado State Highway 41 . The proposal for US 666 would extend to Richfield via upgrades to State Route 95 and State Route 24 . UDOT submitted the proposal for US 666 to AASHTO , which was rejected . AASHTO cited that the route was not direct , and SR @-@ 24 was not built to U.S. Highway standards . UDOT did not pursue the extension of US 163 , even though the Utah state legislature had already approved the new road from Bluff to Montezuma creek as route 163 . 
 With this extension the Utah definition of US 163 conflicted with the AASHTO definition . UDOT resolved this discrepancy by signing the extended portion as State Route 163 . In 2004 , the plan to extend US 163 was abandoned , and the extension was renumbered SR @-@ 162 to " make the state route numbers run synonymous with the U.S. route designation . " Although the state changed the definition of US 163 back to match the national definition in 2004 , the portion north of Bluff remained unsigned . In October 2008 , UDOT requested and obtained approval to truncate US 163 to the junction with US 191 resolving the discrepancy .

 = Titus = 
 Titus ( Latin : Titus <unk> Caesar <unk> Augustus ; 30 December 39 AD – 13 September 81 AD ) was Roman emperor from 79 to 81 . A member of the Flavian dynasty , Titus succeeded his father Vespasian upon his death , thus becoming the first Roman Emperor to come to the throne after his own biological father . 
 Prior to becoming Emperor , Titus gained renown as a military commander , serving under his father in Judea during the First Jewish – Roman War . The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor Nero in 68 , launching Vespasian 's bid for the imperial power during the Year of the Four Emperors . When Vespasian was declared Emperor on 1 July 69 , Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion . In 70 , he besieged and captured Jerusalem , and destroyed the city and the Second Temple . For this achievement Titus was awarded a triumph : the Arch of Titus commemorates his victory to this day . 
 Under the rule of his father , Titus gained notoriety in Rome serving as prefect of the Praetorian Guard , and for carrying on a controversial relationship with the Jewish queen Berenice . Despite concerns over his character , Titus ruled to great acclaim following the death of Vespasian in 79 , and was considered a good emperor by Suetonius and other contemporary historians . 
 As emperor , he is best known for completing the Colosseum and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters , the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 and a fire in Rome in 80 . After barely two years in office , Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81 . He was deified by the Roman Senate and succeeded by his younger brother Domitian . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Titus was born in Rome , probably on 30 December 39 AD , as the eldest son of Titus Flavius Vespasianus — commonly known as Vespasian — and Domitilla the Elder . He had one younger sister , Domitilla the Younger ( born 45 ) , and one younger brother , Titus Flavius Domitianus ( born 51 ) , commonly referred to as Domitian . 
 = = = Family background = = = 
 Decades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome , which was gradually replaced in prominence by a new provincial nobility during the early part of the 1st century . One such family was the gens Flavia , which rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations , acquiring wealth and status under the Emperors of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty . Titus 's great @-@ grandfather , Titus Flavius Petro , had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar 's civil war . His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC . 
 Nevertheless , Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla , whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro 's son Titus Flavius Sabinus I , Titus 's grandfather . Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia . By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied himself to the more prestigious patrician gens Vespasia , ensuring the elevation of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to the senatorial rank . 
 The political career of Vespasian included the offices of quaestor , aedile and praetor , and culminated with a consulship in 51 , the year Domitian was born . As a military commander , he gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 . What little is known of Titus 's early life has been handed down to us by Suetonius , who records that he was brought up at the imperial court in the company of Britannicus , the son of emperor Claudius , who would be murdered by Nero in 55 . 
 The story was even told that Titus was reclining next to Britannicus , the night he was murdered , and sipped of the poison that was handed to him . Further details on his education are scarce , but it seems he showed early promise in the military arts and was a skilled poet and orator both in Greek and Latin . 
 = = Adult life = = 
 From c . 57 to 59 he was a military tribune in Germania . He also served in Britannia , perhaps arriving c . 60 with reinforcements needed after the revolt of Boudica . In c . 63 he returned to Rome and married Arrecina Tertulla , daughter of a former Prefect of the Praetorian Guard . She died c . 65 . 
 Titus then took a new wife of a much more distinguished family , Marcia Furnilla . However , Marcia 's family was closely linked to the opposition to Nero . Her uncle Barea Soranus and his daughter Servilia were among those who perished after the failed Pisonian conspiracy of 65 . Some modern historians theorize that Titus divorced his wife because of her family 's connection to the conspiracy . 
 Titus never remarried . Titus appears to have had multiple daughters , at least one of them by Marcia Furnilla . The only one known to have survived to adulthood was Julia Flavia , perhaps Titus 's child by Arrecina , whose mother was also named Julia . During this period Titus also practiced law and attained the rank of quaestor . 
 = = = Judaean campaigns = = = 
 In 66 the Jews of the Judaea Province revolted against the Roman Empire . Cestius Gallus , the legate of Syria , was defeated at the battle of Beth @-@ Horon and forced to retreat from Jerusalem . The pro @-@ Roman king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled the city to Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans . 
 Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion , who was dispatched to the region at once with the Fifth Legion and Tenth Legion . He was later joined at Ptolemais by Titus with the Fifteenth Legion . With a strength of 60 @,@ 000 professional soldiers , the Romans prepared to sweep across Galilee and march on Jerusalem . 
 The history of the war was covered in detail by the Roman @-@ Jewish historian Josephus in his work The Wars of the Jews . Josephus served as a commander in the city of <unk> when the Roman army invaded Galilee in 67 . After an exhausting siege which lasted 47 days , the city fell , with an estimated 40 @,@ 000 killed and the remaining Jews committing suicide ( except Josephus ) . 
 Surviving a group suicide , Josephus surrendered to Vespasian and became a prisoner . He later wrote that he provided the Romans with intelligence on the ongoing revolt . By 68 , the entire coast and the north of Judaea were subjugated by the Roman army , with decisive victories won at <unk> and <unk> , where Titus distinguished himself as a skilled general . 
 = = = = Year of the Four Emperors = = = = 
 The last and most significant fortified city held by the Jewish resistance was Jerusalem . The campaign came to a sudden halt when news arrived of Nero 's death . Almost simultaneously , the Roman Senate had declared Galba , then governor of Hispania , as Emperor of Rome . Vespasian decided to await further orders , and sent Titus to greet the new princeps . 
 Before reaching Italy , Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho , governor of Lusitania , and that Vitellius and his armies in Germania were preparing to march on the capital , intent on overthrowing Otho . Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other , he abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea . Meanwhile , Otho was defeated in the First Battle of Bedriacum and committed suicide . 
 When the news reached the armies in Judaea and <unk> , they took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69 . Vespasian accepted , and through negotiations by Titus , joined forces with Gaius Licinius Mucianus , governor of Syria . A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus , while Vespasian travelled to Alexandria , leaving Titus in charge to end the Jewish rebellion . By the end of 69 , the forces of Vitellius had been beaten , and Vespasian was officially declared emperor by the Senate on 21 December , thus ending the Year of the Four Emperors . 
 = = = = Siege of Jerusalem = = = = 
 Meanwhile , the Jews had become embroiled in a civil war of their own , splitting the resistance in Jerusalem between several factions . The <unk> led by Menahem ben Judah cannot hold on for long ; the Zealots led by Eleazar ben Simon eventually fall under the command of the Galilean leader John of Gush <unk> ; and the other northern rebel commander , Simon Bar Giora , manages to gain leadership over the <unk> too . Titus besieged Jerusalem . The Roman army was joined by the Twelfth Legion , which was previously defeated under Cestius Gallus , and from Alexandria Vespasian sent Tiberius Julius Alexander , governor of Egypt , to act as Titus ' second in command . 
 Titus surrounded the city , with three legions ( <unk> , <unk> and XVth ) on the western side and one ( Xth ) on the Mount of Olives to the east . He put pressure on the food and water supplies of the inhabitants by allowing pilgrims to enter the city to celebrate Passover , and then refusing them egress . Jewish raids continuously harassed the Roman army , one of which nearly resulted in Titus being captured . 
 After attempts by Josephus to negotiate a surrender had failed , the Romans resumed hostilities and quickly breached the first and second walls of the city . To intimidate the resistance , Titus ordered deserters from the Jewish side to be crucified around the city wall . By this time the Jews had been exhausted by famine , and when the weak third wall was breached , bitter street fighting ensued . 
 The Romans finally captured the Antonia Fortress and began a frontal assault on the gates of the Temple . According to Josephus , Titus had ordered that the Temple should not be destroyed , but while the fighting around the gates continued , a soldier hurled a torch inside one of the windows , which quickly set the entire building ablaze . The later Christian chronicler Sulpicius Severus , possibly drawing on a lost portion of Tacitus ' Histories , claims that Titus favoured the destruction of the Temple . The Temple was completely demolished , after which Titus ' soldiers proclaimed him imperator in honor of the victory . 
 Jerusalem was sacked and much of the population killed or dispersed . Josephus claims that 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 people were killed during the siege , of which a majority were Jewish . 97 @,@ 000 were captured and enslaved , including Simon Bar @-@ Giora and John of <unk> . Many fled to areas around the Mediterranean . Titus reportedly refused to accept a wreath of victory , as he claimed that he had not won the victory on his own , but had been the vehicle through which their God had manifested his wrath against his people . 
 The Jewish Diaspora at the time of the Temple ’ s destruction , according to Josephus , was in Parthia ( Persia ) , Babylonia ( Iraq ) , Arabia , as well as some Jews beyond the Euphrates and in Adiabene ( Kurdistan ) . 
 = = = Heir to Vespasian = = = 
 Unable to sail to Italy during the winter , Titus celebrated elaborate games at Caesarea Maritima and Berytus , then travelled to Zeugma on the Euphrates , where he was presented with a crown by Vologases I of Parthia . While visiting Antioch he confirmed the traditional rights of the Jews in that city . 
 On his way to Alexandria , he stopped in Memphis to consecrate the sacred bull Apis . According to Suetonius , this caused consternation : the ceremony required Titus to wear a diadem , which the Romans associated with monarchy , and the partisanship of Titus 's legions had already led to fears that he might rebel against his father . Titus returned quickly to Rome – hoping , says Suetonius , to allay any suspicions about his conduct . 
 Upon his arrival in Rome in 71 , Titus was awarded a triumph . Accompanied by Vespasian and Domitian he rode into the city , enthusiastically saluted by the Roman populace and preceded by a lavish parade containing treasures and captives from the war . Josephus describes a procession with large amounts of gold and silver carried along the route , followed by elaborate re @-@ enactments of the war , Jewish prisoners , and finally the treasures taken from the Temple of Jerusalem , including the Menorah and the Pentateuch . Simon Bar Giora was executed in the Forum , after which the procession closed with religious sacrifices at the Temple of Jupiter . The triumphal Arch of Titus , which stands at one entrance to the Forum , memorializes the victory of Titus . 
 With Vespasian declared emperor , Titus and his brother Domitian received the title of Caesar from the Senate . In addition to sharing tribunician power with his father , Titus held seven consulships during Vespasian 's reign and acted as his secretary , appearing in the Senate on his behalf . More crucially , he was appointed Praetorian prefect ( commander of the Praetorian Guard ) , ensuring their loyalty to the Emperor and further solidifying Vespasian 's position as a legitimate ruler . 
 In this capacity he achieved considerable notoriety in Rome for his violent actions , frequently ordering the execution of suspected traitors on the spot . When in 79 , a plot by Aulus Caecina Alienus and <unk> Marcellus to overthrow Vespasian was uncovered , Titus invited Alienus to dinner and ordered him to be stabbed before he had even left the room . 
 During the Jewish wars , Titus had begun a love affair with Berenice , sister of Agrippa II . The <unk> had collaborated with the Romans during the rebellion , and Berenice herself had supported Vespasian in his campaign to become emperor . In 75 , she returned to Titus and openly lived with him in the palace as his promised wife . The Romans were wary of the eastern queen and disapproved of their relationship . When the pair was publicly denounced by Cynics in the theatre , Titus caved in to the pressure and sent her away , but his reputation further suffered . 
 = = Emperor ( 79 – 81 ) = = 
 = = = Succession = = = 
 Vespasian died of an infection on 23 June 79 AD , and was immediately succeeded by his son Titus . Because of his many ( alleged ) vices , many Romans feared that he would be another Nero . Against these expectations , however , Titus proved to be an effective Emperor and was well loved by the population , who praised him highly when they found that he possessed the greatest virtues instead of vices . 
 One of his first acts as Emperor was to order a halt to trials based on treason charges , which had long plagued the principate . The law of treason , or law of <unk> , was originally intended to prosecute those who had corruptly " impaired the people and majesty of Rome " by any revolutionary action . Under Augustus , however , this custom had been revived and applied to cover slander and libel as well . This led to numerous trials and executions under Tiberius , Caligula , and Nero , and the formation of networks of informers ( <unk> ) , which terrorized Rome 's political system for decades . 
 Titus put an end to this practice , against himself or anyone else , declaring : 
 It is impossible for me to be insulted or abused in any way . For I do naught that deserves censure , and I care not for what is reported falsely . As for the emperors who are dead and gone , they will avenge themselves in case anyone does them a wrong , if in very truth they are demigods and possess any power . 
 Consequently , no senators were put to death during his reign ; he thus kept to his promise that he would assume the office of Pontifex Maximus " for the purpose of keeping his hands unstained " . The informants were publicly punished and banished from the city . Titus further prevented abuses by making it unlawful for a person to be tried under different laws for the same offense . Finally , when Berenice returned to Rome , he sent her away . 
 As Emperor he became known for his generosity , and Suetonius states that upon realising he had brought no benefit to anyone during a whole day he remarked , " Friends , I have lost a day . " 
 = = = Challenges = = = 
 Although his administration was marked by a relative absence of major military or political conflicts , Titus faced a number of major disasters during his brief reign . On 24 August 79 , two months after his accession , Mount Vesuvius erupted . The eruption almost completely destroyed the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples . The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and lava , killing thousands . Titus appointed two ex @-@ consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort , while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano . Additionally , he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year . 
 During the second visit , in spring of AD 80 , a fire broke out in Rome , burning large parts of the city for three days and three nights . Although the extent of the damage was not as disastrous as during the Great Fire of 64 — crucially sparing the many districts of insulae — Cassius Dio records a long list of important public buildings that were destroyed , including Agrippa 's Pantheon , the Temple of Jupiter , the <unk> , parts of the Theatre of Pompey , and the Saepta Julia among others . Once again , Titus personally compensated for the damaged regions . According to Suetonius , a Plague also broke out during the fire . The nature of the disease , however , or the death toll are unknown . 
 Meanwhile , war had resumed in Britannia , where Gnaeus Julius Agricola pushed further into Caledonia and managed to establish several forts there . As a result of his actions , Titus received the title of Imperator for the fifteenth time . 
 His reign also saw the rebellion led by Terentius Maximus , one of several false <unk> who appeared throughout the 70s . Although Nero was primarily known as a universally hated tyrant , there is evidence that for much of his reign , he remained highly popular in the eastern provinces . Reports that Nero had in fact survived his overthrow were fueled by the confusing circumstances of his death and several prophecies foretelling his return . 
 According to Cassius Dio , Terentius Maximus resembled Nero in voice and appearance and , like him , sang to the lyre . Terentius established a following in Asia minor but was soon forced to flee beyond the Euphrates , taking refuge with the Parthians . In addition , sources state that Titus discovered that his brother Domitian was plotting against him but refused to have him killed or banished . 
 = = = Public works = = = 
 Construction of the Flavian Amphitheatre , presently better known as the Colosseum , was begun in 70 under Vespasian and finally completed in 80 under Titus . In addition to providing spectacular entertainments to the Roman populace , the building was also conceived as a gigantic triumphal monument to commemorate the military achievements of the Flavians during the Jewish wars . 
 The inaugural games lasted for a hundred days and were said to be extremely elaborate , including gladiatorial combat , fights between wild animals ( elephants and cranes ) , mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded , horse races and chariot races . During the games , wooden balls were dropped into the audience , inscribed with various prizes ( clothing , gold , or even slaves ) , which could then be traded for the designated item . 
 Adjacent to the amphitheatre , within the precinct of Nero 's Golden House , Titus had also ordered the construction of a new public bath @-@ house , the Baths of Titus . Construction of this building was hastily finished to coincide with the completion of the Flavian Amphitheatre . 
 Practice of the imperial cult was revived by Titus , though apparently it met with some difficulty as Vespasian was not deified until six months after his death . To further honor and glorify the Flavian dynasty , foundations were laid for what would later become the Temple of Vespasian and Titus , which was finished by Domitian . 
 = = = Death ( 81 A.D. ) = = = 
 At the closing of the games , Titus officially dedicated the amphitheatre and the baths , which was to be his final recorded act as Emperor . He set out for the Sabine territories but fell ill at the first posting station where he died of a fever , reportedly in the same farm @-@ house as his father . Allegedly , the last words he uttered before passing away were : " I have made but one mistake " . 
 Titus had ruled the Roman Empire for just over two years , from the death of his father in 79 to his own on 13 September 81 . He was succeeded by Domitian , whose first act as emperor was to deify his brother . 
 Historians have speculated on the exact nature of his death , and to which mistake Titus alluded in his final words . Philostratus writes that he was poisoned by Domitian with a sea hare ( Aplysia <unk> ) , and that his death had been foretold to him by Apollonius of Tyana . Suetonius and Cassius Dio maintain he died of natural causes , but both accuse Domitian of having left the ailing Titus for dead . Consequently , Dio believes Titus 's mistake refers to his failure to have his brother executed when he was found to be openly plotting against him . 
 The Babylonian Talmud ( Gittin <unk> ) attributes Titus 's death to an insect that flew into his nose and picked at his brain for seven years , in a repetition of another legend referring to biblical King Nimrod .

 Titus 's record among ancient historians stands as one of the most exemplary of any emperor . All the surviving accounts from this period , many of them written by his own contemporaries , present a highly favorable view towards Titus . His character has especially prospered in comparison with that of his brother Domitian . 
 The Wars of the Jews offers a first @-@ hand , eye @-@ witness account of the Jewish rebellion and the character of Titus . The neutrality of Josephus ' writings has come into question however , as he was heavily indebted to the Flavians . In 71 , he arrived in Rome in the entourage of Titus , became a Roman citizen and took on the Roman nomen Flavius and praenomen Titus from his patrons . He received an annual pension and lived in the palace . 
 It was while in Rome , and under Flavian patronage , that Josephus wrote all of his known works . The War of the Jews is heavily slanted against the leaders of the revolt , portraying the rebellion as weak and unorganized , and even blaming the Jews for causing the war . The credibility of Josephus as a historian has subsequently come under fire . 
 Another contemporary of Titus was Publius Cornelius Tacitus , who started his public career in 80 or 81 and credits the Flavian dynasty with his elevation . The Histories — his account of this period — was published during the reign of Trajan . Unfortunately only the first five books from this work have survived until the present day , with the text on Titus 's and Domitian 's reign entirely lost . 
 Suetonius <unk> gives a short but highly favourable account on Titus 's reign in The Lives of Twelve Caesars , emphasizing his military achievements and his generosity as Emperor , in short describing him as follows : 
 Titus , of the same surname as his father , was the delight and darling of the human race ; such surpassing ability had he , by nature , art , or good fortune , to win the affections of all men , and that , too , which is no easy task , while he was emperor . 
 Finally , Cassius Dio wrote his Roman History over a hundred years after the death of Titus . He shares a similar outlook as Suetonius , possibly even using the latter as a source , but is more reserved , noting : 
 His satisfactory record may also have been due to the fact that he survived his accession but a very short time , for he was thus given no opportunity for wrongdoing . For he lived after this only two years , two months and twenty days — in addition to the thirty @-@ nine years , five months and twenty @-@ five days he had already lived at that time . In this respect , indeed , he is regarded as having equalled the long reign of Augustus , since it is maintained that Augustus would never have been loved had he lived a shorter time , nor Titus had he lived longer . For Augustus , though at the outset he showed himself rather harsh because of the wars and the factional strife , was later able , in the course of time , to achieve a brilliant reputation for his kindly deeds ; Titus , on the other hand , ruled with mildness and died at the height of his glory , whereas , if he had lived a long time , it might have been shown that he owes his present fame more to good fortune than to merit . 
 Pliny the Elder , who later died during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius , dedicated his Naturalis Historia to Titus . 
 In contrast to the ideal portrayal of Titus in Roman histories , in Jewish memory " Titus the Wicked " is remembered as an evil oppressor and destroyer of the Temple . For example , one legend in the Babylonian Talmud describes Titus as having had sex with a whore on a Torah scroll inside the Temple during its destruction .

 = Cicada = 
 The cicadas ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) are a superfamily , the Cicadoidea , of insects in the order Hemiptera ( true bugs ) . They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha , along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers . It is divided into the Tettigarctidae , with two species in Australia , and Cicadidae , with more than 1 @,@ 300 species described from around the world ; many undescribed species remain . 
 Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart , short antennae , and membranous front wings . They have an exceptionally loud song , produced not by stridulation , but by vibrating <unk> tymbals rapidly . The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period ; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates . They typically live in trees , feeding on sap , and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark . Most cicadas are cryptic , singing at night to avoid predators . The periodic cicadas spend most of their lives as underground nymphs , emerging only after 13 or 17 years , most likely to reduce losses by <unk> their predators . 
 Cicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer 's Iliad , and as motifs in art from the Chinese Shang dynasty . They have been used in myths and folklore to represent carefree living and immortality . Cicadas are eaten in various countries , including China , where the nymphs are served deep @-@ fried in Shandong cuisine . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name is a direct derivation of the Latin cicada , meaning " tree cricket " . American English of central Appalachia retains the name " <unk> " . In ancient Greek , it was called a <unk> , and in modern Greek <unk> , <unk> — both names being onomatopoeic . 
 = = Taxonomy and diversity = = 
 Cicadas are arranged into two families : the Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae . The two extant species of Tettigarctidae include one in southern Australia and the other in Tasmania . The family Cicadidae is subdivided into the subfamilies <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; they are found on all continents except Antarctica . Some previous works also included a family @-@ level taxon called the <unk> . The largest species is the Malaysian emperor cicada <unk> <unk> ; its wingspan is up to about 20 cm ( 8 in ) . They are also notable for the great length of time some species take to mature . 
 At least 1300 cicada species are distributed worldwide with the majority being in the tropics . Most genera are restricted to a single biogeographical region and many species have a very limited range . This high degree of endemism has been used to study the biogeography of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and the Orient . There are about 200 described species in Australia and New Zealand , around 150 in South Africa , over 170 in America north of Mexico , at least 800 in Latin America , and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific . About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic . A few species are found in southern Europe , and a single species is in England , the New Forest cicada , <unk> montana , which also occurs in continental Europe . 
 Most of the North American species are in the genus <unk> : the annual or jar fly or dog @-@ day cicadas ( so named because they emerge in late July and August ) . The best @-@ known North American genus , however , is Magicicada . These periodical cicadas have an extremely long lifecycle of 13 or 17 years , suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers . 
 Australian cicadas are found on tropical islands and cold coastal beaches around Tasmania , in tropical wetlands , high and low deserts , alpine areas of New South Wales and Victoria , large cities like Sydney , Melbourne , and Brisbane , and Tasmanian highlands and snowfields . Many of them go by common names such as cherry nose , brown baker , red eye , greengrocer , yellow Monday , whisky drinker , double drummer , and black prince . The Australian greengrocer , <unk> <unk> , is among the loudest insects in the world . 
 Forty @-@ two species from five genera populate New Zealand , ranging from sea level to mountain tops , and all are endemic to New Zealand and the surrounding islands ( Norfolk Island , New Caledonia ) . 
 = = = Palaeontology = = = 
 Fossil Cicadomorpha first appeared in the Upper Permian . The superfamily <unk> contains three families . The Upper Permian <unk> are found in Australia and South Africa , and also in younger rocks from China . The Upper Triassic <unk> are found in Australia and South Africa . 
 The <unk> or " giant cicadas " come from the Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous of Eurasia and South America . The first of these was a forewing discovered in the Taynton Limestone Formation of Oxfordshire , England ; it was initially described as a butterfly in 1873 , before being recognised as a cicada and renamed <unk> <unk> .

 = = = Description = = = 
 Cicadas are large insects made conspicuous by the courtship calls of the males . They are characterised by having three joints in their tarsi , and having small antennae with conical bases and three to six segments , including a seta at the tip . The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the <unk> part of the head , complex sound @-@ producing membranes , and a mechanism for linking the wings which involves a down @-@ rolled edging on the rear of the forewing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hind wing . Cicadas lack the ability to jump as exhibited by other members of the Auchenorrhyncha . Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the forelimbs of nymphs for underground life . The relict family Tettigarctidae differ from the Cicadidae in having the prothorax extending as far as the scutellum , and by lacking the tympanal apparatus . 
 The adult insect , known as an imago , is 2 to 5 centimetres ( 1 – 2 in ) in total length in most species , although the largest , the empress cicada ( <unk> <unk> ) , has a head @-@ body length of about 7 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) , and its wingspan is 18 to 20 centimetres ( 7 – 8 in ) . Cicadas have prominent compound eyes set wide apart on the sides of the head . The short antennae protrude between the eyes or in front of them . They also have three small ocelli located on the top of the head in a triangle between the two large eyes , and this distinguishes cicadas from other members of the Hemiptera . The mouthparts form a long sharp rostrum which they insert into the plant to feed . The post @-@ clypeus is a large , nose @-@ like structure that lies between the eyes and makes up most of the front of the head : it contains the pumping musculature . 
 The thorax has three segments and houses the powerful wing muscles . They have two pairs of membranous wings that may be hyaline , cloudy or pigmented . The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification . The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen . The abdomen is segmented , with the <unk> segments housing the reproductive organs , and terminates in females with a large , saw @-@ edged ovipositor . In males , the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber . 
 The surface of the fore @-@ wing is super @-@ hydrophobic ; it is covered with minute waxy cones , blunt spikes which create a water @-@ repellent film . Rain rolls across the surface , removing dirt in the process . In the absence of rain , dew condenses on the wings . When the droplets coalesce , they leap several millimetres into the air , which also serves to clean the wings . It has been found that bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled , rather their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale @-@ sized spikes , making the wing surface the first @-@ known <unk> that can kill bacteria . 
 = = = Temperature regulation = = = 
 Desert cicadas such as <unk> apache are unusual among insects in controlling their temperature by evaporative cooling , analogous to sweating in mammals . When their temperature rises above about 39 ° C , they suck excess sap from the food plants and extrude the excess water through pores in the tergum at a modest cost in energy . Such a rapid loss of water can be sustained only by feeding on water @-@ rich xylem sap . At lower temperatures , feeding cicadas would normally need to excrete the excess water . By evaporative cooling , desert cicadas can reduce their bodily temperature by some 5 ° C. Some non @-@ desert cicada species such as Magicicada <unk> also cool themselves evaporatively , but less dramatically . Conversely , many other cicadas can voluntarily raise their body temperatures as much as 22 ° C ( 40 ° F ) above ambient temperature . 
 = = = Song = = = 
 The " singing " of male cicadas is not stridulation such as many familiar species of insects produce — for example crickets . Instead , male cicadas have a noisemaker called a tymbal below each side of the anterior abdominal region . The tymbals are structures of the exoskeleton formed into complex membranes with thin , membranous portions and thickened ribs . Contraction of internal muscles buckles the tymbals inwards , thereby producing a click ; on relaxation of the muscles , the tymbals return to their original position , producing another click . The male abdomen is largely hollow , and acts as a sound box . By rapidly vibrating these membranes , a cicada combines the clicks into apparently continuous notes , and enlarged chambers derived from the tracheae serve as resonance chambers with which it amplifies the sound . The cicada also modulates the song by positioning its abdomen toward or away from the substrate . Partly by the pattern in which it combines the clicks , each species produces its own distinctive mating songs and acoustic signals , ensuring that the song attracts only appropriate mates . 
 Average temperature of the natural habitat for the South American species <unk> rana is approximately 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) . During sound production , the temperature of the tymbal muscles was found to be significantly higher . Many cicadas sing most actively during the hottest hours of a summer day ; roughly a 24 @-@ hour cycle . 
 Although only males produce the cicadas ' distinctive sound , both sexes have membraneous structures called tympana by which they detect sounds ; the equivalent of having ears . Males disable their own tympana while calling , thereby preventing damage to their hearing ; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120 dB ( SPL ) which is among the loudest of all insect @-@ produced sounds . The song is loud enough to cause permanent hearing loss in humans should the cicada sing just outside the listener 's ear . In contrast , some small species have songs so high in pitch that the noise is inaudible to humans . 
 For the human ear , it is often difficult to tell precisely where a cicada song originates . The pitch is nearly constant , the sound is continuous to the human ear , and cicadas sing in scattered groups . In addition to the mating song , many species have a distinct distress call , usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked . Some species also have courtship songs , generally quieter , and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song . Males also produce encounter calls , whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses . 
 The song of cicadas is considered by entomologists to be unique to a given species , and a number of resources exist to collect and analyse cicada sounds . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 In some species of cicada , the males remain in one location and call to attract females . Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus . In other species , the males move from place to place , usually with quieter calls while searching for females . The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds . After mating , the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs . 
 When the eggs hatch , the newly hatched nymphs drop to the ground and burrow . Cicadas live underground as nymphs for most of their lives at depths down to about 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 ft ) . Nymphs have strong front legs for digging and excavating chambers in close proximity to roots where they feed on xylem sap . In the process , their bodies and interior of the burrow become coated in anal fluids . In wet habitats , larger species construct mud towers above ground in order to <unk> their burrows . In the final nymphal instar , they construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge . They then moult ( shed their skins ) on a nearby plant for the last time , and emerge as adults . The exuviae or abandoned exoskeletons remain , still clinging to the bark of the tree . 
 Most cicadas go through a life cycle that lasts from two to five years . Some species have much longer life cycles , such as the North American genus , Magicicada , which has a number of distinct " broods " that go through either a 17 @-@ year or , in some parts of the world , a 13 @-@ year life cycle . The long life cycles may have developed as a response to predators , such as the cicada killer wasp and praying mantis . A specialist predator with a shorter life cycle of at least two years could not reliably prey upon the cicadas . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Cicada nymphs suck sap from the xylem of various species of trees , including oak , cypress , willow , ash , and maple . While it is common folklore that adults do not eat , they actually do drink plant sap utilizing their sucking mouthparts . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 Cicadas , like other Auchenorrhyncha , are adapted for jumping ( saltation ) , as well as the usual insect modes of locomotion , walking and flight . However , they do not walk or run well , and take to the wing to travel distances greater than a few centimetres . Cicadas can extend their hind legs in under a millisecond to execute a jump , implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release . 
 = = Predators , parasites and pathogens = = 
 Cicadas are commonly eaten by birds and sometimes by squirrels , as well as bats , wasps , mantises , spiders and robber flies . In times of mass emergence of cicadas , various amphibians , fish , reptiles , mammals and birds change their foraging habits so as to benefit from the glut . Newly hatched nymphs may be eaten by ants , and nymphs living underground are preyed on by burrowing mammals like moles . In Australia , cicadas are preyed on by the Australian cicada killer wasp ( Exeirus lateritius ) , which stings and stuns cicadas high in the trees , making them drop to the ground where the cicada @-@ hunter mounts and carries them , pushing with its hind legs , sometimes over a distance of a hundred meters , until they can be shoved down into its burrow , where the numb cicada is placed onto one of many shelves in a " catacomb " , to form the food @-@ stock for the wasp grub that grows out of the egg deposited there . 
 Several fungal diseases infect and kill adult cicadas while another entomopathogenic fungus , Cordyceps spp . , attacks nymphs . <unk> <unk> specifically attacks the adults of periodical cicadas , the spores remaining dormant in the soil between outbreaks . 
 = = = Antipredator adaptations = = = 
 Cicadas use a variety of strategies to evade predators . Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed . Many are extremely well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight . As well as being coloured like tree bark , they are disruptively patterned to break up their outlines ; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate . The wings are <unk> , avoiding the typical shine of insect cuticle which would break the cicada 's camouflage . 
 The periodical cicadas ( Magicicada ) make use of predator satiation : they emerge , all at once , at long intervals of 13 or 17 years ; their juveniles are probably the longest @-@ lived of all insect development stages . Since the number of cicadas in any given area exceeds the amount predators can eat , all available predators are satiated , and the remaining cicadas can breed in peace . 
 Some cicadas such as <unk> <unk> display bright deimatic flash coloration on their hindwings when threatened ; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators , giving the cicadas time to escape . The majority of cicadas are nocturnal and rely on camouflage when at rest , but some species are aposematic ; the Malaysian <unk> sanguinea has conspicuous red and black warning coloration , is diurnal , and boldly flies about in full view of possible predators . 
 Predators such as the <unk> fly <unk> hunt cicadas by sound , being attracted to their song . Singing males soften their song so that the attention of the listener gets distracted to neighbouring louder singers , or cease singing altogether as a predator approaches . It has been asserted that loud cicada song , especially in chorus , repels predators , but observations of predator responses refute the claim .

 = = = In art and literature = = = 
 Cicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer 's Iliad , and as motifs in decorative art from the Chinese Shang dynasty ( 1766 – 1122 B.C. ) . They are described by Aristotle in his History of Animals and by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History ; their mechanism of sound production is mentioned by Hesiod in his poem Works and Days " when the <unk> flowers , and the tuneful <unk> sitting on his tree in the weary summer season pours forth from under his wings his shrill song " . In the classic 14th @-@ century Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms , <unk> took her name from the sable ( <unk> ) tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas ( <unk> ) , which adorned the hats of high @-@ level officials . In Latin America , the mariachi song " La <unk> " ( " The Cicada " ) <unk> the insect as a creature that sings until it dies . In the Japanese novel The Tale of Genji , the title character poetically likens one of his many love interests to a cicada for the way she delicately sheds her scarf the way a cicada sheds its shell when molting . A cicada exuviae plays a role in the manga Winter Cicada . Cicadas are a frequent subject of haiku , where , depending on type , they can indicate spring , summer or autumn . 
 = = = In mythology and folklore = = = 
 Cicadas have been used as money , in folk medicine , to forecast the weather , to provide song ( in China ) , and in folklore and myths around the world . In France , the cicada represents the folklore of Provence and the Mediterranean cities . 
 The cicada has represented insouciance since classical antiquity . Jean de La Fontaine began his collection of fables Les fables de La Fontaine with the story La Cigale et la <unk> ( The Cicada and the Ant ) based on one of Aesop 's fables : in it the cicada spends the summer singing while the ant stores away food , and finds herself without food when the weather turns bitter . 
 The cicada symbolises rebirth and immortality in Chinese tradition . In the Chinese essay " Thirty @-@ Six Stratagems " , the phrase " to shed the golden cicada skin " ( <unk> , pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) is the poetic name for using a decoy ( leaving the exuviae ) to fool enemies . In the Chinese classic novel Journey to the West ( 16th century ) , the protagonist Priest of Tang was named the Golden Cicada . 
 In Japan , the cicada is associated with the summer season . According to Lafcadio Hearn , the song of <unk> <unk> , called " <unk> @-@ <unk> boshi " , is said to indicate the end of summer , and it is called so because of its particular call . 
 In an Ancient Greek myth , Tithonus eventually turns into a cicada after being granted immortality , but not eternal youth , by Zeus . The Greeks also used a cicada sitting on a harp as emblematic of music . 
 = = = As food and folk medicine = = = 
 Cicadas were eaten in Ancient Greece , and are consumed today in China , both as adults and ( more often ) as nymphs , Malaysia , Burma , Latin America , and central Africa . Female cicadas are prized for being meatier . Shells of cicadas are employed in traditional Chinese medicines . 
 In 2011 , cicadas were incorporated into a single batch of ice cream in Columbia , Missouri , at Sparky 's . The ice creamery was advised by the public health department against making a second batch , a suggestion with which store owners complied . 
 = = = As pests = = = 
 Cicadas feed on sap , and are benign to humans ; they do not bite or sting in a true sense , but may occasionally mistake a person 's arm for a plant limb and attempt to feed . 
 Cicadas are not major agricultural pests but in some outbreak years , trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots . Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches . Although in general , the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage , during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas , the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer . Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane , and this has affected the crop adversely , and in a few isolated cases , females have <unk> on food crops such as date palms , grape vines , citrus trees , asparagus and cotton . 
 Cicadas sometimes cause damage to amenity shrubs and trees , mainly in the form of scarring left on tree branches where the females laid their eggs . Branches of young trees may die as a result .

 Traci Lords : Underneath It All is an autobiography by American actress and singer Traci Lords , first published on July 8 , 2003 by HarperCollins . It was reissued as a paperback on June 29 , 2004 , with an additional chapter and photos . The book primarily details Lords ' career in the adult film industry , when she appeared underage in dozens of pornographic films and became one of the most notable <unk> of the 1980s . It also chronicles her childhood , transition to mainstream films and musical career . 
 Traci Lords : Underneath It All received positive response from critics and was a commercial success . It debuted at number thirty @-@ one on the The New York Times Best Seller list . However , the book met with criticism from adult film industry insiders , some of whom accused Lords of lying . 
 = = Summary = = 
 Lords was born Nora Louise Kuzma in Steubenville , Ohio . Her parents divorced when she was 7 @-@ years @-@ old due to her father 's abusive behavior , and she moved with her mother and three sisters to her great @-@ grandmother 's house . When she was 10 , she was raped by a sixteen @-@ year @-@ old acquaintance . At the age of 12 , Kuzma moved with her mother and sisters to Lawndale , California , along with her mother 's boyfriend Roger , who was a cocaine dealer . She began attending Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach , California . At 14 , she became pregnant by her high school boyfriend . Searching for a job in order to get money for an abortion , Kuzma was introduced to Roger 's friend Lynn for whom she started working as a babysitter . Lynn offered to help her solve her job problems by getting her a fake driver 's license ID . Her new ID , with the name of Kristie Elizabeth <unk> , stated she was 22 rather than 15 . She ran away from home and ended up on the streets of Hollywood where she landed a job as a nude model . After appearing in a nude centerfold in Penthouse magazine ( she was only 15 when the photos were taken ) , Kuzma became nationally known as Traci Lords . From there she appeared in numerous adult films and magazines until authorities discovered she had been a minor and started an extensive investigation of all her co @-@ workers .

 Lords first talked about her plans to write a book during an interview with Ross Shafer on April 18 , 1988 . Later , in July , it was confirmed that a book entitled Out of the Blue : The Traci Lords Story was in development . However , the project was shelved due to problems with the publishing deal . On November 4 , 2000 , when Lords was a guest on the The Howard Stern Show , she was again asked about the book but said she had no intentions of putting it out at that time .

 The book received relatively positive reviews from critics . Susan Carpenter , writing in the Los Angeles Times , called the book " a luridly fascinating , if horrifying , tell @-@ all , from her birth in an eastern Ohio steel town to her present @-@ day life as an actress and recording artist who is happily married in L.A. " Amanda Tyler of USA Today commented : " Lords ' story of personal redemption is so immersed in genuine emotion and beaming with soulful resiliency that the reader will walk away with nothing but respect for her and her remarkable journey . " Bill Zwecker , who reviewed the book for Chicago Sun @-@ Times , noted : " ' Graphic ' is said to be quite the understatement for the memoirs former under @-@ age porn star Traci Lords has penned . " John Patterson of The Guardian wrote : " It has porn 's typical , irreversible @-@ nosedive trajectory : fake IDs , serious money , major narcotics - the lowest , <unk> rung on stardom 's ladder - followed by exposure ( of entirely the wrong sort ) , disgrace , and rehabilitation . " 
 Despite the favorable reviews , the book met with criticism from adult film industry insiders , some of whom accused Lords of lying . Co @-@ workers from that time such as John Leslie , Ron Jeremy , Ginger Lynn and Tom Byron said they never saw her use drugs and insisted she was always fully aware of her actions . One of her co @-@ workers from that time , Christy Canyon , said about Lords ' autobiography , " I think her book could have been fabulous , except that she was lying throughout the whole thing . "

 = André Messager = 
 André Charles Prosper Messager ( French : [ <unk> ] ; 30 December 1853 – 24 February 1929 ) was a French composer , organist , pianist , conductor and administrator . His stage compositions included ballets and 30 opéra comiques and operettas , among which Véronique had lasting success , with Les p 'tites Michu and Monsieur Beaucaire also enjoying international success . 
 Despite financial obstacles , Messager pursued studies in piano and composition , with teachers including Camille Saint @-@ Saëns and Gabriel Fauré . He became a major figure in the musical life of London as well as Paris , both as a conductor and a composer . Most of his Parisian works were produced in London , where several of them had long runs and numerous revivals , and he wrote two operatic works in English . He was the only French composer to write an original Savoy opera . Towards the end of his career , he composed musical comedies for Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps . 
 As a conductor , Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London , at the head of the Opéra @-@ Comique , the Paris Opéra , the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire , and of the Royal Opera House , Covent Garden . Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works , as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas , from Mozart to Richard Strauss , and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of Wagner . In Paris he conducted the world premieres of Debussy 's Pelléas et Mélisande , Massenet 's Grisélidis and Charpentier 's Louise . At Covent Garden , he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint @-@ Saëns and Massenet .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Messager was born at <unk> in central France , the son of Paul @-@ Philippe @-@ Émile Messager , a prosperous local tax collector , and Sophie @-@ Cornélie <unk> de <unk> . The young Messager was given piano lessons , and at the age of seven he was sent as a boarder to a Marist school where he continued his interest in the piano . After a bank crash brought ruin to the family , which could no longer afford to keep Messager at the Marist school , he was awarded a bursary to study at the École de Musique classique et <unk> in Paris , run by Louis Niedermeyer . This was at the time of the Paris Commune , and to escape the violence in the city , the school was temporarily evacuated to Switzerland . Messager studied piano with Adam <unk> , organ with Clément Loret , and composition with Eugène <unk> , Gabriel Fauré and ( after leaving Niedermeyer 's school ) Camille Saint @-@ Saëns . 
 Fauré and Messager quickly moved from being master and pupil to being firm friends and occasional collaborators . In 1874 Messager was appointed to succeed Fauré as <unk> de <unk> ( choirmaster ) at Saint @-@ Sulpice , Paris , under the principal organist , Charles @-@ Marie Widor . In 1876 , he won the gold medal of the Société des Auteurs , Compositeurs et <unk> de Musique with a symphony , the work being warmly received when performed by the Concerts Colonne at the Théâtre du Châtelet in January 1878 . He won further prizes for his cantatas Prométhée <unk> and Don Juan et Haydée . 
 In 1878 , Fauré and Messager travelled together to Cologne to see Wagner 's Das Rheingold and Die Walküre , and later they went to Munich for the complete Ring cycle , Die Meistersinger and Tannhäuser and to Bayreuth for Die Meistersinger and Parsifal . They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition , the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth . This short , skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from The Ring . They also collaborated on the Messe des pêcheurs de <unk> . 
 = = = First successes = = = 
 In 1878 Messager was appointed conductor at the Folies Bergère , and he began his career composing for the stage with two short ballets , Fleur d <unk> ( 1878 ) and Les vins de France ( 1879 ) . In 1880 a former manager of the Folies , M. <unk> , was appointed to run the Eden Théâtre , a new 3 @,@ 000 capacity theatre in Brussels . At his invitation , Messager resigned from the Folies in 1880 and became conductor of the Eden Théâtre . He returned to Paris in 1881 as organist of St. Paul @-@ St. Louis and from 1882 to 1884 he was maître de <unk> at Ste Marie @-@ des @-@ Batignolles a small church in the north west of Paris , where his assistant was another young composer , Claude Terrasse . 
 In 1883 , the composer Firmin <unk> died , leaving an unfinished operetta , François les bas @-@ bleus . Messager was invited to complete it ; he orchestrated the entire work and composed about 12 numbers . It was staged in November 1883 at the Théâtre des Folies @-@ Dramatiques and was an immediate critical and popular success . It was produced in London by Kate Santley in 1885 under the title François the Radical . In 1883 , Messager married a distant cousin , Edith Clouette . Fauré played the organ at the ceremony . 
 In December 1883 Messager and Chabrier gave the first performance of the latter 's Trois valses <unk> at the Société Nationale de Musique . The concert also included the two @-@ piano version premiere of España . A close friend of Chabrier from the 1880s until Chabrier 's death , Messager had a great admiration for Chabrier 's opera Gwendoline and swore that he would conduct it in Paris , which he later did . He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the published vocal score of the work . 
 Following the success of François les bas @-@ bleus , Messager received , and accepted , simultaneous invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an operetta for the Folies @-@ Dramatiques . The operetta , La fauvette du temple , first performed on 17 November 1885 , confirmed Messager 's reputation . It ran well into the following year in Paris , and he was able to sell the British rights immediately , though the work was not staged in London until 1891 . The ballet , Les deux pigeons , which became one of Messager 's best known works , took longer to reach the stage . It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra , but the staging , which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene , was considered a fire hazard by the police authorities , and the production was temporarily shelved . 
 A month after the opening of La fauvette du temple the Bouffes @-@ Parisiens premiered Messager 's opéra comique , La Béarnaise , with Jeanne Granier in the title role . It ran for three months and was successfully produced in Britain the following year with a cast including Florence St. John and Marie Tempest , running for more than 200 performances . The Times said of this production that it gave Messager a secure footing in London , which led to important results later in his career . A production of La Béarnaise in New York followed in 1887 , under the title <unk> . 
 In 1886 Les deux pigeons was finally produced at the Paris Opéra and was a great success . It was Messager 's last success for four years . His attempt at a more serious opera , Le bourgeois de Calais ( 1888 ) , with " a boring historical plot , bad lyrics , and a banal score " was not well received . One critic wrote , " That Le Bourgeois de Calais will have a successful career there is not the faintest chance , for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece . " Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale <unk> ( 1888 ) , which was slightly better received , and a three @-@ act operetta , Le mari de la reine ( The Queen 's Husband , 1889 ) , which failed , although Messager thought it " the best of my flops . " Also in the 1880s , Messager published some song cycles , and " sung waltzes " . 
 = = = Fin de siècle = = = 
 Messager 's fortunes revived in 1890 with La Basoche , produced with much success at the Opéra @-@ Comique . The critic who had pronounced so unfavourably on Le Bourgeois de Calais wrote of the new piece , " an exceptionally pleasing work ... a dainty piece which cannot fail to obtain widespread popularity . " An English @-@ language version was produced in London in 1891 by Richard D 'Oyly Carte . The theatrical newspaper The Era wrote , " The Basoche is more than a success ; it is a triumph " , but the piece had only a moderately successful run of three months . A New York production was given in 1893 but was not a success . 
 In 1892 Messager 's career as a conductor began to advance . He was invited to conduct Die Walküre at Marseille . As a composer , however , the early 1890s brought him mixed fortunes . Madame <unk> , staged at the Théâtre de la Renaissance in 1893 , was the first operatic setting of the story by Pierre Loti later set by Puccini as Madama Butterfly ; it was politely rather than enthusiastically received . Mirette , produced by Carte at the Savoy Theatre in 1894 , was Messager 's first opera written expressly for the London stage and was the only original Savoy opera by a French composer . To assist him in what was for him ( at the time ) an unfamiliar idiom , he enlisted the help of the songwriter <unk> ( Alice Maude ) Davis ( 1859 – 1938 ) , known professionally as Hope Temple . She became Messager 's second wife in 1895 , Edith having divorced him . According to Bernard Shaw , Messager , concluding from the reception of La Basoche in London that it was unwise to offer the British public anything too intelligent , decided that the new opera was going to be as commonplace as possible . It had a disappointing run , and Messager vetoed any production in Paris . 
 His next opera , a serious work , Le chevalier d <unk> ( 1896 ) , was unsuccessful , and for a while Messager and his new wife withdrew to the English countryside near Maidenhead , Berkshire . From 1897 , however , his career revived , with the success of his operetta Les p 'tites Michu at the Bouffes @-@ Parisiens , his appointment in 1898 as musical director of the Opéra @-@ Comique , and the outstanding success of Véronique ( 1898 ) . Both of these operettas had librettos by Albert <unk> and Georges Duval , whose work was judged to be above the average of their kind . 
 From 1898 to 1904 , Messager 's work at the Opéra @-@ Comique left him little time for composition , particularly after 1901 , when he also spent May to July at the Royal Opera House in London . He turned down W. S. Gilbert 's offer of a collaboration , and wrote only two stage works between 1898 and 1914 . His international fame as a composer nevertheless grew , with productions of Les p 'tites Michu and Véronique in countries including Britain , Spain , Switzerland , Germany and the U.S. Unusually for the London stage at the time , Véronique was not translated into English but was given in <unk> and Duval 's original French in 1903 . An English translation was staged the following year and ran for 496 performances . Messager conducted the first nights of both productions . 
 At the Opéra @-@ Comique , Messager encouraged Claude Debussy to complete his opera Pelléas et Mélisande and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere . He conducted the premiere in 1902 and in gratitude the work was dedicated to him . Messager also conducted the premieres of Massenet 's Grisélidis and Charpentier 's Louise . As a conductor , he won praise from critics on both sides of the English Channel . The English music critic Francis Toye wrote that good though Arturo Toscanini 's conducting of Pelléas et Mélisande was at La Scala in Milan , Messager 's was still better .

 From 1901 to 1907 , Messager was one of the directors of the Grand Opera Syndicate , which ran the Covent Garden opera seasons , featuring the leading singers of the day , including Nellie Melba and Enrico Caruso . Much of his time , according to his biographer John Wagstaff , was spent on administration . From 1901 , for two years , Messager had an affair with the Scottish soprano Mary Garden , whom he had met at the Opéra @-@ Comique and conducted when she took over the title role of Louise . She also appeared in a revival of his Madame <unk> . His first appearance at Covent Garden was in 1902 with the first and second performances of The Princess <unk> ( in French ) by Herbert Bunning . He next conducted at Covent Garden in 1904 in the British premiere of Saint @-@ Saëns 's Hélène , followed in 1905 by Carmen , Don Giovanni , Faust , the world première of Franco Leoni 's L <unk> , Orphée et Euridice and Roméo et Juliette ; in his final year 1906 he conducted Armide , Carmen , Don Giovanni , Faust , the British premiere of Le jongleur de Notre @-@ Dame , and Roméo et Juliette . In 1906 he also introduced to Covent Garden his ballet Les deux pigeons . Despite his reputation as a Wagnerian , he yielded the baton for Wagner performances to Hans Richter , widely regarded as the world 's foremost exponent of Wagner 's music . In 1906 , Messager and the London Symphony Orchestra travelled to Paris to play a programme of English music at the Châtelet Theatre , including works by Sullivan , Parry and Stanford . When he left Covent Garden in 1907 , the directors found it necessary to appoint two people to fill his place : Neil Forsyth as general manager and Percy Pitt as musical director . 
 In 1907 Messager returned to composition . His " comédie lyrique " , Fortunio was presented at the Opéra @-@ Comique with great success . In the same year he was appointed joint director of the Paris Opéra , responsible for the artistic direction , with <unk> <unk> , formerly director of the Lyons Opera , taking charge of administration . The partnership lasted until 1914 but , Wagstaff writes , it was " only moderately successful , because of shortage of funds and disputes with staff " . Messager decided on a policy of making the Opéra " more genuinely French " . He revived Rameau 's Hippolyte et <unk> , for the first time in Paris since 1767 , and presented unusual French repertoire including Fauré 's Pénélope and Ravel 's L 'heure espagnole . Foreign opera was not neglected ; Messager gave Paris its first complete cycle of Der Ring des Nibelungen , presented a Russian season starring <unk> <unk> and Feodor Chaliapin , and gave the French premiere of Richard Strauss 's Salome . At the invitation of the Emperor Wilhelm II , Messager and <unk> took the Opéra company to Berlin in 1908 . Relations between the two co @-@ directors were not always harmonious ; the French government was obliged to refuse to accept Messager 's resignation on at least one occasion , and he finally resigned in November 1913 , a year before their term of office was due to expire . He consented to return in January 1914 to conduct Parsifal – its first performance in Europe outside Bayreuth . His conducting of the work won critical praise . 
 On the strength of his experience as a Wagnerian , Messager was appointed conductor of the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire in 1908 . Alongside the main orchestral repertoire of Haydn , Mozart , Beethoven , Liszt and French classics , Messager also conducted the Conservatoire orchestra in major choral works by J. S. Bach , Handel , Schumann and Berlioz , as well as introducing early French music such as that of <unk> . In 1909 he delivered the French premiere , very shortly after the world premiere in Boston , of Paderewski 's Polonia Symphony . In the 1913 – 14 season , he conducted a chronological cycle of Beethoven 's symphonies and his Missa Solemnis , as well as the Verdi Requiem , for the Italian composer 's centenary . Messager took the orchestra outside Paris to Lille , Lyon and Antwerp during these years . During World War I , he took the orchestra on tour to Argentina ( 1916 ) , Switzerland ( 1917 ) , and the U.S. and Canada ( 1918 – 19 ) giving concerts in more than 50 cities . At the end of that tour he resigned his post . Messager was criticised for performing the music of Wagner , but he maintained that German music represented the noble side of the enemy nation 's nature . Like Fauré , but unlike Saint @-@ Saëns , Messager refused to have anything to do with the National League for the Defence of French Music ( La Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française ) , which sought to boycott German music . 
 In 1914 Messager composed Béatrice , described as a " légende lyrique " , based on the 1911 play The Miracle . The premiere was in Monte Carlo . The work was performed in Paris in 1917 but was not successful . In 1915 Messager joined with other musicians in contributing compositions to King Albert 's Book to raise money for " the relief of the suffering Belgian people " ; the other composers included Debussy , Elgar , Mascagni , Paderewski and Saint @-@ Saëns . 
 In 1919 Messager 's operetta Monsieur Beaucaire was premiered in Birmingham , prior to a long run in the West End . The composer , who generally conducted British premieres of his works , was suffering from sciatica and could not even be in the audience for the first nights in either city . The work received its Paris premiere at the Marigny Theatre in 1925 . Later in 1919 , Messager resumed the musical directorship of the Opéra @-@ Comique for the 1919 – 20 season , conducting among other works the first complete French performance of Così fan tutte . At the Opéra , he was the conductor for Tristan und Isolde on the 100th anniversary of Wagner 's birth . 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 In the 1920s , Messager kept pace with the change in fashion in musical theatre , consciously adopting the styles of musical comedy , lightening his orchestration , but maintaining a Gallic flavour , mostly avoiding American dance @-@ rhythm influences . He collaborated with Yvonne Printemps and Sacha Guitry on the musical comedies <unk> ( which he dedicated to the memory of Fauré ) , and L 'amour masqué . In his late operettas , his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of the nineteenth century , with hints of Fauré and , particularly , Chabrier 's L 'Etoile . 
 In 1924 Diaghilev persuaded Messager to conduct the Paris premieres of Auric 's ballet Les <unk> and Poulenc 's Les Biches . In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important updates to copyright law , though he was on the losing side of the case . He sued the BBC for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his consent . He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to George Edwardes , whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast . The case established that as the broadcasting rights had not been specifically reserved , the Edwardes estate 's rights included them . 
 Messager died in 1929 after a short illness and was interred in the Passy Cemetery . Coups de roulis was running in Paris when he died . One critic commented , " Its tuneful melodies show that the veteran composer had lost nothing of the qualities that made Véronique such a success . Throughout his life Messager remained without a peer as a composer of light music . " 
 = = = Honours , awards and reputation = = = 
 Messager was elected President of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques in 1926 , the first composer to hold this office . In the same year he was elected to the Académie des Beaux Arts . In 1927 he was appointed Commander of the Légion d 'honneur . In his native town of <unk> , the new music academy , opened in 2009 , is named the Conservatoire André Messager . 
 = = Music = = 
 The biographer John Wagstaff writes that Messager 's music is notable for its fine orchestration , easy @-@ flowing melody , and skilfully written music , dance @-@ like in character . Messager 's operettas are in the tradition of Offenbach , Hervé and Lecocq , and some saw him as the last of their line . Wagstaff quotes Messager 's biographer and pupil Henry Février : " La Basoche was the last great French opéra comique of the 19th century , and Messager ’ s next <unk> , especially Les p ’ <unk> Michu and Véronique , certainly show a difference in style from the earlier works , bringing an altogether fresher approach to the genre . " Although , as Wagstaff notes , Messager ’ s contribution to French music as a composer was recognised by his musical contemporaries internationally , his fame as a composer of light music has tended to obscure his considerable standing in contemporary serious musical circles . The leading composers of the time valued his friendship and advice . Fauré said of him , " familiar with everything , knowing it all , fascinated by anything new " . Messager 's younger colleague , the composer Reynaldo Hahn , wrote , " I doubt if any musician has ever loved music as much as André Messager did . It would simply be impossible to have wider musical interests than he did . Right up to the end of his life too . " 
 Baker 's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians says of Messager , " His style may be described as enlightened eclecticism ; his music was characteristically French , and more specifically Parisian , in its elegance and gaiety . " The English musicologist Gervase Hughes wrote , " He combined melodic richness and economy of means with the fluid grace of Jules Massenet , the aristocratic elegance of Camille Saint @-@ Saëns and the refined subtlety of Gabriel Fauré " . 
 = = = Recordings = = = 
 Messager 's career lasted into the beginning of the recording era . In New York in November 1918 , with the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra , he recorded Les <unk> and Cortège de Bacchus from Sylvia by Delibes , Sérénade and Mules from Impressions d 'Italie by Charpentier , the Bacchanale from Samson et Dalila and the Prelude to Le <unk> , both by Saint @-@ Saëns , and 4 ½ <unk> extracts from Capriccio Espagnol by Rimsky @-@ Korsakov and from Le Rouet d 'Omphale by Saint @-@ Saëns . 
 Of Messager 's works performed by other artists , there are complete recordings of several of his operas , and extracts from others . There have been two complete sets of Véronique – a 1953 Decca mono recording conducted by Pierre <unk> , and a 1969 stereo EMI recording conducted by Jean @-@ Claude <unk> . Other complete sets of Messager operas include L 'amour masqué ( 1970 ; conductor , Raymond Legrand ) , La Basoche ( 1960 ; Tony Aubin ) , Coups de roulis ( 1963 ; Marcel <unk> ) , Fortunio ( 1987 ; John Eliot Gardiner ) , <unk> ( 1947 ; Louis <unk> ) , Monsieur Beaucaire ( 1958 ; Jules <unk> ) , and <unk> ( 1964 ; Jean @-@ Paul Kreder ) . 
 Singers who have recorded individual numbers from Messager 's operas include role creators such as Jean Périer ( Véronique ) , Lucien <unk> ( La <unk> ) , Pierre <unk> and Yvonne Printemps ( L 'amour masqué ) , Koval ( <unk> ) , Marcelle <unk> ( Coups de roulis ) , and Maggie Teyte ( Monsieur Beaucaire ) , as well as other contemporaries Aino <unk> , Emma Eames , and John McCormack whose recordings have been reissued on compact disc . Singers of the next generation who recorded Messager numbers included Georges Thill and Ninon <unk> . More recent singers who have recorded numbers from Messager 's operas include <unk> <unk> , Susan Graham , Felicity Lott and Anna Netrebko . 
 Of Messager 's non @-@ operatic works , his Messe des pêcheurs de <unk> , written jointly with Fauré , has been recorded by Harmonia Mundi , conducted by Philippe Herreweghe ( 1989 ) . Messager 's other collaboration with Fauré , the Wagner send @-@ up Souvenirs de Bayreuth , has been recorded by several piano <unk> , including Kathryn Stott and Martin Roscoe ( 1995 , Hyperion ) , and Patrick de Hooge and Pierre @-@ Alain <unk> ( 2000 , Naxos ) . A suite from Les deux pigeons has been recorded several times , and in 1993 Decca recorded the complete score , with the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera conducted by Richard Bonynge .

 = Concussion = 
 Concussion , from the Latin <unk> ( " to shake violently " ) or <unk> ( " action of striking together " ) , is the most common type of traumatic brain injury . The terms mild brain injury , mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) , mild head injury ( MHI ) , minor head trauma , and concussion may be used interchangeably , although the last is often treated as a narrower category . Although the term " concussion " is still used in sports literature as interchangeable with " MHI " or " MTBI " , the general clinical medical literature now uses " MTBI " instead . In this article , " concussion " and " MTBI " are used interchangeably . Frequently defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function , concussion causes a variety of physical , cognitive , and emotional symptoms , which may not be recognized if subtle . 
 Treatment involves monitoring as well as physical and cognitive rest ( reduction of such activities as school work , playing video games and text messaging ) . Symptoms usually resolve within three weeks , though they may persist or complications may occur . 
 Those who have had one concussion seem more susceptible to another , especially if the new injury occurs before symptoms from the previous concussion have completely resolved . There is also a negative progressive process in which smaller impacts cause the same symptom severity . Repeated concussions may increase the risk in later life for dementia , Parkinson 's disease , and / or depression . 
 A variety of signs accompany concussion including somatic ( such as headache ) , cognitive ( such as feeling in a fog ) , emotional ( such as emotional <unk> ) , physical signs ( such as loss of consciousness or amnesia ) , behavioral changes ( such as irritability ) , cognitive impairment ( such as slowed reaction times ) , and / or sleep disturbances . Fewer than 10 % of sports @-@ related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness . 
 Due to varying definitions and possible underreporting , the rate at which concussion occurs annually is not accurately known , but is estimated to be more than 6 per 1 @,@ 000 people . Common causes include sports injuries , bicycle accidents , car accidents , and falls , the latter two being the most frequent causes among adults . In addition to a blow to the head , concussion may be caused by acceleration forces without a direct impact , and on the battlefield , MTBI is a potential consequence of nearby explosions . 
 It is not clear exactly what damage is done and how the symptoms are caused , but stretching of axons and changes in ion channels are involved . Cellular damage has reportedly been found in concussed brains , but it may have been due to artifacts from the studies . It is currently thought that structural and neuropsychiatric factors may both be responsible for the effects of concussion . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Concussion is associated with a variety of symptoms , which typically occur rapidly after the injury . Early symptoms usually subside within days or weeks . The number and type of symptoms any one individual suffers varies widely . 
 = = = Physical = = = 
 Headache is the most common MTBI symptom . Others include dizziness , vomiting , nausea , lack of motor coordination , difficulty balancing , or other problems with movement or sensation . Visual symptoms include light sensitivity , seeing bright lights , blurred vision , and double vision . Tinnitus , or a ringing in the ears , is also commonly reported . In one in about seventy concussions , concussive convulsions occur , but seizures that take place during or immediately after concussion are not ' post @-@ traumatic seizures ' , and , unlike post @-@ traumatic seizures , are not predictive of post @-@ traumatic epilepsy , which requires some form of structural brain damage , not just a momentary disruption in normal brain functioning . Concussive convulsions are thought to result from temporary loss or inhibition of motor function , and are not associated either with epilepsy or with more serious structural damage . They are not associated with any particular sequelae , and have the same high rate of favorable outcomes as concussions without convulsions . 
 = = = Cognitive and emotional = = = 
 Cognitive symptoms include confusion , disorientation , and difficulty focusing attention . Loss of consciousness may occur , but is not necessarily correlated with the severity of the concussion if it is brief . Post @-@ traumatic amnesia , in which events following the injury cannot be recalled , is a hallmark of concussion . Confusion , another concussion hallmark , may be present immediately or may develop over several minutes . A person may repeat the same questions , be slow to respond to questions or directions , have a vacant stare , or have slurred or incoherent speech . Other MTBI symptoms include changes in sleeping patterns and difficulty with reasoning , concentrating , and performing everyday activities . 
 Concussion can result in changes in mood including <unk> , loss of interest in favorite activities or items , <unk> , and displays of emotion that are inappropriate to the situation . Common symptoms in concussed children include restlessness , lethargy , and irritability . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid , which protects it from light trauma . More severe impacts , or the forces associated with rapid acceleration , may not be absorbed by this cushion . Concussion may be caused by impact forces , in which the head strikes or is struck by something , or impulsive forces , in which the head moves without itself being subject to blunt trauma ( for example , when the chest hits something and the head snaps forward ) . 
 Forces may cause linear , rotational , or angular movement of the brain , or a combination of them . In rotational movement , the head turns around its center of gravity , and in angular movement it turns on an axis not through its center of gravity . The amount of rotational force is thought to be the major component in concussion and its severity . Studies with athletes have shown that the amount of force and the location of the impact are not necessarily correlated with the severity of the concussion or its symptoms , and have called into question the threshold for concussion previously thought to exist at around 70 – 75g . 
 The parts of the brain most affected by rotational forces are the midbrain and diencephalon . It is thought that the forces from the injury disrupt the normal cellular activities in the reticular activating system located in these areas , and that this disruption produces the loss of consciousness often seen in concussion . Other areas of the brain that may be affected include the upper part of the brain stem , the <unk> , the corpus callosum , the temporal lobe , and the frontal lobe . Angular accelerations of 4600 , 5900 , or 7900 radian / s2 are estimated to have 25 , 50 , or 80 % risk of MTBI respectively . 
 = = = Pathophysiology = = = 
 In both animals and humans , MTBI can alter the brain 's physiology for hours to years , setting into motion a variety of pathological events . As one example , in animal models , after an initial increase in glucose metabolism , there is a subsequent reduced metabolic state which may persist for up to four weeks after injury . Though these events are thought to interfere with neuronal and brain function , the metabolic processes that follow concussion are reversible in a large majority of affected brain cells ; however , a few cells may die after the injury . 
 Included in the cascade of events unleashed in the brain by concussion is impaired neurotransmission , loss of regulation of ions , deregulation of energy use and cellular metabolism , and a reduction in cerebral blood flow . <unk> neurotransmitters , chemicals such as glutamate that serve to stimulate nerve cells , are released in excessive amounts . The resulting cellular excitation causes neurons to fire excessively . This creates an imbalance of ions such as potassium and calcium across the cell membranes of neurons ( a process like excitotoxicity ) . 
 At the same time , cerebral blood flow is relatively reduced for unknown reasons , though the reduction in blood flow is not as severe as it is in ischemia . Thus cells get less glucose than they normally do , which causes an " energy crisis " . 
 Concurrently with these processes , the activity of mitochondria may be reduced , which causes cells to rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy , increasing levels of the byproduct lactate . 
 For a period of minutes to days after a concussion , the brain is especially vulnerable to changes in intracranial pressure , blood flow , and anoxia . According to studies performed on animals ( which are not always applicable to humans ) , large numbers of neurons can die during this period in response to slight , normally innocuous changes in blood flow . 
 Concussion involves diffuse ( as opposed to focal ) brain injury , meaning that the dysfunction occurs over a widespread area of the brain rather than in a particular spot . It is thought to be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury , because axons may be injured to a minor extent due to stretching . Animal studies in which primates were concussed have revealed damage to brain tissues such as small petechial hemorrhages and axonal injury . <unk> damage has been found in the brains of concussion sufferers who died from other causes , but inadequate blood flow to the brain due to other injuries may have contributed . Findings from a study of the brains of deceased NFL athletes who received concussions suggest that lasting damage is done by such injuries . This damage , the severity of which increases with the cumulative number of concussions sustained , can lead to a variety of other health issues . 
 The debate over whether concussion is a functional or structural phenomenon is ongoing . Structural damage has been found in the mildly traumatically injured brains of animals , but it is not clear whether these findings would apply to humans . Such changes in brain structure could be responsible for certain symptoms such as visual disturbances , but other sets of symptoms , especially those of a psychological nature , are more likely to be caused by reversible pathophysiological changes in cellular function that occur after concussion , such as alterations in neurons ' biochemistry . These reversible changes could also explain why dysfunction is frequently temporary . A task force of head injury experts called the Concussion In Sport Group met in 2001 and decided that " concussion may result in neuropathological changes but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury . " 
 In summary , and extrapolating from animal studies , the pathology of a concussion seems to start with the disruption of the cell membrane of nerve cells . This results in a migration of potassium from within the cell into the extracellular space with subsequent release of glutamate which potentiates further potassium shift , in turn resulting in depolarization and suppression of nerve activity . In an effort to restore ion balance , the sodium @-@ potassium ion pumps increase activity , which results in excessive ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) consumption and glucose utilization . Lactate accumulates but , paradoxically , cerebral blood flow decreases , which leads to a proposed " energy crisis . " After this increase in glucose metabolism , there is a subsequent lower metabolic state which may persist for up to 4 weeks after injury . A completely separate pathway involves a large amount of calcium accumulating in cells , which may impair oxidative metabolism and begin further biochemical pathways that result in cell death . Again , both of these main pathways have been established from animal studies and the extent to which they apply to humans is still somewhat unclear . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Head trauma recipients are initially assessed to exclude a more severe emergency such as an intracranial hemorrhage . This includes the " ABCs " ( airway , breathing , circulation ) and stabilization of the cervical spine which is assumed to be injured in any athlete who is found to be unconscious after head or neck injury . Indications that screening for more serious injury is needed include worsening of symptoms such as headache , persistent vomiting , increasing disorientation or a deteriorating level of consciousness , seizures , and unequal pupil size . Those with such symptoms , or those who are at higher risk for a more serious brain injury , may undergo brain imaging to detect lesions and are frequently observed for 24 – 48 hours . A brain CT or brain MRI should be avoided unless there are progressive neurological symptoms , focal neurological findings or concern of skull fracture on exam . 
 Diagnosis of MTBI is based on physical and neurological examination findings , duration of unconsciousness ( usually less than 30 minutes ) and post @-@ traumatic amnesia ( PTA ; usually less than 24 hours ) , and the Glasgow Coma Scale ( MTBI sufferers have scores of 13 to 15 ) . Neuropsychological tests exist to measure cognitive function and the international consensus meeting in Zurich recommended the use of the <unk> test . Such tests may be administered hours , days , or weeks after the injury , or at different times to demonstrate any trend . Increasingly , athletes are also being tested pre @-@ season to provide a baseline for comparison in the event of an injury , though this may not reduce risk or affect return to play . 
 If the Glasgow Coma Scale is less than 15 at two hours , or less than 14 at any time , a CT is recommended . In addition , a CT scan is more likely to be performed if observation after discharge is not assured or intoxication is present , there is suspected increased risk for bleeding , age greater than 60 , or less than 16 . Most concussions , without complication , cannot be detected with MRI or CT scans . However , changes have been reported on MRI and SPECT imaging in those with concussion and normal CT scans , and post @-@ concussion syndrome may be associated with abnormalities visible on SPECT and PET scans . Mild head injury may or may not produce abnormal EEG readings . 
 Concussion may be under @-@ diagnosed because of the lack of the highly noticeable signs and symptoms while athletes may minimize their injuries to remain in the competition . A retrospective survey in 2005 suggested that more than 88 % of concussions are unrecognized . 
 Diagnosis can be complex because concussion shares symptoms with other conditions . For example , post @-@ concussion symptoms such as cognitive problems may be misattributed to brain injury when , in fact , due to post @-@ traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 No single definition of concussion , minor head injury , or mild traumatic brain injury is universally accepted . In 2001 , the expert Concussion in Sport Group of the first International Symposium on Concussion in Sport defined concussion as " a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain , induced by traumatic biomechanical forces . " It was agreed that concussion typically involves temporary impairment of neurological function that heals by itself within time , and that neuroimaging normally shows no gross structural changes to the brain as the result of the condition . 
 However , although no structural brain damage occurs according to the classic definition , some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain 's synapses . Also , by definition , concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness . However , the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness , such as amnesia , although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs . This debate resurfaces in some of the best @-@ known concussion grading scales , in which those episodes involving loss of consciousness are graded as being more severe than those without . 
 Definitions of mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) were inconsistent until the World Health Organization 's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ( ICD @-@ 10 ) provided a consistent , authoritative definition across specialties in 1992 . Since then , various organizations such as the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders have defined MTBI using some combination of loss of consciousness ( LOC ) , post @-@ traumatic amnesia ( PTA ) , and the Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) . 
 Concussion falls under the classification of mild TBI , but it is not clear whether concussion is implied in mild brain injury or mild head injury . " MTBI " and " concussion " are often treated as synonyms in medical literature but other injuries such as intracranial hemorrhages ( e.g. intra @-@ axial hematoma , epidural hematoma , and subdural hematoma ) are not necessarily precluded in MTBI or mild head injury , as they are in concussion . MTBI associated with abnormal neuroimaging may be considered " complicated MTBI " . " Concussion " can be considered to imply a state in which brain function is temporarily impaired and " MTBI " to imply a pathophysiological state , but in practice few researchers and clinicians distinguish between the terms . Descriptions of the condition , including the severity and the area of the brain affected , are now used more often than " concussion " in clinical neurology . 
 = = = Grading systems = = = 
 At least 41 systems measure the severity , or grade , of a mild head injury , and there is little agreement about which is best . In an effort to simplify , the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport , meeting in Prague in 2004 , decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a ' simple ' or ' complex ' classification . However , the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology , although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most ( 80 – 90 % ) concussions resolve in a short period ( 7 – 10 days ) , and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents . 
 In the past , the decision to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion . However , current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers ' Association recommend against such use of these grading systems . Currently , injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom @-@ free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre @-@ injury levels . 
 Three grading systems have been most widely followed : by Robert <unk> , the Colorado Medical Society , and the American Academy of Neurology . Each employs three grades , as summarized in the following table : 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Prevention of MTBI involves general measures such as wearing seat belts and using airbags in cars . Older people are encouraged to reduce fall risk by keeping floors free of clutter and wearing thin , flat , shoes with hard soles that do not interfere with balance . 
 Protective equipment such as headgear has been found to reduce the number of concussions in athletes and improvements in the design of helmets may decrease the number and severity further . New " Head Impact Telemetry System " technology is being placed in helmets to study injury mechanisms and may generate knowledge that will potentially help reduce the risk of concussions among American Football players . Changes to the rules or enforcing existing rules in sports , such as those against " head @-@ down tackling " , or " spearing " , which is associated with a high injury rate , may also prevent concussions . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 After exclusion of neck injury , observation should be continued for several hours . If repeated vomiting , worsening headache , dizziness , seizure activity , excessive drowsiness , double vision , slurred speech , unsteady walk , or weakness or numbness in arms or legs , or signs of basilar skull fracture develop , immediate assessment in an emergency department is warranted . After this initial period has passed , there is debate as to whether it is necessary to awaken the person several times during the first night , as has traditionally been done , or whether there is more benefit from uninterrupted sleep . 
 Physical and cognitive rest should be continued until all symptoms have resolved with most ( 80 – 90 % ) concussions resolving in seven to ten days , although the recovery time may be longer in children and adolescents . Cognitive rest includes reducing activities which require concentration and attention such as school work , video games , and text messaging . It has been suggested that even leisure reading can commonly worsen symptoms in children and adolescents and proposals include time off from school and attending partial days . Since students may appear ' normal ' , continuing education of relevant school personnel may be needed . 
 Those with concussion are generally prescribed rest , including adequate nighttime sleep as well as daytime rest . Rest includes both physical and cognitive rest until symptoms clear and a gradual return to normal activities at a pace that does not cause symptoms to worsen is recommended . Education about symptoms , their management , and their normal time course , can lead to an improved outcome . 
 For persons participating in athletics , the 2008 Zurich Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport recommends that participants be symptom free before restarting and then progress through a series of graded steps . These steps include : 
 complete physical and cognitive rest 
 light aerobic activity ( less than 70 % of maximum heart rate ) 
 sport @-@ specific activities such as running drills and skating drills 
 non @-@ contact training drills ( exercise , coordination , and cognitive load ) 
 full @-@ contact practice 
 full @-@ contact games . 
 Only when symptom @-@ free for 24 hours , should progression to the next step occur . If symptoms occur , the person should drop back to the previous asymptomatic level for at least another 24 hours . The emphasis is on remaining symptom free and taking it in medium steps , not on the steps themselves . 
 Medications may be prescribed to treat sleep problems and depression . Analgesics such as ibuprofen can be taken for headache , but paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) is preferred to minimize the risk of intracranial hemorrhage . <unk> individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing . Activation database @-@ guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group . 
 About one percent of people who receive treatment for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury . Observation to monitor for worsening condition is an important part of treatment . Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72 hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen . Athletes , especially intercollegiate or professional , are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring . 
 People may be released after assessment from hospital or emergency room to the care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening symptoms or those that might indicate an emergent condition such as : change in consciousness , convulsions , severe headache , extremity weakness , vomiting , new bleeding or deafness in either or both ears . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 People who have had a concussion seem more susceptible to another one , particularly if the new injury occurs before symptoms from the previous concussion have completely gone away . It is also a negative process if smaller impacts cause the same symptom severity . Repeated concussions may increase a person 's risk in later life for dementia , Parkinson 's disease , and depression . 
 MTBI has a mortality rate of almost zero . The symptoms of most concussions resolve within weeks , but problems may persist . These are seldom permanent , and outcome is usually excellent . The overall prognosis for recovery may be influenced by a variety of factors that include age at the time of injury , intellectual abilities , family environment , social support system , occupational status , coping strategies , and financial circumstances . People over age 55 may take longer to heal from MTBI or may heal incompletely . Similarly , factors such as a previous head injury or a coexisting medical condition have been found to predict longer @-@ lasting post @-@ concussion symptoms . Other factors that may lengthen recovery time after MTBI include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression , poor health before the injury or additional injuries sustained during it , and life stress . Longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual symptoms . For unknown reasons , having had one concussion significantly increases a person 's risk of having another . Having previously sustained a sports concussion has been found to be a strong factor increasing the likelihood of a concussion in the future . Other strong factors include participation in a contact sport and body mass size . The prognosis may differ between concussed adults and children ; little research has been done on concussion in the pediatric population , but concern exists that severe concussions could interfere with brain development in children . 
 A 2009 study found that individuals with a history of concussions might demonstrate a decline in both physical and mental performance for longer than 30 years . Compared to their peers with no history of brain trauma , sufferers of concussion exhibited effects including loss of episodic memory and reduced muscle speed . 
 = = = Post @-@ concussion syndrome = = = 
 In post @-@ concussion syndrome , symptoms do not resolve for weeks , months , or years after a concussion , and may occasionally be permanent . About 10 % to 20 % of people have post concussion syndrome for more than a month . Symptoms may include headaches , dizziness , fatigue , anxiety , memory and attention problems , sleep problems , and irritability . There is no scientifically established treatment , and rest , a recommended recovery technique , has limited effectiveness . Symptoms usually go away on their own within months . The question of whether the syndrome is due to structural damage or other factors such as psychological ones , or a combination of these , has long been the subject of debate . 
 = = = Cumulative effects = = = 
 Cumulative effects of concussions are poorly understood , with this being even more true in children . The severity of concussions and their symptoms may worsen with successive injuries , even if a subsequent injury occurs months or years after an initial one . Symptoms may be more severe and changes in neurophysiology can occur with the third and subsequent concussions . Studies have had conflicting findings on whether athletes have longer recovery times after repeat concussions and whether cumulative effects such as impairment in cognition and memory occur . 
 Cumulative effects may include psychiatric disorders and loss of long @-@ term memory . For example , the risk of developing clinical depression has been found to be significantly greater for retired American football players with a history of three or more concussions than for those with no concussion history . Three or more concussions is also associated with a fivefold greater chance of developing Alzheimer 's disease earlier and a threefold greater chance of developing memory deficits . 
 = = = CTE = = = 
 Chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or " CTE " , is an example of the cumulative damage that can occur as the result of multiple concussions or less severe blows to the head . The condition was previously referred to as " dementia <unk> " , or " punch drunk " syndrome , as it was first noted in boxers . The disease can lead to cognitive and physical handicaps such as parkinsonism , speech and memory problems , slowed mental processing , tremor , depression , and inappropriate behavior . It shares features with Alzheimer 's disease . 
 = = = Second @-@ impact syndrome = = = 
 Second @-@ impact syndrome , in which the brain swells dangerously after a minor blow , may occur in very rare cases . The condition may develop in people who receive a second blow days or weeks after an initial concussion , before its symptoms have gone away . No one is certain of the cause of this often fatal complication , but it is commonly thought that the swelling occurs because the brain 's arterioles lose the ability to regulate their diameter , causing a loss of control over cerebral blood flow . As the brain swells , intracranial pressure rapidly rises . The brain can herniate , and the brain stem can fail within five minutes . Except in boxing , all cases have occurred in athletes under age 20 . Due to the very small number of documented cases , the diagnosis is controversial , and doubt exists about its validity . A 2010 Pediatrics review article stated that there is debate whether the brain swelling is due to two separate hits or to just one hit , but in either case , catastrophic football head injuries are three times more likely in high school athletes than in college athletes . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Most cases of traumatic brain injury are concussions . A World Health Organization ( WHO ) study estimated that between 70 and 90 % of head injuries that receive treatment are mild . However , due to underreporting and to the widely varying definitions of concussion and MTBI , it is difficult to estimate how common the condition is . Estimates of the incidence of concussion may be artificially low , for example due to underreporting . At least 25 % of MTBI sufferers fail to get assessed by a medical professional . The WHO group reviewed studies on the epidemiology of MTBI and found a hospital treatment rate of 1 – 3 per 1000 people , but since not all concussions are treated in hospitals , they estimated that the rate per year in the general population is over 6 per 1000 people . 
 Young children have the highest concussion rate among all age groups . However , most people who suffer concussion are young adults . A Canadian study found that the yearly incidence of MTBI is lower in older age groups ( graph at right ) . Studies suggest males suffer MTBI at about twice the rate of their female counterparts . However , female athletes may be at a higher risk for suffering concussion than their male counterparts . 
 Up to five percent of sports injuries are concussions . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 300 @,@ 000 sports @-@ related concussions occur yearly in the U.S. , but that number includes only athletes who lost consciousness . Since loss of consciousness is thought to occur in less than 10 % of concussions , the CDC estimate is likely lower than the real number . Sports in which concussion is particularly common include football and boxing ( a boxer aims to " knock out " , i.e. give a mild traumatic brain injury to , the opponent ) . The injury is so common in the latter that several medical groups have called for a ban on the sport , including the American Academy of Neurology , the World Medical Association , and the medical associations of the UK , the U.S. , Australia , and Canada . 
 Due to the lack of a consistent definition , the economic costs of MTBI are not known , but they are estimated to be very high . These high costs are due in part to the large percentage of hospital admissions for head injury that are due to mild head trauma , but indirect costs such as lost work time and early retirement account for the bulk of the costs . These direct and indirect costs cause the expense of mild brain trauma to rival that of moderate and severe head injuries . 
 = = History = = 
 The Hippocratic Corpus , collection of medical works from ancient Greece , mentions concussion , later translated to <unk> cerebri , and discusses loss of speech , hearing and sight that can result from " commotion of the brain " . This idea of disruption of mental function by " shaking of the brain " remained the widely accepted understanding of concussion until the 19th century . The Persian physician Muhammad ibn <unk> <unk> was the first to write about concussion as distinct from other types of head injury in the 10th century AD . He may have been the first to use the term " cerebral concussion " , and his definition of the condition , a transient loss of function with no physical damage , set the stage for the medical understanding of the condition for centuries . In the 13th century , the physician Lanfranc of Milan 's <unk> Magna described concussion as brain " commotion " , also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury ( though many of his contemporaries did not ) , and discussing the transience of post @-@ concussion symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from the injury . In the 14th century , the surgeon Guy de <unk> pointed out the relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as skull fractures and penetrating head trauma . In the 16th century , the term " concussion " came into use , and symptoms such as confusion , lethargy , and memory problems were described . The 16th century physician Ambroise Paré used the term <unk> cerebri , as well as " shaking of the brain " , " commotion " , and " concussion " . 
 Until the 17th century , concussion was usually described by its clinical features , but after the invention of the microscope , more physicians began exploring underlying physical and structural mechanisms . However , the prevailing view in the 17th century was that the injury did not result from physical damage , and this view continued to be widely held throughout the 18th century . The word " concussion " was used at the time to describe the state of unconsciousness and other functional problems that resulted from the impact , rather than a physiological condition . 
 In 1839 , Guillaume Dupuytren described brain contusions , which involve many small hemorrhages , as <unk> cerebri and showed the difference between unconsciousness associated with damage to the brain parenchyma and that due to concussion , without such injury . In 1941 , animal experiments showed that no macroscopic damage occurs in concussion .

 Measurement of predictive visual tracking is being studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury . A head @-@ mounted display unit with eye @-@ tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern for the person to follow with their eyes . People without brain injury will be able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those with mild traumatic brain injury cannot . 
 = 2008 Astana season = 
 The 2008 season for the Astana cycling team began in January with the Tour Down Under and ended in October with the Giro di Lombardia . As a UCI ProTour team , they were automatically invited and obliged to attend every event in the UCI ProTour . 
 Astana changed drastically between the 2007 and 2008 seasons , with its former manager Marc <unk> replaced by Johan Bruyneel from the dissolved Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team . Following Bruyneel to Astana were several riders from that team , including Alberto Contador and Levi Leipheimer , who had finished first and third , respectively , in the 2007 Tour de France for Discovery . Numerous riders also left the team , including Matthias Kessler , Andrey Kashechkin , and Alexander Vinokourov , who had all tested positive for doping . 
 The team 's biggest successes in 2008 were the overall victories by Contador in the Giro d 'Italia and the Vuelta a España . As the team was barred from competing in the Tour de France that year , as well as other events organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation , Contador was unable to defend his championship from the year before . 
 Just as the team 's competitive season was nearing its end , Lance Armstrong announced that he planned to return to competitive cycling in 2009 after a four @-@ year absence . As Bruyneel was Armstrong 's team manager for all seven of his Tour de France victories , there was much speculation immediately that Armstrong would sign with Astana in his comeback , which he eventually did .

 By their own admission , Astana does not aim for the classics . The team first participated in Omloop Het Volk on March 1 , with Dmitriy Muravyev in 31st their best @-@ placed rider . Sergei Ivanov 's 7th in the Amstel Gold Race proved to be one of the team 's best results all season , as in the other spring races in which they competed , Kuurne – Brussels – Kuurne , the Tour of Flanders , and Gent – Wevelgem , they did not have a rider place higher than 13th . Due in part to the ban imposed by the Amaury Sport Organisation from participating in races they organized , the team did not compete in Milan – San Remo , Paris – Roubaix , La Flèche Wallonne , Liège – Bastogne – Liège , or other races in which a team of their caliber would normally take part . In March , Tomas Vaitkus earned the team 's lone one @-@ day victory of the spring season , winning a sprint finish to the Ronde van het <unk> Hart . 
 = = = Fall races = = = 
 The team entered the Clásica de San Sebastián in August , with Contador in 26th their highest @-@ placed finisher . Contador , like many riders in the event , rode it as preparation for the road cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games . Astana also took part in Vattenfall Cyclassics , the Coppa Sabatini , Paris – Bourges , the Giro dell 'Emilia , the Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli , Milano – Torino , and the Giro del Piemonte in September and October , but did not obtain a place higher than 11th ( by Janez Brajkovič in the Giro dell 'Emilia ) . In August , Leipheimer and Contador took the top two spots in the Clásica a los <unk> de Guadarrama , a race they rode as preparation for the Vuelta a España . 
 In the Giro di Lombardia , Astana 's final race of the season , they were more successful than they had been most of the season , attaining a fourth podium finish in a one @-@ day race on the year . While Damiano Cunego had broken away from the field with 15 kilometers left to race to win the event , Brajkovič won a sprint over Caisse d 'Epargne 's Rigoberto Urán for second , and reacted as though he won the race . Chris Horner was also highly placed in the event , finishing seventh . 
 = = Stage races = = 
 Astana attended the Tour Down Under for the first time in 2008 , as it was the first year the event was part of the UCI ProTour . The team was not very competitive in the event , with a fifth place in a sprint finish to Stage 2 from Aaron Kemps as their best stage result . They also led the teams classification after that stage . The team 's best @-@ placed rider in the final overall classification was José Luis Rubiera , ranked 31st . The team then attended the Tour of California in February . Leipheimer was the team leader for the event , as he was the defending champion from 2007 with Team Discovery . Leipheimer assumed the race lead after Stage 3 , having worked with Rabobank rider Robert Gesink to gain time on the peloton with Gesink claiming the stage win and Leipheimer the overall lead . Leipheimer padded his lead by winning the individual time trial in Solvang two days later and held on to win the Tour itself for the second straight year . While the Tour of California was ongoing , Astana sent another squad to the Volta ao Algarve , with Tomas Vaitkus claiming a win in Stage 2 . Rubiera was the victor in early March of the queen stage of the Vuelta a Murcia , a stage which the peloton almost refused to race because of the weather and safety conditions . 
 With the team <unk> from Paris – Nice and Tirreno – Adriatico , their next stage race was the Volta ao Distrito de Santarém , a race which neither Astana nor Discovery Channel had participated in the year before . The team did not win any stage , though Andreas Klöden finished on the event 's final podium , in third . Astana next entered the Vuelta a Castilla y León with a squad that was thought to greatly outclass the squads entered by other teams . Contador won the opening time trial and the mountainous fourth stage en route to winning the race overall . Leipheimer also showed well , finishing 4 seconds off Contador 's winning time in the time trial , and falling only on Stage 4 , where he rode in support of Contador , to finish in fourth overall . 
 In April , the team achieved great success in the Vuelta al País Vasco , with Contador winning the opening stage , which had seven categorized climbs , and the final individual time trial , to win the race overall . Just after the tour of the Basque country was the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey , an event in which Astana won a stage with Grégory Rast and the points classification with Assan Bazayev . Later in the month , the team sent a squad headed by Leipheimer and Chris Horner to the Tour de Georgia . They did not win any stage , but Leipheimer took third overall , and Antonio <unk> fourth . The team was greatly successful at the Tour de Romandie later in the month , with Maxim <unk> and Klöden both winning stages , and Klöden the race overall . In the Volta a Catalunya , which was concurrent to the Giro d 'Italia , the team did not win any stage , with Janez Brajkovič 's second in Stage 2 their closest result , though they did win the teams classification . 
 At the Tour de Luxembourg in June , Rast entered as defending champion and was considered among the favorites , but the team did not win any stage or finish on the podium . Leipheimer won the prologue time trial to the Dauphine Libéré later in the month , and wound up finishing third overall in the race . Klöden next took second overall in the Tour de Suisse , later in June . The following month , <unk> and Horner raced as Astana ( though they were the only Astana riders in the event ) at the Cascade Cycling Classic , and Leipheimer was able to take the overall win there , largely thanks to a convincing victory in the third stage time trial . On the same day , René <unk> won a stage in Tour of Austria . Later in the month , <unk> Ivanov won the Tour de Wallonie , without winning a stage . 
 The team sent squads to the Tour de Pologne , Tour de l 'Ain , Tour of Ireland , and the Eneco Tour , but did not obtain a stage win , classification win , or podium finish in any of them .

 = = = Giro d 'Italia = = = 
 Astana was at first not invited to the Giro . Six days before the race began , RCS Sport ( the organizers of the Giro ) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation . This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador , Leipheimer , and Klöden participating in the race . Having thought for two months prior that they would not compete in the Giro , most of Astana 's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy , and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro . 
 The team mostly lay low in the race 's first week and a half , with only fourth in a sprint from Assan Bazayev in Stage 4 and fifth in Stage 6 by Maxim Iglinsky from a breakaway to show for themselves through nine stages . Contador and Klöden both showed strongly in the Stage 10 individual time trial , with Contador missing the stage win by just 8 seconds ( Klöden was third , 20 seconds off Marzio Bruseghin 's winning time ) and moving from eighth to fourth in the overall classification . 
 The high mountain Stage 14 into the Italian Alps saw Contador rise to second overall , just five seconds behind race leader Gabriele Bosisio . The next day , Contador finished twelve minutes ahead of Bosisio and took the race leader 's pink jersey . His main rival at that point was Riccardo Riccò , who had gained 16 seconds on him that day and was only 33 back overall . Contador padded his lead over Riccò slightly in short time trial in Stage 16 , and stayed out of trouble in Stages 17 and 18 , stages where the contenders all finished together . The long and mountainous Stage 19 saw Riccò and Danilo Di Luca both put time into Contador with late attacks , but not enough to take the jersey from him . Di Luca found himself effected the next day , losing over five minutes and falling from contention , but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by just 4 seconds entering the Stage 21 time trial . Riccò was unable to challenge Contador in the Giro 's finale , finishing 68th on the stage and losing close to two minutes to Contador , who was 11th . Though neither Contador himself nor anyone from the team won any stage in the Giro , Contador took the overall victory in the General Classification . 
 = = = Vuelta a España = = = 
 Astana entered the Vuelta with Contador as a big favorite to win the overall title and complete the career sweep of the Grand Tours . Astana 's Vuelta actually began with a disappointment , an 8th @-@ place finish in the Stage 1 team time trial , which either they or CSC – Saxo Bank had been thought likeliest to win . After staying out of trouble in sprinters ' Stages 2 through 4 , Leipheimer won the Stage 5 individual time trial and Contador was fourth , 49 seconds back of him . This gave Leipheimer the race leader 's golden jersey by a margin of 2 seconds over Sylvain Chavanel . It was not a lead that Astana intended to defend the next day , however , as Chavanel 's Cofidis team drove the peloton to catch the morning breakaway in Stage 6 so Chavanel could get bonus seconds in intermediate sprints to take the jersey , which he did . 
 The next stage , after the first rest day , was the longest in the Vuelta and contained numerous mountain climbs . It was made even more difficult by a consistent downfall of rain and cold temperatures . Contador and Leipheimer both marked the competition and finished well on the stage , third and fifth respectively , to maintain their high overall placings . Leipheimer regained the race lead the next day essentially by default , as Alessandro Ballan , who had won the difficult Stage 7 , quickly faded on Stage 8 . Again Astana did not work to keep Leipheimer in the race lead , affording a breakaway that included Egoi Martínez sufficient time that Martínez took the golden jersey . The next day , several local newspapers criticized Astana for the move , as CSC – Saxo Bank and Caisse d 'Epargne had tried to pull the peloton such that Astana would have no choice to defend the jersey , but were unable to force their hand . Martínez reacted to his assumption of the race lead as though it were a gift from his former manager Bruyneel . 
 Following several stages won by sprinters and breakaways , the next test for the riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13 . The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes , but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent of what has been called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling . Astana and Caisse d 'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb , and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition . It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part , 7 kilometers from the finish . Contador indeed went on to win the stage , and took the race lead as well . Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera , and Contador won the sprint . 
 The top ten in the general classification finished together in the next five stages , which were mostly friendly to sprinters and breakaways . Stage 20 was another time trial , one with an uphill finish . This time trial was won convincingly by Leipheimer , as only Contador and Valverde were within a minute of his winning time . This ride put Leipheimer 46 seconds off Contador 's time . With the Vuelta 's final stage flat and largely ceremonial , akin to the Champs @-@ Élysées stage in the Tour de France , this stood as the final result , with Contador winning the Vuelta to complete his career triple ; he also won the combination classification and its white jersey . Minor controversy followed the Vuelta ; Contador alleged that Leipheimer was not being a team player by seeming to ride the Stage 20 time trial with the aim of winning the Vuelta , after Contador had apparently been decided as the team 's leader , though the team had not firmly chosen a leader as the race began .

 On February 13 , it was announced that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season , which included the Tour de France , Paris – Nice , and numerous one @-@ day races . The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons ; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France . The team reacted with surprise and disappointment , particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed , and as a result Contador would not be able to defend his Tour de France championship .

 On June 26 , the team fired Vladimir Gusev for " irregular values " given in an internal doping check as part of the program run by Dr. Rasmus <unk> , proprietor of a noted anti @-@ doping system previously used by Team CSC . Though the values did not by themselves confirm doping on Gusev 's part , they were taken as an indication of it . 
 The firing also caused Gusev to be removed from Russia 's team for the 2008 Olympic Games , though he originally intended to sue the team in time to still take part in the Olympics . 
 On September 1 , Gusev began his appeal of the firing , with the case eventually reaching the Court of Arbitration for Sport . On June 18 , 2009 , the CAS ruled that Astana was in the wrong regarding Gusev 's dismissal and ordered the team to pay his lost wages , legal fees , and compensatory damages .

 Seven @-@ time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong revealed in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine published on September 9 that he intended to return to competitive cycling in 2009 , after four years of retirement . Aside from trying to win an eighth Tour de France , his goal would be to raise public awareness and money for cancer research . He would ride for no salary . 
 It was speculated immediately that Armstrong would return with team Astana , as it was now headed by Armstrong 's sporting director from each of his seven Tour de France victories , Johan Bruyneel . 
 Though spokespeople for the team first denied any plans to sign Armstrong , Bruyneel commented two days later during the then @-@ ongoing Vuelta a España that he had spoken to Armstrong about his return , and could not imagine him riding for any team but Astana . On September 24 , Armstrong signed with Astana . 
 Armstrong 's return was not well received by Contador , who asserted that he had earned the right to be a team leader and said he would consider leaving the team if he were relegated to a role supporting Armstrong . 
 The team gave Contador assurances in the offseason that he would remain Astana 's team leader , and Contador remained with the team for 2009 , though the controversy over who would in fact be the team 's leader lasted well into the 2009 Tour de France .

 = Palace of Queluz = 
 The Palace of Queluz ( Portuguese : Palácio de Queluz , Portuguese pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is a Portuguese 18th @-@ century palace located at Queluz , a freguesia of the modern @-@ day Sintra Municipality , in the Lisbon District . One of the last great Rococo buildings to be designed in Europe , the palace was conceived as a summer retreat for Dom Pedro of Braganza , later to become husband and then king consort to his own niece , Queen Maria I. It served as a discreet place of incarceration for Queen Maria as her descent into madness continued in the years following Dom Pedro 's death in 1786 . Following the destruction by fire of the Ajuda Palace in 1794 , Queluz Palace became the official residence of the Portuguese prince regent , John VI , and his family and remained so until the Royal Family fled to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1807 following the French invasion of Portugal . 
 Work on the palace began in 1747 under the architect Mateus Vicente de Oliveira . Despite being far smaller , the palace is often referred to as the Portuguese Versailles . From 1826 , the palace slowly fell from favour with the Portuguese sovereigns . In 1908 , it became the property of the state . Following a serious fire in 1934 , which gutted the interior , the palace was extensively restored , and today is open to the public as a major tourist attraction . 
 One wing of the palace , the Pavilion of Dona Maria , built between 1785 and 1792 by the architect Manuel Caetano de Sousa , is now a guest house allocated to foreign heads of state visiting Portugal . 
 = = Architecture and history = = 
 Queluz 's architecture is representative of the final extravagant period of Portuguese culture that followed the discovery of Brazilian gold in 1690 . From the beginning of the 18th century many foreign artists and architects were employed in Portugal to satisfy the needs of the newly enriched aristocracy ; they brought with them classical ideas of architecture which derived from the Renaissance . In its design , Queluz is a revolt against the earlier , heavier , Italian @-@ influenced Baroque which preceded the Rococo style throughout Europe . 
 Comparisons with the far larger and more Baroque Versailles are unwarranted : Versailles is referred to as having " an aura of majesty " and it was built and dedicated to exhibit in stone " all the glories of France , " whereas the far smaller palace at Queluz has been described as " exquisite rather than magnificent " and looking like " a very expensive birthday cake " . In its frivolity , the architecture of Queluz reflects the lifestyle led by the Portuguese royal family at the time of building : during the reign of Dom Pedro 's brother , Joseph I , when Portugal was in practice governed by a <unk> or favourite , the Marquis of Pombal . Pombal encouraged the royal family to while away their days in the country and leave affairs of state to him . Thus the extravagant , almost whimsical architecture of Queluz , set apart from the capital city , exactly represents the politics and social events of Portugal during this era , and the carefree and flamboyant lives led by its occupants . Queluz 's role as a haven for those without responsibility was , however , to be short @-@ lived . 
 On the accession to the throne of Dom Pedro 's wife Maria in 1777 , Pombal was dismissed , and Dom Pedro and Maria ruled jointly in his place , using the partially completed Rococo palace at Queluz as a retreat from affairs of state in much the same way as Frederick the Great used Europe 's other famed Rococo palace , Sanssouci . 
 The site chosen for this summer retreat was in a secluded hollow . It had originally been owned by the Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo . When the ruling Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640 , the property was confiscated , and Rodrigo was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish . The estate and its hunting lodge then became one of the many properties of the Portuguese king , João IV . He set it aside as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch . Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro , the second son of João V. 
 The architect , Mateus Vicente de Oliveira , had trained under <unk> of Ratisbon and Jean Baptiste Robillon during the construction of the royal palace and convent of Mafra . The more sombre and massive classical palace at Mafra does not appear to have influenced the design for Queluz , which is in a lighter , more airy style . Work began in 1747 and continued rapidly until 1755 , when it was interrupted by the Great earthquake of 1755 , after which the labourers were more urgently required for the reconstruction of the city . The earthquake proved to be a catalyst , because the urban rebuilding process stimulated the development of the arts in Portugal . The subsequent architecture of Queluz was influenced by new ideas and concepts . When work recommenced in 1758 , the design was adapted for fear of another earthquake . Thus the later works take the form of low , long buildings , more structurally stable than a single high block : as a result , viewed from a distance the palace resembles long enfilades linked by higher pavilions rather than one single construction . 
 = = Exterior = = 
 The public façade of the palace faces directly onto a town square and takes the form of two low , symmetrical , quadrant wings which flank the forward @-@ reaching wings of a small central corps de logis , thus forming a semi @-@ circular cour d 'honneur ( see key 1 ) . The southern of the two quadrant wings is terminated by the onion @-@ domed chapel , while the northern wing contained the kitchens and servants ' quarters ( see keys 2 , 1 and 13 ) . The only decoration comes from the simple classical pediments above the windows . This façade , that most readily seen from the town , presents a decorous and impassive public face with one of the most architecturally severe elevations of the palace ( see illustration right ) . 
 Oliveira was directly responsible for the " Ceremonial Façade " of the " corps de logis " , the rectangular block which forms the nucleus of the palace , and some of the interior courtyards . His former tutor , the Frenchman Jean @-@ Baptiste Robillon , was in charge of the gardens , many buildings , and the Rococo interiors . He in turn was assisted by Jean @-@ Baptiste Pillement and other French and Portuguese artists . The " Ceremonial Façade " is the best @-@ known view of the palace . With classical proportions , it is externally decorated by travertine rendering and delicately carved cartouches over the windows . It has been described as a " harmonious example of Portuguese Baroque " . This façade with its single @-@ storey flanking wings forms a three @-@ sided courtyard containing the " Hanging Garden " — so called because like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon it is on a raised terrace ( see key 5 ) . 
 The second major part of the palace is the great western wing , known as the Robillon wing or Robillon Pavilion , which illustrates better than any other the excesses of Baroque and Rococo architecture ( see key 9 ) . Completed in 1779 , it has a doric colonnade which runs the entire length of its western and southern façades , the roof of which provides a balustraded balcony accessible from the floor above ( see key 10 ) . Owing to the topography of the site , the eastern side appears as a single @-@ storey building , with only the upper floor visible above the ground in the " Hanging Garden " . The balustrade on the roof of the Robillon wing is broken by heavy segmental pediments adorned with reclining statuary figures ; the balustrade itself is also adorned with <unk> , statuary and heavy armorial trophies ( see illustration below ) . 
 The Robillon wing contains an entrance to the palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps . Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective , centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site , and divided mid @-@ flight so as not to lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond . The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary ( see key 11 ) . The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose @-@ pink , contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone ( see illustration ) . 
 In 1760 , Pombal arranged for Dom Pedro to marry the king 's unstable daughter Maria , the heiress to the throne . Pombal encouraged the couple to live with their children in the unfinished palace at Queluz , away from the seat of government . It had always been a favourite retreat of the couple and was their principal home before Maria 's accession . Further enlargements were made to reflect the palace 's elevation from country retreat to royal palace . However , Maria had dismissed Pombal on her accession and , as a ruling monarch , she did not have time to while away her hours in the country . Dom Pedro interfered little in affairs of state , preferring to spend his time on religious matters . 
 By the death of Dom Pedro in 1786 , all the interior work was completed . This was fortunate , as from this period his widow 's mental health deteriorated , until in 1794 , she and her court took up official and full @-@ time residence at Queluz . There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the view of her subjects . Her eldest son , later King João VI , was appointed Regent and ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra . 
 In 2004 , the World Monuments Fund began a program to restore the lead sculptures by British sculptor John Cheere , as well as some of the other features of the garden . The project is ongoing . 
 = = Interior = = 
 The interior of the palace received no less attention to detail and design than the exterior . French artisans were employed to decorate the rooms , many of which are small , their walls and ceilings painted to depict allegorical and historical scenes . Polished red bricks were frequently used for the floors , for a rustic appearance as well as coolness in hot weather . The many tall pavilions which link the various lower wings of the palace allow for a series of long low rooms broken by higher and lighter rooms . A predominant feature of the interiors is the <unk> : polychrome glazed tiles , often in a chinoiserie style with tones of blues and yellows contrasting with muted reds . Materials for use on the interior included stone imported from Genoa and woods from Brazil , Denmark and Sweden , while coloured marbles were imported from Italy . Many of the palace 's rooms were severely damaged by fire in 1934 , and much was lost . 
 = = = The state apartments = = = 
 = = = = The Sala das <unk> = = = = 
 The Sala das <unk> ( the only room in the state apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire ) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels ( illustrated below ) . The gallery leads to the enfilade of state rooms , all of which have been fully restored . The formal rooms of the palace consist of three large halls : The Hall of Ambassadors , The Music Room and the Ball Room . Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room ( where hunting parties would assemble ) , which is a frescoed salon painted with trees and foliage by Pillement . 
 = = = = The Music Room = = = = 
 The Music Room ( illustrated below ) which follows the " Sala dos <unk> " is decorated with gilded and painted wood and was redesigned in 1768 . The ceiling inset with painted cartouches is notable for the intricate ribbed scheme of its design , similar to that of the vestibule at Caserta . The Music Room is decorated in a more neoclassical style than the other state rooms , reflecting its redesign in the period following the Baroque Rococo in the final half of the 18th century . This room was the setting for the large concerts for which the palace was famous . The room still contains the Empire grand piano decorated with gilt <unk> . Above the piano hangs a Image : Sala de <unk> Like many other rooms of the palace , the Music Room is lit by huge crystal chandeliers . 
 = = = = The Ball Room = = = = 
 The Ballroom , the last of the palace 's three largest rooms , ( illustrated below ) was designed by Robillon in 1760 . To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms . The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling , of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de <unk> ' <unk> at Schloss <unk> . The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded , coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids . 
 = = = = The Hall of Ambassadors = = = = 
 The Hall of Ambassadors ( " Sala dos <unk> " ) , sometimes called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors , was designed by Robillon in 1757 and is one of the largest reception rooms in the palace . This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light , spanning the full width of the palace , with tall windows on both sides . Between each window is a semi @-@ circular gilt console table above which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces . The throne dais , set in an apse , is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns , and the floor is a <unk> board pattern of black and white marble tiles . 
 = = = = The Chapel = = = = 
 During the occupancy of the palace by Dom Pedro and Maria I , the chapel was central to the daily routine of their court . It was no coincidence that the chapel was the first part of the palace to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752 . Religion was one of Dom Pedro 's favourite interests . During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal . The Queen 's interest in religion was , however , no less fevered than that of her husband — the couple attended mass several times a day . Following Dom Pedro 's death , the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace , and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies . Finally the Queen 's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity . Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil . She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816 . 
 The chapel beneath its large onion dome is dark and cavernous and decorated with carved <unk> , the detailing highlighted in red , green , blue and pink , by the Portuguese sculptor Silvestre Faria Lobo . The upper level has galleries for the use of royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation . One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ . A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable font , its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover . 
 = = = Private apartments = = = 
 The private rooms of the palace are far smaller and more intimate than the formal state rooms and contain many royal mementos and curios which belonged to the rooms ' former occupants . Amongst the more remarkable rooms in this suite are the Sala das <unk> , the Queen 's Boudoir and the King 's Bedroom . 
 = = = = Sala das <unk> = = = = 
 This was the royal family 's private dining room . The decoration continues the theme used in some of the more formal and public rooms , with tiled panels illustrating courtiers in sylvan poses . These panels , like much other work in the palace , were produced by João <unk> and José Conrado Rosa . 
 = = = = The Queen 's Boudoir = = = = 
 This was one of the private rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz . It is designed in the form of a bower , with a trellis pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor ( illustrated below ) , giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior . The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use . The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain <unk> and mirror <unk> by José Conrado Rosa . Next to the boudoir is the Queen 's bedroom ; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford , who visited the palace in 1794 . 
 = = = = The King 's Bedroom = = = = 
 The King 's Bedroom ( illustrated below ) has been described as one of the most " fantastic " rooms in the palace . Although actually square , it gives the illusion of being completely circular , with a domed ceiling supported by columns of mirrored glass . Between the columns are cartouches depicting scenes from the tales of Don Quixote . João VI died in this room in 1826 . The room contains a large bust of the King showing his " pendulous jowls and unattractive face " . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 Queluz is famed for the glory of its gardens , which include a large topiary parterre laid out in the manner of Le Nôtre at the rear of the palace ( see key 14 ) . The Flemish influences , including the canals , in the garden are the work of the Dutch gardener Gerald van der <unk> , who assisted Robillon from 1760 . Formal terraces and walkways are given extra interest by statuary and fountains . The dominant feature of the principal parterre is the " Portico dos <unk> " , a garden temple flanked by two allegorical equestrian statues depicting <unk> , and two sphinxes ( see final illustration ) <unk> dressed in 18th @-@ century costume , combining the formal and the fantastic . This surreal theme continues elsewhere in the gardens where such motifs as the rape of the Sabines and the death of Abel alternate with statuary of donkeys dressed in human clothing . Deeper in the gardens is a grotto complete with a cascade . Later to be a popular feature in Portuguese gardens , the Queluz cascade was the first artificial waterfall to be constructed near Lisbon . 
 An avenue of huge <unk> forms the approach to the classical Robillon wing of the palace ( see key 7 ) , while from the wing a double staircase leads to the canal . More than 100 metres ( 330 ft ) long , the walls of the canal are decorated with tiled panels depicting seascapes and associated scenes . This is the largest of a series of canals in the gardens bordered with chinoiserie @-@ style <unk> tiles . Fed by a stream , the sluice gates to the canals are only opened in May . During the 18th century , the canals were the setting for fêtes <unk> during which fully rigged ships would sail in processions with figures aboard in allegorical costumes . 
 The gardens also contain a fountain with tritons and dolphins which has been attributed to Bernini . There are further fountains and statuary in the lower gardens , set within tall hedges of yew and cypress , and magnolia and mulberry trees planted by Marshal Junot during the French occupation in the Napoleonic wars . 
 = = Later history = = 
 Following a fire at the Ajuda Palace in 1794 , the Prince Regent John VI and his wife Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves . The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children . These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934 . To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807 , the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil . The French occupational forces took control of the palace , and their commander , General Junot , made several alterations to the building . On the royal family 's return from exile in 1821 , the King preferred to live at Mafra , leaving his wife , the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina , to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca <unk> . The King visited Queluz infrequently . It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King 's Bedroom in 1826 . 
 Carlotta Joaquina , sometimes described as sinister , is said to have been ambitious and violent . Her features were reportedly ugly , and she was short in stature . Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz , employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in Europe . The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens , of which nothing remains today . She died at the palace in 1830 . 
 Following the death of Carlotta Joaquina , Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royals . Carlotta Joaquina 's son King Miguel used the palace during the three @-@ year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV , before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile . A year later , Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz , the palace of his birth . Pedro I 's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861 , the throne passed to his brother Luís . From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon . On the assassination of Luís ' son Carlos I in 1908 , the palace passed into the ownership of the state . Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the monarchy fell two years later . 
 = = Queluz , National Monument = = 
 In the 21st century , the palace gardens , once an irrigated oasis in the centre of parched farmland , are bounded by the " Radial de Sintra " motorway which feeds traffic towards Lisbon and away from Sintra . However , transportation and tourism have been the saviours of the palace . Since 1940 it has been open to the public as a museum . It houses much of the former royal collection , including furniture , <unk> carpets , paintings , and Chinese and European ceramics and porcelain . 
 In 1957 , the " Dona Maria Pavilion " in the palace 's east wing was transformed into a guest house for visiting heads of state . Today the palace 's principal rooms are therefore not simply museums , but the setting for official entertaining . 
 The town square that the palace faces , " Largo do Palácio de Queluz " , remains relatively unaltered since the 18th century . The large houses , once the homes of courtiers , and the former Royal Guard quarters with its campanile are still clustered around the palace . In latter years , the town of Queluz has expanded considerably to become one of the suburbs of Lisbon . The Palace of Queluz is one of Lisbon 's many tourist attractions . 
 = Jeremy Soule = 
 Jeremy Soule ( / <unk> / ; born December 19 , 1975 in Keokuk , Iowa ) is an American composer of soundtracks for film , television and video games . He has won multiple awards and has been described as the " John Williams of video game music " and " a model of success " for Western composers . He has composed soundtracks for over 60 games and over a dozen other works during his career . He is best known for his work in The Elder Scrolls and Guild Wars series , and several other top @-@ selling titles such as Total Annihilation , Neverwinter Nights , Dungeon Siege , and Harry Potter . 
 After several years of private composition studies he became an employee of Square in 1994 . After finishing the soundtrack to Secret of Evermore in 1995 , he left to join Humongous Entertainment , where he composed for several children 's games as well as Total Annihilation , his first award @-@ winning score . He left to form his own music production company , Soule Media in 2000 , now called Artistry Entertainment . Through the company , Soule has created several award @-@ winning soundtracks , including Icewind Dale , the Harry Potter series of games , and all of the main Elder Scrolls games since 2002 . 
 In 2005 , he founded DirectSong , a record label that publishes digital DRM @-@ free versions of his soundtracks as well as those of classical composers . Soule 's works have been played in several live concerts such as the Symphonic Game Music Concert in Germany and the international Play ! A Video Game Symphony concert series . While many of his works are orchestral , he considers himself a " music practitioner " , or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music . Several of Soule 's soundtracks have been created both credited and uncredited with the help of his brother , Julian . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Soule was born in Keokuk , Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic designer mother . He became interested in music and symphony orchestras at the age of five . Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music , even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework ; after his teachers and his father realized his talent , he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade . He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master 's degree in composition before completing high school , though , as he never enrolled in the school , he did not earn a degree . He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up ; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult it would be to do both . 
 While playing video games as a child , Soule came to believe that the experience they created could be greatly enhanced by having a better musical score . After completing high school , he took a year to create a portfolio showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like . Soule sent the tape to LucasArts and Square . Square very much appreciated the portfolio ; he does not believe that LucasArts ever listened to his tapes as they had a " no unsolicited package " policy . Soule began working at Square in Seattle only two weeks after first submitting his demo tapes .

 = = = 1990s = = = 
 Soule was promptly given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore . The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds ( like wind blowing and ocean waves ) into the music and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound . Part of the reason for this was that the sound program used in Evermore was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it , forcing him to work creatively within his limitations . When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company , Humongous Entertainment , and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles , Soule quit Square to score Gilbert 's children 's adventure game series , Putt @-@ Putt ; he was the company 's third employee . Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children 's games over the next three years , with multiple titles in the Putt @-@ Putt , Pajama Sam , <unk> Fish and Spy Fox series . 
 While working at Humongous , Soule met fellow employee and video game designer Chris Taylor , and signed on to compose the soundtrack to his major project , Total Annihilation . Soule convinced Taylor that , given the large amount of other real @-@ time strategy games coming out at the same time as Total Annihilation with techno scores , that to separate themselves they needed to do a large orchestral score . He went so far as to bet a year 's worth of reduced pay that it would pay off ; Gilbert felt that it did after the first sentence of the first review of the game he read was about the music . Given the software limitations at the time , to make the sound work correctly required a full live orchestra , the first that Soule had ever worked with ; the orchestral tracks in Evermore had been performed by Soule and his brother by themselves , two instruments at a time . The soundtrack earned Soule his first award , that of " Best Music " of 1997 from GameSpot in their year @-@ end awards . Soule spent the next two years composing music for the game 's two expansion packs and for children 's games . 
 = = = 2000s = = = 
 In February 2000 , Jeremy and his brother , Julian , formed Soule Media as an independent music production company ; its name has since been changed to Artistry Entertainment . Julian works as a sound engineer and composer for the company , and has assisted Jeremy in several projects throughout his career , both credited and uncredited . The first large project that Jeremy Soule worked on through the company was 2000 's Icewind Dale , which won the best music of the year award from both IGN and GameSpot . 
 In 2001 , Soule scored the first of five Harry Potter games that he would work on between then and 2005 . His first game , Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone , was nominated for an Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award for " Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition " , while Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban won and were nominated , respectively , for a British Academy of Film & Television Arts award for " Best Score " in the Game Music Category . The other games he composed for that year include Baldur 's Gate : Dark Alliance and <unk> : Rise of <unk> , which he later described as a bad game lifted up in the eyes of testers and reviewers by good music . He was responsible for composing the soundtracks to three top @-@ selling role @-@ playing games in 2002 , those of Dungeon Siege , The Elder Scrolls III : Morrowind , and Neverwinter Nights ; Morrowind earned him his second Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award nomination . 
 Since then Artistry Entertainment has grown and scored a string of highly successful games such as the Guild Wars series , Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic , Warhammer 40 @,@ 000 : Dawn of War , The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion and The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim . Oblivion was an award @-@ winning soundtrack by Soule . It was nominated for the 2006 British Academy of Film & Television Arts and Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards , and won the MTV Video Music Awards and Official Xbox Magazine soundtrack awards . In 2005 Jeremy and Julian Soule founded DirectSong , a company which sells DRM @-@ free downloads of Jeremy 's compositions as well as works by dozens of classical composers . By 2007 the company had grown to over one million registered customers , though Soule noted that not all of those customers resulted in a sale of a non @-@ free product . Soule says that the traffic numbers for DirectSong have surpassed some major record labels at times . DirectSong has also struggled to fulfil orders or provide timely support , with some customers sometimes waiting more than a year for CDs , resulting in an " F " rating by the Better Business Bureau , based on 58 complaints . 
 In 2006 , Soule composed music for the first Guild Wars title , and would ultimately go on to compose music for all expansions for the first game , as well as the soundtrack for Guild Wars 2 . Soule also uses DirectSong to sell " expansion packs " of music for games such as Guild Wars that can be played in game like the rest of the soundtrack . He estimates that at least 10 % of the players of Guild Wars have bought his musical expansion for the game , Battle Pak 1 . Soule also worked on another of Chris Taylor 's real @-@ time strategy titles in 2007 , with the launch of Supreme Commander .

 November 2011 saw the release of the fifth installment in the Elder Scrolls franchise , Skyrim . The game 's soundtrack is among Soule 's most critically acclaimed pieces of work , receiving a BAFTA nomination as well as numerous other awards from organizations such as the Game Audio Network Guild . Soule would also go on to compose the music for two of the official DLC packs for the game , Dragonborn and Dawnguard , both released in 2012 . 
 In March 2013 , Soule launched a Kickstarter project to fund a classical music album called The Northerner : Soule Symphony No. 1 , seeking $ 10 @,@ 000 for the album . The campaign ultimately raised a total of $ 121 @,@ 227 . The project features vocals in Old Norse , with Soule citing the successful use of the similar Icelandic language by <unk> in one of her own projects during development . The symphony has been delayed several times , and is currently scheduled for 2017 . For the project , Soule and his company are developing new audio technology . 
 In 2014 , Soule signed an MMO exclusivity deal with Sony Online Entertainment , in order to compose music for Everquest Next and Landmark . The move saw an end to his six year collaboration with the Guild Wars series . Everquest Next was later cancelled in March 2016 , but Landmark is still in development . 
 In 2015 , Soule composed a Dota 2 music pack , along with his brother Julian . The soundtrack was available as part of the Compendium , a pack of digitally @-@ distributed content that funded the prize pool for The International 2015 tournament , which took place in August 2015 and ultimately featured the largest prize @-@ pool in e @-@ sports history , with over $ 18 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in total .

 Music that Soule has composed has been played in numerous live concerts . His music from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was performed on August 20 , 2003 at the first Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig , Germany , and his music from Morrowind was performed at the third Symphonic Game Music Concert on August 17 , 2005 . Selections of his pieces from Morrowind and Oblivion are played in the international concert series Play ! A Video Game Symphony . Jeremy Soule attended the world @-@ premiere of Play ! on May 27 , 2006 in Chicago . Music from Oblivion has also been played at the Press Start 2007 -Symphony of Games- concerts in September 2007 in Japan . Soule 's music has been featured in numerous top @-@ selling games ; he once estimated in an interview that around 10 million games with his music in them were sold in 2006 alone . 
 Selections of remixes of Soule 's work appear on English remixing websites such as OverClocked ReMix . Soule is a supporter of the game music arrangement community , even going so far as to submit his own arrangement to OverClocked ReMix . He did so to help promote and inspire younger and newer composers . The track , " Squaresoft Variation " , arranges the Final Fantasy VI piece " Terra " ; Soule has said that he chose the piece to remix because when he first started at Square he spent some time debugging the game before his composition duties for Evermore started . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Soule rarely gets to see the game he is composing for in any sort of completed state before he begins work ; as a result he bases many of his musical decisions on the company 's previous games . He credits his success with this strategy to the fact that many of the games he works on come from studios that have created several successful games in the past . He finds it much easier to compose a soundtrack to a game that is very visual in nature , such as a role @-@ playing game . He also likes to see the storyboards and concept art for the game , as he considers them a good provider of " pure emotional intent " for the game . When composing a soundtrack , the first thing that he decides is the tempo and the amount of energy the music will have ; this decision is as much based on the genre of the game as it is the artistic style of the game . After that , Soule starts composing smaller tracks in the soundtrack , to make sure that they match up with the vision of the game before he starts on the major themes . Soule tries to compose all of a game 's soundtrack himself rather than in a team , though he sometimes collaborates with his brother . 
 Although many of his works are orchestral in nature , Soule has denied that it is his " style " , as he feels that the term boxes him into only creating one type of music . He prefers to call himself a " music practitioner " , or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music as he is capable of many styles , such as Japanese pop , which he has written along with Jeff Miyahara . Soule considers music to be like a language , which can be arranged in many different ways if you understand the structure . He does not have a favorite genre of game to compose for , preferring instead to compose for " ambitious " games by people with " new ideas " . 
 Soule 's greatest musical influences are " Debussy 's exploration of harmony " , " Wagner 's grand operas " , and " Mozart 's form and composition " . While many of his orchestral works are based on movie scores in terms of scope , he does not often listen to movie scores , though he names his favorite composer as John Williams . The influence has been noted by critics , who have termed Soule " the John Williams of video game music " . Among video game music influences , he has cited Square for providing him " with the education for what quality means to this business " and Nobuo Uematsu in particular . His favorite style of music to listen to is British pop and rock music , while his favorite video games are the ones that he has written scores to , especially the ones made by Chris Taylor , though one of his all @-@ time favorites is The Legend of Zelda . He has said that the games he would most like to work on that he has not already are ones by Shigeru Miyamoto , a Final Fantasy game , and a Metroid game .

 Golos Truda ( Russian : <unk> <unk> English : The Voice of Labour ) was a Russian @-@ language anarcho @-@ syndicalist newspaper . Founded by working @-@ class Russian expatriates in New York in 1911 , Golos Truda shifted to Petrograd during the Russian Revolution in 1917 , when its editors took advantage of the general amnesty and right of return for political dissidents . There , the paper integrated itself into the nascent anarcho @-@ syndicalist movement , pronounced the necessity of a social revolution of and by the workers , and situated itself in opposition to the myriad of other left @-@ wing movements . 
 The rise to power of the Bolsheviks marked the turning point for the newspaper however , as the new government enacted increasingly repressive measures against the publication of dissident literature and against anarchist agitation in general , and after a few years of low @-@ profile publishing , the Golos Truda collective was finally expunged by the Stalinist regime in 1929 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the suppression of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the consequent exile of political dissidents from the Russian Empire , Russian @-@ language journalism in New York City enjoyed a revival . Among the fledgling publications were a number of political newspapers and labor union periodicals , including Golos Truda , which the Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada began publishing in the city in 1911 , initially on a monthly basis . The newspaper adopted the ideology of anarcho @-@ syndicalism , a fusion of trade unionism and anarchist philosophy which had emerged from the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam and along similar lines in America through the influential Industrial Workers of the World . The anarcho @-@ syndicalists rejected state @-@ oriented political struggle and intellectualism , instead proposing labor unions as the revolutionary agents that would bring about an anarchist society characterised primarily by worker collectives . 
 At the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917 , the Russian Provisional Government declared a general amnesty and offered to fund the return of those Russians who had been exiled as political opponents of the Empire ; the entire staff of Golos Truda elected to leave New York City for Russia and to move the periodical to Petrograd . In Vancouver on May 26 , 1917 , the editors , along with Ferrer Center artist Manuel <unk> and thirteen others , boarded a ship bound for Japan . On board , the anarchists played music , gave lectures , staged plays and even published a revolutionary newspaper , The Float . From Japan , the band made their way to Siberia , and proceeded East to European Russia .

 Though initially the Bolsheviks had not enjoyed much popularity following the February Revolution — with liberal Prime Minister Alexander Kerensky retaining enough support to repress an attempted coup d 'état by the faction in July — they capitalized on the disorder and economic collapse of Russian society , mass worker 's strikes and the Kornilov affair to increase their popularity among — and ultimately control over — the Soviets . Volin lamented that the almost six @-@ month gap between the February Revolution and the launch of Golos Truda in Russia as " a long and irreparable delay " for the anarchists ; they now faced a difficult task , with the majority of the workers having been won over by the powerful , consolidated Bolshevik Party whose propaganda efforts dwarfed those of the anarchists . 
 In Petrograd , the work of beginning publication was assisted by the nascent Anarcho @-@ Syndicalist Propaganda Union , and the new paper bolstered the city 's indigenous anarcho @-@ syndicalist movement . Its editorial staff included Maksim <unk> , Vladimir <unk> ( the linotype operator ) , Volin , Gregori <unk> , Alexander Schapiro , and <unk> <unk> . 
 The first ( weekly ) issue was published on August 11 , 1917 , with an editorial stated its firm opposition to the tactics and programs of the Bolsheviks , Mensheviks , left Social Revolutionaries , right Social Revolutionaries and others , and that the conception of revolutionary action of the anarcho @-@ syndicalists bore no resemblance to those of the socialists . It declared as its principal goal a revolution that would replace the state with a free confederation of autonomous " peasant unions , industrial unions , factory committees , control commissions and the like in locations all over the country " . This revolution would be " anti @-@ statist in its methods of struggle , syndicalist in its economic content , and federal in its political tasks " . It placed its greatest hopes in the factory committees , which had arisen spontaneously around the country after the February Revolution . 
 Each of the early issues contained what Volin later described as " clear and definite articles on the way in which the Anarcho @-@ Syndicalists conceived the constructive tasks of the Revolution to come " , citing as examples " a series of articles on the role of the factory committees ; articles on the tasks of the Soviets , and others on how to resolve the agrarian problem , on the new organization of production , and on exchange " . It published copious articles on the general strike as well as on the French bourses du travail and <unk> . The paper shifted to daily publication for three months after the October Revolution of that same year . In a series of articles , it proclaimed the necessity of immediately abandoning the <unk> Bolshevik dictatorship of the proletariat , and of allowing the workers freedom of association and action . 
 Although Golos Truda sharply criticized the anarchist communists of Petrograd as romantics , ignorant of the complex social forces of the Revolution among Petrograd 's Bolshevik @-@ supporting factory workers , the ideas of the union and its paper were considered bizarre and met with little initial success . Despite this , the anarcho @-@ syndicalist union persisted and gradually acquired a degree of influence , focusing its efforts through propaganda in Golos Truda , with the intent of capturing the attention of the public with its ideals and by differentiating itself from the other radical factions . The paper 's circulation continuing to increase in the city and its provinces , with robust anarcho @-@ syndicalist collectives and meetings emerging in Kronstadt , <unk> , and <unk> . In March 1918 , the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow , and the anarchists swiftly followed , moving the printing of Golos Truda to the new capital . 
 = = Suppression and legacy = = 
 On November 17 , 1917 , the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets issued a decree granting to the Bolsheviks control over all newsprint and expansive powers of shutting down dissident newspapers . After the suppression of the Golos Truda by the Bolshevik government in August 1918 , <unk> Maximoff , Nikolai <unk> and Efim <unk> established <unk> Golos Truda ( The Free Voice of Labour ) . At the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921 , Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin declared war against the petite bourgeoisie , and in particular the anarcho @-@ syndicalists , with immediate consequences ; the Cheka closed the publishing and printing premises of Golos Truda in Petrograd , as well as the paper 's bookstore in Moscow , where all but half a dozen anarchists had been arrested . 
 Despite the banning of their paper , the Golos Truda group continued on , however , and issued a final edition in the form of a journal , in Petrograd and Moscow in December 1919 . During the New Economic Policy period ( 1921 – 1928 ) , it released a number of works , including the publication of the collected works of pre @-@ eminent anarchist theorist Mikhail Bakunin from its bookstore and publishing house in Petrograd between 1919 and 1922 . What little anarchist activity the regime tolerated ended in 1929 , after the accession of Joseph Stalin , and the bookshops of the Golos Truda group in Moscow and Petrograd were closed permanently amidst an abrupt and violent wave of repression . The newspaper was also suppressed by the Post Office Department in the United States , where it was succeeded by the widely circulated <unk> i Volya ( Bread and Freedom ) , first published on February 26 , 1919 , which in turn was banned from the United States and Canada for its anarchist position . 
 Russian revolutionary anarchist @-@ turned @-@ Bolshevik Victor Serge described Golos Truda as the most authoritative anarchist group active in 1917 , " in the sense that it was the only one to possess any semblance of doctrine , a valuable collection of militants " who foresaw that the October Revolution " could only end in the formation of a new power " . 
 = Typhoon Neoguri ( 2008 ) = 
 Typhoon Neoguri , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ambo , was the earliest tropical cyclone on record to strike The People 's Republic of China . The first named storm in the 2008 Pacific typhoon season , named after the Korean word for raccoon dog , it formed from a low pressure area on April 13 to the east of the Philippine island of Mindanao , and after crossing the island it intensified into a tropical storm in the South China Sea . Environmental conditions allowed for quick strengthening , with Neoguri attaining typhoon status on April 16 . The typhoon reached its peak intensity on April 18 as it approached the island of Hainan , and subsequently it turned northward . Due to increased wind shear and cooler waters , Neoguri rapidly weakened and made landfall as a minimal tropical storm in southern China on April 19 . 
 In the southern Philippines , the storm brought heavy rainfall , which left a person missing when a boat capsized . The typhoon left 40 fishermen missing in the South China Sea . Neoguri brought heavy rainfall as it made its final landfall on China , causing moderate damage totaling over ¥ 296 million ( 2008 RMB , $ 42 million 2008 USD ) . Three deaths occurred in China .

 An area of disorganized convection persisted east @-@ northeast of Palau on April 11 in association with a sharp easterly wave , and within the system , a low pressure area was evident between Palau and Yap . Located beneath a developing anticyclone , with limited wind shear and enhanced diffluence , the system encountered favorable conditions for development . By April 13 , a low @-@ level circulation had formed and started consolidating about 260 km ( 160 mi ) southeast of <unk> City on Mindanao island in the Philippines . At around the same time , weak rainbands began wrapping into the center . At 1200 UTC on April 13 , the JMA classified it as a weak tropical depression . Its development was impeded somewhat as it crossed Mindanao and Negros island , though the circulation consolidated while convective banding features increased . Later that day , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) classified the system as Tropical Depression Ambo , and early on April 14 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified it as Tropical Depression 02W about 300 km ( 185 mi north of the Zamboanga Peninsula ) . Also , PAGASA declared " Ambo " at 0300 UTC April 14 to be within <unk> City . 
 The depression continued westward , along the southern periphery of a strong subtropical ridge extending from southeastern Asia to north of Luzon . After it entered the Sulu Sea , the convection and circulation continued to consolidate , while its anticyclone aloft provided excellent outflow . Based on satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique , the JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm 02W midday on April 14 . At 0000 UTC on April 15 , the JMA classified the system as a full tropical depression , and six hours later the agency upgraded it to Tropical Storm Neoguri after it crossed Palawan island into the South China Sea . Shortly thereafter , the PAGASA issued its last advisory on the cyclone as the storm moved out of their area of warning responsibility . 
 After attaining tropical storm status , significant intensification was limited due to a slight increase in wind shear as well as impeded outflow . The slowing of the strengthening trend was temporary , and by early on April 16 the organization had rapidly improved . As a result , the JMA upgraded Neoguri to a severe tropical storm . Warm water temperatures contributed to further intensification , and an eye formed in the center of the convection . At 1200 UTC on April 16 , the JMA classified Neoguri as a typhoon about 350 km ( 220 mi ) east of Qui Nhon , Vietnam . An approaching mid @-@ level trough turned the typhoon northwestward , which enhanced outflow and contributed to further intensification . Late on April 17 , the JTWC assessed Neoguri as attaining peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , averaged over a duration of one minute , near the Paracel Islands . Early the next day , the JMA estimated Neoguri reached its peak intensity with ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , about 190 km ( 120 mi ) east of Sanya on the southern tip of Hainan .
