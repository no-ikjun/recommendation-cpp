 = Pennsylvania Route 646 = 
 Pennsylvania Route 646 ( PA 646 ) is a 19 @.@ 15 miles ( 30 @.@ 82 km ) long state highway located in McKean county in Pennsylvania . The southern terminus is at PA 59 in Keating Township . The northern terminus is the New York state line in Foster Township . The route continues as New York State Route 16 ( NY 16 ) in <unk> County . 
 PA 646 was assigned in the 1928 mass numbering of state routes in Pennsylvania . At that time , it consisted entirely of the PA 346 â state line stretch in Foster Township . The rest of the stretch consisted of PA 59 , now realigned , and PA 746 , now decommissioned . PA 746 was decommissioned in 1946 , and PA 59 was realigned in 1952 , with PA 646 being extended onto its current alignment . The route has remained virtually unchanged since the change in 1952 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Ormsby to Rew = = = 
 PA 646 begins at an intersection with PA 59 in the small borough of Ormsby . The highway , situated around several oil wells , progresses to the northwest through a moderately populated region of residential homes . PA 646 continues on this progression for several miles , parallelling a pipeline running through the Kinzua Valley . After an intersection with a local dirt road , the highway leaves Ormsby and continues into the under @-@ populated forests in Keating Township . The route follows an old railroad grade , entering the small unincorporated place of McKean . When PA 646 turns to the north at a gradual bend , it crosses a second pipeline and enters the community of Cyclone . 
 Upon entering Cyclone , PA 646 intersects with Pithole Road , which heads to the northeast and into <unk> Hollow , a local mountain range . The route itself heads to the northwest still , passing several residential homes in the area . After an intersection with <unk> Road , the highway turns to the north and leaves Cyclone for the woodlands in Keating Township once again . After leaving Cyclone , PA 646 enters the Bradford Oil Field , which includes the community of Cyclone and runs about two miles east of the Lafayette Township line . The route continues northbound for a couple miles , entering the community of Gifford , situated near the Lafayette Township line . The community is moderately developed , with most of the region contained by residential homes and local dirt roads . The major intersection in Gifford along PA 646 is the one with Alley Gifford and Droney Road . At a fork in the highway with Fairground Road , the highway turns northeastward , looping around on a gradual bend of the Bradford Oil Field . 
 A short distance after the bend , PA 646 continues to the northeast , entering the community of Aiken , where at another fork in the road , PA 770 begins . PA 646 continues to the northeast through Aiken , an under @-@ developed community of residential homes . A short distance later , the highway crosses the township line into Bradford Township . The route continues for several miles , making a gradual bend in the woodlands into Foster Township . PA 646 continues , making an intersection with Wolf Run Road , which heads southward to the community of Middletown . At that intersection , PA 646 turns northeastward , entering the community of Rew . In Rew , the route becomes moderately developed once again , where it intersects with PA 46 . After intersecting with Rew â Bradford Road , a highway that becomes a dirt road up Pratt Hollow , PA 646 progresses to the north and exits Rew . 
 = = = Rew to Bells Camp = = = 
 PA 646 , after crossing out of Rew , enters the dense woodlands once again , where yet another pipeline is crossed . When the highway reaches this pipeline , the alignment of the highway turns , winding along Summit Road along the base of Pratt Hollow . The highway continues northward , winding around several mountains through the Bradford Oil Field , passing a large swamp before entering the small community of Summit . In Summit , PA 646 is partially developed , with most of the population situated at the intersection of PA 646 with PA 246 . The route intersects with a <unk> Lane , a local road , before turning to the north and out of Summit . The route heads northward for a short distance , paralleling a grade right @-@ of @-@ way road , which heads eastward to <unk> . A short distance later , PA 646 enters a small developed area , where the route intersects with PA 346 . 
 At the intersection with PA 346 , PA 646 turns off its right @-@ of @-@ way , which continues along a pipeline as a dirt road , and onto a concurrency with the aforementioned touring route . PA 646 and PA 346 head eastward , intersecting with several dirt roads in a light woodland . The two highways continue eastward , entering the community of Red Rock . In Red Rock , most of the highway is unpopulated , until an intersection with Narrow Gauge Road , where most of the residential homes stand . When Narrow Gauge Road intersects with the two highways once again , PA 646 and PA 346 enter the community of Derrick City . In Derrick City , the highways pass along a stretch of residential houses before PA 646 turns off to the north on Olean Road . PA 346 continues ahead along Derrick Road towards Bradford . 
 After turning on Olean Road , PA 646 turns to the northeast , running along the Pennbrook Run for the entire stretch of highway . Along the highway several residential homes surround , while the road enters the community of Bells Camp . Bells Camp is moderately developed , and is the last designated community along PA 646 . The highway forks off from Bells Camp Road , continuing further to the northeast along Olean Road . When the route turns to the east , PA 646 intersects with a connector street back to Bells Camp Road , which parallels to the north . The highway is undeveloped from this point , intersecting with Fullerton Road , which terminates at Olean Road . The route continues northward , paralleling PA 546 and Knapp Creek , before crossing the state line into New York a distance northwest of Fullerton . The right @-@ of @-@ way continues northward as NY 16 towards Olean .

 When the mass amount of state legislative routes were assigned in Pennsylvania in 1928 , PA 646 consisted of only the stretch from PA 346 in Derrick City to the New York state line . There was no concurrency with PA 346 at that time . The stretch from PA 59 to PA 346 was not state @-@ maintained . The rest of the current PA 646 was an alignment of PA 59 . The entire alignment of PA 646 was paved in 1930 . Also that year , the stretch from PA 59 in Aiken to PA 46 in Rew was designated as PA 746 , a spur off PA 46 . 
 This set of highways remained intact for over a decade , until 1946 , when PA 746 was decommissioned in favor of extending PA 646 over its alignment . Now PA 646 continued along a concurrency with PA 346 and east of Red Rock , it went southward ( away from PA 346 ) down to PA 59 in Aiken , where it ended . In 1952 , PA 59 was realigned off its <unk> â Aiken alignment , and PA 646 was extended to Ormsby , where it ended at PA 59 .

 = Battlefield Germany = 
 Battlefield Germany is a turn @-@ based strategy video game developed and published by Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 released in April 1987 . It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year . It is the eighth instalment to the Strategic Wargames series . The game is set during a fictional scenario in which the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact engage in a conventional war throughout Europe , mostly centring in West and East Germany . 
 The game is a turn @-@ based strategy and focuses on the player building and training units that are used to attack the opposing side . The game was released for 8 @-@ bit consoles as well as 16 @-@ bit consoles . Battlefield Germany received mixed reviews upon release . Reviewers mainly criticised the tempo of the gameplay and lack of innovation from the original . Some critics , however , praised the graphics and viewed the hard difficulty favourably . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game is a turn @-@ based strategy and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact . The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces at the beginning of the game . The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen ; if NATO was picked , the player will start at western European countries ( France , West Germany , Denmark ) whereas if the player sides with the Warsaw Pact , the game will begin in eastern Europe . The map is hexagon @-@ shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions . Each side has a variety of units ; infantry move at a slower pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units . The game displays two maps on screen ; the larger , central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini @-@ map of Europe , which runs north from Denmark to southern France . 
 There are seven types of units in the game . Each unit has a set of statistics which is displayed in the interface once selected . The statistics range from combat strength , fatigue , efficiency , supply and movement points . During the game , both sides have the option to request air support that can be used to attack enemy units . If the other side uses their air support , the player will be given a warning of an oncoming air strike and will have the option to retreat . The game has two endings depending on the side chosen . If playing as NATO , the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive . However , if playing as the Warsaw Pact , the objective is to destroy all NATO forces .

 The events leading up the stand @-@ off between NATO and the Warsaw Pact are detailed in a pre @-@ game text ; Iran declares war on Iraq and subsequently invades the latter nation , whilst Egypt succumbs to a civil war and establishes Islamic law over the country , culminating in an Egyptian invasion of Israel . The events in the Middle East prompt the superpowers of the United States and the British Empire to intervene , leading up to a conventional war in Europe against the Eastern bloc . The game is set in 1989 .

 Personal Software Services was founded in Coventry , England , by Gary Mays and Richard Cockayne in 1981 . The company were known for creating games that revolved around historic war battles and conflicts , such as Theatre Europe , Bismark and Falklands ' 82 . The company had a partnership with French video game developer ERE Informatique , and published localised versions of their products to the United Kingdom . In 1986 , Cockayne took a decision to alter their products for release on 16 @-@ bit consoles , as he found that smaller 8 @-@ bit consoles such as the ZX Spectrum lacked the processing power for larger strategy games . The decision was falsely interpreted as " pull @-@ out " from the Spectrum market by a video game journalist . Following years of successful sales throughout the mid 1980s , Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties , in what Cockayne admitted in a retrospective interview that " he took his eye off the ball " .

 = Wappocomo ( Romney , West Virginia ) = 
 Wappocomo is a late 18th @-@ century Georgian mansion and farm overlooking the South Branch Potomac River north of Romney , Hampshire County , West Virginia , USA . It is located along Cumberland Road ( West Virginia Route 28 ) and the South Branch Valley Railroad . 
 The original section of the mansion at Wappocomo was built in 1774 by Nicholas Casey ( 1745 â 1833 ) , using bricks that had been used as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River . The Wappocomo property had been a part of the South Branch Survey of Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron 's Northern Neck Proprietary . The Parsons family , prominent in Virginia and West Virginia politics in the 18th and 19th centuries , acquired Wappocomo and continue to maintain ownership of the property into the 21st century . 
 Wappocomo was involved in two slavery @-@ related disputes that caused friction between the governments of Pennsylvania and Virginia . In 1788 , Nicholas Casey purchased a freed slave by the name of John , who had been kidnapped in Pennsylvania and returned into slavery in Virginia . Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin demanded that the Governor of Virginia punish the three Virginia residents responsible for the abduction and re @-@ enslavement of a freedman , however , Virginia 's governor cited the absence of such a clause in the United States Constitution . In August 1855 , a fugitive slave named Jacob Green escaped from Wappocomo with several other slaves to Pennsylvania . Col. Isaac Parsons ( 1814 â 62 ) and his nephews went north to pursue the escapees , resulting in the arrest of his nephew , James " Zip " Parsons III ( 1831 â 93 ) . Parsons ' trial caused a further dispute between the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania over the latter 's refusal to execute the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 . 
 The mansion at Wappocomo is unique among the historic residences along the South Branch Potomac River , in that its formal faÃ§ade faces toward the road and the western flanks of South Branch Mountain rather than toward the river . The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two @-@ story Georgian @-@ style structure , an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo 's construction . The bricks used to build the 1774 structure were manufactured in England , and used as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River . The interior of the 1774 structure contains a grand stairway in the center hall and all the original handmade woodworking . A stone addition to the mansion with two stories of deep verandas was completed in 1861 . The principal passenger depot for the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad , Wappocomo Station , is located at the farm .

 The land on which Wappocomo is located was originally part of the South Branch Survey of Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron 's Northern Neck Proprietary . The South Branch Survey extended from the north end of The Trough to the confluence of the North and South Branches of the Potomac River . Lord Fairfax originally planned to maintain the South Branch Survey as his personal manor , but later commissioned James Genn to survey the South Branch Potomac River lowlands for sale in 1748 , with land lots ranging in size from 300 acres ( 120 ha ) to 400 acres ( 160 ha ) . 
 Prominent Hampshire County pioneer Peter Casey ( 1715 â 87 ) received the Wappocomo parcel , known as Lot Number 21 of the South Branch Survey , from Lord Fairfax . Casey 's son , Nicholas Casey ( 1745 â 1833 ) , married Grace Foreman ( 1762 â 1796 ) , the daughter of another Hampshire County pioneer and colonial military officer William Foreman . Nicholas Casey inherited Lot Number 21 from his father , and in 1774 , Casey built the present mansion at Wappocomo . 
 The bricks used in the construction of Casey 's mansion were manufactured in England , and used as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River . These bricks were then transported overland through the Blue Ridge Mountains and Ridge @-@ and @-@ Valley Appalachians in bullock carts . During this time , the mansion was named Wappocomo , which was derived from the Native American toponym " <unk> " for the South Branch Potomac River . 
 In 1788 , while residing at his Wappocomo residence , Casey purchased a freed slave named John , who had been residing in Washington County , Pennsylvania . Virginia residents Francis McGuire , Baldwin Parsons , and Absalom Wells seized John and transported him to Virginia , where they sold him back into slavery to Casey . Such an act was illegal in Pennsylvania , and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society petitioned Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin to demand punishment of the three men by the Governor of Virginia . Virginia 's governor refused , citing the absence of a provision in the United States Constitution calling for such an action . Governor Mifflin petitioned the United States Congress , and a bill was introduced that provided against such an occurrence . 
 On December 4 , 1789 , Casey was appointed by an act of the Virginia General Assembly as a trustee of Romney . Casey served as a trustee alongside Isaac Parsons and Andrew Wodrow . Casey and his fellow trustees were given authority by the Virginia General Assembly to settle disputes regarding the town 's land lots and to " open and clear " the town 's " streets and lanes " in accordance with the original survey and plan for Romney . 
 = = = Parsons family acquisition = = = 
 Nicholas Casey 's daughter , Mary Catherine Casey ( 1773 â 1846 ) , married James Gregg Parsons ( 1773 â 1847 ) of Hampshire County in 1795 . Parsons was the eldest son of Isaac Parsons ( 1752 â 1796 ) and his wife Mary Ellender Gregg . The Parsons were a prominent family whose ancestors arrived at the Thirteen Colonies from England in 1635 , and relocated to Hampshire County around 1740 . Isaac Parsons represented Hampshire County as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1789 until his death on August 25 , 1796 . By 1778 , Parsons owned 161 acres ( 65 ha ) of Lot Number 16 and all of Lot Number 17 , which was adjacent to the Wappocomo property . 
 James Gregg Parsons and his wife Catherine inherited Wappocomo from her father , and they raised their 12 children there . Following his wife 's death , Parsons acquired sole ownership in Wappocomo plantation . After his death on January 25 , 1847 , his will , dated November 7 , 1846 and probated February 22 , 1847 , devised Lot Number 21 including Wappocomo ( referred to in the will as the Casey Tract ) to his son Colonel Isaac Parsons ( 1814 â 62 ) . On May 18 , 1836 , Col. Parsons married Susan Blue ( 1817 â 89 ) , the daughter of Uriah Blue Jr. and his wife M. Elizabeth Donaldson Blue . Col. Parsons served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates representing Hampshire County from 1854 to 1857 . James " Big Jim " Parsons , Jr . ( 1798 â 1858 ) inherited the Collins Tract ( Lot Number 20 ) , which later became Valley View , and his son David C. Parsons ( 1803 â 1860 ) inherited Lot Number 13 . James Gregg Parsons ' sons also inherited the nearby " Jake Sugar Rum Tract , the McGuire Tract , and five town lots in Romney . " 
 = = = Jacob Green affair = = = 
 In August 1855 , Jacob Green , a slave owned by Col. Parsons , escaped from Wappocomo farm with four other slaves from neighboring plantations . In October of that year , he returned to Col. Parsons ' plantation in Romney , and persuaded four or five slaves from neighboring farms owned by Parsons family relatives to escape with him to Pennsylvania . 
 A party of eight to ten men , including Col. Parsons and two of his nephews , James " Zip " Parsons III ( 1831 â 93 ) and a Mr. Stump , went north in pursuit of the escapees . In the course of the pursuit , they captured two of Stump 's escaped slaves , who were sent back to Hampshire County . With information obtained from the two recaptured slaves , Col. Parsons went to Johnstown , James Parsons III to Hollidaysburg , and Stump to Altoona , where they hoped to intercept Green as he headed west on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Main Line Canal toward Pittsburgh . James Parsons III intercepted Green at Hollidaysburg , but local abolitionists thwarted his attempt to capture Green , and Parsons was arrested and arraigned for kidnapping . 
 Upon learning of the arrest of his nephew , Col. Parsons sought the assistance of Charles James Faulkner , a prominent Martinsburg lawyer and United States House Representative from Virginia 's 8th congressional district , and of James Murray Mason , a United States Senator from Virginia . Faulkner and Mason both offered their legal services for James Parsons III 's defense . The Virginia General Assembly pledged its support to Parsons and to Virginia 's slaveowners in defending their constitutional rights and to protect them from prosecution . Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise appointed John Randolph Tucker to attend Parsons ' trial as a " special commissioner " of Virginia . The dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania escalated , and on January 31 , 1856 , an article published in the New York Herald read " Threatened Civil War between Virginia and Pennsylvania . " 
 Col. Parsons , Faulkner , and Tucker traveled to Hollidaysburg for James Parsons III 's trial . Faulkner provided for Parsons ' legal defense , leading to his acquittal as having acted legally under the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 . 
 In September 1856 , Faulkner billed Col. Parsons $ 150 for his legal services . Parsons disputed the charge . In a series of articles in the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser , he declared that Faulkner had originally offered his services at no cost ; that he had been lauded publicly for his generosity in doing so without ever denying that he had been working pro bono ; and that he was practicing " duplicity and deception " in trying to win a reputation in his district through " specious acts of munificence " . 
 Faulkner later served as United States Minister to France ; following the American Civil War , he again served as a member of the United States House of Representatives , from West Virginia 's 2nd congressional district . James Parsons III and his brother William Miller Parsons ( born 1835 ) were later proprietors of the Virginia Argus .

 Following its construction by Col. Parsons in 1861 , the ballroom in the upper story of Wappocomo 's stone addition served as the scene of many events and parties . According to tradition , as many as 100 couples have danced on the ballroom 's wooden floor since its construction in 1861 . It was the custom of the Parsons family to allow guests who were visiting the mansion for the first time to write their names and the date of their visit on the mortar between the addition 's stone blocks ; many of these signatures are still legible .

Following its organization , the company became known as the Huckleberry Rangers of the Confederate States Army 's 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment . Parsons traveled to Richmond with a supply of cattle , and returned to his company 's camp on the North River in Hampshire County around November 15 , 1861 . Throughout 1861 , Col. Parsons " gratuitously " provided Confederate soldiers with food at his table and horses from his stables at his Wappocomo plantation . 
 Parsons was anxious to learn about the condition of his family and property at Wappocomo ; he also needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket . Accompanied by Lieutenant Blue and Adam Parrish , he traveled west along the Northwestern Turnpike to around Pleasant Dale , then followed a series of roads and paths until nighttime , when they reached Sugar Hollow two miles north of Romney . Parsons stayed behind in the hollow , while Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons ' clothes . Knowing that the Union Army kept a 24 @-@ hour guard at the main house , Blue circled around to the rear of the mansion and knocked on the window of his uncle , Garrett W. Blue , who was residing with the Parsons family . Garrett Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home 's front porch , and he subsequently fetched Parsons ' daughter , Kate , who provided Lt. Blue with a parcel for her father . 
 Lt. Blue and Parrish returned to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them , and Parsons set about locating pine from which to make torches to light their way out of the hollow . Parsons carried with him a small hatchet , and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch . He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet , and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding . The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter , where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire . The following morning , they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris ' home , where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish . Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson 's residence on the Little Cacapon River , which had risen due to the previous night 's rainfall . They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided , then traveled to Blue 's Gap , where they set up camp . There , Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry , cavalry , and artillery present in and around Romney ; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons ' son , Isaac Parsons , Jr . , and by W. V. Parsons .

 Col. Parsons died on 24 April 1862 , while the American Civil War was still in progress . On April 26 , 1862 , acting Quartermaster Lt. F. H. Morse of the Union Army completed his death certificate , in which he noted Parsons ' " very fine house near Romney . " Following his death , the plantation was inherited by Col. Parsons ' wife , Susan Blue Parsons , for the purpose of raising and educating their children . 
 In 1884 , the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's South Branch line , connecting Green Spring and Romney , was completed . The line bisected the Wappocomo property and traversed the mansion 's front lawn . 
 Susan Blue Parsons died on October 2 , 1889 . On December 20 , 1890 , Col. Parsons ' son , Garrett Williams Parsons ( 1852 â 1935 ) , acquired Wappocomo for $ 16 @,@ 885 @.@ 72 , which he paid to Col. Parsons 's other heirs for their shares in the property . On November 12 , 1878 , he married Mary Avery Covell ( 1852 â 1914 ) , the daughter of West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind principal John Collins Covell ( 1823 â 87 ) . After the death of Garrett Williams Parsons on September 29 , 1935 , Wappocomo was inherited by his son Charles Heber Parsons ( 1886 â 1952 ) , who resided on the farm with his wife Gertrude L. Parsons ( 1895 â 1968 ) and engaged in farming on the property . He subsequently bequeathed the mansion and farm to his only child , Charles Heber Parsons , Jr . ( 1932 â 2002 ) and his wife Kathryn Anne Cole Parsons ( 1935 â 2004 ) . 
 In 1972 , the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's South Branch line , located on the Wappocomo property , became part of the Chessie System . In 1978 , ownership of the line was transferred to the West Virginia State Rail Authority , after which the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad South Branch line became known as the South Branch Valley Railroad . 
 In 1991 , the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad began operating on the South Branch Valley Railroad in 1991 , running between Wappocomo Station and Petersburg via The Trough . Its principal depot is Wappocomo Station , located on the Wappocomo farm ; the station consists of a ticket office housed in a red 1940 Baltimore and Ohio Railroad caboose , numbered <unk> ; the caboose is owned by the Chesapeake and Ohio Historical Society and leased by the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad . 
 Part of Wappocomo 's original land tract , located near the city limits of Romney , was sold for residential building lots and for the Fruit Growers Storage facility , a refrigerated storage plant for fruit stands along the South Branch Valley Railroad near the mansion . The Fruit Growers Storage facility also provided refrigerated storage for fruit that was to be shipped as freight on the South Branch Valley Railroad . 
 Charles Heber Parsons , Jr . ' s son , Charles " Chuck " Heber Parsons III ( 1955 â 2012 ) , inherited the farm at Wappocomo and carefully restored and maintained the property . Parsons was a prominent member of the Romney community and served as Assistant Chief of the Romney Volunteer Fire Department . He also served in the United States Air Force and worked as an engineer for Dyno Nobel , a manufacturer of explosives . Parsons was an avid bowler , and competed in local , state , and national bowling tournaments . In October 2013 , the first annual Chuck Parsons Memorial Bowling Tournament was held in his honor , with the proceeds benefitting the Hampshire County Parks and Recreation Department summer youth programs . Following Parsons ' passing in 2012 , Wappocomo was inherited by his children , Charles " Chip " Heber Parsons IV and <unk> Marie Parsons .

 The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two @-@ story Georgian @-@ style structure with a basement and attic , an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo 's construction . This part of the mansion is built of large weighted ballast bricks , with walls that measure 1 foot 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) in depth , allowing for deep inset windows . It also features two inside chimneys on either side , which once stood higher above its steep roof . The mansion 's formal entrance is covered by a small portico supported with wooden columns and engaged columns at the wall . 
 Other historic homes located along the South Branch Potomac River face the river ; the mansion at Wappocomo is unique in that its formal faÃ§ade faces toward Cumberland Road ( West Virginia Route 28 ) and the western flanks of South Branch Mountain . This may be due in part to the house 's distance from the river , approximately 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) . The house 's second @-@ floor rear windows offer a scenic view of the South Branch Potomac River . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The home 's wooden sill plates and joists were sawed by hand and the " rot nails " used for their construction were manufactured in the blacksmith shop on the Wappocomo plantation . The residence at Wappocomo also features unusually high fireplace mantelpieces , wide grooved window moldings and casings with base panels , solid paneled doors , and interior woodworking throughout , all of which were handmade . Every room of the main structure originally contained a corner fireplace . 
 Both of the mansion 's two floors consist of four large rooms with high ceilings , and each of these rooms is exactly the same size and shape . A grand stairway is located at the end of the mansion 's central hall , extending from the first floor to the attic . The stairway 's handrail is crafted of walnut , and it is connected to the stairway 's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step . 
 The basement rooms at Wappocomo are located almost entirely aboveground . The house 's foundation is constructed of large stone blocks , into which was crafted a large open fireplace that once exhibited a swinging iron chimney crane . The space around this large open fireplace within the mansion 's basement formerly served as a kitchen , where most of the cooking and food preparation took place . Entry into the home 's basement is accessible through a wide and heavy exterior door . 
 = = = Stone addition = = = 
 In 1861 , a stone addition to the original 1774 Georgian structure was built . The large stone blocks used for the construction of the addition were quarried from the plantation 's Mill Creek Mountain , a ridge located across the South Branch Potomac River to the west of the mansion . The stone blocks were hewed by sawyers , then transported across the river to the mansion , and lifted upon the addition 's scaffolding with wheelbarrows . A Mr. <unk> supervised and managed the stone addition 's construction . 
 The 1861 stone addition 's two floors consisted of two large rooms on each floor , with 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) ceilings . The two upstairs rooms were transformed into a large ballroom , while the two downstairs rooms were used as a dining room and kitchen . 
 The stone addition exhibits two stories of deep verandas extending across its eastern front faÃ§ade . These verandas were once supported by tall columns rising from the addition 's ground @-@ level porch , to the roof of the second @-@ story porch . An exterior stairway once connected the lower porch to the upper porch .

 Wappocomo farm is located within the relatively flat floodplain of the South Branch Potomac River valley , to the north of Romney . The farm 's property adjoins the Valley View farm and Romney corporate limits to the southwest , the South Branch Potomac River to the west and north , and the South Branch Valley Railroad line and Cumberland Road ( West Virginia Route 28 ) to the east . Mill Creek Mountain , a narrow anticlinal mountain ridge , rises to the west of the opposite riverbank of the South Branch Potomac River , and the western foothills of South Branch Mountain rise to the east . Mill Creek and South Branch Mountains contain Appalachian @-@ Blue Ridge forests of hardwoods and pine . Hanging Rocks , cliffs of stratified Oriskany sandstone and limestone layers , are located within a gap where the South Branch Potomac River cuts through Mill Creek Mountain approximately 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of Wappocomo farm . The unincorporated area at Hanging Rocks is known similarly as <unk> ( or Wappocomo ) . 
 Big Run , a tributary stream of the South Branch Potomac River , flows north bisecting the Wappocomo property , bordered by dense foliage . Shortly before it enters Wappocomo farm , Big Run flows alongside ledges of gray shale known to contain <unk> and <unk> fossils . A smaller unnamed stream flows through the front lawn of the house at Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run . Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo 's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River , which consist of rich alluvial soils .

 On November 7 , 1874 , Col. Parsons ' widow , Susan Blue Parsons , conveyed 2 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 ha ) of Wappocomo 's land to freedman William Washington , his wife Ann , and their children .

This deed enabled the Washington family to reside on that land lot as long as any of the individuals specified in the deed lived there . On September 17 , 1892 , Garrett Williams Parsons and his wife , Mary Avery Covell Parsons , conveyed to Washington an additional 3 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) of land . The old log house built by Washington on this former Wappocomo land lot is presently known as Washington Place , and it is thought to be one of the first residences built by freed slaves in Hampshire County .

 In a mixed review for Blogcritics , Chris Beaumont summed up that " Watching these promo DVDs makes me want the Blu @-@ ray that much more . The performances are great , the sets are great , and it is hard not to get excited about these guys taking the stage together . This is metal . " 
 Chad Bowar , writing for About.com , said that the concert was " one of the defining moments and biggest events in recent metal history " and commented that the bands " can still put on a great show " despite their age . He distinguished the styles of each band , writing : " Anthrax has a more lighthearted , fun approach , while Megadeth is 100 percent business with very little banter and focus on the music . Slayer has a more ominous vibe , although their evil mystique has lessened over the years .

 = The Rebel Flesh = 
 " The Rebel Flesh " is the fifth episode of the sixth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , which was first broadcast on 21 May 2011 on BBC One and on BBC America in the United States . It is the first episode of a two @-@ part story written by Matthew Graham and directed by Julian Simpson , concluded in " The Almost People " . 
 In the episode , the TARDIS is hit by a solar storm , sending the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) and his companions Amy Pond ( Karen Gillan ) and Rory Williams ( Arthur Darvill ) to a monastery on an island on Earth in the 22nd century , which has been converted into a factory to pump acid off the island . To prevent death from the acid , the workers have utilized a " programmable matter " called the Flesh , which creates a doppelgÃ¤nger ( called " Ganger " ) controlled by the worker . As the solar storm hits , the Gangers become independent , and the Doctor , Amy and Rory must work to prevent the two groups from breaking into a war . 
 Showrunner Steven Moffat specifically asked Graham to write the episodes about " avatars that rebel " , although the Flesh and the monastery were Graham 's original ideas . The episode was filmed in the late months of 2010 with some location filming at Caerphilly Castle to represent the monastery . Prosthetics were used to create the Gangers ' facial features , while doubles of the actors were used for scenes in which a character and his or her Ganger were both in a scene , but did not both show their face . 
 The episode was seen by 7 @.@ 35 million viewers in the UK and achieved an Appreciation Index of 85 . Reviewers were generally positive about the episode ; some praised the setting and characters but others commented that the story had not developed enough even though it was only the first part . The computer @-@ generated effects used for one scene were also disapproved of by a couple of reviewers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The TARDIS is caught in the first waves of a " solar tsunami " and materialises on Earth in the 22nd century . The Doctor , Amy , and Rory find themselves on a remote island , where a factory housed in a former castle monastery pumps a valuable , highly corrosive acid to the mainland . The skeleton crew of the factory uses a self @-@ replicating fluid called the Flesh from which they create doppelgÃ¤ngers of themselves , colloquially called " Gangers " . The crew control the Gangers from special harnesses , operating in the hazardous environment of the factory via the disposable bodies . The Doctor , initially posing as a weatherman , fears the worst part of the solar tsunami will strike the solar @-@ powered factory soon , threatening those still remaining , and offers to take the crew in his TARDIS . The foreman , Miranda Cleaves ( Raquel Cassidy ) , refuses to shut down the factory until she receives orders from the mainland . As the solar storm begins , the Doctor races to disconnect the solar collector , but an electrical strike hits the castle , throwing the Doctor off the tower and knocking everyone inside unconscious . 
 When the crew awaken , they find themselves out of the control beds with no sign of the Gangers . However , their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid @-@ corroded ground . The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious for more than an hour and the Gangers have gained sentience . They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them , posing as Cleaves and Jennifer ( Sarah Smart ) , when the two give themselves away by turning pale @-@ white . Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits . The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her . The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans , as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers . The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high @-@ powered electrical charge . The Gangers plan an attack , and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge . The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her . The Doctor determines that in a monastery , the safest place to be is the chapel , and directs everyone there . The Gangers , in acid @-@ protection suits , bear down on the chapel . Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group , against Amy 's wishes . In the chapel , Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor . 
 = = = Continuity = = = 
 " The Almost People " confirms that the Doctor came to the base to examine the Flesh in its early stage in order to humanely sever its connection to Amy , who was replaced by a Ganger avatar prior to the beginning of the series . He is once more seen performing a pregnancy scan on Amy which , as before , cannot come to a conclusion to whether she is pregnant . The " Eye Patch Lady " also makes another brief appearance to Amy , similar to those in " Day of the Moon " and " The Curse of the Black Spot " . Her identity is revealed in " The Almost People " and she plays a larger part in " A Good Man Goes to War " and " The Wedding of River Song " .

 Matthew Graham was originally to write a single episode for the previous series , but withdrew because he did not have enough time to write the script . He then received an e @-@ mail from showrunner Steven Moffat , who asked him to write for the next series ; Graham agreed . When the two met , Moffat said he would like the episodes to lead into the mid @-@ series finale and that it should deal with " avatars that rebel " . Initially worried this may seem too similar to the film Avatar , Graham went on to create the Flesh . Graham wanted the Gangers to be scary , but not monsters who wanted " to take over the world for the sake of it " . He wanted them to appear relatable to the audience as they were humans who deserved rights . Moffat suggested that the avatars work in a factory ; attempting to make it different from other factories featured in Doctor Who , Graham proposed to set the story in a monastery , an idea of which Moffat greatly approved . The monastery was inspired by the film The Name of the Rose , while the Gangers were influenced by The Thing ; Graham described it as " The Thing in the context of The Name of the Rose " . 
 In the early drafts of the script , there were " so many copies of people running around the place " which made the story too confusing , so Graham and the production crew worked to make it more rational . The episode also contains a subplot in which Rory helps and protects Jennifer as she is scared and affected by the Gangers , which proved a twist in Amy and Rory 's relationship . Karen Gillan enjoyed the twist . Amy had previously always had Rory " in the palm of her hand " and a different side of the character was shown as she experienced the same emotions Rory felt when she seemed interested in the Doctor . Arthur Darvill also thought it gave Rory a chance to " man up " and be a hero by protecting someone . 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 The read @-@ through for " The Rebel Flesh " and " The Almost People " took place on 12 November 2010 . It was then filmed around late November and early December . The cold temperatures at the time were a challenge and caused discomfort . The crew were concerned that the cast , particularly the three lead actors , would fall ill as their costumes were not designed for such weather conditions . Even so , the cast remained healthy . Scenes outside and inside the monastery were filmed at Caerphilly Castle , previously used in Doctor Who in The End of Time and " The Vampires of Venice " . 
 The actors each played their respective Gangers , with prosthetics applied to their faces for when the duplicates ' faces reverted to the original material of the Flesh . Moffat wanted the Gangers to appear like " eyeball matter " : white with small capillaries running through them . For the scenes in which both the character and their respective Ganger was in the same shot , a double for each of the actors was used . Most of the shots showed either the character or their Ganger speaking over their counterpart 's shoulder , as only the backs of the doubles ' head were made to look similar to the actors . 
 The episode also contains several tracks of contemporary music . In the beginning when Amy and Rory are playing darts inside in the TARDIS and the Doctor runs a pregnancy scan on Amy , the song " Supermassive Black Hole " by Muse is playing in the background . The Gangers also play " You Don 't Have to Say You Love Me " by Dusty Springfield .

 " The Rebel Flesh " received generally positive reviews by critics . Dan Martin , writing for The Guardian , said that " The Rebel Flesh " " is particularly satisfying " though it seemed that not much had happened due to it being the first part of a two @-@ part story . He praised Graham 's " believable world " and " well @-@ drawn " characters of Cleaves , Buzzer , and Jennifer . He later rated it the seventh best episode of the series , though the finale was not included in the list . The Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller called it " a very traditional @-@ style Doctor Who story " . He noted that Smith gave a more restrained performance that suited the feel of the episode , and also praised the advantage taken with the location filming for the monastery . Radio Times 's critic Patrick Mulkern considered the episode to be an improvement from Graham 's only other Doctor Who episode , " Fear Her " , though it had " failed to enthral " him . In contrast to Martin , Mulkern said that Graham 's characters were not " showing many life signs yet " with the exception of Jennifer , who was " marginally sympathetic " . 
 IGN 's Matt Risley rated the episode 8 out of 10 , saying it delivered " a solid and traditional <unk> tale , albeit one at its best " , though it was " nothing groundbreaking " yet . He went on to praise the supporting cast that " managed to sell both their flawed human originals and their progressively bonkers <unk> counterparts " as well as the setting . However , he questioned Rory 's willingness to protect Jennifer , as he thought Rory would have learned from his experiences with death to be more careful . Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars , saying that " The Rebel Flesh " " strikes a satisfying balance between the humorous and the horrific " from the cold open . He commended Graham for handling the two @-@ part structure by using extra time to explore the characters and themes , and thought the highlight of the episode were Rory 's scenes with Jennifer . However , he criticised the CGI used in some scenes , although he called the prosthetics used for the Gangers " impressive " , as well as the episode for ending in " a damp squib of a cliffhanger " that was " clearly too telegraphed throughout the episode " . 
 SFX magazine reviewer Richard Edwards gave the episode four out of five stars , saying it " looks fantastic " and praised choice of the abbey as the factory , which blew " the clichÃ© of a futuristic industrial setting apart immediately , and [ made ] you feel like you â re watching something new . " Like Jeffery , he said the visual effects were " generally pretty good " but criticised the CGI used for Jennifer 's special abilities . Keith Phipps on The A.V. Club graded it as a " B " and called it " just a pretty good episode " . His complaint was that it " truly [ felt ] like half a story in the way the best Doctor Who two @-@ <unk> don 't " , though he said it managed to plant intriguing strands for the conclusion . 
 = James Joyce = 
 James Augustine Aloysius Joyce ( 2 February 1882 â 13 January 1941 ) was an Irish novelist and poet . He contributed to the modernist avant @-@ garde , and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the twentieth century . 
 Joyce is best known for Ulysses ( 1922 ) , a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer 's Odyssey are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles , perhaps most prominent among these the stream of consciousness technique he utilized . Other well @-@ known works are the short @-@ story collection Dubliners ( 1914 ) , and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ( 1916 ) and Finnegans Wake ( 1939 ) . His other writings include three books of poetry , a play , occasional journalism , and his published letters . 
 Joyce was born in 41 Brighton Square , Rathgar , Dublin â about half a mile from his mother 's birthplace in <unk> â into a middle @-@ class family on the way down . A brilliant student , he excelled at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere , despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father 's alcoholism and unpredictable finances . He went on to attend University College Dublin . 
 In 1904 , in his early twenties , Joyce emigrated permanently to continental Europe with his partner ( and later wife ) Nora Barnacle . They lived in Trieste , Paris , and Zurich . Though most of his adult life was spent abroad , Joyce 's fictional universe centres on Dublin , and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members , enemies and friends from his time there . Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city . Shortly after the publication of Ulysses , he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat , saying , " For myself , I always write about Dublin , because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world . In the particular is contained the universal . "

 James Augustine Aloysius Joyce was born on 2 February 1882 to John Stanislaus Joyce and Mary Jane " May " Murray , in the Dublin suburb of Rathgar . He was baptized according to the Rites of the Catholic Church in the nearby St Joseph 's Church in <unk> on 5 February by Rev. John O <unk> . His godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann . He was the eldest of ten surviving children ; two of his siblings died of typhoid . 
 His father 's family , originally from Fermoy in Cork , had once owned a small salt and lime works . Joyce 's father and paternal grandfather both married into wealthy families , though the family 's purported ancestor , SeÃ¡n MÃ³r <unk> ( fl . 1680 ) was a stonemason from Connemara . In 1887 , his father was appointed rate collector ( i.e. , a collector of local property taxes ) by Dublin Corporation ; the family subsequently moved to the fashionable adjacent small town of Bray 12 miles ( 19 km ) from Dublin . Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog , which engendered in him a lifelong <unk> . He also suffered from <unk> , as a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms to him as a sign of God 's wrath . 
 In 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on the death of Charles Stewart Parnell . His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic church , the Irish Home Rule Party and the British Liberal Party and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland . The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership . But the Vatican 's role in allying with the British Conservative Party to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce . The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the Vatican Library . In November of that same year , John Joyce was entered in Stubbs Gazette ( a publisher of bankruptcies ) and suspended from work . In 1893 , John Joyce was dismissed with a pension , beginning the family 's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and general financial mismanagement . 
 Joyce had begun his education at Clongowes Wood College , a Jesuit boarding school near <unk> , County Kildare , in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees . Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O 'Connell School on North Richmond Street , Dublin , before he was offered a place in the Jesuits ' Dublin school , Belvedere College , in 1893 . This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere . In 1895 , Joyce , now aged 13 , was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere . The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life . 
 Joyce enrolled at the recently established University College Dublin ( UCD ) in 1898 , studying English , French and Italian . He also became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city . In 1900 his laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen 's When We Dead Awaken was published in Fortnightly Review ; it was his first publication and , after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen , he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist . Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays ( since lost ) during this period . Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce 's works . His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation , most notably , Thomas Kettle , Francis Sheehy @-@ Skeffington and Oliver St. John Gogarty . Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by Arthur Griffith in his newspaper , The United Irishman , in November 1901 . Joyce had written an article on the Irish Literary Theatre and his college magazine refused to print it . Joyce had it printed and distributed locally . Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce . In 1901 , the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce ( 19 ) as an English- and Irish @-@ speaking scholar living with his mother and father , six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace ( now Inverness Road ) , Clontarf , Dublin . 
 After graduating from UCD in 1902 , Joyce left for Paris to study medicine , but he soon abandoned this . Richard Ellmann suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult . Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin . But Joyce claimed ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather . He stayed on for a few months , appealing for finance his family could ill afford and reading late in the BibliothÃ¨que Sainte @-@ GeneviÃ¨ve . When his mother was diagnosed with cancer , his father sent a telegram which read , " <unk> [ sic ] <unk> COME HOME FATHER " . Joyce returned to Ireland . Fearing for her son 's impiety , his mother tried unsuccessfully to get Joyce to make his confession and to take communion . She finally passed into a coma and died on 13 August , James and his brother Stanislaus having refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside . After her death he continued to drink heavily , and conditions at home grew quite appalling . He scraped a living reviewing books , teaching , and singing â he was an accomplished tenor , and won the bronze medal in the 1904 Feis <unk> . 
 On 7 January 1904 Joyce attempted to publish A Portrait of the Artist , an essay @-@ story dealing with aesthetics , only to have it rejected by the free @-@ thinking magazine Dana . He decided , on his twenty @-@ second birthday , to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero . It was a fictional rendering of Joyce 's youth , but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work . It was never published in this form , but years later , in Trieste , Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death . 
 The same year he met Nora Barnacle , a young woman from Galway City who was working as a chambermaid . On 16 June 1904 , they first stepped out together , an event which would be commemorated by providing the date for the action of Ulysses ( as " Bloomsday " ) . 
 Joyce remained in Dublin for some time longer , drinking heavily . After one of these drinking binges , he got into a fight over a misunderstanding with a man in St Stephen 's Green ; he was picked up and dusted off by a minor acquaintance of his father , Alfred H. Hunter , who took him into his home to tend to his injuries . Hunter was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife , and would serve as one of the models for Leopold Bloom , the protagonist of Ulysses . He took up with medical student Oliver St John Gogarty , who formed the basis for the character Buck Mulligan in Ulysses . After staying for six nights in the Martello Tower that Gogarty was renting in Sandycove , he left in the middle of the night following an altercation which involved another student he lived with , the unstable Dermot Chenevix Trench ( Haines in Ulysses ) , who fired a pistol at some pans hanging directly over Joyce 's bed . Joyce walked the 8 miles ( 13 km ) back to Dublin to stay with relatives for the night , and sent a friend to the tower the next day to pack his trunk . Shortly thereafter he left Ireland with Nora to live on the Continent . 
 = = = 1904 â 20 : Trieste and Zurich = = = 
 Joyce and Nora went into self @-@ imposed exile , moving first to Zurich in Switzerland , where he had supposedly acquired a post to teach English at the Berlitz Language School through an agent in England . It turned out that the agent had been swindled ; the director of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste , which was then part of Austria @-@ Hungary ( until World War I ) , and is today part of Italy . Once again , he found there was no position for him , but with the help of <unk> <unk> , director of the Trieste Berlitz school , he finally secured a teaching position in Pola , then also part of Austria @-@ Hungary ( today part of Croatia ) . He stayed there , teaching English mainly to Austro @-@ Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base , from October 1904 until March 1905 , when the Austrians â having discovered an espionage ring in the city â expelled all aliens . With <unk> 's help , he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there . He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years . 
 Later that year Nora gave birth to their first child , George , also known as Giorgio . Joyce then managed to talk his brother , Stanislaus , into joining him in Trieste , and secured him a position teaching at the school . Joyce 's ostensible reasons were desire for Stanislaus 's company and the hope of offering him a more interesting life than that of his simple clerking job in Dublin . Joyce also hoped to augment his family 's meagre income with his brother 's earnings . Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations throughout the time they lived together in Trieste , with most arguments centring on Joyce 's drinking habits and frivolity with money . 
 Joyce became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906 , having secured employment as a letter @-@ writing clerk in a bank . He intensely disliked Rome , and moved back to Trieste in early 1907 . His daughter Lucia was born later that year . 
 Joyce returned to Dublin in mid @-@ 1909 with George , to visit his father and work on getting Dubliners published . He visited Nora 's family in Galway and liked Nora 's mother very much . While preparing to return to Trieste he decided to take one of his sisters , Eva , back with him to help Nora run the home . He spent only a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin , this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste . With their backing he launched Ireland 's first cinema , the Volta Cinematograph , which was well @-@ received , but fell apart after Joyce left . He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister , Eileen , in tow . Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later , but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent , eventually marrying Czech bank cashier Frantisek <unk> . 
 Joyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid @-@ 1912 during his years @-@ long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of Dubliners . His trip was once again fruitless , and on his return he wrote the poem " Gas from a Burner " , an invective against Roberts . After this trip , he never again came closer to Dublin than London , despite many pleas from his father and invitations from fellow Irish writer William Butler Yeats . 
 One of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz , better known by the pseudonym Italo <unk> . They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics . Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom ; most of the details about the Jewish faith in Ulysses came from Schmitz 's responses to queries from Joyce . While living in Trieste , Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations . 
 Joyce concocted a number of money @-@ making schemes during this period , including an attempt to become a cinema magnate in Dublin . He also frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste . Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in Dublin . Joyce 's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence . What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students . 
 In 1915 , after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in World War I , Joyce moved to Zurich . Two influential private students , Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco <unk> , petitioned officials for an exit permit for the <unk> , who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria @-@ Hungary during the war . In Zurich , Joyce met one of his most enduring and important friends , the English socialist painter Frank Budgen , whose opinion Joyce constantly sought through the writing of Ulysses and Finnegans Wake . It was also here that Ezra Pound brought him to the attention of English feminist and publisher Harriet Shaw Weaver , who would become Joyce 's patron , providing him with thousands of pounds over the next 25 years and relieving him of the burden of teaching to focus on his writing . While in Zurich he wrote Exiles , published A Portrait ... , and began serious work on Ulysses . Zurich during the war was home to exiles and artists from across Europe , and its bohemian , multilingual atmosphere suited him . Nevertheless , after four years he was restless , and after the war he returned to Trieste as he had originally planned . He found the city had changed , and some of his old friends noted his maturing from teacher to artist . His relations with his brother Stanislaus ( who had been interned in an Austrian prison camp for most of the war due to his pro @-@ Italian politics ) were more strained than ever . Joyce went to Paris in 1920 at an invitation from Ezra Pound , supposedly for a week , but the family ended up living there for the next twenty years . 
 = = = 1920 â 41 : Paris and Zurich = = = 
 Joyce set himself to finishing Ulysses in Paris , delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant @-@ garde writer . A further grant from Miss Shaw Weaver meant he could devote himself full @-@ time to writing again , as well as consort with other literary figures in the city . During this time , Joyce 's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an eyepatch . He was treated by Dr Louis Borsch in Paris , undergoing nine operations before Borsch 's death in 1929 . Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia , who , according to the <unk> , suffered from schizophrenia . Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung at the time , who after reading Ulysses , is said to have concluded that her father had schizophrenia . Jung said she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river , except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking . 
 In Paris , Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce during his long years of writing Finnegans Wake . Were it not for their support ( along with Harriet Shaw Weaver 's constant financial support ) , there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published . In their literary magazine " transition , " the Jolases published serially various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress . Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940 , fleeing the Nazi occupation of France . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On 11 January 1941 , he underwent surgery in Zurich for a perforated ulcer . While he at first improved , he relapsed the following day , and despite several transfusions , fell into a coma . He awoke at 2 a.m. on 13 January 1941 , and asked for a nurse to call his wife and son , before losing consciousness again . They were still on their way when he died 15 minutes later . 
 Joyce 's body was interred in the <unk> Cemetery near Zurich Zoo . Buried originally in an ordinary grave , he was moved in 1966 to a more prominent " honor grave , " with a seated statue of Joyce by American artist Milton <unk> nearby . Swiss tenor Max Meili sang Addio terra , addio cielo from Monteverdi 's L 'Orfeo at the burial service . Although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time , neither attended Joyce 's funeral , and the Irish government later declined Nora 's offer to permit the repatriation of Joyce 's remains . Nora , who had married Joyce in London in 1931 , survived him by 10 years . She is buried by his side , as is their son Giorgio , who died in 1976 . 
 = = = Joyce and religion = = = 
 The issue of Joyce 's relationship with religion is somewhat controversial . Early in life , he lapsed from Catholicism , according to first @-@ hand testimonies coming from himself , his brother Stanislaus Joyce , and his wife : 
 My mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity â home , the recognised virtues , classes of life , and religious doctrines . [ ... ] Six years ago I left the Catholic church , hating it most fervently . I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature . I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me . By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride . Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do . 
 My brother â s breakaway from Catholicism was due to other motives . He felt it was imperative that he should save his real spiritual life from being overlaid and crushed by a false one that he had outgrown . He believed that poets in the measure of their gifts and personality were the repositories of the genuine spiritual life of their race and the priests were usurpers . He detested falsity and believed in individual freedom more thoroughly than any man I have ever known . [ ... ] The interest that my brother always retained in the philosophy of the Catholic Church sprang from the fact that he considered Catholic philosophy to be the most coherent attempt to establish such an intellectual and material stability . 
 When the arrangements for Joyce 's burial were being made , a Catholic priest offered a religious service , which Joyce 's wife Nora declined , saying : " I couldn 't do that to him . " 
 However , L. A. G. Strong , William T. Noon , Robert Boyle and others have argued that Joyce , later in life , reconciled with the faith he rejected earlier in life and that his parting with the faith was succeeded by a not so obvious reunion , and that Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are essentially Catholic expressions . Likewise , Hugh Kenner and T. S. Eliot believed they saw between the lines of Joyce 's work the outlook of a serious Christian and that beneath the veneer of the work lies a remnant of Catholic belief and attitude . Kevin Sullivan maintains that , rather than reconciling with the faith , Joyce never left it . Critics holding this view insist that Stephen , the protagonist of the semi @-@ autobiographical A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as well as Ulysses , is not Joyce . Somewhat cryptically , in an interview after completing Ulysses , in response to the question " When did you leave the Catholic Church " , Joyce answered , " That 's for the Church to say . " Eamonn Hughes maintains that Joyce takes a dialectic approach , both affirming and denying , saying that Stephen 's much noted non @-@ <unk> is qualified â " I will not serve that which I no longer believe ... " , and that the non @-@ <unk> will always be balanced by Stephen 's " I am a servant ... " and Molly 's " yes " . It is also known from first hand testimonies and his own writing that Joyce attended Catholic Mass and Orthodox Sacred Liturgy , especially during Holy Week , purportedly for aesthetic reasons . His sisters also noted his Holy Week attendance and that he did not seek to dissuade them . One friend witnessed him cry " secret tears " upon hearing Jesus ' words on the cross and another accused him of being a " believer at heart " because of his frequent attendance at church . 
 Umberto Eco compares Joyce to the ancient episcopi <unk> ( wandering bishops ) in the Middle Ages . They left a discipline , not a cultural heritage or a way of thinking . Like them , the writer retains the sense of blasphemy held as a liturgical ritual . 
 Some critics and biographers have opined along the lines of Andrew Gibson : " The modern James Joyce may have vigorously resisted the oppressive power of Catholic tradition . But there was another Joyce who asserted his allegiance to that tradition , and never left it , or wanted to leave it , behind him . " Gibson argues that Joyce " remained a Catholic intellectual if not a believer " since his thinking remained influenced by his cultural background , even though he dissented from that culture . His relationship with religion was complex and not easily understood , even perhaps by himself . He acknowledged the debt he owed to his early Jesuit training . Joyce told the sculptor August Suter , that from his Jesuit education , he had ' learnt to arrange things in such a way that they become easy to survey and to <unk> 
 = = = Joyce and music = = = 
 Music is central to Joyce 's biography and to the understanding of his writings . In turn , Joyce 's poetry and prose became an inspiration for composers and musicians . There are at least five aspects to consider : 
 1 . Joyce 's musicality : Joyce had considerable musical talent , which expressed itself in his singing , piano and guitar playing , as well as in a melody that he composed . His own musicality ( which once made him consider music as a profession ) is the root of his strong adoption of music as a major driving force in his fiction , in addition to his own experience of music in Ireland before he left in 1904 . Joyce had a light tenor voice ; he was taught by Vincent O 'Brien and Benedetto Palmieri ; in 1904 won a bronze medal at the competitive music festival Feis <unk> . His only composition is a melody to his poem Bid adieu , to which a piano accompaniment was added in the 1920s in Paris by the American composer Edmund J. Pendleton ( 1899 â 1987 ) . 
 2 . The music Joyce knew : Music frequently found its way into Joyce 's poetry and prose . Often this happens in the form of allusions to ( or partial quotations from ) texts of Irish traditional songs , popular ballads , Roman Catholic chant and opera arias . His operatic references include works by Balfe , Wallace and Arthur Sullivan , in addition to Meyerbeer , Mozart , and Wagner ( among many others ) . Joyce also makes frequent use of the Irish Melodies of Thomas Moore and ballads such as George Barker 's Dublin Bay and J.L. Molloy 's Love 's Old Sweet Song . 
 3 . Opera as a genre : Joyce had a lifelong preoccupation with opera as a generic precedent for his own fiction . Although Joyce scholarship has long identified an explicit recourse to musical structures in Ulysses ( in particular the ' Sirens ' episode ) and Finnegans Wake , more recent criticism has established a decisive reliance on Wagner 's Ring in Finnegans Wake and an attempt to adapt the structures of opera and oratorio to the medium of fiction , notably in the ' Cyclops ' episode of Ulysses . George Antheil 's unfinished setting of ' Cyclops ' as an opera attests this attempt . 
 4 . Music to Joyce 's words : Music that uses Joyce 's texts most frequently appears as settings of his poems in songs , and occasionally as excerpts from prose works . Irish composers were among the first to set Joyce 's poetry , including Geoffrey Molyneux Palmer ( 1882 â 1957 ) , Herbert Hughes ( 1882 â 1937 ) and Brian Boydell ( 1917 â 2000 ) , but the musical qualities of Joyce 's verse also attracted European and North American composers , with early settings by Karol Szymanowski ( Songs to Words by James Joyce op . 54 , 1926 ) and Samuel Barber ( Three Songs op . 10 , 1936 ) in addition to settings by major exponents of the 1950s and ' 60s avant @-@ garde such as Elliott Carter ( String Quartet No. 1 , 1951 ) and Luciano Berio ( Chamber Music , 1953 ; Thema ( <unk> a Joyce ) , 1958 ; etc . ) In 2015 <unk> and <unk> presented an unabridged version of Finnegans Wake , collaboratively read and set to music , by contributors from around the globe . 
 5 . Music inspired by Joyce : Often , instrumental music was also inspired by Joyce 's writings , including works by Pierre Boulez , Klaus Huber , Rebecca Saunders , Toru Takemitsu and Gerard Victory . With Luciano Berio 's Thema ( <unk> a Joyce ) ( 1958 ) there is also a key work in the development of electro @-@ acoustic music . In 2014 the English composer Stephen Crowe set Joyce 's explicit letters to Nora as a song @-@ cycle for tenor and ensemble . 
 Joyce himself took a keen interest in musical settings of his work , performed some of them himself , and corresponded with many of the composers . He was particularly fond of the early settings by Palmer . 
 = = Major works = = 
 = = = Dubliners = = = 
 Joyce 's Irish experiences constitute an essential element of his writings , and provide all of the settings for his fiction and much of its subject matter . His early volume of short stories , Dubliners , is a penetrating analysis of the stagnation and paralysis of Dublin society . The stories incorporate epiphanies , a word used particularly by Joyce , by which he meant a sudden consciousness of the " soul " of a thing . 
 = = = A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man = = = 
 A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel Stephen Hero . Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora , though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister . A KÃ¼nstlerroman , Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming @-@ of @-@ age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self @-@ consciousness . Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works , such as stream of consciousness , interior monologue , and references to a character 's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings , are evident throughout this novel . Joseph Strick directed a film of the book in 1977 starring Luke Johnston , Bosco Hogan , T. P. McKenna and John Gielgud . 
 = = = Exiles and poetry = = = 
 Despite early interest in the theatre , Joyce published only one play , Exiles , begun shortly after the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and published in 1918 . A study of a husband and wife relationship , the play looks back to The Dead ( the final story in Dubliners ) and forward to Ulysses , which Joyce began around the time of the play 's composition . 
 Joyce also published a number of books of poetry . His first mature published work was the satirical broadside " The Holy Office " ( 1904 ) , in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the Celtic Revival . His first full @-@ length poetry collection Chamber Music ( 1907 ; referring , Joyce joked , to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot ) consisted of 36 short lyrics . This publication led to his inclusion in the Imagist Anthology , edited by Ezra Pound , who was a champion of Joyce 's work . Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime includes " Gas From A Burner " ( 1912 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 1927 ) and " Ecce <unk> " ( written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father ) . It was published by the Black Sun Press in Collected Poems ( 1936 ) . 
 = = = Ulysses = = = 
 As he was completing work on Dubliners in 1906 , Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom under the title Ulysses . Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time , he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914 . The writing was completed in October 1921 . Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self @-@ imposed deadline , his 40th birthday ( 2 February 1922 ) . 
 Thanks to Ezra Pound , serial publication of the novel in the magazine The Little Review began in March 1918 . This magazine was edited by Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap , with the intermittent financial backing of John Quinn , a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature . Unfortunately , this publication encountered problems with New York Postal Authorities ; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920 ; the editors were convicted of publishing obscenity in February 1921 . Although the conviction was based on the " NausicaÃ¤ " episode of Ulysses , The Little Review had fuelled the fires of controversy with dada poet Elsa von Freytag @-@ Loringhoven 's defence of Ulysses in an essay " The Modest Woman . " Joyce 's novel was not published in the United States until 1933 . 
 Partly because of this controversy , Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book , but it was published in 1922 by Sylvia Beach from her well @-@ known Rive <unk> bookshop , Shakespeare and Company . An English edition published the same year by Joyce 's patron , Harriet Shaw Weaver , ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities , and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed . The following year , John Rodker produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies , but these were burned by English customs at Folkestone . A further consequence of the novel 's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of " bootleg " versions appeared , most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher Samuel Roth . In 1928 , a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication . 
 With the appearance of both Ulysses and T. S. Eliot 's poem The Waste Land , 1922 was a key year in the history of English @-@ language literary modernism . In Ulysses , Joyce employs stream of consciousness , parody , jokes , and virtually every other established literary technique to present his characters . The action of the novel , which takes place in a single day , 16 June 1904 , sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin and represents Odysseus ( Ulysses ) , Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom , his wife Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus , parodically contrasted with their lofty models . Both Bloom and Dedalus represent Joyce in difference ages : youth and middle age . And both relate to each other symbolically in the novel as father and son . The key to this father / son relationship is revealed by Stephen on the Sandymount strand when he contemplates the Nicene Creed and the ' consubstantial ' relationship of God the Father to Son . The book explores various areas of Dublin life , dwelling on its squalor and monotony . Nevertheless , the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city , and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt , brick by brick , using his work as a model . To achieve this level of accuracy , Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom 's Directory â a work that listed the owners and / or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city . He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification . The book consists of 18 chapters , each covering roughly one hour of the day , beginning around 8 a.m. and ending sometime after 2 a.m. the following morning . Each chapter employs its own literary style , and parodies a specific episode in Homer 's Odyssey . Furthermore , each chapter is associated with a specific colour , art or science , and bodily organ . This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal schematic structure renders the book a major contribution to the development of 20th @-@ century modernist literature . The use of classical mythology as an organising framework , the near @-@ obsessive focus on external detail , and the occurrence of significant action within the minds of characters have also contributed to the development of literary modernism . Nevertheless , Joyce complained that , " I may have <unk> Ulysses , " and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer . Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form . It was only when Stuart Gilbert published his critical work on Ulysses in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert . But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel . A first edition copy of Ulysses is on display at The Little Museum of Dublin . 
 = = = Finnegans Wake = = = 
 Having completed work on Ulysses , Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year . On 10 March 1923 he informed a patron , Harriet Weaver : " Yesterday I wrote two pages â the first I have since the final Yes of Ulysses . Having found a pen , with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of <unk> so that I could read them . Il <unk> <unk> il <unk> ma non il <unk> , the Italians say . ' The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice ' or ' the leopard cannot change his spots . ' " Thus was born a text that became known , first , as Work in Progress and later Finnegans Wake . 
 By 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book . In that year , he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition . For the next few years , Joyce worked rapidly on the new book , but in the 1930s , progress slowed considerably . This was due to a number of factors , including the death of his father in 1931 , concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia , and his own health problems , including failing eyesight . Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers , including Samuel Beckett . For some years , Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete , on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later , and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce 's fictional alter @-@ ego , an example of Joyce 's superstitions . 
 Reaction to the work was mixed , including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce 's work , such as Pound and the author 's brother , Stanislaus Joyce . To counteract this hostile reception , a book of essays by supporters of the new work , including Beckett , William Carlos Williams and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress . At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases ' home , Joyce revealed the final title of the work and Finnegans Wake was published in book form on 4 May 1939 . Later , further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author Hervey Cleckley , who questioned the significance others had placed on the work . In his book , The Mask of Sanity , Cleckley refers to Finnegans Wake as " a 628 @-@ page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital . " 
 Joyce 's method of stream of consciousness , literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in Finnegans Wake , which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English , based mainly on complex multi @-@ level puns . This approach is similar to , but far more extensive than that used by Lewis Carroll in Jabberwocky . This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce 's oft @-@ quoted description in the Wake of Ulysses as his " <unk> unreadable Blue Book of Eccles " to the Wake itself . However , readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot . 
 Much of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages . The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and , as Joyce 's eyesight worsened , of writing the text from the author 's dictation . 
 The view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by Giambattista Vico , and the metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola are important to the interplay of the " characters . " Vico propounded a cyclical view of history , in which civilisation rose from chaos , passed through theocratic , aristocratic , and democratic phases , and then lapsed back into chaos . The most obvious example of the influence of Vico 's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book . Finnegans Wake opens with the words " riverrun , past Eve and Adam 's , from swerve of shore to bend of bay , brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs . " ( " vicus " is a pun on Vico ) and ends " A way a lone a last a loved a long the . " In other words , the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence , turning the book into one great cycle . Indeed , Joyce said that the ideal reader of the Wake would suffer from " ideal insomnia " and , on completing the book , would turn to page one and start again , and so on in an endless cycle of reading .

 Joyce 's work has been an important influence on writers and scholars as diverse as Samuel Beckett , SeÃ¡n Ã <unk> , Jorge Luis Borges , Flann O 'Brien , Salman Rushdie , Robert Anton Wilson , John Updike , David Lodge and Joseph Campbell . Ulysses has been called " a demonstration and summation of the entire [ Modernist ] movement " . French literary theorist Julia <unk> characterised Joyce 's novel writing as " polyphonic " and a hallmark of postmodernity alongside poets MallarmÃ© and Rimbaud . 
 Some scholars , most notably Vladimir Nabokov , have mixed feelings on his work , often championing some of his fiction while condemning other works . In Nabokov 's opinion , Ulysses was brilliant , Finnegans Wake horrible â an attitude Jorge Luis Borges shared . 
 Joyce 's influence is also evident in fields other than literature . The sentence " Three quarks for Muster Mark ! " in Joyce 's Finnegans Wake is the source of the word " quark " , the name of one of the elementary particles proposed by the physicist Murray Gell @-@ Mann in 1963 . The French philosopher Jacques Derrida has written a book on the use of language in Ulysses , and the American philosopher Donald Davidson has written similarly on Finnegans Wake in comparison with Lewis Carroll . Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan used Joyce 's writings to explain his concept of the <unk> . According to Lacan , Joyce 's writing is the supplementary cord which kept Joyce from psychosis . 
 In 1999 , Time magazine named Joyce one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century , and stated : " Joyce ... revolutionised 20th century fiction " . In 1998 , the Modern Library , US publisher of Joyce 's works , ranked Ulysses No. 1 , A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man No. 3 , and Finnegans Wake No. 77 , on its list of the 100 best English @-@ language novels of the 20th century . 
 The work and life of Joyce is celebrated annually on 16 June , known as Bloomsday , in Dublin and in an increasing number of cities worldwide , and critical studies in scholarly publications , such as the James Joyce Quarterly , continue . Both popular and academic uses of Joyce 's work were hampered by restrictions placed by Stephen J. Joyce , Joyce 's grandson and executor of his literary estate . On 1 January 2012 , those restrictions were lessened by the expiry of copyright protection for much of the published work of James Joyce . 
 In April 2013 the Central Bank of Ireland issued a silver â¬ 10 commemorative coin in honour of Joyce that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork Ulysses . 
 The Irish Naval Service named an offshore patrol vessel in Joyce 's honour . In a service attended by members of the Joyce family , the <unk> James Joyce ( <unk> ) was commissioned on 1 September 2015 . 
 = Nazi Germany = 
 Nazi Germany , also known as the Third Reich ( German : <unk> Reich ) , was a period in German history from 1933 to 1945 , when the country was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany was transformed into a fascist totalitarian state which controlled nearly all aspects of life . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( " German Reich " , " German Empire " or " German Realm " ) from 1933 to 1943 and <unk> Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany ceased to exist after the Allied Forces defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . 
 Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933 . The Nazi Party then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 , and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole FÃ¼hrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person , and his word became above all laws . The government was not a coordinated , co @-@ operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour . In the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy . Extensive public works were undertaken , including the construction of <unk> ( high speed highways ) . The return to economic stability boosted the regime 's popularity . 
 Racism , especially antisemitism , was a central feature of the regime . The Germanic peoples ( the Nordic race ) were considered by the Nazis to be the purest branch of the Aryan race , and were therefore viewed as the master race . Millions of Jews and others deemed undesirable were murdered in the Holocaust . Opposition to Hitler 's rule was ruthlessly suppressed . Members of the liberal , socialist , and communist opposition were killed , imprisoned , or exiled . The Christian churches were also oppressed , with many leaders imprisoned . Education focused on racial biology , population policy , and fitness for military service . Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed . Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program , and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage . Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film , mass rallies , and Hitler 's hypnotising oratory to control public opinion . The government controlled artistic expression , promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others . 
 Beginning in the late 1930s , Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands , threatening war if they were not met . It seized Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939 . Hitler made a pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939 , launching World War II in Europe . In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers , Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain . <unk> took control of conquered areas , and a German administration was established in what was left of Poland . Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned , murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps , or shot . The regime 's racial policies turned genocidal , culminating in the mass murder of Jews and other minorities in the Holocaust . The plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe was formalized in the 1942 Wannsee Conference , replacing the previous policy of forced emigration of Jews from the Reich . 
 Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 , the tide gradually turned against the Nazis , who suffered major military defeats in 1943 . Large @-@ scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 , and the Axis powers were pushed back in Eastern and Southern Europe . Following the Allied invasion of France , Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the other Allied powers from the west and capitulated within a year . Hitler 's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war @-@ related deaths in the closing months of the war . The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials . 
 = = Name = = 
 The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) from 1933 to 1943 , and <unk> Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . The name Deutsches Reich is usually translated into English as " German Empire " or " German Reich " . 
 Common English terms are " Nazi Germany " and " Third Reich " . The latter , adopted by Nazi propaganda , was first used in a 1923 book by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck . The book counted the Holy Roman Empire ( 962 â 1806 ) as the first Reich and the German Empire ( 1871 â 1918 ) as the second . The Nazis used it to legitimize their regime as a successor state . After they seized power , Nazi propaganda retroactively referred to the Weimar Republic as the <unk> ( " Interim Reich " ) . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The German economy suffered severe setbacks after the end of World War I , partly because of reparations payments required under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles . The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country 's war debt ; the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods , economic chaos , and food riots . When the government failed to make the reparations payments in January 1923 , French troops occupied German industrial areas along the Ruhr . Widespread civil unrest followed . 
 The National Socialist German Workers ' Party ( NSDAP ; Nazi Party ) was the renamed successor of the German Workers ' Party founded in 1919 , one of several far @-@ right political parties active in Germany at the time . The party platform included removal of the Weimar Republic , rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , radical antisemitism , and anti @-@ Bolshevism . They promised a strong central government , increased Lebensraum ( living space ) for Germanic peoples , formation of a national community based on race , and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews , who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights . The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the VÃ¶lkisch movement . 
 When the stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929 , the impact in Germany was dire . Millions were thrown out of work , and several major banks collapsed . Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party . They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs . Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order , quelling civil unrest , and improving Germany 's international reputation . After the federal election of 1932 , the Nazis were the largest party in the Reichstag , holding 230 seats with 37 @.@ 4 percent of the popular vote . 
 = = = Nazi seizure of power = = = 
 Although the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932 , they did not have a majority , so Hitler led a short @-@ lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People 's Party . Under pressure from politicians , industrialists , and the business community , President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 . This event is known as the Machtergreifung ( seizure of power ) . In the following months , the NSDAP used a process termed Gleichschaltung ( co @-@ ordination ) to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party . All civilian organisations , including agricultural groups , volunteer organisations , and sports clubs , had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members . By June 1933 , virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches . 
 On the night of 27 February 1933 , the Reichstag building was set afire ; Marinus van der Lubbe , a Dutch communist , was found guilty of starting the blaze . Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising . Violent suppression of communists by the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) was undertaken all over the country , and four thousand members of the Communist Party of Germany were arrested . The Reichstag Fire Decree , imposed on 28 February 1933 , rescinded most German civil liberties , including rights of assembly and freedom of the press . The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges or a court order . The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda blitz that led to public support for the measure . 
 In March 1933 , the Enabling Act , an amendment to the Weimar Constitution , passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94 . This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws â even laws that violated the constitution â without the consent of the president or the Reichstag . As the bill required a two @-@ thirds majority to pass , the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending ; the Communists had already been banned . On 10 May the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats ; they were banned in June . The remaining political parties were dissolved , and on 14 July 1933 , Germany became a de facto one @-@ party state when the founding of new parties was made illegal . Further elections in November 1933 , 1936 , and 1938 were entirely Nazi @-@ controlled and saw only the Nazis and a small number of independents elected . The regional state parliaments and the <unk> ( federal upper house ) were abolished in January 1934 . 
 The Nazi regime abolished the symbols of the Weimar Republic , including the black , red , and gold tricolour flag , and adopted reworked imperial symbolism . The previous imperial black , white , and red tricolour was restored as one of Germany 's two official flags ; the second was the swastika flag of the NSDAP , which became the sole national flag in 1935 . The NSDAP anthem " Horst @-@ Wessel @-@ Lied " ( " Horst Wessel Song " ) became a second national anthem . 
 In this period , Germany was still in a dire economic situation ; millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting . Hitler knew that reviving the economy was vital . In 1934 , using deficit spending , public works projects were undertaken . A total of 1 @.@ 7 million Germans were put to work on the projects in 1934 alone . Average wages both per hour and per week began to rise . 
 The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military , industrial , and political leaders . In response , Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives , which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934 . Hitler targeted Ernst RÃ¶hm and other SA leaders who , along with a number of Hitler 's political adversaries ( such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher ) , were rounded up , arrested , and shot . 
 On 2 August 1934 , President von Hindenburg died . The previous day , the cabinet had enacted the " Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich " , which stated that upon Hindenburg 's death , the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor . Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government . He was formally named as FÃ¼hrer und Reichskanzler ( leader and chancellor ) . Germany was now a totalitarian state with Hitler at its head . As head of state , Hitler became Supreme Commander of the armed forces . The new law altered the traditional loyalty oath of servicemen so that they affirmed loyalty to Hitler personally rather than the office of supreme commander or the state . On 19 August , the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 90 percent of the electorate in a plebiscite . 
 Most Germans were relieved that the conflicts and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended . They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels , who promised peace and plenty for all in a united , Marxist @-@ free country without the constraints of the Versailles Treaty . The first Nazi concentration camp , initially for political prisoners , was opened at Dachau in 1933 . Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created by the end of the war . Upon seizing power , the Nazis took repressive measures against their political opposition and rapidly began the comprehensive marginalisation of persons they considered socially undesirable . Under the guise of combating the Communist threat , the National Socialists secured immense power . Above all , their campaign against Jews living in Germany gained momentum . 
 Beginning in April 1933 , scores of measures defining the status of Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level . Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination with the establishment of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 , stripping them of their basic rights . The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth , their right to intermarry with non @-@ Jews , and their right to occupy many fields of labour ( such as practising law , medicine , or working as educators ) . They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society , which over time <unk> the Jews ; arguably , these actions desensitised Germans to the extent that it resulted in the Holocaust . Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo , had their rights removed , or were sent to concentration camps . Everyone and everything was monitored in Nazi Germany . <unk> and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities , then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available , through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party ( which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose ) , and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions .

 As early as February 1933 , Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken , albeit clandestinely at first , as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty . A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east . He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933 , claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair , as they applied only to Germany . The Saarland , which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I , voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany . In March 1935 Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550 @,@ 000 men and that he was creating an air force . Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo @-@ German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935 . 
 When the Italian invasion of Ethiopia led to only mild protests by the British and French governments , on 7 March 1936 Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht Heer ground forces to march 3 @,@ 000 troops into the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in violation of the Versailles Treaty ; an additional 30 @,@ 000 troops were on standby . As the territory was part of Germany , the British and French governments did not feel that attempting to enforce the treaty was worth the risk of war . In the one @-@ party election held on 29 March , the NSDAP received 98 @.@ 9 percent support . In 1936 Hitler signed an Anti @-@ Comintern Pact with Japan and a non @-@ aggression agreement with the Fascist Italy of Benito Mussolini , who was soon referring to a " Rome @-@ Berlin Axis " . 
 Hitler sent air and armoured units to assist General Francisco Franco and his Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War , which broke out in July 1936 . The Soviet Union sent a smaller force to assist the Republican government . Franco 's Nationalists were victorious in 1939 and became an informal ally of Nazi Germany . 
 = = = Austria and Czechoslovakia = = = 
 In February 1938 , Hitler emphasised to Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg the need for Germany to secure its frontiers . Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite regarding Austrian independence for 13 March , but Hitler demanded that it be cancelled . On 11 March , Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg demanding that he hand over all power to the Austrian NSDAP or face an invasion . The Wehrmacht entered Austria the next day , to be greeted with enthusiasm by the populace . 
 The Republic of Czechoslovakia was home to a substantial minority of Germans , who lived mostly in the Sudetenland . Under pressure from separatist groups within the Sudeten German Party , the Czechoslovak government offered economic concessions to the region . Hitler decided to incorporate not just the Sudetenland but the whole of Czechoslovakia into the Reich . The Nazis undertook a propaganda campaign to try to drum up support for an invasion . Top leaders of the armed forces were not in favour of the plan , as Germany was not yet ready for war . The crisis led to war preparations by the British , the Czechoslovaks , and France ( Czechoslovakia 's ally ) . Attempting to avoid war , British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain arranged a series of meetings , the result of which was the Munich Agreement , signed on 29 September 1938 . The Czechoslovak government was forced to accept the Sudetenland 's annexation into Germany . Chamberlain was greeted with cheers when he landed in London bringing , he said , " peace for our time . " The agreement lasted six months before Hitler seized the rest of Czech territory in March 1939 . A puppet state was created in Slovakia . 
 Austrian and Czech foreign exchange reserves were soon seized by the Nazis , as were stockpiles of raw materials such as metals and completed goods such as weaponry and aircraft , which were shipped back to Germany . The <unk> Hermann GÃ¶ring industrial conglomerate took control of steel and coal production facilities in both countries . 
 = = = Poland = = = 
 In March 1939 , Hitler demanded the return of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor , a strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany . The British announced they would come to the aid of Poland if it was attacked . Hitler , believing the British would not actually take action , ordered an invasion plan should be readied for a target date of September 1939 . On 23 May he described to his generals his overall plan of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland . He expected this time they would be met by force . 
 The Germans reaffirmed their alliance with Italy and signed non @-@ aggression pacts with Denmark , Estonia , and Latvia . Trade links were formalised with Romania , Norway , and Sweden . Hitler 's foreign minister , Joachim von Ribbentrop , arranged in negotiations with the Soviet Union a non @-@ aggression pact , the Molotov â Ribbentrop Pact , which was signed in August 1939 . The treaty also contained secret protocols dividing Poland and the Baltic states into German and Soviet spheres of influence .

 Germany 's foreign policy during the war involved the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin . A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies , such as Italy and Hungary , and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France . By the fall of 1942 , there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front , 10 from Italy , and 10 from Hungary . When a country was no longer dependable , Germany assumed full control , as it did with France in 1942 , Italy in 1943 , and Hungary in 1944 . Although Japan was an official powerful ally , the relationship was distant and there was little co @-@ ordination or co @-@ operation . For example , Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal until late in the war .

 Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 . Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later . World War II was under way . Poland fell quickly , as the Soviet Union attacked from the east on 17 September . Reinhard Heydrich , then head of the Gestapo , ordered on 21 September that Jews should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links . Initially the intention was to deport the Jews to points further east , or possibly to Madagascar . Using lists prepared ahead of time , some 65 @,@ 000 Polish intelligentsia , noblemen , clergy , and teachers were killed by the end of 1939 in an attempt to destroy Poland 's identity as a nation . The Soviet forces continued to attack , advancing into Finland in the Winter War , and German forces were involved in action at sea . But little other activity occurred until May , so the period became known as the " Phoney War " . 
 From the start of the war , a British blockade on shipments to Germany had an impact on the Reich economy . The Germans were particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil , coal , and grain . To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany , Hitler ordered an attack on Norway , which took place on 9 April 1940 . Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April . Also on 9 April , the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark . 
 = = = = Conquest of Europe = = = = 
 Against the judgement of many of his senior military officers , Hitler ordered an attack on France and the Low Countries , which began in May 1940 . They quickly conquered Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and Belgium , and France surrendered on 22 June . The unexpectedly swift defeat of France resulted in an upswing in Hitler 's popularity and a strong upsurge in war fever . 
 In spite of the provisions of the Hague Convention , industrial firms in the Netherlands , France , and Belgium were put to work producing war materiel for the occupying German military . Officials viewed this option as being preferable to their citizens being deported to the Reich as forced labour . 
 The Nazis seized from the French thousands of locomotives and rolling stock , stockpiles of weapons , and raw materials such as copper , tin , oil , and nickel . Financial demands were levied on the governments of the occupied countries as well ; payments for occupation costs were received from France , Belgium , and Norway . Barriers to trade led to hoarding , black markets , and uncertainty about the future . Food supplies were precarious ; production dropped in most areas of Europe , but not as much as during World War I. Greece experienced famine in the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war . 
 Hitler made peace overtures to the new British leader , Winston Churchill , and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations . However , the German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain . By the end of October , Hitler realised the necessary air superiority for his planned invasion of Britain could not be achieved , and he ordered nightly air raids on British cities , including London , Plymouth , and Coventry . 
 In February 1941 , the German Afrika Korps arrived in Libya to aid the Italians in the North African Campaign and attempt to contain Commonwealth forces stationed in Egypt . On 6 April , Germany launched the invasion of Yugoslavia and the battle of Greece . German efforts to secure oil included negotiating a supply from their new ally , Romania , who signed the Tripartite Pact in November 1940 . 
 On 22 June 1941 , contravening the Molotov â Ribbentrop Pact , 5 @.@ 5 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union . In addition to Hitler 's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum , this large @-@ scale offensive ( codenamed Operation Barbarossa ) was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers . The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation . Many were concerned about how much longer the war would drag on or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts . 
 The invasion conquered a huge area , including the Baltic republics , Belarus , and West Ukraine . After the successful Battle of Smolensk , Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev . This pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves . The Moscow offensive , which resumed in October 1941 , ended disastrously in December . On 7 December 1941 , Japan attacked Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . Four days later , Germany declared war on the United States . 
 Food was in short supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland , with rations inadequate to meet nutritional needs . The retreating armies had burned the crops , and much of the remainder was sent back to the Reich . In Germany itself , food rations had to be cut in 1942 . In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan , Hermann GÃ¶ring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway . The 1942 harvest was a good one , and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe . 
 Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce was an organisation set up to loot artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections , libraries , and museums throughout Europe . Some 26 @,@ 000 railroad cars full of art treasures , furniture , and other looted items were sent back to Germany from France alone . In addition , soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing â items which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany â for shipment back home . 
 = = = = Turning point and collapse = = = = 
 Germany , and Europe as a whole , was almost totally dependent on foreign oil imports . In an attempt to resolve the persistent shortage , Germany launched Fall Blau ( Case Blue ) , an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields , in June 1942 . The Red Army launched a counter @-@ offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces , who were trapped in Stalingrad on 23 November . GÃ¶ring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air , but this turned out to be infeasible . Hitler 's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200 @,@ 000 German and Romanian soldiers ; of the 91 @,@ 000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943 , only 6 @,@ 000 survivors returned to Germany after the war . Soviet forces continued to push the invaders westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk , and by the end of 1943 , the Germans had lost most of their territorial gains in the east . 
 In Egypt , Field Marshal Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Korps were defeated by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942 . Allied forces landed in Sicily in July 1943 , and in Italy in September . Meanwhile , American and British bomber fleets , based in Britain , began operations against Germany . In an effort to destroy German morale , many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets . Soon German aircraft production could not keep pace with losses , and without air cover , the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating . By targeting oil refineries and factories , they crippled the German war effort by late 1944 . 
 On 6 June 1944 , American , British , and Canadian forces established a western front with the D @-@ Day landings in Normandy . On 20 July 1944 , Hitler narrowly survived a bomb attack . He ordered savage reprisals , resulting in 7 @,@ 000 arrests and the execution of more than 4 @,@ 900 people . The failed Ardennes Offensive ( 16 December 1944 â 25 January 1945 ) was the last major German campaign of the war . Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January . Hitler 's refusal to admit defeat and his repeated insistence that the war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the closing months of the war . Through his Justice Minister , Otto Georg <unk> , he ordered that anyone who was not prepared to fight should be summarily court @-@ martialed . Thousands of people were put to death . In many areas , people looked for ways to surrender to the approaching Allies , in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue the struggle . Hitler also ordered the intentional destruction of transport , bridges , industries , and other infrastructure â a scorched earth decree â but Armaments Minister Albert Speer was able to keep this order from being fully carried out . 
 During the Battle of Berlin ( 16 April 1945 â 2 May 1945 ) , Hitler and his staff lived in the underground FÃ¼hrerbunker , while the Red Army approached . On 30 April , when Soviet troops were one or two blocks away from the Reich Chancellery , Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide in the FÃ¼hrerbunker . On 2 May General Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov . Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl DÃ¶nitz as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor . Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide the next day , after murdering their six children . On 4 â 8 May 1945 most of the remaining German armed forces surrendered unconditionally . The German Instrument of Surrender was signed 7 May , marking the end of World War II in Europe . 
 Suicide rates in Germany increased as the war drew to a close , particularly in areas where the Red Army was advancing . More than a thousand people ( out of a population of around 16 @,@ 000 ) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town , committing mass rapes , arbitrarily executing civilians , and setting fire to buildings . High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations , including <unk> ( 600 dead ) , <unk> in Pommern ( 1 @,@ 000 dead ) , and Berlin , where at least 7 @,@ 057 people committed suicide in 1945 . 
 = = = = German casualties = = = = 
 Estimates of the total German war dead range from 5 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 9 million persons . A study by German historian RÃ¼diger <unk> puts the number of German military dead and missing at 5 @.@ 3 million , including 900 @,@ 000 men conscripted from outside of Germany 's 1937 borders , in Austria , and in east @-@ central Europe . Overy estimated in 2014 that in all about 353 @,@ 000 civilians were killed by British and American bombing of German cities . An additional 20 @,@ 000 died in the land campaign . Some 22 @,@ 000 citizens died during the Battle of Berlin . Other civilian deaths include 300 @,@ 000 Germans ( including Jews ) who were victims of Nazi political , racial , and religious persecution , and 200 @,@ 000 who were murdered in the Nazi euthanasia program . Political courts called <unk> sentenced some 12 @,@ 000 members of the German resistance to death , and civil courts sentenced an additional 40 @,@ 000 Germans . Mass rapes of German women also took place . 
 At the end of the war , Europe had more than 40 million refugees , its economy had collapsed , and 70 percent of its industrial infrastructure was destroyed . Between twelve and fourteen million ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from east @-@ central Europe to Germany . During the Cold War , the West German government estimated a death toll of 2 @.@ 2 million civilians due to the flight and expulsion of Germans and through forced labour in the Soviet Union . This figure remained unchallenged until the 1990s , when some historians put the death toll at 500 @,@ 000 â 600 @,@ 000 confirmed deaths . In 2006 the German government reaffirmed its position that 2 @.@ 0 â 2 @.@ 5 million deaths occurred .

The Saarland temporarily became a protectorate of France , under the condition that its residents would later decide by referendum which country to join . Poland became a separate nation and was given access to the sea by the creation of the Polish Corridor , which separated Prussia from the rest of Germany . Danzig was made a free city . 
 Germany regained control of the Saarland via a referendum held in 1935 and annexed Austria in the Anschluss of 1938 . The Munich Agreement of 1938 gave Germany control of the Sudetenland , and they seized the remainder of Czechoslovakia six months later . Under threat of invasion by sea , Lithuania surrendered the Memel district in March 1939 . 
 Between 1939 and 1941 , German forces invaded Poland , France , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Belgium , and the Soviet Union . Trieste , South Tyrol , and Istria were ceded to Germany by Mussolini in 1943 . Two puppet districts were set up in the area , the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral and the Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills . 
 = = = Occupied territories = = = 
 Some of the conquered territories were immediately incorporated into Germany as part of Hitler 's long @-@ term goal of creating a Greater Germanic Reich . Several areas , such as Alsace @-@ Lorraine , were placed under the authority of an adjacent Gau ( regional district ) . Beyond the territories incorporated into Germany were the <unk> ( Reich <unk> ) , quasi @-@ colonial regimes established in a number of occupied countries . Areas placed under German administration included the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia , Reichskommissariat Ostland ( encompassing the Baltic states and Belarus ) , and Reichskommissariat Ukraine . Conquered areas of Belgium and France were placed under control of the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France . Belgian Eupen @-@ Malmedy , which had been part of German until 1919 , was annexed directly . Part of Poland was immediately incorporated into the Reich , and the General Government was established in occupied central Poland . Hitler intended to eventually incorporate many of these areas into the Reich . 
 The governments of Denmark , Norway ( Reichskommissariat Norwegen ) , and the Netherlands ( Reichskommissariat Niederlande ) were placed under civilian administrations staffed largely by natives .

 With the issuance of the Berlin Declaration on 5 June 1945 and later creation of the Allied Control Council , the four Allied powers temporarily assumed governance of Germany . At the Potsdam Conference in August 1945 , the Allies arranged for the Allied occupation and denazification of the country . Germany was split into four zones , each occupied by one of the Allied powers , who drew reparations from their zone . Since most of the industrial areas were in the western zones , the Soviet Union was transferred additional reparations . The Allied Control Council disestablished Prussia on 20 May 1947 . Aid to Germany began arriving from the United States under the Marshall Plan in 1948 . The occupation lasted until 1949 , when the countries of East Germany and West Germany were created . Germany finalised her border with Poland by signing the Treaty of Warsaw ( 1970 ) . Germany remained divided until 1990 , when the Allies renounced all claims to German territory with the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany , under which Germany also renounced claims to territories lost during World War II . 
 = = Politics = = 
 = = = Ideology = = = 
 The NSDAP was a far @-@ right political party which came into its own during the social and financial upheavals that occurred with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 . While in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 , Hitler wrote Mein Kampf , which laid out his plan for transforming German society into one based on race . The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism , racial hygiene , and eugenics , and combined them with pan @-@ Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum for the Germanic people . The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union , intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there , who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race and part of a Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy . The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by International Jewry . Others deemed life unworthy of life by the Nazis included the mentally and physically disabled , Romani people , homosexuals , Jehovah 's Witnesses , and social misfits . 
 Influenced by the VÃ¶lkisch movement , the regime was against cultural modernism and supported the development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism . Creativity and art were stifled , except where they could serve as propaganda media . The party used symbols such as the Blood Flag and rituals such as the Nazi Party rallies to foster unity and bolster the regime 's popularity . 
 = = = Government = = = 
 A law promulgated 30 January 1934 abolished the existing <unk> ( constituent states ) of Germany and replaced them with new administrative divisions of Nazi Germany , the Gaue , headed by NSDAP leaders ( Gauleiters ) , who effectively became the governor of their region . The change was never fully implemented , as the <unk> were still used as administrative divisions for some government departments such as education . This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the administrative style of the Nazi regime . 
 Jewish civil servants lost their jobs in 1933 , except for those who had seen military service in World War I. Members of the NSDAP or party supporters were appointed in their place . As part of the process of Gleichschaltung , the Reich Local Government Law of 1935 abolished local elections . From that point forward , mayors were appointed by the Ministry of the Interior . 
 Hitler ruled Germany <unk> by asserting the FÃ¼hrerprinzip ( leader principle ) , which called for absolute obedience of all subordinates . He viewed the government structure as a pyramid , with himself â the infallible leader â at the apex . Rank in the party was not determined by elections ; positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank . The party used propaganda to develop a cult of personality around Hitler . Historians such as Kershaw emphasise the psychological impact of Hitler 's skill as an orator . Kressel writes , " <unk> ... Germans speak with mystification of Hitler 's ' hypnotic ' appeal " . Roger Gill states , " His moving speeches captured the minds and hearts of a vast number of the German people : he virtually hypnotized his audiences . " 
 Top officials reported to Hitler and followed his policies , but they had considerable autonomy . Officials were expected to " work towards the FÃ¼hrer " â to take the initiative in promoting policies and actions in line with his wishes and the goals of the NSDAP , without Hitler having to be involved in the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the country . The government was not a coordinated , co @-@ operating body , but rather a disorganised collection of factions led by members of the party elite who struggled to amass power and gain the FÃ¼hrer 's favour . Hitler 's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them in positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped . In this way he fostered distrust , competition , and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power . 
 = = = Law = = = 
 On 20 August 1934 , civil servants were required to swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler ; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior . This law became the basis of the FÃ¼hrerprinzip , the concept that Hitler 's word overrode all existing laws . Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler â even murder â thus became legal . All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy FÃ¼hrer Rudolf Hess , who also had a veto over top civil service appointments . 
 Most of the judicial system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use during and after the Nazi era to deal with non @-@ political crimes . The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power . People who were convicted of three or more offences â even petty ones â could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely . People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community . Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial . 
 Although the regular courts handled political cases and even issued death sentences for these cases , a new type of court , the <unk> ( People 's Court ) , was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters . This court handed out over 5 @,@ 000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945 . The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist , printing seditious leaflets , or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials . Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment ; hanging , decapitation , and death by shooting . The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology . They located and confined political offenders , Jews , and others deemed undesirable . Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re @-@ arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp . 
 In September 1935 the Nuremberg Laws were enacted . These laws initially prohibited sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include " Gypsies , Negroes or their bastard offspring " . The law also forbade the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households . The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of " German or related blood " were eligible for citizenship . At the same time the Nazis used propaganda to promulgate the concept of Rassenschande ( race defilement ) to justify the need for a restrictive law . Thus Jews and other non @-@ Aryans were stripped of their German citizenship . The wording of the law also potentially allowed the Nazis to deny citizenship to anyone who was not supportive enough of the regime . A supplementary decree issued in November defined as Jewish anyone with three Jewish grandparents , or two grandparents if the Jewish faith was followed . 
 = = = Military and paramilitary = = = 
 = = = = Wehrmacht = = = = 
 The unified armed forces of Germany from 1935 to 1945 were called the Wehrmacht . This included the Heer ( army ) , Kriegsmarine ( navy ) , and the Luftwaffe ( air force ) . From 2 August 1934 , members of the armed forces were required to pledge an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler personally . In contrast to the previous oath , which required allegiance to the constitution of the country and its lawful establishments , this new oath required members of the military to obey Hitler even if they were being ordered to do something illegal . Hitler decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the Einsatzgruppen â the mobile death squads responsible for millions of deaths in Eastern Europe â when it was tactically possible to do so . Members of the Wehrmacht also participated directly in the Holocaust by shooting civilians or undertaking genocide under the guise of anti @-@ partisan operations . The party line was that the Jews were the instigators of the partisan struggle , and therefore needed to be eliminated . On 8 July 1941 , Heydrich announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans , and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot . 
 In spite of efforts to prepare the country militarily , the economy could not sustain a lengthy war of attrition such as had occurred in World War I. A strategy was developed based on the tactic of Blitzkrieg ( lightning war ) , which involved using quick coordinated assaults that avoided enemy strong points . Attacks began with artillery bombardment , followed by bombing and strafing runs . Next the tanks would attack and finally the infantry would move in to secure any ground that had been taken . Victories continued through mid @-@ 1940 , but the failure to defeat Britain was the first major turning point in the war . The decision to attack the Soviet Union and the decisive defeat at Stalingrad led to the retreat of the German armies and the eventual loss of the war . The total number of soldiers who served in the Wehrmacht from 1935 to 1945 was around 18 @.@ 2 million , of whom 5 @.@ 3 million died . 
 = = = = The SA and SS = = = = 
 The Sturmabteilung ( SA ; Storm Detachment ; Brownshirts ) , founded in 1921 , was the first paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party . Their initial assignment was to protect Nazi leaders at rallies and assemblies . They also took part in street battles against the forces of rival political parties and violent actions against Jews and others . By 1934 , under Ernst RÃ¶hm 's leadership , the SA had grown to over half a million members â 4 @.@ 5 million including reserves â at a time when the regular army was still limited to 100 @,@ 000 men by the Versailles Treaty . 
 RÃ¶hm hoped to assume command of the army and absorb it into the ranks of the SA . Hindenburg and Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg threatened to impose martial law if the alarming activities of the SA were not curtailed . Hitler also suspected that RÃ¶hm was plotting to depose him , so he ordered the deaths of RÃ¶hm and other political enemies . Up to 200 people were killed from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in an event that became known as the Night of the Long Knives . After this purge the SA was no longer a major force . 
 Initially a force of a dozen men under the auspices of the SA , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) grew to become one of the largest and most powerful groups in Nazi Germany . Led by ReichsfÃ¼hrer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler from 1929 , the SS had over a quarter million members by 1938 and continued to grow . Himmler envisioned the SS as being an elite group of guards , Hitler 's last line of defence . The Waffen @-@ SS , the military branch of the SS , became a de facto fourth branch of the Wehrmacht . 
 In 1931 Himmler organised an SS intelligence service which became known as the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ; Security Service ) under his deputy , SS @-@ ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Reinhard Heydrich . This organisation was tasked with locating and arresting communists and other political opponents . Himmler hoped it would eventually totally replace the existing police system . Himmler also established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office . This holding company owned housing corporations , factories , and publishing houses . 
 From 1935 forward the SS was heavily involved in the persecution of Jews , who were rounded up into ghettos and concentration camps . With the outbreak of World War II , SS units called Einsatzgruppen followed the army into Poland and the Soviet Union , where from 1941 to 1945 they killed more than two million people , including 1 @.@ 3 million Jews . The SS @-@ TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde ( death 's head units ) were in charge of the concentration camps and extermination camps , where millions more were killed . 
 = = Economy = = 
 = = = Reich economics = = = 
 The most pressing economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate . Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics , created in May 1933 a scheme for deficit financing . Capital projects were paid for with the issuance of promissory notes called <unk> bills . When the notes were presented for payment , the Reichsbank printed money to do so . While the national debt soared , Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the debt . Schacht 's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate , the largest of any country during the Great Depression . 
 On 17 October 1933 , aviation pioneer Hugo Junkers , owner of the Junkers Aircraft Works , was arrested . Within a few days his company was expropriated by the regime . In concert with other aircraft manufacturers and under the direction of Aviation Minister GÃ¶ring , production was immediately ramped up industry @-@ wide . From a workforce of 3 @,@ 200 people producing 100 units per year in 1932 , the industry grew to employ a quarter of a million workers manufacturing over 10 @,@ 000 technically advanced aircraft per year less than ten years later . 
 An elaborate bureaucracy was created to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods with the intention of eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation 's balance of payments . The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles . As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low , in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit @-@ sharing agreement with IG Farben , guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna . Any profits in excess of that amount would be turned over to the Reich . By 1936 , Farben regretted making the deal , as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government . 
 Major public works projects financed with deficit spending included the construction of a network of <unk> and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements . To stimulate the construction industry , credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs . On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce , a loan of up to 1 @,@ 000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry . The amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born . The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers . 
 Hitler envisioned widespread car ownership as part of the new Germany . He arranged for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up plans for the <unk> @-@ wagen ( Strength Through Joy car ) , intended to be an automobile that every German citizen could afford . A prototype was displayed at the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939 . With the outbreak of World War II , the factory was converted to produce military vehicles . No production models were sold until after the war , when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen ( people 's car ) . 
 Six million people were unemployed when the Nazis took power in 1933 , and by 1937 there were fewer than a million . This was in part due to the removal of women from the workforce . Real wages dropped by 25 percent between 1933 and 1938 . Trade unions were abolished in May 1933 with the seizure of the funds and arrest of the leadership of the Social Democratic trade unions . A new organisation , the German Labour Front , was created and placed under NSDAP functionary Robert Ley . The average German worked 43 hours a week in 1933 , and by 1939 this increased to 47 hours a week . 
 By early 1934 the focus shifted away from funding work creation schemes and toward rearmament . By 1935 , military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government 's purchases of goods and services . On 18 October 1936 Hitler named GÃ¶ring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan , intended to speed up the rearmament programme . In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills , synthetic rubber plants , and other factories , GÃ¶ring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends . Large expenditures were made on rearmament , in spite of growing deficits . With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935 , the Reichswehr , which had been limited to 100 @,@ 000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty , expanded to 750 @,@ 000 on active service at the start of World War II , with a million more in the reserve . By January 1939 , unemployment was down to 301 @,@ 800 , and it dropped to only 77 @,@ 500 by September . 
 = = = Wartime economy and forced labour = = = 
 The Nazi war economy was a mixed economy that combined a free market with central planning ; historian Richard Overy described it as being somewhere in between the command economy of the Soviet Union and the capitalist system of the United States . 
 In 1942 , after the death of Armaments Minister Fritz Todt , Hitler appointed Albert Speer as his replacement . Speer improved production via streamlined organisation , the use of single @-@ purpose machines operated by unskilled workers , rationalisation of production methods , and better co @-@ ordination between the many different firms that made tens of thousands of components . Factories were relocated away from rail yards , which were bombing targets . By 1944 , the war was consuming 75 percent of Germany 's gross domestic product , compared to 60 percent in the Soviet Union and 55 percent in Britain . 
 The wartime economy relied heavily upon the large @-@ scale employment of forced labourers . Germany imported and enslaved some 12 million people from 20 European countries to work in factories and on farms ; approximately 75 percent were Eastern European . Many were casualties of Allied bombing , as they received poor air raid protection . Poor living conditions led to high rates of sickness , injury , and death , as well as sabotage and criminal activity . 
 Foreign workers brought into Germany were put into four different classifications ; guest workers , military internees , civilian workers , and Eastern workers . Different regulations were placed upon the worker depending on their classification . To separate Germans and foreign workers , the Nazis issued a ban on sexual relations between Germans and foreign workers . 
 Women played an increasingly large role . By 1944 over a half million served as auxiliaries in the German armed forces , especially in anti @-@ aircraft units of the Luftwaffe ; a half million worked in civil aerial defence ; and 400 @,@ 000 were volunteer nurses . They also replaced men in the wartime economy , especially on farms and in small family @-@ owned shops . 
 Very heavy strategic bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing synthetic oil and gasoline as well as the German transportation system , especially rail yards and canals . The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944 . By November fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations , and the production of new armaments was no longer possible . Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to one @-@ fourth of its manpower and industry into anti @-@ aircraft resources , which very likely shortened the war . 
 = = Racial policy = = 
 Racism and antisemitism were basic tenets of the NSDAP and the Nazi regime . Nazi Germany 's racial policy was based on their belief in the existence of a superior master race . The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races , particularly Jews , who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race . 
 = = = Persecution of Jews = = = 
 Discrimination against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power ; following a month @-@ long series of attacks by members of the SA on Jewish businesses , synagogues , and members of the legal profession , on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish businesses . The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service , passed on 7 April , forced all non @-@ Aryan civil servants to retire from the legal profession and civil service . Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise . On 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one Jewish parent or grandparent was considered non @-@ Aryan . As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life , members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un @-@ German , and a nationwide book burning was held on 10 May . 
 Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country . Jewish businesses were denied access to markets , forbidden to advertise in newspapers , and deprived of access to government contracts . Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks . Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews . 
 In November 1938 , a young Jewish man requested an interview with the German ambassador in Paris . He met with a legation secretary , whom he shot and killed to protest his family 's treatment in Germany . This incident provided the pretext for a pogrom the NSDAP incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938 . Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany . At least 91 German Jews were killed during this pogrom , later called Kristallnacht , the Night of Broken Glass . Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months â they were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops , drive cars , go to the cinema , visit the library , or own weapons . Jewish pupils were removed from schools . The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay for the damage caused by Kristallnacht and told that any money received via insurance claims would be confiscated . By 1939 around 250 @,@ 000 of Germany 's 437 @,@ 000 Jews emigrated to the United States , Argentina , Great Britain , Palestine , and other countries . Many chose to stay in continental Europe . Emigrants to Palestine were allowed to transfer property there under the terms of the Haavara Agreement , but those moving to other countries had to leave virtually all their property behind , and it was seized by the government . 
 = = = Persecution of Roma and other groups = = = 
 Like the Jews , the Romani people were subjected to persecution from the early days of the regime . As a non @-@ Aryan race , they were forbidden to marry people of German extraction . Romani were shipped to concentration camps starting in 1935 and were killed in large numbers . Action T4 was a programme of systematic murder of the physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued until the end of the war . Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others ; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940 . Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933 , the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400 @,@ 000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects . More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient , which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests , but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift , sexual behaviour , and cleanliness . Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted . The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes , the poor , the homeless , and criminals . Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah 's Witnesses , homosexuals , social misfits , and members of the political and religious opposition . 
 = = = The Holocaust = = = 
 Germany 's war in the East was based on Hitler 's long @-@ standing view that Jews were the great enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany 's expansion . Hitler focused his attention on Eastern Europe , aiming to defeat Poland , the Soviet Union and remove or kill the resident Jews and Slavs in the process . After the occupation of Poland , all Jews living in the General Government were confined to ghettos , and those who were physically fit were required to perform compulsory labour . In 1941 Hitler decided to destroy the Polish nation completely . He planned that within 10 to 20 years the section of Poland under German occupation would be cleared of ethnic Poles and resettled by German colonists . About 3 @.@ 8 to 4 million Poles would remain as slaves , part of a slave labour force of 14 million the Nazis intended to create using citizens of conquered nations in the East . 
 The Generalplan Ost ( General Plan for the East ) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia , for use as slave labour or to be murdered . To determine who should be killed , Himmler created the Volksliste , a system of classification of people deemed to be of German blood . He ordered that those of Germanic descent who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps , have their children taken away , or be assigned to forced labour . The plan also included the kidnapping of children deemed to have Aryan @-@ Nordic traits , who were presumed to be of German descent . The goal was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union , but when the invasion failed , Hitler had to consider other options . One suggestion was a mass forced deportation of Jews to Poland , Palestine , or Madagascar . 
 Somewhere around the time of the failed offensive against Moscow in December 1941 , Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately . Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe â eleven million people â were formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 . Some would be worked to death and the rest would be killed in the implementation of Die EndlÃ¶sung der Judenfrage ( the Final Solution of the Jewish question ) . Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by Einsatzgruppen firing squads , but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale . By 1941 , killing centres at Auschwitz concentration camp , Sobibor , Treblinka , and other Nazi extermination camps replaced Einsatzgruppen as the primary method of mass killing . The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5 @.@ 5 to six million people , including over a million children . Twelve million people were put into forced labour . 
 German citizens ( despite much of the later denial ) had access to information about what was happening , as soldiers returning from the occupied territories would report on what they had seen and done . Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide . Some Polish citizens tried to rescue or hide the remaining Jews , and members of the Polish underground got word to their government in exile in London as to what was happening . 
 In addition to eliminating Jews , the Nazis also planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan . Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians . Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists . Together , the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union . These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19 @.@ 3 million civilians and prisoners of war . 
 = = = Oppression of ethnic Poles = = = 
 During the German occupation of Poland , 2 @.@ 7 million ethnic Poles were killed by the Axis powers . Polish civilians were subject to forced labour in German industry , internment , wholesale expulsions to make way for German colonists and mass executions . The German authorities engaged in a systematic effort to destroy Polish culture and national identity . During operation AB @-@ Aktion , many university professors and members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed , or transported to concentration camps . During the war , Poland lost an estimated 39 to 45 percent of its physicians and dentists , 26 to 57 percent of its lawyers , 15 to 30 percent of its teachers , 30 to 40 percent of its scientists and university professors , and 18 to 28 percent of its clergy . Further , 43 percent of Poland 's educational and research institutions and 14 percent of its museums had been destroyed .

One in four of the population were killed or wounded . 
 = = Society = = 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Antisemitic legislation passed in 1933 led to the removal all of Jewish teachers , professors , and officials from the education system . Most teachers were required to belong to the <unk> <unk> ( National Socialist Teachers League ; <unk> ) , and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers . Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler , and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed . Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession . The average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage . 
 Frequent and often contradictory directives were issued by Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick , Bernhard Rust of the <unk> ( Ministry of Education ) , and various other agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools . Books deemed unacceptable to the regime were removed from school libraries . Indoctrination in National Socialist thought was made compulsory in January 1934 . Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated from the age of 12 at Adolf Hitler Schools for primary education and National Political Institutes of Education for secondary education . Detailed National Socialist indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at Order Castles . 
 Primary and secondary education focused on racial biology , population policy , culture , geography , and especially physical fitness . The curriculum in most subjects , including biology , geography , and even arithmetic , was altered to change the focus to race . Military education became the central component of physical education , and education in physics was oriented toward subjects with military applications , such as ballistics and aerodynamics . Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda . 
 At universities , appointments to top posts were the subject of power struggles between the education ministry , the university boards , and the National Socialist German Students ' League . In spite of pressure from the League and various government ministries , most university professors did not make changes to their lectures or syllabus during the Nazi period . This was especially true of universities located in predominately Catholic regions . Enrolment at German universities declined from 104 @,@ 000 students in 1931 to 41 @,@ 000 in 1939 . But enrolment in medical schools rose sharply ; Jewish doctors had been forced to leave the profession , so medical graduates had good job prospects . From 1934 , university students were required to attend frequent and time @-@ consuming military training sessions run by the SA . First @-@ year students also had to serve six months in a labour camp for the Reichsarbeitsdienst ( National Labour Service ) ; an additional ten weeks service were required of second @-@ year students . 
 = = = Oppression of churches = = = 
 About 65 percent of the population of Germany was Protestant when the Nazis seized power in 1933 . Under the Gleichschaltung process , Hitler attempted to create a unified Protestant Reich Church from Germany 's 28 existing Protestant churches , with the ultimate goal of eradication of the churches in Germany . Ludwig MÃ¼ller , a pro @-@ Nazi , was installed as Reich Bishop , and the German Christians , a pro @-@ Nazi pressure group , gained control of the new church . They objected to the Old Testament because of its Jewish origins , and demanded that converted Jews be barred from their church . Pastor Martin NiemÃ¶ller responded with the formation of the Confessing Church , from which some clergymen opposed the Nazi regime . When in 1935 the Confessing Church synod protested the Nazi policy on religion , 700 of their pastors were arrested . MÃ¼ller resigned and Hitler appointed Hanns <unk> as Minister for Church Affairs , to continue efforts to control Protestantism . In 1936 , a Confessing Church envoy protested to Hitler against the religious persecutions and human rights abuses . Hundreds more pastors were arrested . The church continued to resist , and by early 1937 Hitler abandoned his hope of uniting the Protestant churches . The Confessing Church was banned on 1 July 1937 . <unk> was arrested and confined , first in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and then at Dachau . Theological universities were closed and more pastors and theologians were arrested . 
 Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover . Hitler moved quickly to eliminate political <unk> , rounding up functionaries of the Catholic @-@ aligned Bavarian People 's Party and Catholic Centre Party , which , along with all other non @-@ Nazi political parties , ceased to exist by July . The Reichskonkordat ( Reich Concordat ) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933 , amid continuing harassment of the church in Germany . The treaty required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics . Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat , closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious . Clergy , nuns , and lay leaders were targeted , with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years , often on trumped @-@ up charges of currency smuggling or immorality . Several high profile Catholic lay leaders were targeted in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives assassinations . Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets . Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt , restrictions were placed on public meetings , and Catholic publications faced censorship . Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings . 
 Pope Pius XI had the " Mit brennender Sorge " ( " With Burning Concern " ) <unk> smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit . It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church . In response , Goebbels renewed the regime 's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics . Enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply , and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities . Later Catholic protests included the 22 March 1942 pastoral letter by the German bishops on " The Struggle against Christianity and the Church " . About 30 percent of Catholic priests were disciplined by police during the Nazi era . A vast security network spied on the activities of clergy , and priests were frequently denounced , arrested , or sent to concentration camps â many to the dedicated clergy barracks at Dachau . In the areas of Poland annexed in 1940 , the Nazis instigated a brutal suppression and systematic dismantling of the Catholic Church . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 Nazi Germany had a strong anti @-@ tobacco movement . Pioneering research by Franz H. MÃ¼ller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer . The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking , including producing lectures and pamphlets . Smoking was banned in many workplaces , on trains , and among on @-@ duty members of the military . Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides . As part of a general public health campaign , water supplies were cleaned up , lead and mercury were removed from consumer products , and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer . 
 Government @-@ run health care insurance plans were available , but Jews were denied coverage starting in 1933 . That same year , Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat government @-@ insured patients . In 1937 Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat non @-@ Jewish patients , and in 1938 their right to practice medicine was removed entirely . 
 Medical experiments , many of them pseudoscientific , were performed on concentration camp inmates beginning in 1941 . The most notorious doctor to perform medical experiments was SS @-@ HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Dr Josef Mengele , camp doctor at Auschwitz . Many of his victims died or were intentionally killed . Concentration camp inmates were made available for purchase by pharmaceutical companies for drug testing and other experiments . 
 = = = Role of women and family = = = 
 Women were a cornerstone of Nazi social policy . The Nazis opposed the feminist movement , claiming that it was the creation of Jewish intellectuals , and instead advocated a patriarchal society in which the German woman would recognise that her " world is her husband , her family , her children , and her home . " Soon after the seizure of power , feminist groups were shut down or incorporated into the National Socialist Women 's League . This organisation coordinated groups throughout the country to promote motherhood and household activities . Courses were offered on childrearing , sewing , and cooking . The League published the NS @-@ Frauen @-@ <unk> , the only NSDAP @-@ approved women 's magazine in Nazi Germany . Despite some propaganda aspects , it was predominantly an ordinary woman 's magazine . 
 Women were encouraged to leave the workforce , and the creation of large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign . Women received a bronze award â known as the <unk> der Deutschen Mutter ( Cross of Honour of the German Mother ) â for giving birth to four children , silver for six , and gold for eight or more . Large families received subsidies to help with their utilities , school fees , and household expenses . Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate , the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940 . Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men . Women were for the most part employed as domestic servants , weavers , or in the food and drink industries â jobs that were not of interest to men . Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build @-@ up to the war , so foreign labourers were brought in . After the war started , slave labourers were extensively used . In January 1943 Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort . Thereafter , women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs . By September 1944 , 14 @.@ 9 million women were working in munitions production . 
 The Nazi regime discouraged women from seeking higher education . Nazi leaders held conservative views about women and endorsed the idea that rational and theoretical work was alien to a woman 's nature since they were considered inherently emotional and instinctive â as such , engaging in academics and careerism would only " divert them from motherhood . " The number of women allowed to enrol in universities dropped drastically , as a law passed in April 1933 limited the number of females admitted to university to ten percent of the number of male attendees . Female enrolment in secondary schools dropped from 437 @,@ 000 in 1926 to 205 @,@ 000 in 1937 . The number of women enrolled in post @-@ secondary schools dropped from 128 @,@ 000 in 1933 to 51 @,@ 000 in 1938 . However , with the requirement that men be enlisted into the armed forces during the war , women comprised half of the enrolment in the post @-@ secondary system by 1944 . 
 Women were expected to be strong , healthy , and vital . The sturdy peasant woman who worked the land and bore strong children was considered ideal , and athletic women were praised for being tanned from working outdoors . Organisations were created for the indoctrination of Nazi values . From 25 March 1939 , membership in the Hitler Youth became compulsory for all children over the age of ten . The <unk> ( Young Girls League ) section of the Hitler Youth was for girls age 10 to 14 , and the Bund Deutscher <unk> ( BDM ; League of German Girls ) was for young women age 14 to 18 . The BDM 's activities focused on physical education , with activities such as running , long jumping , somersaulting , tightrope walking , marching , and swimming . 
 The Nazi regime promoted a liberal code of conduct regarding sexual matters , and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock . Promiscuity increased as the war progressed , with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously . The same was the case for married women , who liaised with soldiers , civilians , or slave labourers . Sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain , for example , better work from a foreign labourer . Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood . 
 With Hitler 's approval , Himmler intended that the new society of the Nazi regime should de @-@ <unk> illegitimate births , particularly of children fathered by members of the SS , who were vetted for racial purity . His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children . The Lebensborn ( Fountain of Life ) association , founded by Himmler in 1935 , created a series of maternity homes where single mothers could be accommodated during their pregnancies . Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance . The resulting children were often adopted into SS families . The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and NSDAP members , who quickly filled over half the available spots . 
 Existing laws banning abortion except for medical reasons were strictly enforced by the Nazi regime . The number of abortions declined from 35 @,@ 000 per year at the start of the 1930s to fewer than 2 @,@ 000 per year at the end of the decade . In 1935 a law was passed allowing abortions for eugenics reasons . 
 = = = Environmentalism = = = 
 Nazi society had elements supportive of animal rights , and many people were fond of zoos and wildlife . The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment . In 1933 , the Nazis enacted a stringent animal @-@ protection law that had an impact on what was allowed for medical research . But the law was only loosely enforced . In spite of a ban on vivisection , the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals . 
 The Reich Forestry Office , under GÃ¶ring , enforced regulations that required foresters to plant a wide variety of trees to ensure suitable habitat for wildlife . A new Reich Animal Protection Act became law in 1933 . The regime enacted the Reich Nature Protection Act in 1935 to protect the natural landscape from excessive economic development . The act allowed for the expropriation of privately owned land to create nature preserves and aided in long @-@ range planning . <unk> efforts were made to curb air pollution , but little enforcement of existing legislation was undertaken once the war began . 
 = = Culture = = 
 The regime promoted the concept of Volksgemeinschaft , a national German ethnic community . The goal was to build a classless society based on racial purity and the perceived need to prepare for warfare , conquest , and a struggle against Marxism . The German Labour Front founded the Kraft durch Freude ( <unk> ; Strength Through Joy ) organisation in 1933 . In addition to taking control of tens of thousands of previously privately run recreational clubs , it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment experiences such as cruises , vacation destinations , and concerts . 
 The Reichskulturkammer ( Reich Chamber of Culture ) was organised under the control of the Propaganda Ministry in September 1933 . Sub @-@ chambers were set up to control various aspects of cultural life , such as films , radio , newspapers , fine arts , music , theatre , and literature . All members of these professions were required to join their respective organisation . Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts , and many emigrated . Books and scripts had to be approved by the Propaganda Ministry prior to publication . Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media . 
 Radio became very popular in Germany during the 1930s , with over 70 percent of households owning a receiver by 1939 , more than any other country . Radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable by July 1933 . Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power , but as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that people would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment . 
 As with other media , newspapers were controlled by the state , with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses . By 1939 over two @-@ thirds of the newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry . The NSDAP daily newspaper , the VÃ¶lkischer Beobachter ( Ethnic Observer ) , was edited by Alfred Rosenberg , author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century , a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority . Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany should only publish content favourable to the regime . His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use ; the typical newspaper followed the directives very closely . Newspaper readership plummeted , partly because of the decreased quality of the content , and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio . 
 Authors of books left the country in droves , and some wrote material highly critical of the regime while in exile . Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors should concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths and the concept of blood and soil . By the end of 1933 over a thousand books , most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters , had been banned by the Nazi regime . 
 Hitler took a personal interest in architecture , and worked closely with state architects Paul Troost and Albert Speer to create public buildings in a neoclassical style based on Roman architecture . Speer constructed imposing structures such as the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg and a new Reich Chancellery building in Berlin . Hitler 's plans for rebuilding Berlin included a gigantic dome based on the Pantheon in Rome and a triumphal arch more than double the height of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . Neither of these structures were ever built . 
 Hitler felt that abstract , Dadaist , expressionist , and modern art were decadent , an opinion that became the basis for policy . Many art museum directors lost their posts in 1933 and were replaced by party members . Some 6 @,@ 500 modern works of art were removed from museums and replaced with works chosen by a Nazi jury . Exhibitions of the rejected pieces , under titles such as " Decadence in Art " , were launched in sixteen different cities by 1935 . The Degenerate Art Exhibition , organised by Goebbels , ran in Munich from July to November 1937 . The exhibition proved wildly popular , attracting over two million visitors . 
 Composer Richard Strauss was appointed president of the <unk> ( Reich Music Chamber ) on its founding in November 1933 . As was the case with other art forms , the Nazis ostracised musicians who were not deemed racially acceptable , and for the most part did not approve of music that was too modern or atonal . Jazz music was singled out as being especially inappropriate , and foreign musicians of this genre left the country or were expelled . Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner , especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories , and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933 . 
 Movies were popular in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s , with admissions of over a billion people in 1942 , 1943 , and 1944 . By 1934 German regulations restricting currency exports made it impossible for American film makers to take their profits back to America , so the major film studios closed their German branches . Exports of German films plummeted , as their heavily antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries . The two largest film companies , Universum Film AG and Tobis , were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry , which by 1939 was producing most German films . The productions were not always overtly propagandistic , but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content . Scripts were pre @-@ censored . 
 Leni Riefenstahl 's Triumph of the Will ( 1935 ) , documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally , and Olympia ( 1938 ) , covering the 1936 Summer Olympics , pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that influenced later films . New techniques such as telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed . Both films remain controversial , as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their <unk> of national socialist ideals . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Allied powers organised war crimes trials , beginning with the Nuremberg trials , held from November 1945 to October 1946 , of 23 top Nazi officials . They were charged with four counts â conspiracy to commit crimes , crimes against peace , war crimes , and crimes against humanity â in violation of international laws governing warfare . All but three of the defendants were found guilty ; twelve were sentenced to death . The victorious Allies outlawed the NSDAP and its subsidiary organisations . The display or use of Nazi symbolism such as flags , swastikas , or greetings , is illegal in Germany and Austria , and other restrictions , mainly on public display , apply in various countries . See Swastika Â§ Post @-@ WWII stigmatization for details . 
 Nazi ideology and the actions taken by the regime are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral . Hitler , Nazism , and the Holocaust have become symbols of evil in the modern world . Interest in Nazi Germany continues in the media and the academic world . Historian Sir Richard J. Evans remarks that the era " exerts an almost universal appeal because its murderous racism stands as a warning to the whole of humanity . " 
 The Nazi era continues to inform how Germans view themselves and their country . Virtually every family suffered losses during the war or has a story to tell . For many years Germans kept quiet about their experiences and felt a sense of communal guilt , even if they were not directly involved in war crimes . Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s , people began researching the experiences of their family members . Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has led to the development of a strong democracy in today 's Germany , but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo @-@ Nazi thought .

 = USS Delaware ( BB @-@ 28 ) = 
 USS Delaware ( BB @-@ 28 ) was a dreadnought battleship of the United States Navy , the lead ship of her class . She was laid down at Newport News Shipbuilding in November 1907 , launched in January 1909 , and completed in April 1910 . The sixth ship to be named for the First State , Delaware was armed with a main battery of ten 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns all on the centerline , making her the most powerful battleship in the world at the time of her construction . She was also the first battleship of the US Navy to be capable of steaming at full speed for 24 continuous hours without suffering a breakdown . 
 Delaware served in the Atlantic Fleet throughout her career . During World War I , she sailed to Great Britain to reinforce the British Grand Fleet , in the 6th Battle Squadron . She saw no action during the war , however , as both the British and Germans had abandoned direct confrontation with each other . After the end of the war , she returned to her peacetime duties of fleet maneuvers , midshipmen cruises , and good @-@ will visits to foreign ports . Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , Delaware was retained until the new battleship USS Colorado was completed in 1924 , at which point she was broken up for scrap in accordance with the treaty . 
 = = Design = = 
 Delaware was 518 ft 9 in ( 158 m ) long overall and had a beam of 85 ft 3 in ( 26 m ) and a draft of 27 ft 3 in ( 8 m ) . She displaced 20 @,@ 380 long tons ( 20 @,@ 707 t ) as designed and up to 22 @,@ 400 long tons ( 22 @,@ 759 t ) at full combat load . Her bow had an early example of bulbous forefoot . 
 The ship was powered by two @-@ shaft vertical triple @-@ expansion engines rated at 25 @,@ 000 shp ( 18 @,@ 642 kW ) and fourteen coal @-@ fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers , generating a top speed of 21 kn ( 24 mph ; 39 km / h ) . The ship had a cruising range of 6 @,@ 000 nmi ( 11 @,@ 000 km ; 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 10 kn ( 12 mph ; 19 km / h ) . Also , because Delaware 's engine bearings were equipped with forced lubrication instead of a gravity @-@ fed system , she was the first American battleship capable of steaming at full speed for 24 hours without any need for engine repair . She had a crew of 933 officers and men . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of ten 12 @-@ inch / 45 caliber Mark 5 guns in five twin Mark 7 gun turrets on the centerline , two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward . The other three turrets were placed aft of the superstructure . The secondary battery consisted of twenty @-@ one 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 50 caliber Mark 6 guns mounted on Mark 9 and Mark 12 pedestal mounts in casemates along the side of the hull . As was standard for capital ships of the period , she carried a pair of 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . The main armored belt was 11 in ( 279 mm ) thick , while the armored deck was 2 in ( 51 mm ) thick . The gun turrets had 12 in ( 305 mm ) thick faces and the conning tower had 11 @.@ 5 in ( 292 mm ) thick sides . At the time of her construction , Delaware was the largest and most powerful battleship then building in the world . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Delaware was built by Newport News Shipbuilding ; she was laid down on 11 November 1907 , and launched on 6 January 1909 . After completion of the fitting @-@ out work , the ship was commissioned into the US Navy on 4 April 1910 . On 3 October , she steamed to Wilmington , Delaware , where she received a set of silver service from her namesake state . The battleship then returned to Hampton Roads on the 9th , and remained there until she left to join the First Division , Atlantic Fleet , on 1 November . She and the rest of the division visited England and France , and then conducted maneuvers off Cuba in January 1911 . On 17 January , a boiler explosion aboard Delaware killed eight men and badly scalded another . On 31 January , the ship carried the remains of Anibal Cruz , the Chilean ambassador to the United States , back to Chile . She steamed by way of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , around the tip of South America , to Punta Arenas , Chile . She returned to New York City on 5 May , and then left for Portsmouth on 4 June to participate in the coronation fleet review for King George V. 
 Throughout the next five years , Delaware participated in the normal peacetime routine of fleet and squadron maneuvers , gunnery drills , and torpedo practice in the Atlantic Fleet . During the summer months , she conducted training cruises for midshipmen from the Naval Academy . She was present in the Naval Review of 14 October 1912 , attended by President William Howard Taft and the Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer . In 1913 , she conducted a good @-@ will visit to Villefranche , France , along with the battleships Wyoming and Utah . She participated in the intervention in Mexico at Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution , to protect American citizens in the area . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Following the American entrance into World War I on 6 April 1917 , Delaware had recently returned to Hampton Roads from fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea . There , she trained new armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war . On 25 November 1917 , she sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9 , bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea . Once in Scapa Flow , the division joined the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron . The 6th Battle Squadron was tasked with serving as the " fast wing " of the Grand Fleet . On 14 December , Delaware participated in joint Anglo @-@ American maneuvers to practice coordination of the Allied fleet . 
 Starting in late 1917 , the Germans had begun to use surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia ; this forced the British to send squadrons from the Grand Fleet to escort the convoys . On 6 February 1918 , the 6th Battle Squadron and eight British destroyers escorted a convoy of merchant ships to Norway . While steaming off Stavanger on the 8th , Delaware was attacked twice by a German U @-@ boat , though evasive maneuvers allowed Delaware to escape undamaged . The squadron was back in Scapa Flow on 10 February ; Delaware escorted two more such convoys in March and April . On 22 â 24 April , the German High Seas Fleet sortied to intercept one of the convoys in the hope of cutting off and destroying the escorting battleship squadron . Delaware and the rest of the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow on 24 April in an attempt to intercept the Germans , but the High Seas Fleet had already broken off the operation and returned to port . 
 Starting on 30 June , the 6th Battle Squadron and a division of British destroyers covered a group of American minelayers as they laid the North Sea mine barrage ; the work lasted until 2 July . King George V inspected the Grand Fleet , including Delaware , at Rosyth . Thereafter , Delaware was relieved by the battleship Arkansas ; Delaware then sailed across the Atlantic , arriving in Hampton Roads on 12 August . 
 = = = Post @-@ war = = = 
 Delaware remained at York River until 12 November 1918 , the day after the Armistice with Germany was signed , effectively ending World War I. She then sailed to Boston Navy Yard for an overhaul . Delaware rejoined the fleet on 11 March 1919 for training maneuvers off Cuba . She returned to New York with her division on 14 April , where additional divisional , squadron , and fleet exercises were conducted . She was present for another Naval Review on 28 April 1921 in Hampton Roads . From 5 June to 31 August 1922 , Delaware conducted a training cruise for midshipmen to various ports in the Caribbean along with to Halifax , Nova Scotia . She went on another cruise to Europe from 9 July to 29 August 1923 , and visited Copenhagen , Greenock , CÃ¡diz , and Gibraltar . 
 In the years immediately following the end of the war , the United States , Britain , and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs . All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill @-@ advised , and so convened the Washington Naval Conference to discuss arms limitations , which produced the Washington Naval Treaty , signed in February 1922 . Under the terms of Article II of the treaty , Delaware and her sister North Dakota were to be scrapped as soon as the new battleships Colorado and West Virginia , then under construction , were ready to join the fleet . On 30 August 1923 , Delaware accordingly entered dry dock in the Norfolk Navy Yard ; her crew was transferred to the recently commissioned Colorado , and the process of disposal began . Delaware was transferred to the Boston Navy Yard , decommissioned on 10 November , and disarmed . She was then sold on 5 February 1924 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = What More Can I Give = 
 " What More Can I Give " ( also " Todo Para Ti " in Spanish ) is a song written by American singer Michael Jackson and recorded by a supergroup of singers following the September 11 attacks . The inspiration for the song had initially come to Jackson after a meeting with the President of South Africa Nelson Mandela in the late 1990s . The song was to be premiered at a Jackson concert , but the singer failed to perform it . The song also failed to gain an official release , despite the pop singer having stated that it would be issued as a charity single for the refugees of the Kosovo War , which ended in 1999 . 
 Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 , Jackson rewrote " What More Can I Give " at the suggestion of Marc Schaffel . Schaffel , who produced and became the executive producer on the project , convinced Jackson to also do a Spanish version of the song as well , and handled the details of the production . Jackson and other artists recorded the new version of the song shortly afterward ; the other artists included Britney Spears , Reba McEntire , Anastacia , Nick Carter , Jennifer Lopez , 3LW , BeyoncÃ© , NSYNC , Celine Dion , Christina Aguilera , Brian McKnight , Toni Braxton , Luther Vandross , Mariah Carey , Mary J. Blige and Usher . In addition , a Spanish language version of the song was recorded . Entitled " Todo Para Ti " , his lyrics were adapted into Spanish by the Panamanian musician RubÃ©n Blades . Schaffel brought three @-@ time Grammy winner K. C. Porter on to the project to give the Spanish version a different sound from the English recording . 
 " What More Can I Give " was scheduled for release as a charity single in the hope that $ 50 million would be raised between downloads , sponsors , and donations to aid the survivors and the families of victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks . The plan , however , never came to fruition and the reasons why have varied between sources and the individuals involved . One newspaper stated that the release of the song was abandoned after part of a marketing ploy by Sony Music after Jackson started a public campaign against Sony and its USA music head . 
 " What More Can I Give " was played on the radio for the first time in late 2002 . The debut airing was made without permission by radio station WKTU @-@ FM in New York . The following year , on October 27 , 2003 , " What More Can I Give " was made available to the public by way of digital download for several days . Jackson had the song taken down on the eve of the raid on his Neverland Valley Ranch property by Santa Barbara Sheriffs . Proceeds from the short sale of the song went to children 's charities . 
 Schaffel enlisted friend and famed Brazilian artist Romero Britto to design , create , and paint an artwork to be used as the cover for the single . Britto created the " ribbon " piece in bright colors including yellow , blue and red . Britto created 250 of this piece as a special collector 's item and both Britto and Michael Jackson signed and numbered each of these pieces . 
 Michael Jackson recorded the song in both English and Spanish , and shot the video for Marc Schaffel . Even after his death it is believed to be the " last " actual completed song and video that Michael Jackson had done , and approved for release . It was also one of the only few tracks Michael Jackson ever performed in Spanish and is considered the last . Michael Jackson had told many people he felt that " What More Can I Give " was a definite contender for song of the year for both the English and Latin Grammys , and felt it would be a more successful as " We Are the World " . No official release date for either project has been given since the death of Jackson in June 2009 , by either Schaffel or Jackson 's estate . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 Michael Jackson originally started writing the song , originally titled " Heal L.A. " , with Brad Buxer after the Rodney King verdict and following riots in 1992 . The song was worked on throughout the making of the HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I album and its subsequent world tour in 1996 to 1997 . In late 1997 , when work began on the Invincible album the song was put on hold , but its completion was always a passion of Michael 's . Jackson was inspired to finish " Heal L.A. " after a meeting with anti @-@ apartheid activist and President of South Africa Nelson Mandela in 1999 . The songwriter stated that during a conversation with the then @-@ President , the concept of giving was discussed by the pair . The singer revealed that it was during this interaction that the words " what more can I give " came into his mind and he began writing . With the first version of the song completed , Jackson intended to premiere it at his MJ & Friends concerts , staged in Munich , Germany and the South Korean capital Seoul in June 1999 . Ultimately , Jackson did not perform the song at the concerts and it remained unreleased . 
 " What More Can I Give " was also intended to be released as a charity single to aid the Kosovar refugees who had been forced out of their home during the Kosovo War ( 1998 â 1999 ) . Jackson revealed his intentions for the release in an interview with the British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror . The pop singer stated that television footage of the war upset him and that he wanted to go to Yugoslavia to hug every one of the suffering children . Like before , however , the song failed to gain a release as a single and was not considered good enough for inclusion on Jackson 's 2001 Invincible album . 
 In 2001 , two separate concerts were held on September 7 and September 10 in celebration of Michael Jackson 's thirtieth year as a solo entertainer ( his first solo single , " Got to Be There " , was released in 1971 ) . Held in New York City , the shows sold out within five hours of going on sale . The concerts featured performances by artists such as Usher , Whitney Houston , MÃ½a , Liza Minnelli , James Ingram , Gloria Estefan and Marc Anthony . They also contained solo performances by Jackson himself , and marked the onstage reunion of the pop singer and his brothers ( The Jacksons ) . 
 Hours following the second concert , the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City , the Pentagon outside of Washington , D.C. , and a crash near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , resulted in the loss of 2 @,@ 993 lives . Following the events of September 11 , Jackson rewrote " What More Can I Give " and expressed his views on the song , writing and music . " I 'm not one to sit back and say , ' Oh , I feel bad for what happened to them [ ... ] I want the whole world to sing [ " What More Can I Give " ] , to bring us together as a world , because a song is a mantra , something you repeat over and over . And we need peace , we need giving , we need love , we need unity . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 " What More Can I Give " was recorded in 2001 by a number of artists . The project had received an " overwhelming response from major artists all over the world " , with musicians such as Anastacia , BeyoncÃ© , Nick Carter , Aaron Carter , NSYNC and Carlos Santana offering to lend their voices to the track . The recording process was held in Los Angeles , California and destinations reachable by Michael Jackson 's private plane and mobile production unit headed by Marc Schaffel , who traveled across the globe with a team to record the different artists . The all @-@ star benefit followed a similar Jackson @-@ effort , " We Are the World " , which raised millions of dollars for famine relief in Africa . The recording of " What More Can I Give " was completed in October 2001 . 
 In addition to the English @-@ language version of " What More Can I Give " , a Spanish version of the song was recorded . Entitled " Todo Para Ti " , the track features several of the musicians on the English version , as well as Latin artists such as Alejandro Sanz and Cristian Castro , who only appear on the Spanish @-@ language version . The title for " Todo Para Ti " translates to " Everything for You " in English . Producer and songwriter K. C. Porter had directly translated the title of " What More Can I Give " initially , but it was changed after Jackson expressed that he felt it was too clumsy .

 " What More Can I Give " was performed live at the 9 / 11 benefit concert United We Stand : What More Can I Give . Held at the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington , D.C. on October 21 , 2001 , the eight @-@ hour concert featured numerous artists performing to a sell @-@ out audience of 54 @,@ 000 people . Jackson performed his song " Man in the Mirror " , before he and other singers such as Rod Stewart , Al Green , James Brown , Sean Combs and Pink closed the show with " What More Can I Give . " Joe D 'Angelo of MTV later stated that the entire performance was held together by Jackson and Billy Gilman , who he claimed were the only two who looked like they knew the lyrics to the song . He concluded that the collective rendition of the song was altogether " choppy and disparate . " Jon Pareles also wrote negatively about the performance . He stated that it " became a shambles as [ a ] <unk> of guests missed their cues or couldn 't be heard " . 
 Jackson 's appearance during the " What More Can I Give " performance was later edited out of American Broadcasting Company 's airing of the show . The company were forced to take the action after representatives of Jackson informed them that CBS had demanded that the singer not perform on a network show before a Jackson special being broadcast on their channel the following month . CBS executives , however , denied their insistence on Jackson 's removal from the footage . They stated that if the singer had appeared in the broadcast footage , they most probably would have been forced to delay Jackson 's show , so that it would not appear too soon after the airing of United We Stand : What More Can I Give .

 " What More Can I Give " had been planned for release as a charity single to aid survivors and families of victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks . At the time of the attacks , Jackson stated that he hoped to raise $ 50 million for those affected . It was also proclaimed by Jackson 's spokesman that the recording would be released as soon as possible , with further reports revealing that it could be made available in music stores within that month . 
 After the song failed to gain an official release , differing allegations arose as to who was to blame . The Los Angeles Times reported that the " What More Can I Give " project was abandoned after it emerged that the song 's executive producer , Marc Schaffel , had directed and produced gay pornography . News of Schaffel 's background supposedly became known to an entertainment television show , whose staff threatened to expose the producer 's past in porn . Jackson 's legal and management team subsequently sought to end the musician 's business relationship with Schaffel , declaring their intentions in a letter sent to the producer 's lawyers in November 2001 .

 One year after the all @-@ star recording of " What More Can I Give " , it was played for the first time on radio . WKTU @-@ FM , a radio station based in New York , debuted the song without permission and played it in heavy rotation . WKTU @-@ FM 's Program Director Frankie Blue stated at the time , " This song is a gift to the world . Michael and everyone donated their time for it , and it deserves to be heard . The song is called " What More Can I Give " , and I can give the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make them think about what they can give . " It is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song ; both Jackson and Schaffel were uninvolved with it . Prior to the airing , at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process , as well as to their representatives . Schaffel stated that he would hate to see the song not being used to raise money for charity , the intended purpose . WKTU @-@ FM received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song , thanking the station and asking where they could buy a copy of " What More Can I Give " .

 " What More Can I Give " was eventually made available as a digital download on October 27 , 2003 . The websites <unk> and <unk> sold the song at a price of $ 2 per download , with a portion of the proceeds from the fee going towards children 's charities such as Oneness , Mr. Holland 's Opus Foundation and the International Child Art Foundation . The charities support arts programs to eliminate racism , increase education and connect children throughout the world , respectively . The download project had been set up by Jackson with the American media company Clear Channel Communications . 
 = Western jackdaw = 
 The western jackdaw ( Corvus monedula ) , also known as the Eurasian jackdaw , European jackdaw , or simply jackdaw , is a passerine bird in the crow family . Found across Europe , western Asia and North Africa , it is mostly resident , although northern and eastern populations migrate south in winter . Four subspecies are recognised , which mainly differ in the colouration of the plumage on the head and nape . Linnaeus first described it formally , giving it the name Corvus monedula . Later analysis of its DNA suggests that it , along with its closest relative , the Daurian jackdaw , is an early offshoot from the genus Corvus , and possibly distinct enough to warrant reclassification in a separate genus , Coloeus . The common name derives from the word " jack " , meaning " small " , and " daw " , the native English name for the bird . 
 Measuring 34 â 39 centimetres ( 13 â 15 in ) in length , the western jackdaw is a black @-@ plumaged bird with a grey nape and distinctive pale @-@ grey irises . It is gregarious and vocal , living in small groups with a complex social structure in farmland , open woodland , on coastal cliffs , and in urban settings . An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder , it eats a wide variety of plant material and invertebrates , as well as food waste from urban areas . Western jackdaws are monogamous and build simple nests of sticks in cavities in trees , cliffs , or buildings . About five pale blue or blue @-@ green eggs with brown speckles are laid and incubated by the female . The young fledge in four to five weeks . 
 = = Systematics = = 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The western jackdaw was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th century work Systema Naturae . Owing to its supposed fondness for picking up coins , Linnaeus gave it the binomial name Corvus monedula , choosing the specific name <unk> , which is derived from <unk> , the Latin stem of the word " money " . The genus Coloeus , from the Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) for jackdaw , was created by Peter Pallas in 1766 , though most subsequent works have retained the two jackdaw species in Corvus . 
 The original Old English word <unk> ( pronounced with initial ch ) gave modern English " chough " ; Chaucer sometimes used this word to refer to the western jackdaw , as did Shakespeare in Hamlet although there has been debate about which species he was referring to . This onomatopoeic name , based on the western jackdaw 's call , now refers to corvids of the genus Pyrrhocorax ; the red @-@ billed chough ( Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax ) , formerly particularly common in Cornwall , became known initially as the " Cornish chough " and then just the " chough " , the name transferring from one species to the other . 
 The common name jackdaw first appeared in the 16th century , and is thought to be a compound of the forename Jack , used in animal names to signify a small form ( e.g. jack snipe ) , and the archaic native English word daw . Formerly , western jackdaws were simply called " <unk> " . The metallic chyak call may be the origin of the jack part of the common name , but this is not supported by the Oxford English Dictionary . Daw , first used for the bird in the 15th century , is held by the Oxford English Dictionary to be derived from the postulated Old English <unk> , citing the cognates in Old High German <unk> , Middle High German <unk> or <unk> , and modern German Dahle or <unk> , and dialectal <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Names in English dialects are numerous . Scottish and north English dialects have included ka or <unk> since the 14th century . The Midlands form of this word was co or coo . <unk> is potentially a compound of ka and <unk> , a variant of daw . Other dialectal or obsolete names include <unk> , <unk> , caddy , <unk> , college @-@ bird , <unk> , <unk> , ka @-@ <unk> , chimney @-@ sweep bird ( from their nesting propensities ) , and sea @-@ crow ( from the frequency with which they are found on coasts ) . It was also frequently known quasi @-@ nominally as Jack . 
 An archaic collective noun for a group of jackdaws is a " clattering " . Another name for a flock is a " train " . 
 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 A study in 2000 found that the genetic distance between jackdaws and the other members of Corvus was greater than that within the rest of the genus . This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name Coloeus in her Birds of South Asia ( 2005 ) , a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters . A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial control region of several corvids . It found that the western jackdaw , and the closely related Daurian jackdaw ( C. <unk> ) of eastern Russia and China , were basal to the core Corvus clade . The names Coloeus monedula and Coloeus <unk> have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their official list . The two species of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in the Altai Mountains , southern Siberia , and Mongolia . Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 There are four recognised subspecies of the western jackdaw . All European subspecies intergrade where their populations meet . C. m. monedula intergrades into C. m. soemmerringii in a transition zone running from Finland south across the Baltic and eastern Poland to Romania and Croatia . 
 C. m. monedula ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) , the nominate subspecies , is found in eastern Europe . Its range extends across Scandinavia , from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and <unk> in Denmark , through eastern Germany and Poland , and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north @-@ western Romania , Vojvodina in northern Serbia , and Slovenia . It breeds in south @-@ eastern Norway , southern Sweden , and northern and eastern Denmark , with occasional wintering in England and France . It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain . It has a pale nape and sides of the neck , a dark throat , and a light grey partial collar of variable extent . 
 C. m. spermologus ( Vieillot , 1817 ) occurs in western and central Europe from the British Isles , Netherlands and the Rhineland in the north , through western Switzerland into Italy in the south @-@ east , and the Iberian peninsula and Morocco in the south . It winters in the canary Islands and Corsica . The name " spermologus " comes from the Greek <unk> , a picker up of seeds . It is darker in colour than the other subspecies and lacks the whitish border at the base of the grey nape . 
 C. m. soemmerringii ( Fischer , 1811 ) is found in north @-@ eastern Europe and north and central Asia , from the former Soviet Union to Lake Baikal and north @-@ west Mongolia , and south to Turkey , Israel and the eastern Himalayas . Its south @-@ western limits are Serbia and southern Romania . It winters in Iran and northern India ( Kashmir ) . Johann Fischer von Waldheim described this taxon as Corvus soemmerringii in 1811 , noting its differences from populations in western Europe . Its species name was given in honour of the German anatomist , Samuel Thomas von <unk> . It is distinguished by the nape and the sides of the neck being paler , creating a contrasting black crown and lighter grey part collar . 
 C. m. cirtensis ( Rothschild and Hartert , 1912 ) is found in Morocco and Algeria in north @-@ western Africa and was formerly found in Tunisia . The name " cirtensis " refers to the ancient city of Cirta in Numidia . The plumage is duller and more uniformly dark grey than the other subspecies , with the paler nape less distinct . 
 = = Description = = 
 Measuring 34 â 39 centimetres ( 13 â 15 in ) in length , the western jackdaw is the second smallest member of the genus Corvus . Most of the plumage is a shiny black , with a purple ( in subspecies monedula and spermologus ) or blue ( in subspecies cirtensis and soemmerringii ) sheen on the crown , forehead , and secondaries , and a green @-@ blue sheen on the throat , primaries , and tail . The cheeks , nape and neck are light grey to greyish @-@ silver , and the underparts are slate @-@ grey . The legs are black , as is the short stout bill , the length of which is about 75 % of the length of the rest of the head . There are rictal bristles covering around 40 % of the maxilla and 25 % of the lower mandible . The irises of adults are greyish or silvery white while those of juveniles are light blue , becoming brownish before whitening at around one year of age . The sexes look alike , though the head and neck plumage of male birds fades more with age and wear , particularly just before moulting . Western jackdaws undergo a complete moult from June to September in the western parts of their range , and a month later in the east . The purplish sheen of the cap is most prominent just after moulting . 
 Immature birds have duller and less demarcated plumage . The head is a sooty black , sometimes with a faint greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible ; the back and side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black . The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen . 
 There is very little geographic variation in size . The main differences are the presence or absence of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape , the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts . Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill . Body colour becomes darker further north , in mountain regions and humid climates , and paler elsewhere . However , individual variation , particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting , can often be greater than geographic differences . 
 A skilled flyer , the western jackdaw can manoeuvre tightly as well as tumble and glide . It has characteristic jerky wing beats when flying , though these are not evident when birds are migrating . Wind tunnel experiments show that the preferred gliding speed is between 6 and 11 metres ( 20 and 36 ft ) per second and that the wingspan decreases as the bird flies faster . On the ground , western jackdaws have an upright posture and strut briskly , their short legs giving them a rapid gait . They feed with their heads held down or horizontally . 
 Within its range , the western jackdaw is unmistakable ; its short bill and grey nape are distinguishing features . From a distance , it can be confused with a rook ( Corvus <unk> ) , or when in flight , with a pigeon or chough . Flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size , faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips . They also have shorter , thicker necks , much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks . They can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs . The western jackdaw is very similar in morphology , behaviour , and calls to the Daurian jackdaw , with which its range overlaps in western Asia . Adults are readily distinguished , since the Daurian has a pied plumage , but immature birds are much more similar , both species having dark plumage and dark eyes . The Daurian tends to be darker , with a less contrasting nape than the Western . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 Western jackdaws are voluble birds . The main call , frequently given in flight , is a metallic and squeaky chyak @-@ chyak or kak @-@ kak . This is a contact or greeting call . A feeding call made by adults to call young , or males when offering food to their mates , has been transcribed as <unk> or <unk> . Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males , written as <unk> , <unk> or <unk> . Perched birds often chatter together , and before settling for the night , large roosting flocks make a cackling noise . Western jackdaws also have a hoarse , drawn @-@ out alarm call , <unk> or <unk> , used when warning of predators or when mobbing them . Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age . As they grow , their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18 . After this , the voice deepens and softens . From day 25 , the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise . The European jackdaw can be trained to speak , and whilst it can copy the human voice well , it is usually limited to just a few words or phrases . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The western jackdaw is found from north @-@ west Africa through all of Europe , except for the extreme north , and eastwards through central Asia to the eastern Himalayas and Lake Baikal . To the east , it occurs throughout Turkey , the Caucasus , Iran , Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and north @-@ west India . However , it is regionally extinct in Malta and Tunisia . The range is vast , with an estimated global extent of between 1 million and 10 million square kilometres ( 4 hundred thousand to 4 million square miles ) . It has a large global population , with an estimated 15 @.@ 6 to 45 million individuals in Europe alone . Censuses of bird populations in marginal uplands in Britain show that western jackdaws greatly increased in numbers between the 1970s and 2010 , although this increase may be related to recovery from previous periods when they were regarded as pests . The UK population was estimated at 2 @.@ 5 million individuals in 1998 , up from 780 @,@ 000 in 1970 . 
 Most populations are resident , but the northern and eastern populations are more migratory , relocating to wintering areas between September and November and returning between February and early May . Their range expands northwards into Russia to Siberia during summer , and retracts in winter . They are vagrants to the Faroe Islands , particularly in the winter and spring , and occasionally to Iceland . Elsewhere , western jackdaws congregate over winter in the Ural Valley in north @-@ western Kazakhstan , the north Caspian , and the Tian Shan region of western China . They are winter visitors to the Quetta Valley in western Pakistan , and are winter vagrants to Lebanon , where they were first recorded in 1962 . In Syria , they are winter vagrants and rare residents with some confirmed breeding taking place . The soemmerringii subspecies occurs in south @-@ central Siberia and extreme north @-@ west China and is accidental to Hokkaido , Japan . A small number of western jackdaws reached the north @-@ east of North America in the 1980s and have been found from Atlantic Canada to Pennsylvania . They have also occurred as vagrants in Gibraltar , Mauritania , and Saint Pierre and Miquelon , and one is reported to have been seen in Egypt . 
 Western jackdaws inhabit wooded steppes , pastures , cultivated land , coastal cliffs , and towns . They thrive when forested areas are cleared and converted to fields and open areas . Habitats with a mix of large trees , buildings , and open ground are preferred ; open fields are left to the rook , and more wooded areas to the Eurasian jay ( Garrulus glandarius ) . Along with other corvids such as the rook , common raven ( Corvus corax ) , and hooded crow ( C. cornix ) , some western jackdaws spend the winter in urban parks ; populations measured in three urban parks in Warsaw show increases from October to December , possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north . The same data from Warsaw , collected from 1977 to 2003 , showed that the wintering western jackdaw population had increased four @-@ fold . The cause of the increase is unknown , but a reduction in the number of rooks may have benefited the species locally , or rooks overwintering in Belarus may have caused western jackdaws to relocate to Warsaw . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Generally wary of people in the forest or countryside , western jackdaws are much tamer in urban areas . Like magpies , they are known to show interest in shiny objects such as jewellery . John Gay , in his Beggar 's Opera , notes that " A covetous fellow , like a jackdaw , steals what he was never made to enjoy , for the sake of hiding it " . In Tobias Smollett 's The Expedition of Humphry Clinker , a scathing character assassination runs , " He is ungracious as a hog , greedy as a vulture , and thievish as a jackdaw . " 
 Highly gregarious , western jackdaws are generally seen in flocks of varying sizes , though males and females pair @-@ bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks . Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting , with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site . At Uppsala , Sweden , 40 @,@ 000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night . Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks , the latter particularly when migrating or roosting . They have been recorded foraging with the common starling ( Sturnus vulgaris ) , Northern lapwing ( Vanellus vanellus ) , and common gull ( Larus canus ) in northwestern England . Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons ( Falco biarmicus ) , although larger groups are more able to elude the predators . Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies , common ravens , or Egyptian vultures ( Neophron percnopterus ) ; one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group . Occasionally , a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed . 
 In his book King Solomon 's Ring , Konrad Lorenz described and analysed the complex social interactions in a western jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg , Austria . He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration . He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure , with higher @-@ ranked individuals dominating lower @-@ ranked birds , and pair @-@ bonded birds sharing the same rank . Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females . Upon pairing , the female assumes the same social position as her partner . Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order , and are the last to have access to food and shelter . Lorenz noted one case in which a male , absent during the dominance struggles and pair <unk> , returned to the flock , became the dominant male , and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate . This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others . According to Lorenz , the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock . 
 = = = Social displays = = = 
 Social hierarchy in western jackdaw flocks is determined by supplanting , fighting , and threat displays â several of which have been described . In the bill @-@ up posture , the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and <unk> its plumage . Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness , the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks . A bill @-@ down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour . In this display , a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers , and sometimes slightly lifts its wings . Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues . In the forward @-@ threat posture , a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards . In intense versions , the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings . This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females . In the defensive @-@ threat posture , the bird lowers its head and bill , spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers . Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch @-@ site . The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight . Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet @-@ first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other . Other individuals gather and call noisily . 
 Western jackdaws entreat their partners to preen them by showing their nape and ruffling their head feathers . Birds mainly preen each other 's head and neck . Known as allopreening , this behaviour is almost always done between birds of a mated pair . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Foraging takes place mostly on the ground in open areas and to some extent in trees . Landfill sites , bins , streets , and gardens are also visited , more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about . Various feeding methods are employed , such as jumping , pecking , clod @-@ turning and scattering , probing the soil , and occasionally , digging . Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by dropping vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat . Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil . <unk> will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals , seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests , and will catch flying ants in flight . Compared with other corvids , the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill ; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy . 
 The western jackdaw tends to feed on small invertebrates up to 18 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) in length that are found above ground , including various species of beetle ( particularly cockchafers of the genus Melolontha , and weevil larvae and pupae . ) , Diptera , and Lepidoptera species , as well as snails and spiders . Also eaten are small rodents , bats , the eggs and chicks of birds , and carrion such as roadkill . Vegetable items consumed include farm grains ( barley , wheat and oats ) , weed seeds , elderberries , acorns , and various cultivated fruits . Examination of the gizzards of western jackdaws shot in Cyprus in spring and summer revealed a diet of cereals ( predominantly wheat ) and insects ( notably cicadas and beetles ) . The diet averages 84 % plant material except when breeding , when the main food source is insects . A study in southern Spain examining western jackdaw pellets found that they contained significant amounts of silicaceous and calcareous grit to aid digestion of vegetable food and supply dietary calcium . 
 Opportunistic and highly adaptable , the western jackdaw varies its diet markedly depending on available food sources . They have been recorded taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark ( Alauda arvensis ) , Manx shearwater ( Puffinus puffinus ) , razorbill ( Alca torda ) , common murre ( Uria aalge ) , grey heron ( Ardea cinerea ) , rock pigeon ( Columba livia ) , and Eurasian collared dove ( Streptopelia <unk> ) . A field study of a large city dump on the outskirts of LeÃ³n in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk , and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism . The saker falcon ( Falco cherrug ) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia . 
 Western jackdaws practice active food sharing â where the initiative for the transfer lies with the donor â with a number of individuals , regardless of sex or kinship . They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food . The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship . Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species , including chimpanzees . The function of this behaviour is not fully understood , though it has been found to be detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism , reciprocity and harassment avoidance . It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Western jackdaws become sexually mature in their second year . Genetic analysis of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra @-@ pair copulation and there is little evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure . Some pairs do separate in the first few months , but almost all pairings of over six months ' duration are lifelong , ending only when a partner dies . Widowed or separated birds fare badly , often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone . 
 Western jackdaws usually breed in colonies with pairs collaborating to find a nest site , which they then defend from other pairs and predators during most of the year . They nest in cavities in trees or cliffs , in ruined or occupied buildings and in chimneys , the common feature being a sheltered site for the nest . The availability of suitable sites influences their presence in a locale . They may also use church steeples for nesting , a fact reported in verse by 18th century English poet William Cowper : 
 A great frequenter of the church , Where , <unk> , he finds a perch , And dormitory too . 
 A mated pair usually constructs a nest by improving a crevice by dropping sticks into it ; it is then built on top of the platform formed . This behaviour has led to the blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces , sometimes with birds still on them . Nest platforms can attain a great size . John Mason Neale notes that a " Clerk was allowed by the <unk> to have for his own use all that the <unk> had brought into the Tower : and he took home , at one time , two cart @-@ loads of good firewood , besides a great quantity of rubbish which he threw away . " In his The Natural History of Selborne , Gilbert White notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath the lintels of Stonehenge , and describes an example of the bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting . The species has been recorded outcompeting the tawny owl ( Strix aluco ) for nest sites in the Netherlands . They can take over old nest sites of the black woodpecker ( Dryocopus martius ) and stock dove ( Columba <unk> ) . Breeding colonies may also edge out those of the red @-@ billed chough , but in turn be ousted by larger corvids such as the carrion crow , rook or magpie . 
 Nests are lined with hair , wool , dead grass and many other materials . The eggs are a lighter colour than those of other corvids , being smooth , a glossy pale blue or blue @-@ green with darker speckles ranging from dark brown to olive or grey @-@ violet . Egg size and weight varies slightly between subspecies ; those of subspecies monedula average 35 @.@ 0 by 24 @.@ 7 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 38 in Ã 0 @.@ 97 in ) and 11 @.@ 1 g ( 0 @.@ 39 oz ) in weight , those of subspecies soemmerringii 34 @.@ 8 by 25 @.@ 0 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 37 in Ã 0 @.@ 98 in ) in size and 11 @.@ 3 g ( 0 @.@ 40 oz ) in weight , and those of subspecies spermologus 35 @.@ 0 by 25 @.@ 2 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 38 in Ã 0 @.@ 99 in ) in size and 11 @.@ 5 g ( 0 @.@ 41 oz ) in weight . Clutches usually contain 4 or 5 eggs , although a Slovakian study found clutch sizes ranging from 2 to 9 eggs . The eggs are incubated by the female for 17 â 18 days until hatching as naked altricial chicks , which are completely dependent on the adults for food . They fledge after 28 â 35 days , and the parents continue to feed them for another four weeks or so . 
 Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and incubation begins before clutch completion , which often leads to the death of the last @-@ hatched young . If the supply of food is low , parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive . Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of clutch failure . 
 The great spotted cuckoo ( <unk> glandarius ) has been recorded as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw , depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel . Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain , tawny owl , and least weasel ( Mustela nivalis ) in England , and brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) in Finland . The European pine marten ( Martes <unk> ) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests are part of a colony . 
 = = Parasites and diseases = = 
 Western jackdaws have learned to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after delivery by the milkman . The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink . This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded . It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future . 
 An outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans has been linked to western jackdaws . During a post @-@ mortem on an affected bird , a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen . The illness appeared to be a co @-@ infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus ( <unk> ) . Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw , although their pathogenicity or role is unknown . 
 = = Pest control = = 
 The western jackdaw has been hunted as vermin , though not as heavily culled as other species of corvid . After a series of poor harvests in the early 1500s , Henry VIII introduced a Vermin Act in 1532 " <unk> to <unk> <unk> ( i.e. jackdaws ) , Crowes and <unk> " to protect grain crops from their predations . Western jackdaws were notorious as they also favoured fruit , especially cherries . This act was taken up in a piecemeal fashion , but Elizabeth I passed the Act for the Preservation of <unk> in 1566 that was taken up with more vigour . The species was hunted for its threat to grain crops and for propensity for nesting in belfries until the mid @-@ 20th century . Particularly large numbers were culled in the county of Norfolk . Western jackdaws were also culled on game estates as they raid nests of other birds for eggs . In a 2003 dissertation on public opinion of corvids , Antonia <unk> notes that the German naturalist Alfred Brehm considered the western jackdaw to be a lovable bird , and did not describe any negative impacts of this species on agriculture . 
 The western jackdaw is one of a very small number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom . The other pest species that can be controlled by trapping are the crow , jay , magpie and rook . An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them . As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive , and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations . Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought ( incorrectly ) to prey on gamebirds . 
 = = Cultural depictions and folklore = = 
 An ancient Greek and Roman adage runs " The swans will sing when the jackdaws are silent " , meaning that educated or wise people will speak only after the foolish have become quiet . In Ancient Greek folklore , a jackdaw can be caught with a dish of oil . A narcissistic creature , it falls in while looking at its own reflection . The mythical Princess Arne <unk> was bribed with gold by King Minos of Crete , and was punished by the gods for her greed by being transformed into an equally avaricious jackdaw , who still seeks shiny things . The Roman poet Ovid described jackdaws as harbingers of rain in his poetic work Amores . Pliny notes how the Thessalians , Illyrians , and <unk> cherished jackdaws for destroying grasshoppers ' eggs . The Veneti are fabled to have bribed the jackdaws to spare their crops . 
 In some cultures , a jackdaw on the roof is said to predict a new arrival ; alternatively , a jackdaw settling on the roof of a house or flying down a chimney is an omen of death , and coming across one is considered a bad omen . A jackdaw standing on the vanes of a cathedral tower is said to foretell rain . The 12th century historian William of Malmesbury records the story of a woman who , upon hearing a jackdaw chattering " more loudly than usual , " grew pale and became fearful of suffering a " dreadful calamity " , and that " while yet speaking , the messenger of her misfortunes arrived " . Czech superstition formerly held that if jackdaws are seen quarreling , war will follow , and that jackdaws will not build nests at <unk> after being banished by Saint Procopius . 
 The jackdaw was considered sacred in Welsh folklore as it nested in church steeples â it was shunned by the Devil because of its choice of residence . Nineteenth century belief in the Fens held that seeing a jackdaw on the way to a wedding was a good omen for a bride . 
 The jackdaw is featured on the Ukrainian town of Halych 's ancient coat of arms , the town 's name allegedly being derived from the East Slavic word for the bird . In The Book of Laughter and Forgetting ( 1979 ) , Milan Kundera notes that Franz Kafka 's father Hermann had a sign in front of his shop with a jackdaw painted next to his name , since " <unk> " means jackdaw in Czech . 
 = Claire Taylor = 
 Samantha Claire Taylor MBE ( born 25 September 1975 ) is a former cricketer who represented England more than 150 times between 1998 and 2011 . A top order batsman , Taylor was the first woman to be named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year . Along with Charlotte Edwards , she was the mainstay of England 's batting during the first decade of the 21st century , and played a key role in the team 's two world titles in 2009 . 
 Taylor did not play cricket until the age of 13 , but four years later made her county debut . Initially considered a wicket @-@ keeper with limited batting ability , Taylor struggled to break into the England team . She made her international debut in 1998 , and within two years was a regular in the team . After an unsuccessful World Cup in 2000 , Taylor left her job to become a full @-@ time cricketer . Over the subsequent five years , she developed into one of the leading batsmen in women 's cricket , but after another failure in the 2005 World Cup she resumed her career alongside cricket . 
 Despite her struggles at the World Cup , Taylor continued to improve as a batsman , and in 2006 , she scored 156 not out , the highest individual total in an ODI at Lord 's Cricket Ground . Her batting successes resulted in her being short @-@ listed for the ICC Women 's Cricketer of the Year in 2007 and 2008 , and she won the award in 2009 . After being the leading run @-@ scorer in the 2009 World Cup , and player of the tournament in the World Twenty20 later that year , she was less consistent from 2010 , though she performed well in the pair of quadrangular tournaments played in England during her final summer of cricket , and completed her career with batting averages in excess of 40 in both Test and ODI cricket .

 = = = Early life and career = = = 
 Samantha Claire Taylor was born in Amersham , Buckinghamshire on 25 September 1975 , as part of a sporting family : her father played rugby , and her mother played hockey . She attended Dolphin School in Hurst , Berkshire , where she initially played softball , participating as the only girl in the school team . Taylor did not play cricket until a summer camp at the age of 13 , but thereafter improved to such a level that she captained the Dolphin School cricket team , playing alongside the boys . She subsequently moved to The Abbey School , Reading for a short time , and finally Kendrick School . Although she primarily played hockey as a teenager , at which she represented England at Under @-@ 17 and Under @-@ 19 as a forward , she began playing women 's county cricket for Thames Valley , making her debut for the side in May 1993 . 
 Taylor was awarded a place at The Queen 's College , Oxford to study Mathematics in 1994 . At Oxford , Taylor earned three blues for hockey , and three half blues for cricket . She also played for the college men 's cricket team , which included Iain Sutcliffe , who later played over three hundred county cricket matches . During her time at Oxford , Taylor continued to play for Thames Valley , and scored her maiden century in the women 's County Championship , scoring 109 runs against Lancashire and Cheshire in July 1996 . Her highest score prior to that innings had been 37 . The following year , having graduated from Oxford with a second @-@ class honours degree , Taylor scored successive half @-@ centuries for Thames Valley , reaching 97 against Sussex , 77 against Lancashire and Cheshire , and an unbeaten 62 against East Midlands . She had been making intermittent appearances for England at various age group levels for the previous five years , and in September 1997 , she scored 85 for England Under @-@ 21s against the touring South African side . Even so , she was not included in the team for the 1997 Women 's Cricket World Cup , but she was named as a non @-@ travelling reserve , something that Taylor said " confirmed to me my breakthrough into the senior squad . " 
 = = = International breakthrough = = = 
 In April 1998 , Taylor travelled to South Africa as part of the England Under @-@ 21 squad that competed in the women 's Inter @-@ Provincial Tournament , scoring two half @-@ centuries in the competition . Her full international debut occurred later that year , during the fourth One Day International ( ODI ) between England and Australia . Playing as a specialist batsman , Taylor scored one run during a heavy defeat for England . Taylor finished the 1998 women 's County Championship with two strong batting performances : she struck her second century , scoring 103 runs against West , followed by 65 runs against Surrey . Towards the end of the English season , she kept wicket for England in a match against England Under @-@ 21s , scoring an unbeaten 45 runs . She retained her place in the England squad for the series against the touring Indian team in 1999 . England struggled in the series , and Taylor was one of a number of inexperienced players in the squad who " failed to seize their chance " , according to the Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack report . Taylor 's highest score in the series was 12 runs , and she had batting averages of 11 @.@ 00 in the ODIs , and 5 @.@ 50 in the solitary Test match . 
 During the subsequent English winter of 1999 â 2000 , Taylor was part of the touring party that travelled to Australia and New Zealand for nine ODIs . The tour was a failure for the team : they lost all nine international matches , and their only win was a warm @-@ up match against Wellington , in which Taylor scored 83 runs . She secured another half @-@ century in the second ODI against New Zealand , scoring 56 runs after opening the innings . In a series in which England 's batting was described as dismal , her half @-@ century was one of only two in ODIs during the tour , and Wisden reported that giving Taylor an " overdue opportunity " was one saving grace of the trip . She struggled for runs in the series against the touring South Africans in 2000 , aggregating 68 runs from five innings , as once again the English batting â particularly the top order â was criticised . After the conclusion of the series , Taylor struck a century in a county match , scoring 115 runs for Berkshire against Surrey . 
 England 's " slide down the international ladder " continued during the 2000 Women 's Cricket World Cup , according to Wisden . The batting was once more culpable , but Taylor provided some relief . She scored 267 runs in the tournament at an average of 66 @.@ 75 , ranking her among the top ten batsmen . She struck her first century in international cricket ; scoring 137 not out against Sri Lanka . In doing so , she shared a partnership of 188 runs with Jane Cassar , which as of 2012 , is a record for the fifth wicket in women 's ODIs . England failed to qualify from the group stage of the competition . 
 = = = Full @-@ time cricketer = = = 
 After the 2000 World Cup , Taylor wanted to focus on her desire to become one of the best batsmen in the world . In order to achieve this , she decided to become a full @-@ time cricketer . After university , she had joined Procter & Gamble , and by 2001 she was earning Â£ 38 @,@ 000 as an IT assistant manager at the company . In contrast , her income from cricket totalled Â£ 7 @,@ 000 , and in order to afford to quit her IT job , she had to move back in with her parents . England 's next series was against the World Cup runners @-@ up , Australia , who toured in June and July 2001 . England 's batting remained unreliable , and Australia won all five matches between the sides : two Test matches and three ODIs . Taylor was praised as the only highlight of the English batting ; her innings of 50 not out was the highest score by her side in any of the ODIs . In the second Test , she significantly improved on her previous best Test score of 18 runs , batting for over four hours in a gritty performance to reach 137 runs . Taylor missed the tour of India in January 2002 after injuring her knee in a training session , but returned the following summer with a string of good performances in the Super Fours â a competition in which the England selectors place the 48 leading players into four teams â trailing only her England team mate Charlotte Edwards as the leading run @-@ scorer . In the four ODIs that season , against New Zealand and India , Taylor failed to make an impact , scoring just 43 runs in total . 
 Ahead of a tour by the England women to New Zealand and Australia , Taylor competed in the State League , a one @-@ day competition in New Zealand , for the Canterbury Magicians . She finished the tournament in the top @-@ five batsmen , scoring 252 runs at an average of 42 @.@ 00 . Unfortunately for England , her good form did not continue into the international matches : in her seven ODI matches , she scored 87 runs . She continued to struggle at the start of the 2003 English domestic season , prompting Wisden to report that she " had barely scraped a run " in the County Championship matches . Despite her struggles , she survived an overhaul of the England squad , in which seven of the players who had toured Australia and New Zealand had been dropped . She repaid the faith shown in her , striking centuries in both Test matches against South Africa . The first , a score of 177 runs , was the highest total she made in Test cricket , and was scored over six and a half hours , and was just twelve runs short of the highest by any England woman . Two weeks later , she became one of only five women , as of 2012 , to have scored centuries in consecutive Test matches , when she scored 131 runs at Taunton . Her performances in the ODI series were less eye @-@ catching , but a half @-@ century in the first match helped her finish second to Laura Newton as England 's leading run @-@ scorer . 
 Taylor competed in the State League for the second consecutive year in early 2004 , and finished with the second @-@ most runs in the competition , scoring 401 runs at an average of 44 @.@ 55 . From New Zealand , she travelled to South Africa to join up with the England team for five ODIs . After scoring 90 runs in a warm @-@ up contest against an Invitational XI , she finished as England 's second most prolific run @-@ scorer behind Edwards , though she only once reached a half @-@ century in the international matches . Back in England for the 2004 Super Fours competition , Taylor and Edwards once more headed the batting tables , Taylor narrowly trailing her international team mate in terms of runs scored , but ahead of her on batting average , having scored 351 runs at 87 @.@ 75 . In the subsequent series against New Zealand , Taylor was the top @-@ scorer in the first Twenty20 International match played by either gender . Despite the quicker @-@ scoring nature of the Twenty20 game , Taylor was praised for her measured batting and placement . In the ODIs , England possessed greater depth in their batting , making the team less reliant on Taylor and Edwards ' performances . That depth helped them to win the series 3 â 2 , despite a low @-@ scoring sequence of matches for Taylor in which she averaged below twenty . 
 In preparation for the 2005 Women 's Cricket World Cup in South Africa , Taylor played her third and final season in the State League , though her 229 runs at an average of 38 @.@ 16 were the lowest she achieved in any year of the competition . During a short warm @-@ up series against South Africa , she enjoyed batting success , scoring 94 and 47 in the two ODIs , and then an unbeaten 166 runs against a side from Gauteng and North West . After the first round of matches were all lost to rain , Taylor struck the highest score of the tournament in England 's second match , against Sri Lanka . She scored 136 runs from 128 balls , and shared century partnerships with both Edwards and Clare Connor to help England record a large victory . She made little impact against India in the next match , but then scored 55 not out against South Africa and 46 against New Zealand to help ensure England 's qualification for the semi @-@ finals . Cricinfo reported that Australia were " undoubted favourites " for their semi @-@ final clash with England , and that Taylor would be one of her side 's key players for the contest . After the early loss of Laura Newton , Taylor was dismissed for the third duck of her ODI career , and England subsided to a five @-@ wicket loss . She finished the tournament as one of the top @-@ three batsmen by both runs @-@ scored and average , aggregating 265 runs at 53 @.@ 00 . 
 = = = Further development = = = 
 After the World Cup , Taylor was disheartened by both her own , and England 's , lack of success . She bemoaned that the sacrifices she had made had come to nothing , and after talking to psychologists , she realised that she needed to <unk> her work â life balance . An amateur violinist , she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra , and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant . 
 In the English summer of 2005 , England hosted Australia for two Test matches and six limited @-@ overs contests . The two Tests formed The Women 's Ashes , an accolade that England had not won since 1963 . In the first Test , Taylor scored a patient 35 runs in the first innings , and shared a partnership of 81 with Edwards , but the pair fell in quick succession , and England struggled thereafter . In the second innings , England required over 300 runs to win , but their top @-@ order collapsed , losing three wickets for just fourteen runs . Taylor suffered a duck in the match , and only a century by Arran Brindle rescued a draw for her side . In the second Test , which England won to secure the Ashes , Taylor scored 43 runs in the first innings to help England open up a 158 @-@ run lead . Taylor finished the five @-@ match ODI series as England 's leading run @-@ scorer , totalling 325 runs at an average of 65 @.@ 00 . After hitting half @-@ centuries in the first and the third matches , she was praised by The Daily Telegraph for the quality of her " on @-@ driving and cutting " as she scored 116 runs in the fourth match to level the series 2 â 2 . 
 Taylor , and England , had a difficult tour of Sri Lanka and India in late 2005 ; after winning the two ODIs against Sri Lanka , England drew the only Test against India and lost the ODI series 4 â 1 . Taylor only scored 76 runs in the seven ODI matches , and made scores of five and three in the Test . She re @-@ found her batting form at the start of the 2006 English cricket season , topping the batting averages in the 2006 Super Fours competition , scoring two centuries and two half @-@ centuries in six matches for the Sapphires . 
 Facing the touring Indians later that summer , Taylor made small totals in her first two appearances at the crease , scoring 10 in the only Twenty20 match , and 32 in the first innings of their solitary Test . She reached her fourth and final century in a Test match in the second innings , scoring 115 runs to put England into a potentially match winning position , though the match finished as a draw . The first game of the ODI series featured what the Marylebone Cricket Club describe as " Taylor 's finest hour in an England shirt " . Batting at number three , Taylor was called upon early , after opening batsman Edwards was run out in the third over . She was dropped twice in quick succession during her innings , but continued to reach her century from 110 balls . Having reached the milestone , she scored more rapidly and remained 156 not out at the end of the innings , hitting 9 fours in her 151 @-@ ball innings . The score was the highest of Taylor 's ODI career , and is the joint fourth @-@ highest total in women 's ODI cricket . It is also the highest score made in an ODI match at Lord 's by either gender , passing the 138 runs scored by Viv Richards in 1979 . 
 In the Women 's Quadrangular Series hosted by India in early 2007 , Taylor was England 's best performer with the bat . Despite her side losing all six of their group matches , she finished the tournament with the second @-@ most runs of any player , totalling 346 . She scored half @-@ centuries against each of the other three teams competing â Australia , India and New Zealand â and also scored an unbeaten 113 in the first match against Australia . She had a relatively quiet domestic season in 2007 , ranking sixth amongst run @-@ scorers in the Super Fours , having passed 50 runs just once , and despite ranking second by both runs scored and batting average in the County Championship , Taylor only scored two half @-@ centuries in her five appearances in that competition . England started the summer with four Twenty20 matches , one against South Africa and three against New Zealand , in which Taylor made three scores of 20 or more , but did not reach a half @-@ century . In the third ODI against New Zealand , she scored her sixth century in the format , but her 110 runs came from 133 deliveries , and the Wisden series report suggests that the scoring rate was too slow : New Zealand chased down the total in fewer than 36 overs . In the next match , Taylor scored 72 as England attempted to chase down 240 runs to win , but they were eventually bowled out 43 runs short . Though she only made small totals in the other three matches of the series , Taylor finished as the leading run @-@ scorer in the series , though New Zealand 's Aimee Watkins had a superior batting average . Her performances over the year from August 2006 resulted in Taylor being shortlisted for the ICC Women 's Cricketer of the Year award , alongside Australia 's Lisa Sthalekar and the eventual winner , India 's <unk> Goswami . During the voting period , Taylor scored three centuries and three half @-@ centuries in international cricket .

 England travelled to Australia and New Zealand in early 2008 attempting to improve on their previous visits . In ten ODI matches in Australia against their hosts previously , England had only managed one win , while against New Zealand they had won just three of fifteen contests . England started badly , losing two of their warm @-@ up matches by significant margins , and then falling 21 runs short in the Twenty20 match which opened the series . Taylor top @-@ scored for England in their Twenty20 defeat with 34 runs from 32 balls . She made a similar score in the first ODI match against the hosts , but in the second match both Taylor and Edwards were out for ducks in a heavy defeat for England . After the third match of the series was abandoned without any play , Taylor scored her first half @-@ century of the tour , and shared a century partnership with Edwards to help England secure a 2 â 1 lead in the series , guaranteeing that they would at least draw the five @-@ match contest . After Australia won the last ODI to tie the series , the two sides met at the Bradman Oval to play the only Test of the tour . Taylor and Edwards again enjoyed a successful partnership in England 's first innings ; Taylor scored 79 runs as the pair put on 159 together . She scored an unbeaten half @-@ century in the second innings to help England to retain the Ashes . 
 Taylor carried her good form into the subsequent series against New Zealand , starting the second leg of their trip with a half @-@ century against New Zealand A in a warm @-@ up match in which she was acting captain . England struggled in the first ODI however : only Taylor and Edwards reached double figures for the tourists as they suffered a 123 @-@ run loss . In the following match , Taylor scored the seventh international century of her career , remaining 111 not out as England secured a nine @-@ wicket win over New Zealand . She scored a half @-@ century in the third ODI of the series , and 34 runs in the fifth to finish as England 's leading run @-@ scorer of the tour , scoring 342 runs at an average of 48 @.@ 85 from the nine ODI matches in Australia and New Zealand . 
 Playing in the first match of Berkshire 's County Championship campaign , Taylor scored 146 runs from 148 balls against Nottinghamshire , out of a team total of 212 : no other Berkshire batsman scored more than 10 runs , and Nottinghamshire won by six wickets . In a two match ODI series against the West Indies she made minimal impact , but was described by Cricinfo as being " at her dominant best " in the first match of the subsequent series against South Africa . She struck 7 fours during her 70 @-@ ball innings and scored 83 runs . In the three remaining matches of the series , she made modest totals , before missing the Twenty20 Internationals due to illness . Taylor reached a landmark during the third series of the summer , making her 100th ODI appearance , against India . In the five @-@ match series , which England won 4 â 0 , Taylor remained not out in each of her three innings , scoring 125 runs . Following that series , the ICC introduced player rankings for women 's ODI cricket , for which Taylor was top of the batsmen . 
 = = = Double world champions = = = 
 In 2009 , England participated in both the Women 's Cricket World Cup , and the inaugural Women 's World Twenty20 . Taylor was identified as one of England 's key players in a preview of the tournament , and she set up victory for England in their opening match against Sri Lanka with her eighth ODI century , her third in successive World Cup matches against Sri Lanka . She asserted her dominance once more in the second match , against India , scoring quicker than a run a ball for her 69 not out , to help England chase down a modest total in under 40 overs . Not required to bat against Pakistan , and dismissed for 19 against New Zealand , Taylor helped secure England 's place in the final with a rapid 65 runs , including 2 sixes and 6 fours , against the West Indies . In England 's final match of the group stages , Taylor top @-@ scored with 49 runs in a dead rubber loss against Australia : Australia could not qualify for the final , and England were already through . In the final , having restricted New Zealand to 166 , England were ahead of the required rate early . An early loss of wicket brought Taylor to the crease , and she played an attacking innings of 21 , including 4 fours , before being bowled . England won the match by four wickets , to become ODI world champions . Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run @-@ scorer , having made 324 runs , and her batting average was the highest amongst batsmen with over 100 runs . She was one of five England players to be named in the team of the tournament . 
 Taylor 's next international action came during the inaugural Women 's World Twenty20 tournament , held in England . Despite not being required to bat in England 's opening match against India , she was the second most prolific batsmen in the competition , finishing with 199 runs , just one less than New Zealand 's Aimee Watkins . In the group stage match against Sri Lanka , Taylor achieved her highest score in Twenty20 International cricket , making an unbeaten 75 . Just five days later , she improved on that score , reaching 76 not out against Australia in the semi @-@ finals . Batting with Beth Morgan , the pair maintained a run @-@ rate of almost 10 runs an over to secure England 's place in the final . Facing New Zealand in the final , England dismissed their opponents for 85 runs , but laboured to their total ; Taylor top @-@ scored for her side with 39 not out , and was the only England player to score a faster than a run a ball . Taylor was named as player of the tournament , and having only been dismissed once , finished with a batting average of 199 @.@ 00 . In England 's subsequent series against Australia , Taylor struggled for runs , scoring 79 runs across four ODI innings , and being dismissed for under 20 runs in each innings of the only Test match . She opted to miss the tour of the West Indies in late 2009 to focus on her work commitments .

 Taylor returned to action for England in the 2010 Women 's World Twenty20 , hosted by the West Indies . England , and Taylor , struggled in the competition . Their only victory came against South Africa , after they had already been eliminated from the tournament . Taylor scored 24 runs in the tournament at an average of just 8 @.@ 00 . Later that summer , England hosted New Zealand . Taylor finished as England 's leading run @-@ scorer in the ODI series , scoring 166 runs at an average of 41 @.@ 50 , including half @-@ centuries in two of the matches . In their next series , a tour of Sri Lanka , Taylor started strongly ; scoring 73 runs in a narrow victory against their hosts , but failed to achieve double figures in an innings for the remainder of the tour . Taylor sustained a shoulder injury during the second warm @-@ up match of their subsequent tour of Australia , which ruled her out of the rest of the visit . 
 Her injury had healed by the start of the 2011 season , but Taylor failed to make a significant impact on England 's first two matches of the Twenty20 Quadrangular series , against New Zealand and Australia . In the third match however , ESPNcricinfo 's Liam Brickhill claimed that she " roared back into form " with 66 runs from 46 balls to help England to a big win over India . England won the tournament , which was closely followed by an equivalent ODI Quadrangular . Taylor made at least 30 runs in three of her four innings of the tournament to finish among the top run @-@ scorers in the series , which was also won by England . At the conclusion of the series , Taylor announced her retirement from international cricket . She finished her career with batting averages in excess of 40 in both Test and ODI cricket , and at the time of her retirement she trailed only Charlotte Edwards in ODI runs scored . She continued to represent Berkshire until the conclusion of the 2011 season .

 During her teenage years , Taylor was considered a better hockey player than cricketer . When she began playing for Thames Valley , she was considered a wicket @-@ keeper with no more than average batting ability . At university , she began to develop her batting , playing alongside the men for her college side . The different pace and strength required in the men 's game meant that she had to learn to play off the back foot , in contrast to women 's cricket , which is generally played off the front foot . After graduating from university in 1997 , she made her international debut for England in 1998 , but batted low in the order for England , having been picked as a wicket @-@ keeper . Intent on improving her batting , she began one @-@ on @-@ one coaching with Mark Lane . At the time , it was unusual for a member of the England women 's team to have individual coaching sessions , and Taylor had to pay for the meetings herself . When they began working together , Lane was critical of her batting ; " She was just average , I would say . " The sessions helped to improve Taylor 's mental approach towards batting as well as making technical changes , though Lane promoted the use of bottom @-@ handed hockey @-@ style shots which came more naturally to Taylor . At her peak , she used her intelligence to help manipulate the field ; in an interview she described that , " when I 'm batting at my best I have a 3D awareness of the shape of the field and where the spaces are . "

 Taylor was the first woman to be selected as Wisden 's Cricketer of the Year , in 2009 . The editor of that years almanack , Scyld Berry noted that " there is no element of political correctness or publicity @-@ seeking about her selection , " and that she had been " chosen on merit , for being pre @-@ eminent in her form of the game . " She was short @-@ listed for the ICC Women 's Cricketer of the Year in both 2007 and 2008 , and won the award in 2009 . She was also named as the England and Wales Cricket Board 's Women 's Player of the Year in May 2009 . Continuing on from her success in 2009 , Taylor was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) on the 2010 New Year Honours list . During her career she topped the ICC batting rankings for both ODI and Twenty20 International cricket , and upon her retirement , former Test cricketer Mike Selvey suggested in The Guardian that she was " perhaps the finest batsman the women 's game has seen .

 = <unk> rail = 
 The snoring rail ( Aramidopsis plateni ) also known as the Celebes rail or Platen 's rail is a large flightless rail , the only member of the genus Aramidopsis . It is an Indonesian endemic found in dense vegetation in wet areas of Sulawesi and nearby Buton . The rail has grey underparts , a white chin , brown wings and a rufous patch on the hindneck . The sexes are similar , but the female has a brighter neck patch and a differently coloured bill and iris . The typical call is the snoring ee @-@ <unk> sound that gives the bird its English name . 
 Its inaccessible habitat and retiring nature mean that the snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour . Only the adult plumage has been described , and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded . It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards . Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972 , the rail is threatened by habitat loss ( even within nature reserves ) , hunting for food and predation by introduced species ; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The rails are a large and very widespread family , with nearly 150 species . They are small to medium @-@ sized , terrestrial or wetland birds , and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation . Island species readily become flightless ; of 53 extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands , 32 have lost the ability to fly . 
 The snoring rail was first classified as Rallus plateni by German ornithologist August Wilhelm Heinrich Blasius in 1860 , but was moved to its current monotypic genus Aramidopsis by English zoologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1893 . Following Taylor ( 1998 ) , it was considered to be more similar to the Inaccessible Island and white @-@ throated rails than to members of the Rallus genus , but a 2012 mitochondrial gene study suggests that it should actually be placed in Gallirallus , with Lewin 's rail and the slaty @-@ breasted rail as its closest relatives . 
 Aramidopsis derives from the genus name of the limpkin , Aramus and the Greek suffix opsis , " resembling " . Although the rail shares the origin of its name with the South American <unk> species , its distinctive bill , thick legs and barred lower belly distinguish it from that group . The species name plateni commemorates Carl Constantin Platen , a German doctor who collected birds and butterflies in the Malay Archipelago and gave Blasius his specimen of the rail . The common name refers to the rail 's distinctive call , and was given to the bird as der Vogel <unk> ( the snoring bird ) by German entomologist Gerd Heinrich when he rediscovered the species in 1932 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The snoring rail is 30 cm ( 12 in ) long and weighs 143 â 160 g ( 5 @.@ 0 â 5 @.@ 6 oz ) . It is flightless , with short wings , a very short tail and strong legs and feet . The back and the underparts from the forecrown to the breast are grey , apart from a white chin , and the sides and rear of the neck are deep orange @-@ red . Most of the rest of the upperparts are brown , and the belly , flanks and undertail have white barring . The male has black legs , a yellow iris and a brown and greenish down @-@ curved bill . The female is similar , but has a brighter hindneck colour , less white on the chin , a red iris , a cream and reddish bill and blue @-@ grey legs . Immature and juvenile plumages are undescribed . Visual confusion with sympatric rails is unlikely . The blue @-@ faced rail is similar in size , but is chestnut above and black below , and the buff @-@ banded rail has strongly marked upperparts , breast and head . The slaty @-@ breasted rail is smaller and has barred upperparts . 
 The call , given frequently , is a short <unk> followed by a distinctive snoring ee @-@ <unk> . A deep <unk> sound has also been recorded . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The snoring rail is an uncommon Indonesian endemic species of lowland and hill forests in northern , north central and southeastern Sulawesi . Another population was found on Buton island in 1995 . 
 The typical habitat of this species is dense vegetation in wet areas . This may include impenetrable bamboo and liana in forests , rattan in regrown forests , or elephant grass and bushes on the hillsides of the <unk> Peninsula . Claims of the species occurring in rice fields are believed to be due to confusion with the buff @-@ banded rail . The snoring rail occurs from sea level to 1 @,@ 300 m ( 4 @,@ 300 ft ) 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Its inaccessible habitat and sparse distribution means that little is known about this species . A few birds were shot by Platen and another expedition led by Paul Sarasin and his second cousin , Fritz , between 1893 and 1898 , but the rail was then not seen for more than thirty years until Heinrich found it almost at the end of a two @-@ year survey of Sulawesi , then known as Celebes . He described it as " the most priceless catch that I have ever hunted or will hunt " . More than a decade later , Dutch ornithologist Louis <unk> de <unk> also took a year to find the rail , despite concentrating on known suitable habitat . There were then no documented sightings until birds were observed in 1983 and 1989 . Sight records remain infrequent , and only about ten specimen corpses have been studied . 
 The snoring rail catches crabs in highland streams , and these crustaceans may be a major dietary item . It also forages in muddy areas , and has been recorded as consuming lizards . Nothing is known of its breeding behaviour other than a report of an adult seen feeding with two chicks in August 1983 , but the original report gives no details of the claimed sighting . 
 = = Status = = 
 The snoring rail is restricted to Sulawesi and Buton , and has an estimated population of 3 @,@ 500 â 15 @,@ 000 individuals . Its numbers are thought to be decreasing , and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . 
 It may always have been thinly spread , but there has been widespread deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat . The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972 , and the large Lore <unk> and <unk> Nani <unk> National Parks are within its range , but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas , and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore <unk> . The rail has been trapped for food in the past , and is sometimes killed by dogs , cats and other introduced predators . A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail , suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves . 
 = Night shark = 
 The night shark ( Carcharhinus signatus ) is a species of requiem shark , in the family Carcharhinidae , found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean . An inhabitant of the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope , this shark most commonly occurs at depths of 50 â 600 m ( 160 â 1 @,@ 970 ft ) and conducts a diel vertical migration , spending the day in deeper water and moving into shallower waters at night . Off northeastern Brazil , large numbers congregate around seamounts of varying depth . A slender , streamlined species , the night shark typically reaches a length of 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . It can be identified by its long pointed snout and large green eyes ( when alive ) , and is dark grayish blue or brown above and white below . 
 Night sharks are quick , nocturnally active , schooling predators that feed mainly on small bony fishes and squid . Reproduction is viviparous as with the other members of its family ; females mate during the summer and give birth to litters of usually 12 â 18 pups after a gestation period of a year . This deepwater species is not known to pose a danger to humans . It is caught incidentally by commercial tuna and swordfish longline fisheries in the western Atlantic , and also by a targeted longline fishery operating off northeastern Brazil . The night shark is highly valued for its fins , and additionally as a source of meat , liver oil , and fishmeal . However , most sharks caught off northeastern Brazil have been found to contain unsafe concentrations of mercury . 
 Because of its low reproductive rate and historically documented declines in areas such as the Caribbean , the night shark has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and the American Fisheries Society ( AFS ) . A population assessment has indicated that this species is secure in the waters off the United States , but this may not be true elsewhere .
