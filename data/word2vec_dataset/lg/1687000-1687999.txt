 Soon after his elevation , Basiliscus had despatched Illus and his brother <unk> against Zeno , who , now in his native fortresses , had resumed the life of an Isaurian chieftain . Basiliscus , however , failed to fulfill the promises he made to the two generals ; furthermore , they received letters from some of the leading ministers at the court , urging them to secure the return of Zeno , for the city now preferred a restored Isaurian to a Miaphysite whose unpopularity increased with the fiscal rapacity of his ministers . 
 During his operations in Isauria , Illus took Zeno 's brother , Longinus , prisoner and kept him in an Isaurian fortress . Because he thought he would have great influence over a restored Zeno , he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople in the summer of 476 . When Basiliscus received news of this danger , he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people , but it was too late . 
 Armatus , as magister militum , was sent with all available forces in Asia Minor , to oppose the advancing army of the Isaurians , but secret messages from Zeno , who promised to give him the title of magister militum for life and to confer the rank of Caesar on his son , induced him to betray his master . Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way . This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus . 
 In August 476 , Zeno besieged Constantinople . The Senate opened the gates of the city to the Isaurian , allowing the deposed emperor to resume the throne . Basiliscus fled to sanctuary in a church , but he was betrayed by Acacius and surrendered himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from Zeno not to shed their blood . Basiliscus , his wife Aelia Zenonis and his son Marcus were sent to a fortress in Cappadocia , where Zeno had them enclosed in a dry cistern , to die from exposure . 
 Basiliscus had ruled for twenty months . He is described by sources as a successful general , but slow of understanding and easy to deceive . 
 = West Bromwich Albion F.C. = 
 West Bromwich Albion Football Club / <unk> / , also known as West Brom , The Baggies , The Throstles , Albion or simply WBA , is an English professional football club based in West Bromwich in the West Midlands . The club was formed in 1878 and has played at its home ground , The Hawthorns , since 1900 . 
 Albion were one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888 and have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football . They have been champions of England once , in 1919 – 20 and have been runners @-@ up twice but they have had more success in the FA Cup , winning it five times . The first came in 1888 , the year the league was founded , and the most recent in 1968 , their last major trophy . They also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966 . The club 's longest consecutive period in the top division was between 1949 and 1973 , and from 1986 to 2002 they spent their longest ever spell out of the top division . The 2016 – 17 season is now their eleventh non consecutive season in the top flight since 2002 . 
 The team has played in navy blue and white stripes for most of the club 's history . Albion have a number of long @-@ standing rivalries with other West Midlands clubs ; their traditional rivals have always been Wolverhampton Wanderers with whom they contest the Black Country derby .

 = = = Early Years ( 1878 – 1960 ) = = = 
 The club was founded as West Bromwich Strollers in 1878 by workers from George Salter 's Spring Works in West Bromwich , in Staffordshire . They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880 , becoming the first team to adopt the Albion suffix . Albion was a district of West Bromwich where some of the players lived or worked , close to what is today <unk> Green . The club joined the Birmingham & District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition , the Birmingham Cup . They reached the quarter @-@ finals , beating several longer @-@ established clubs on the way . In 1883 , Albion won their first trophy , the Staffordshire Cup . Albion joined the Football Association in the same year ; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the 1883 – 84 season . In 1885 the club turned professional , and in 1886 they reached the FA Cup final for the first time , losing 2 – 0 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay . They reached the final again in 1887 , but lost 2 – 0 to Aston Villa . In 1888 the team won the trophy for the first time , beating strong favourites Preston North End 2 – 1 in the final . 
 In March 1888 , William McGregor wrote to what he considered to be the top five English teams , including Albion , informing them of his intention to form an association of clubs that would play each other home and away each season . Thus when the Football League started later that year , Albion became one of the twelve founder members . Albion 's second FA Cup success came in 1892 , beating Aston Villa 3 – 0 . They met Villa again in the 1895 final , but lost 1 – 0 . The team suffered relegation to Division Two in 1900 – 01 , their first season at the Hawthorns . They were promoted as champions the following season but relegated again in 1903 – 04 . The club won the Division Two championship once more in 1910 – 11 , and the following season reached another FA Cup Final , where they were defeated by Second Division Barnsley in a replay . 
 Albion won the Football League title in 1919 – 20 for the only time in their history following the end of the First World War , their totals of 104 goals and 60 points both breaking the previous league records . The team finished as Division One runners @-@ up in 1924 – 25 , narrowly losing out to Huddersfield Town , but were relegated in 1926 – 27 . In 1930 – 31 they won promotion as well as the FA Cup , beating Birmingham 2 – 1 in the final . The " Double " of winning the FA Cup and promotion has not been achieved before or since . Albion reached the final again in 1935 , losing to Sheffield Wednesday , but were relegated three years later . They gained promotion in 1948 – 49 , and there followed the club 's longest unbroken spell in the top flight of English football , a total of 24 years . 
 In 1953 – 54 Albion came close to being the first team in the 20th century to win the League and Cup double . They succeeded in winning the FA Cup , beating Preston North End 3 – 2 , but injuries and a loss of form towards the end of the season meant that they finished as runners @-@ up to fierce rivals Wolves in the league . Nonetheless , Albion became known for their brand of fluent , attacking football , with the 1953 – 54 side being hailed as the " Team of the Century " . One national newspaper went so far as to suggest that the team be chosen en masse to represent England at the 1954 World Cup finals . They remained one of the top English sides for the remainder of the decade , reaching the semi @-@ final of the 1957 FA Cup and achieving three consecutive top five finishes in Division One between 1957 – 58 and 1959 – 60 . 
 = = = Ups and Downs ( 1960 – 1992 ) = = = 
 Although their league form was less impressive during the 1960s , the second half of the decade saw West Bromwich Albion establish a reputation as a successful cup side . In 1966 , under manager Jimmy Hagan , they beat West Ham in their first League Cup appearance , winning 5 – 3 on aggregate in the last two @-@ legged final . The following year they reached the final again , the first at Wembley , but lost 3 – 2 to Third Division Queens Park Rangers after being 2 – 0 up at half @-@ time . Albion 's cup form continued under Hagan 's successor Alan Ashman . He guided the club to their last major trophy to date , the 1968 FA Cup , when they beat Everton in extra time thanks to a single goal from Jeff Astle . Albion reached the FA Cup semi @-@ final and European Cup Winners Cup quarter @-@ final in 1969 , and were defeated 2 – 1 by Manchester City in the 1970 League Cup Final . 
 The club were less successful during the reign of Don Howe , and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 1972 – 1973 , but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player @-@ manager Johnny Giles . Under Ron Atkinson , Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi @-@ final but lost to Ipswich Town . They were then the first Western football team to tour China , playing several exhibition games over 3 weeks . In 1978 – 79 , the team finished third in Division One , their highest placing for over 20 years , and also reached the UEFA Cup quarter @-@ final , where they were defeated by Red Star Belgrade . In his second spell as manager , Ronnie Allen guided the team to both domestic cup semi @-@ finals in 1981 – 82 . The mid @-@ 1980s saw the start of Albion 's longest and deepest decline . They were relegated in 1985 – 86 with the worst record in the club 's history , beginning a period of sixteen years outside the top flight . Five years later the club were relegated to the Third Division for the first and only time . 
 = = = Recent Years ( 1992 – present ) = = = 
 Albion had spent the majority of their history in the top @-@ flight of English football , but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier , which had been renamed Division Two . In 1992 – 93 Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time , having just missed out the previous year . Albion 's first appearance at Wembley for over twenty years — and their last ever at the original stadium — saw them beat Port Vale 3 – 0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division . Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur however , and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge . 
 The appointment of Gary Megson in March 2000 heralded an upturn in the club 's fortunes . Megson guided Albion to Division One safety in 1999 – 2000 , and to the play @-@ offs a year later . He went on to lead the club to promotion to the Premier League in 2001 – 02 . After being relegated in their first Premier League season , they made an immediate return to the top flight in 2003 – 04 . In 2004 – 05 Megson 's successor , former Albion midfielder Bryan Robson , led the team to a last @-@ day " Great Escape " , when Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas . This feat was repeated by Sunderland in the 2013 – 14 season , but West Brom remain the only team to also have been bottom during the final day of the season . Despite this success , they failed to avoid the drop the following season , and Robson was replaced by Tony Mowbray in October 2006 . The club competed in the Championship promotion playoff final at Wembley Stadium on 28 May 2007 , but lost 1 – 0 to Derby County . 
 The following season , in 2007 – 08 , Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again , this time in the semi @-@ finals of the FA Cup , where they lost 1 – 0 to Portsmouth . One month later , Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship , but were relegated at the end of the 2008 – 09 campaign . In June 2009 , Mowbray left the club to manage Celtic and was replaced by Roberto Di Matteo in the role of head coach . Di Matteo led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt , but was dismissed in February 2011 and replaced by Roy Hodgson . May 2012 saw Roy Hodgson , having led West Brom to a 10th @-@ place finish in his first season , leave to accept an offer to become the manager of the England national football team . Steve Clarke then led Albion to an 8th @-@ place finish in 2012 – 13 , their highest in the Premier League , but was sacked during the following season after four consecutive league defeats and only winning 7 league games throughout the calendar year . Clarke was replaced as head coach by Pepe Mel , who left by mutual consent a few months later at the end of the 2013 / 14 season . He was replaced by Alan Irvine . Irvine then got his first win with West Brom against Tottenham Hotspur F.C. on 21 September 2014 in a 1 – 0 victory . Alan Irvine was sacked on 29 December 2014 following 7 defeats in 9 games and only 4 wins in 19 games . On 1 January 2015 , Pulis was appointed head coach . He won his first game in charge 7 – 0 against Conference Premier side Gateshead in an FA Cup third round match .

 = = = Colours = = = 
 West Bromwich Albion have played in navy blue and white striped shirts for the majority of their existence , usually with white shorts and white socks . The team is occasionally referred to as the Stripes by supporters . A number of different colours were trialled during the club 's formative years however , including cardinal red and blue quarters in 1880 – 81 , yellow and white quarters in 1881 – 82 , chocolate and blue halves in 1881 – 82 and 1882 – 83 , red and white hoops in 1882 – 83 , chocolate and white in 1883 – 84 and cardinal red and blue halves in 1884 – 85 . The blue and white stripes made their first appearance in the 1885 – 86 season , although at that time they were of a lighter shade of blue ; the navy blue stripes did not appear until after the First World War . For the regional leagues played during the Second World War , Albion were forced to switch to all @-@ blue shirts , as rationing meant that striped material was considered a luxury . 
 Like all football clubs , Albion sport a secondary or " change " strip when playing away from home against a team whose colours clash with their own . As long ago as the 1890s , and throughout much of the club 's early history , a change strip of white jerseys with black shorts was worn . The away shirt additionally featured a large ' V ' during the First World War . In the 1935 FA Cup Final however , when both of Albion and Sheffield Wednesday 's kits clashed , a switch was made to plain navy blue shirts . An all @-@ red strip was adopted at the end of the 1950s , but was dropped following defeat in the 1967 League Cup Final , to be replaced by the all @-@ white design that was worn during the club 's FA Cup run of 1967 – 68 . Since then the away strip has changed regularly , with yellow and green stripes the most common of a number of different designs used . In the 1990s and 2000s a third kit has occasionally been introduced . 
 Albion players — along with those of other Football League teams — first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the abandoned season of 1939 – 40 , and names on the back of their shirts from 1999 – 2000 . Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players ' shorts in 1969 . 
 = = = = Kit sponsors = = = = 
 <unk> <unk> became the club 's first shirt sponsor during the 1981 – 82 season . The club 's shirts have been sponsored for the majority of the time since then , although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993 – 94 season , after local solicitors <unk> & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society . Unusually for a Premier League club , Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008 – 09 campaign , as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began . The longest @-@ running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society . Other sponsors have included T @-@ Mobile ( 2004 – 08 ) , <unk> ( 2010 – 11 ) , Bodog ( 2011 – 12 ) , <unk> ( 2012 – 14 ) , Intuit <unk> ( 2014 – 15 ) , <unk> ( 2015 – 16 ) , and UK @-@ <unk> ( 2016 – present ) . 
 Since May 2011 , West Brom 's kit has been manufactured by Adidas , who are contracted until 2016 . Previous manufacturers have included Diadora ( 1997 @-@ 2006 ) and Umbro ( 2006 – 11 ) . 
 = = = Badge = = = 
 Albion 's main club badge dates back to the late 1880s , when the club 's secretary Tom Smith suggested that a throstle ( song thrush ) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge . Since then , the club badge has always featured a throstle , usually on a blue and white striped shield , although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club 's move to the Hawthorns . The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage . It also gave rise to Albion 's early nickname , the Throstles . As late as the 1930s , a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning . In 1979 an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half @-@ time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns , and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s . 
 In 1975 a version of the badge ( on a roundel rather than a shield ) was granted by the College of Arms to the Football League , for licensing to the club . The badge was described in heraldic blazon as On a roundel paly of thirteen argent and azure a <unk> thrush perched on a raspberry branch leaved and <unk> proper . This is the only known occasion on which the branch has been described as a raspberry branch rather than a hawthorn branch : Rodney Dennys , the officer of arms responsible , may have been imperfectly briefed . 
 The badge has been subject to various revisions through the years , meaning that the club was unable to register it as a trademark . As a result of this , the badge was re @-@ designed in 2006 , incorporating the name of the club for the first time . The new badge gave Albion the legal protection they sought . 
 The main club badge should be distinguished from the badge displayed on the first team strip , as the two have rarely coincided . No badge appeared on the kit for most of the club 's history , although the Stafford knot featured on the team jerseys for part of the 1880s . The West Bromwich town arms were worn on the players ' shirts for the 1931 , 1935 and 1954 FA Cup finals . The town 's Latin motto , Labor omnia <unk> , translates as " labour conquers all things " or " work conquers all " . The town arms were revived as the shirt badge from 1994 until 2000 , with the throstle moved to the collar of the shirts . 
 Albion 's first regular shirt badge appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue . Although it featured the throstle , it did not include the blue and white striped shield of the club badge . A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s . In the mid @-@ 1970s , a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the club 's shirts , while in the late 1970s through to the mid @-@ 1980s , an embroidered WBA logo was displayed , a common abbreviation of the club 's name in print . Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team 's shirts . 
 = = Stadium = = 
 The speed with which the club became established following its foundation is illustrated by the fact that it outgrew four successive grounds in its first seven years . The first was Cooper 's Hill , where they played from 1878 to 1879 . From 1879 to 1881 they appear to have alternated between Cooper 's Hill and Dartmouth Park . During the 1881 – 82 season they played at Bunn 's Field , also known as the <unk> . This had a capacity of between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 000 , and was Albion 's first enclosed ground , allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time . From 1882 to 1885 , as the popularity of football increased , Albion rented the Four Acres ground from the well @-@ established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club . But they quickly outgrew this new home and soon needed to move again . From 1885 to 1900 Albion played at Stoney Lane ; their tenure of this ground was arguably the most successful period in the club 's history , as they won the FA Cup twice and were runners @-@ up three times . 
 By 1900 , when the lease on Stoney Lane expired , the club needed a bigger ground yet again and so made its last move to date . All of Albion 's previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich , but on this occasion they took up a site on the town 's border with Handsworth and Smethwick . The new ground was named the Hawthorns , after the hawthorn bushes that covered the area and were cleared to make way for it . Albion drew 1 – 1 with Derby County in the first match at the stadium , on 3 September 1900 . The record attendance at the Hawthorns was on 6 March 1937 , when 64 @,@ 815 spectators saw Albion beat Arsenal 3 – 1 in the FA Cup quarter @-@ final . The Hawthorns became an all @-@ seater stadium in the 1990s , in order to comply with the recommendations of the Taylor Report . Its capacity today is 26 @,@ 850 , the four stands being known respectively as the Birmingham Road End , Smethwick End , East Stand and West Stand . At an altitude of 551 feet ( 168 m ) above sea level , the Hawthorns is the highest of all the 92 Premier League and Football League grounds . 
 The Hawthorns is certificated under the highest UEFA pitch surfaces which means it is ready to host almost any competition if required however attendance may scupper this . Its West Stand could be developed over the Halford 's Lane road at the back of the stand to allow an upper tier , approximately adding around 5 @,@ 000 to the capacity of The Hawthorns . Other developments can include the filling in of The Millenium and East @-@ Rainbow corners if and when required . 
 West Bromwich Albion as a football club own many retail outlets around The Hawthorns stadium including its Megastore , its club store in Merry Hill and seasonally a club store for the first time in 2014 , in West Bromwich Town Centre . They also own the former Hawthorns Pub a Grade II listed building behind the West Stand on the corner of Halford 's Lane and the Birmingham Road . This is opening against the home fixture vs Southampton in September 2015 . It will be the official club fanzone with licensed bars , live music , fan favourites such as mascots and children activities as well as being shared with a high street food outlet . This is to compete with the famous The Vine pub in Roebuck Lane which a popular destination for all visiting and home football fans year @-@ in @-@ year @-@ out .

 The West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club has branches throughout the United Kingdom , as well as in Ireland , Australia , Malta , Greece ( unofficial ) , Jersey , Northern Ireland , United States ( unofficial ) , India and Thailand . Albion 's " club anthem " is The Lord 's my Shepherd , a setting of Psalm 23 . Supporters of the team celebrate goals by bouncing up and down and chanting " Boing Boing " . This dates back to the 1992 – 93 season , when the team was promoted from the new Second Division . In recent years fans of the team have celebrated the end of each season by adopting a fancy dress theme for the final away match , including dressing as vikings in 2004 in honour of Player of the Season Thomas <unk> . In 2002 – 03 Albion 's fans were voted the best in the Premier League by their peers , while in the BBC 's 2002 " national intelligence test " Test the Nation , they were found to be " more likely to be smarter than any other football supporters , registering an average score of 138 " . 
 Famous Fans include comedian Frank Skinner , former ITV presenter Adrian Chiles , One Direction singer Liam Payne , comedian Lenny Henry , tennis player Goran Ivanisevic , Cat Deeley , and guitarist Eric Clapton . 
 = = = Publications = = = 
 The club has published an official matchday programme for supporters since 1905 . The publication was entitled Albion News for many years , but was renamed Albion from the 2002 – 03 season until the close season of 2013 , when it was renamed back to Albion News . It won Premier League Programme of the Year in 2002 – 03 and Third Division Programme of the Year in 1991 – 92 . In 2007 – 08 it was awarded Championship Programme of the Year by both Programme Monthly and the Football Programme Directory . The programme has a circulation in excess of 8 @,@ 000 copies . The first West Bromwich Albion fanzine , <unk> , was published from 1983 until 1992 , and was followed by several others , most notably <unk> Dick ( 1989 – 2005 ) and Last Train to Rolfe Street ( 1992 – 1995 ) . Since <unk> Dick ceased publication in 2005 , the club now only has one fanzine dedicated to it ; ' Baggie Shorts ' which is produced by the West Bromwich Albion Supporters ' Club London Branch . 
 = = = " Baggies " nickname = = = 
 Although known in their early days as " the Throstles " , the club 's more popular nickname among supporters came to be the Baggies , a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced . The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s , but its exact origins are uncertain . One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa , because of the large baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country . Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the " <unk> " , who carried the club 's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line . Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club 's early years . The official club mascots are named Baggie Bird and Albi ; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest . 
 = = Rivalries = = 
 Historically , Albion 's greatest rivals have always been Aston Villa from nearby Birmingham . The two clubs contested three FA Cup Finals between 1887 and 1895 ( Villa winning two and Albion one ) . More recently however , most Albion fans have begun to see Wolverhampton Wanderers as their main rivals – particularly between 1989 and 2002 when Albion and Villa were never in the same division but Albion were in the same division as Wolves for 11 out of 14 seasons . However , with Albion and Villa being in different divisions for so many years , the rivalry is less heated as Aston Villa supporters consider Birmingham City as their main local rivals and not Albion despite geographical distance between the two clubs . 
 = = = Black Country Derby = = = 
 Albion and Wolves have contested the Black Country derby , it is one of the longest standing <unk> in world football , being played more than 150 times ; their first major clash was an FA Cup tie in 1886 . The rivalry came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 1953 – 54 , and during the 1990s it intensified to new heights among supporters , with both clubs languishing in Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake . Moreover , in 2002 Albion came from being 11 points adrift to overhaul Wolves to gain promotion . The rivalry was further heightened after the sides met in the play @-@ offs in 2007 . A 2004 survey by <unk> confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival . A less @-@ heated rivalry also exists with Birmingham City , with whom Albion contested the 1931 FA Cup final , as well as a semi @-@ final in 1968 . Despite their geographical location Walsall are seen as lesser rivals , having played in a lower division than Albion for most of their history . A number of hooligan firms associate themselves with Albion , including Section 5 , Clubhouse and the Smethwick Mob .

 Ranked by The Daily Telegraph as the most fierce in the region behind the Black Country derby and the Second City derby games between Aston Villa and West Brom are quite fierce . The two first met on 9 December 1882 , in the second round of the Staffordshire Cup : Villa hosted a 3 – 3 draw in front of 13 @,@ 900 fans , while in the replay West Bromwich Albion won by a single goal with an attendance of 10 @,@ 500 . On 3 January 1885 they met for the first time in the third round of the FA Cup : a goalless draw at West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 3 – 0 victory for them away at Aston Villa . The following year , both teams became founder members of The Football League . They met first in a league fixture on 19 January 1889 , Villa winning 2 – 0 at home , and again the next week in a 3 – 3 draw . The two teams met in two further FA Cup finals in the 19th century , a 3 – 0 win for West Bromwich Albion in 1892 and a 1 – 0 win for Aston Villa in 1895 . Birmingham City were relegated from the Premier League in 2011 and Wolverhampton Wanderers a season later , leaving Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion as the only West Midlands teams in England 's top division and without their respective main rivals and with Albion finishing above their nearest rivals for the second season in a row , the historic rivalry is re @-@ surfacing . At the end of the 2015 – 16 season Aston Villa were relegated leaving West Brom the only West Midlands team in the top flight for the 2016 – 17 season .

 = = Ownership and governance = = 
 In the club 's formative years , West Bromwich Albion were run by a seven @-@ man playing committee , and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d ( six pence ) ( 2 ½ p ) . Albion 's first chairman was Henry Jackson , appointed in 1885 , with the club becoming a limited company in June 1891 . Other early chairmen of Albion included Jem Bayliss and Billy Bassett , both of whom had earlier played for the club . Indeed , from 1878 to 1986 there was always an Albion player or ex @-@ player on the club 's committee or board of directors . Bassett became an Albion director in 1905 , following the resignation of the previous board in its entirety . The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank , but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club , aided by local fund @-@ raising activities . Bassett became chairman in 1908 , and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players ' summer wages from his own pocket . He remains Albion 's longest @-@ serving chairman , having held the position until his death in 1937 . The club 's longest @-@ serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys , during the period 1930 – 1965 , including 15 years as chairman . He became FA vice @-@ president in 1969 . 
 Sir Bert Millichip served as Albion chairman from 1974 to 1983 , after which he chose to concentrate on his role as chairman of the Football Association . In 1996 the club became a Public limited company , issuing shares to supporters at £ 500 and £ 3000 each . The shares were quoted on the Alternative Investment Market , but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004 . The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited , the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited . Current chairman Jeremy Peace took up the post in 2002 , after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager Gary Megson forced Thompson to quit the club . 
 In September 2007 , Peace acquired additional shares in West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited , taking his total stake in the company to 50 @.@ 56 % . This triggered a requirement , under the Takeover Code , for him to make a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares in both WBA Holdings Ltd and WBA Ltd . Later that year , Michelle Davies became Albion 's first female director . She , however , has since stepped down from this position . Jeremy Peace announced in June 2008 that he was looking for a major new investor for the club , but no firm proposals were received by 31 July deadline . 
 On 24 July 2015 , Jeremy Peace announced that his sale exclusivity deal was now off after potential buyer was unable to fulfil terms of sale .

 As part of the club 's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2004 , a survey was commissioned via the official West Bromwich Albion website and the Express & Star newspaper to determine the greatest West Bromwich Albion players of all time . A modern @-@ day 16 @-@ man squad was compiled from the results ; all selected players are depicted on a commemorative mural displayed at the Hawthorns . Fourteen of the sixteen players are English @-@ born , with a fifteenth , Cyrille Regis , being a full England international . The list of sixteen is as follows : 
 Other notable honours bestowed upon West Bromwich Albion players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award , which was presented to Cyrille Regis in 1979 . In 1998 , Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends , along with Arthur Rowley , Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles . Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 , to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst . Bobby Robson , a player with Albion , has also been inducted , although this was for his achievements as a manager . In 1919 – 20 , Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One , a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen , Derek Kevan , Jeff Astle and Tony Brown . Brown , who holds the club records for goals and appearances , was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007 .

 The following managers have all led West Bromwich Albion to at least one of the following achievements whilst in charge of the club : winning a major trophy or reaching the final , achieving a top three league finish in the top flight , winning promotion or reaching the quarter @-@ finals of a major European competition . 
 = = Records = = 
 West Bromwich Albion 's record victory was their 12 – 0 league win against Darwen on 4 April 1892 . This is still the widest margin of victory for a game in the top @-@ flight of English football , although the record was equalled by Nottingham Forest when they beat Leicester Fosse by the same scoreline in 1909 . Albion 's biggest FA Cup victory came when they beat Chatham 10 – 1 on 2 March 1889 . The club 's record league defeat was a 3 – 10 loss against Stoke City on 4 February 1937 , while a 0 – 5 defeat to Leeds United on 18 February 1967 represents Albion 's heaviest FA Cup loss . 
 Tony Brown holds a number of Albion 's club records . He has made the most appearances overall for the club ( 720 ) , as well as most appearances in the league ( 574 ) , FA Cup ( 54 ) and in European competition ( 17 ) . Brown is the club 's top scorer in the league ( 218 ) , the FA Cup ( 27 ) and in Europe ( 8 ) . He is also the club 's record scorer overall , with 279 goals . W. G. Richardson scored 328 goals for the club , but this includes 100 during the Second World War , which are not normally counted towards competitive totals . Richardson holds the club record for most league goals in a single season , scoring 39 times in 1935 – 36 . 
 Albion 's most capped international player , taking into account only those caps won whilst at the club , is Chris Brunt . He has appeared 38 times for Northern Ireland as a West Bromwich Albion player , earning 48 caps in total . Jesse Pennington is the club 's most capped England international , with 25 caps . The highest transfer fee paid by the club is £ 12 million to Zenit for José Salomón <unk> on 10 August 2015 . The deal could rise to over £ 15 million with appearance fee and other add ons . The record transfer from Albion to another club is that of Curtis Davies to Aston Villa in July 2008 , for a fee of £ 8 @.@ 5 million .

They finished the season with a record of nine wins and two losses ( 9 – 2 , 7 – 1 in MAC play ) and as MAC co – champions with Central Michigan . 
 The 1990 Rockets squad opened the season with six consecutive victories over Miami ( OH ) , Northern Illinois , Ball State , Ohio , Eastern Michigan and Bowling Green . At the time of the matchup , their meeting against Central Michigan served as a de facto MAC conference championship game . Although Toledo lost 13 – 12 , victories over Kent State and Western Michigan coupled with a Central Michigan loss to Ball State gave the Rockets a share of the MAC championship . Toledo then concluded the season with a loss to Navy and a victory over Arkansas State . 
 In February 1991 , Nick Saban resigned as head coach of the Rockets after only one season to become defensive coordinator of the National Football League 's Cleveland Browns .

 For the TV serial based on the novel , see Tipping the Velvet ( TV serial ) 
 Tipping the Velvet is a historical novel published as Sarah Waters ' debut novel in 1998 . Set in Victorian England during the 1890s , it tells a coming of age story about a young woman named Nan who falls in love with a male impersonator , follows her to London , and finds various ways to support herself as she journeys through the city . The picaresque plot elements have prompted scholars and reviewers to compare it to similar British urban adventure stories written by Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe . 
 The novel has pervasive lesbian themes , concentrating on eroticism and self @-@ discovery . Waters was working on a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would like to read . Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London , she consciously chose an urban setting . As opposed to previous lesbian @-@ themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it , Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings . She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded . The main character 's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender , sexism , and class difference . 
 As Waters ' debut novel , Tipping the Velvet was highly acclaimed and was chosen by The New York Times and The Library Journal as one of the best books of 1998 . Waters followed it with two other novels set in the Victorian era , both of which were also well received . Reviewers have offered the most praise for Tipping the Velvet 's use of humour , adventure , and sexual explicitness . The novel was adapted into a somewhat controversial three @-@ part series of the same name produced and broadcast by the BBC in 2002 and a stage play in 2015 . 
 = = Inspiration and publication = = 
 When Sarah Waters was 19 years old , she joined a student house in Whitstable , Kent , sharing a bed and then falling in love with another young woman . They lived there for two winters in what became a six @-@ year relationship . She recalled , " It was cold , isolated , romantic and so intense — quite special . " In 1995 , Waters was at Queen Mary and Westfield College writing her PhD dissertation on gay and lesbian historical fiction from 1870 onward when she became interested in the Victorian era . While learning about the activism in socialism , women 's suffrage , and utopianism of the period , she was inspired to write a work of fiction of the kind that she would like to read . Specifically , Waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting , diverging from previous lesbian @-@ themed books such as Isabel Miller 's Patience and Sarah , in which two women escape an oppressive home life to live together freely in the woods . She said to herself at the time , " there 's so much more to lesbian history than that " . 
 Waters was drawn to the Victorian era because of the ( mis ) understandings of what social norms existed during the period . As she stated , " I find it a fascinating period because it feels very close to us , and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange : many of the things we think we know about it are stereotypes , or simply wrong . " Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage , Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde , and Chris Hunt , who wrote Street Lavender , an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era . She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender , with a plot similar to My Secret Life by " Walter " . 
 Waters pitched Tipping the Velvet to ten British publishers , but after they all rejected it , she began considering American publishing houses . Although she was picked up quickly by a literary agency , the agent spent almost a year trying to sell the book to a mainstream publisher . By the time Tipping the Velvet was accepted by Virago Press — one of the ten that had previously passed on the project — Waters had already begun work on her second novel . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Nancy " Nan " Astley is a sheltered 18 @-@ year @-@ old living with her working @-@ class family and helping in their oyster restaurant in Whitstable , Kent . She becomes instantly and desperately enamoured with a " <unk> " , or male impersonator , named Kitty Butler , who performs for a season at the local theatre . They begin a friendship that grows when , after Kitty finds an opportunity to perform in London for better exposure , she asks Nan to join her . Nan enthusiastically agrees and leaves her family to act as Kitty 's dresser while she performs . Although Kitty and Nan acknowledge their relationship to be sisterly , Nan continues to love Kitty until a jealous fight forces Kitty to admit she feels the same , although she insists that they keep their relationship secret . Simultaneously , Kitty 's manager Walter decides that Kitty needs a performing partner to reach true success , and suggests Nan for the role . Nan is initially horrified by the idea , but takes to it . The duo become quite famous until Nan realises she is homesick after being gone from her family for more than a year . Her return home is underwhelming , so she returns to London early to find Kitty in bed with Walter . They announce that the act is finished and they are to be married . 
 Astonished and deeply bruised by the discovery , Nan wanders the streets of London , finally holing herself in a filthy boarding house for weeks in a state of madness until her funds run out . After spying the male costumes she took as her only memory of her time with Kitty , Nan begins to walk the streets of London as a man and easily passes . She is solicited by a man for sex and begins renting , but dressed only as a man for male clients , never letting them know she is a woman . She meets a socialist activist named Florence who lives near the boarding house , but before she can get to know her , Nan is hired by a wealthy widow with licentious tastes named Diana . Although realising — and initially enjoying — that she is an object to Diana and her friends , Nan stays with her for over a year as " Neville " , dressed in the finest men 's clothes Diana can afford . The relationship erodes , however , and Diana throws Nan into the streets . 
 Nan stumbles through London trying to find Florence , which she eventually does ; Florence is now melancholy , however , with a child . Nan stays with Florence and her brother Ralph , working as their housekeeper . Nan and Florence grow closer during the year they live together , and Nan learns that the previous boarder with Florence and Ralph had a child and died shortly after giving birth . Florence was deeply in love with the boarder but her affections were not returned . During an outing to a women 's pub , Nan is recognised by former fans , to Florence 's astonishment , and Nan divulges her own spotty past to Florence . <unk> , they begin a love affair . Putting her theatrical skills to use , Nan assists Ralph in preparing a speech at an upcoming socialist rally . At the event Nan jumps onstage to help Ralph when he falters , and is noticed once more by Kitty , who asks her to come back so they can continue their affair in secret . Realising how much shame Kitty continues to feel , how much of herself was compromised during their affair , and that her truest happiness is where she is now , Nan turns Kitty away and joins Florence . 
 = = Literary elements = = 
 = = = Style = = = 
 The greatest literary strengths in Tipping the Velvet , according to reviewers and literary scholars , are the vibrant portrayal of the districts and streets of London , and Waters ' ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters . Her use of synaesthesia in lush descriptions particularly interested Harriet Malinowitz in The Women 's Review of Books . For example , Malinowitz cites the scene when Nan first meets Kitty , removing her glove to shake Kitty 's hand . Very much an oyster girl , Nan 's hands are covered with " those rank sea @-@ scents , of liquor and oyster @-@ flesh , crab @-@ meat and whelks , which had flavoured my fingers and those of my family for so many years we had ceased , entirely , to notice them . " Nan is mortified that she smells like a herring , but Kitty assuages her fears , kissing her hand and telling her she instead smells like a mermaid . Malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights , sounds , and smells in Victorian London as examples of elements that are " breathlessly and wittily detailed " . 
 Although Waters was born in Pembrokeshire , Wales , she considers herself a London writer because of her intense affection for the city , due in part to her immigration to it . Specifically , Waters is moved by walking through London and seeing remnants of many historical eras : " It 's ... almost like it 's peopled with ghosts — again , jostling up against each other or passing through each other . I find that very exciting . " Her love for the city is apparent to many reviewers . In the Lesbian Review of Books Donna Allegra writes , " [ S ] he summons the era 's attitudes and ambiance projecting them onto the screen of the reader 's mind with Dolby wrap @-@ around sound such that you feel you 're vacationing on all points between Chelsea and the East End . " 
 Miranda Seymour in The New York Times remarks on the " breathless passion " of the narrator 's voice as being absolutely convincing , citing as an example Nancy 's statement to her sister at the start of the book about why she continues to visit Kitty Butler : 
 ... It 's like I never saw anything at all before . It 's like I am filling up , like a wine @-@ glass when it 's filled with wine . I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing — they 're like dust . Then she walks on the stage and — she is so pretty ; and her suit is so nice ; and her voice is so sweet ... She makes me want to smile and weep , at once ... I never saw a girl like her before . I never knew that there were girls like her . 
 Donna Allegra and Christina Patterson in The Observer also praise Nan as a passionate and captivating character . Patterson and Mel Steel in The Independent compare her resourcefulness to that of Moll Flanders . Of her three Victorian @-@ set novels , Waters uses humour and " an attractive lightness of touch " most effectively in Tipping the Velvet , according to Paulina Palmer . Nan the narrator describes the irony of her " curious <unk> career " as a rent @-@ boy only to end up — in Diana 's words — as her " tart " . Waters had such fun writing the novel that she told Robert McCrum from The Observer in 2009 that if she had no obligations to meet stemming from her subsequent success as a writer that she would continue writing Nan 's story . 
 = = = Genre = = = 
 Nan 's path through the plot indicates that Tipping the Velvet is part Bildungsroman , and her journeys through the streets of London invoke elements of a picaresque novel . Scholar Emily Jeremiah characterises the story as a Bildungsroman : a coming @-@ of @-@ age adventure but one that far surpasses a simple coming @-@ out story . Stefania Ciocia in Literary London writes that the plot has classical elements of a fairy tale as it follows the main character 's growth and progression , and has a moral ending that includes a course of events where Nan forsakes three suitors for her — in this case — Princess Charming . Nan finds true love with Florence , who is a bit dowdy , somewhat stout , certainly not wealthy , and driven to improve the world ; the least likely of all the characters . A review in Publishers Weekly states that the series of events leading to Nan finding love are " unpredictable and moving " . 
 Nan 's experiences eventually reveal serious faults of the society she moves through , the primary element of a picaresque novel . For this and other reasons , Waters ' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens ; the reader follows Nan 's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent @-@ boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator , showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals . Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan 's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting , remaining malleable until the end of the novel indicates she is her own worst enemy . Likewise , Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic . 
 Ciocia writes that with half the novel taking place in theatrical settings , Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London . She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage , and later with Kitty , watching how men move and behave to improve their act . She becomes a performer , with Kitty , as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends . Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech . At this point , she is able to reconcile her identity and the story ends . Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot , and was impressed with Iris Murdoch 's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them , a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Sexuality = = = 
 Sexuality and sexual identity is the most prevalent theme in the novel . The title is an obscure Victorian pornographic slang reference to cunnilingus . Nick Rennison in Contemporary British Authors characterises Tipping the Velvet as an " unabashed and unapologetic celebration of lesbian eroticism and sexual diversity " . Donna Allegra writes with appreciation of how the existence of Waters ' characters in a heterosexual existence forces an analysis of closeted positions . The sexism of the period puts a stranglehold on women , forcing readers to compare women in the Victorian era with present @-@ day sexual attitudes . Nan never has difficulty accepting her love for Kitty Butler and other women ; Kitty 's union with Walter , however , " reeks of <unk> " , according to Allegra . Music halls could be rough in some areas , but Kitty is shown handling drunken and rowdy audiences with humour and grace . The only instance where she is overcome and flees the stage is when a drunken patron shouts a euphemism for a lesbian at her . This episode leads to the final scene of Part I when Nan stumbles upon Kitty and Walter in bed . Kitty does not display any pleasure in their union , but rather <unk> tinged with shame . Allegra compares Kitty 's desire for normality overshadowing her desire for love with Nan to " compulsory heterosexuality ... emblematic of and particular to lesbian existence " . 
 Scholar Paulina Palmer asserts that Waters , in Tipping the Velvet and her two following novels also set in the Victorian era — Affinity and <unk> — is establishing a literary tradition that has not existed : " Women engaging in same @-@ sex relationships in the Victorian era were on the whole invisible and we have little knowledge of their literary interests . " Waters , however , acknowledges that accuracy about lesbian life in the Victorian era is not her primary goal : " My purpose was not to be authentic , but to imagine a history that we can ’ t really recover . " Short bursts of lesbian @-@ themed literary activity occurred in 1920s with authors such as Natalie Clifford Barney and Djuna Barnes . Another surge of activity published as lesbian pulp fiction occurred in the 1950s and early 1960s , during which several notable lesbian authors such as Ann Bannon and Valerie Taylor helped to establish lesbian literary identity . These fictions helped to inform readers about the lives and cultural landmarks of lesbians when very little information existed . Waters states that she is not on a deliberate crusade to write about lesbians , but that it is a reflection of what she knows : " Lesbianism is at the top of the agenda for my books because it 's at the top of the agenda for my life . It would be bizarre not to write about it . " In 2009 , as she reflected on her reasons for writing Tipping the Velvet and <unk> , Waters said she was searching for her own identity as a lesbian writer . 
 Among Waters ' Victorian @-@ set novels , depictions of sexual encounters are also , according to Palmer , the most vivid in Tipping the Velvet . A review in The Advocate calls the book " riotously sexy " , and The Seattle Times suggests the scene where Nan shows Kitty how to open and eat an oyster is evocative of Tom Jones . This follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians . Frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour , or employed it as an erotic element controlled by , and for the benefit of , men . Lesbian literary scholar Bonnie Zimmerman writes , " Lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject the patriarchal stereotype of the lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed . It is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in the closet or under the covers . We don ’ t wish to give the world another stick with which to beat us . " 
 = = = Gender = = = 
 Nan not only experiences a series of misadventures and lesbian relationships , but also shifts from female to male at the same time , giving the reader an opportunity to view London society from multiple perspectives . Gender masquerade and reaction to it permeates the novel . According to Harriet Malinowitz , Waters uses the symbolism of clothing such as skirts , pants , stays , braces , bonnets , ties , and chemises " with the sort of metaphorical significance that Melville gives to whales " . Stefania Ciocia declares that in all of 19th century English literature , the only type of character who was able to enjoy adventures native to the picaresque novel were males who acted as the observer or stroller , walking through the city from one district to the next . The single exception to this was Moll Flanders , a prostitute . Nancy Astley behaves as both , giving her the ability to offer her perceptions of London society as both a man and a woman . 
 Music halls , where both Nan and Kitty are employed — and put on display — as male impersonators , allow about half the novel 's action and commentary on gender to take place , according to scholar Cheryl Wilson . When Nan puts on trousers for the first time to perform as Kitty 's partner and realises the impact of their double act together , she states , " whatever successes I might achieve as a girl , they would be nothing compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad , however <unk> , as a boy " . Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel , and some performers are quite popular . Only certain types of depictions of men , however , were acceptable in reality . Nan and Kitty pretend to be London " swells " : gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts . Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions , as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class , and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh at themselves . <unk> such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity . 
 Writing in 1998 about a period more than 100 years before , Waters employs a continuity between the past and present , particularly as it relates to an outsider 's view of sexuality and gender . Diana bestows Nan with the finest gift she had ever received , an expensive watch that requires no winding . She has nowhere to be except at Diana 's beck and call , and never leaves Diana 's mansion without her . Emily Jeremiah uses this as an example of how Tipping the Velvet fits Judith Halberstam 's declaration that homosexual historiographies " produce alternative temporalities " . Gay and lesbian stories do not use the same rites of passage that most mainstream stories do , leaving aside the importance of birth , marriage , reproduction , and death . This transcendence of time is evident in the narration of the novel . It is Nan 's first @-@ person account of her own past , told many years later . When Nan divulges her past to Florence , Waters uses the first line of the novel to signify where she begins , cycling the story . 
 Even the novel 's language bridges this divide . Waters often employs the word " queer " to describe the unusual or remarkable , instead of its post @-@ 1922 connotation to refer to homosexuality . She also uses the term specifically to highlight what is unusual as it applies to gender , or Nan 's own emotions toward Kitty . Nan 's father uses the symbol of the oyster , what he calls a " real queer fish " that exhibits both male and female characteristics , and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they have seen her on stage dressed as a man . The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying <unk> Nan 's first male costume , and is troubled by the " queerness " of it because she looks too much like a man , instead of a woman pretending to be a man . Donna Allegra suggests that by using the contemporary term for prostitutes , " gay girls " , Waters is winking at her readers . 
 = = = Class = = = 
 Starting as a working @-@ class girl and experiencing music halls , prostitution , luxury , and a socialist struggle for utopia , Nan 's journeys through the class system in Tipping the Velvet are as varied as her gender portrayals and love affairs . <unk> Sweeney in The Washington Post notes , " like Dickens , [ Waters ] digs around in the poorhouses , prisons and asylums to come up with characters who not only court and curtsy but dramatise the unfairness of poverty and gender disparity in their time " . 
 Paulina Palmer sees the reading material available in the various locations of Nan 's settings as symbols of the vast class differences in Victorian London . Specifically , Diana keeps a trunk full of pornographic literature which she and Nan read to each other in between sexual encounters . She is an extremely wealthy resident of the London neighbourhood St John 's Wood , and identifies as a <unk> — a contemporary term for a lesbian . Nan uses the euphemism " tom " throughout the novel , particularly to refer to herself and other working class lesbians . Although " tom " was used as a Victorian reference to lesbianism , Waters admits it was probably not as prevalent as her characters suggest it was . 
 Waters includes a historical reference to the medical profession starting to acknowledge and identify female homosexuality in the 19th century when a friend of Diana 's named Dickie reads aloud during a party from a medical text describing the histories of several acknowledged lesbians , including Dickie 's own . One story discussed among the wealthy women at the party is about a young woman with a large clitoris , which they consider congenital in lower @-@ class women . They attempt to prove their point with Diana 's maid Zena , but Nan prevents this humiliation , which precipitates her final rift with Diana . Using Dickie 's book to strike Nan across the face , Diana gives her a black eye and bloody cheek before throwing her out into the street with Zena . Nan goes to Florence 's house , which is filled with socialist literature . Although Diana is a supporter of women 's suffrage , she discourages Nan from reading such literature , confiscating any political material Nan picks up . In contrast , Nan feels hopelessly uninformed when Florence and her friends engage in heated political debates . She asks questions , but feels stupid about not knowing the answers . Florence introduces her to the writings of Walt Whitman , Eleanor Marx , and Edward Carpenter , which they <unk> by using as an introduction to intimacy . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Tipping the Velvet was critically acclaimed upon its release and Waters ' writing style highly praised . Harriet Malinowitz wrote that the story is an " utterly captivating , high octane narrative " and Mel Steel of The Independent wrote , " Could this be a new genre ? The bawdy lesbian picaresque novel ? Whatever it is , take it with you . It 's gorgeous . " Kirkus Reviews also praised it , writing " Waters ' debut offers terrific entertainment : swiftly paced , crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters " , comparing the depiction of Nancy 's parents to the fishing community in David Copperfield , and adding that it " <unk> [ es ] with highly charged ( and explicitly presented ) erotic heat " . John Perry in The San Francisco Chronicle stated that it " has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair . Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe , it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader marveling at the author 's craftsmanship , idiosyncrasy and sheer effort . " Perry did acknowledge , however , that modern optimism was probably the impetus driving Waters ' vision of a lesbian past . 
 Christina Patterson called Waters " an extremely confident writer , combining precise , sensuous descriptions with irony and wit in a skilled , multi @-@ layered pastiche of the lesbian historical romance . " Renee Graham 's review in The Boston Globe characterised the novel 's style as " plush and inviting — delicious , even " . In The New York Times , Miranda Seymour drew attention to the scene when Nan dresses up as Hadrian 's lover , the page Antinous who was drowned in the Nile , for a masquerade benefiting Diana 's friends in a hedonistic <unk> that ends violently with Nan cast out of the house into the cold , highlighting it as a passage of " startling power " . Although Seymour was disappointed with the ending , she wrote , " If lesbian fiction is to reach a wider readership — as much , though far from all , of it deserves to do — Waters is just the person to carry the banner . " 
 Several reviewers compared Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson 's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for a similar story of a woman 's sexual awakening . Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing , but states that the books are quite different and her writing is not like Winterson 's at all . Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson was the only other lesbian author they could recall . 
 The popularity of her first novel cast a standard for Affinity to follow , which Waters consciously made darker , set in a women 's prison with a character who connects with spirits of the dead . Waters found it daunting to follow the success of Tipping the Velvet and reviewers marked the differences in the main characters : where Nan <unk> seeks out and states her desires , Margaret in Affinity is compelled by desire , but internally struggles with it . 
 Tipping the Velvet won the Lambda Literary Award for lesbian fiction in 2000 , and the Betty Trask Award , given to Commonwealth citizens who have produced their first novel before reaching the age of 35 . The Library Journal chose it as one of their Best Books of the Year for 1999 , and the New York Times included it on its list of Notable Books of the Year .

 Tipping the Velvet was adapted into a BBC television drama serial of the same name , originally screened in three episodes on BBC Two in 2002 . It was produced for the BBC by the independent production company Sally Head Productions , and starred Rachael Stirling as Nan , Keeley Hawes as Kitty , Anna Chancellor as Diana , and Jodhi May as Florence . The BBC had previously adapted Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990 and some other scenes in dramas to follow , but none had been so explicit . Sally Head Productions defended the decision to air the entire program uncut . Waters was quite surprised that the BBC chose to produce and broadcast a television adaptation that faithfully followed the relish and detail of sexual escapades in the book . Stirling thoroughly enjoyed the role , despite her avowed heterosexuality : " To counteract any hard @-@ core sex within it , there 's a huge sense of humour and a huge sense of fun and frivolity and joy of life . It was so utterly believable that you never for a moment thought , Fuck , there 's no reason why I 'm standing here naked . " 
 Screenwriter Andrew Davies said he was attracted to the story because it featured a girl transitioning into womanhood and it included his interests in Victorian erotica ; he compared it to Pride and Prejudice — for which he wrote the BBC screenplay — " with dirty bits " . Both Waters and Davies were concerned about the use of dildos in scenes with Diana , but the BBC allowed it . When news releases told of the BBC featuring swearing and sex toys , the Daily Mail reported that viewers began to protest . BBC representatives downplayed the gratuitousness of the story , comparing it to Moll Flanders . 
 Waters especially appreciated the way Davies interpreted Kitty 's ambivalence about being in love with Nan . He wrote the line for her , " I hate the way you make me feel " , which according to Waters crystallises Kitty 's complicated emotions well . The music in the adaptation was written for the film . Waters wrote song titles but not lyrics in the music references in the novel . For one song , during Kitty and Nan 's first performance in the adaptation , Davies wrote a composition that had Kitty show Nan — dressed and performing as brothers — how to pick up girls in the park . It involved Kitty teaching Nan how to kiss , which they do onstage in front of audiences who are watching women , dressed as men , who are in reality having an affair with each other beyond the view of the audience . Waters wrote a similar description as Nan compares their act to their relationship ; their sexual encounters to their performance onstage , noting the irony that Kitty insisted on absolute secrecy yet there they performed in front of thousands : " You are too slow — you go too fast — not there , but here — that 's good — that 's better ! It was as if we walked before the crimson curtain , lay down upon the boards and kissed and <unk> — and were clapped , and cheered , and paid for it ! " 
 A persistent rumour claims a film adaptation of Tipping the Velvet will be directed by Sofia Coppola , starring Beyoncé Knowles and Eva Longoria . However , Longoria insists that everything about the rumour is false , right down to quotes cited to her and Knowles . Knowles also wonders where the false quotes and story originate from . 
 In 2009 , UK playwright Amanda Whittington wrote a stage adaptation of Tipping the Velvet . It was showcased by Guildhall School of Music and Drama at The Bridewell Theatre , London , in October 2009 . Directed by Katharine Rogers , the production featured original music hall songs and was praised for its authentic interpretation of the novel .

 = Banksia verticillata = 
 Banksia verticillata , commonly known as granite banksia or Albany banksia , is a species of shrub or ( rarely ) tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae . It is native to the southwest of Western Australia and can reach up to 3 m ( 10 ft ) in height . It can grow taller to 5 m ( 16 ft ) in sheltered areas , and much smaller in more exposed areas . This species has elliptic green leaves and large , bright golden yellow inflorescences or flower spikes , appearing in summer and autumn . The New Holland honeyeater ( Phylidonyris novaehollandiae ) is the most prominent pollinator , although several other species of honeyeater , as well as bees , visit the flower spikes . 
 A declared vulnerable species , it occurs in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia , with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole , and is threatened by dieback ( Phytophthora cinnamomi ) and aerial canker ( Zythiostroma ) . B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards . Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate . 
 = = Description = = 
 Banksia verticillata grows as a spreading , bushy shrub with many branches up to 3 m ( 10 ft ) high , but can reach 5 m ( 16 ft ) high in sheltered locations . It may be much lower or even adopt a prostrate habit in highly exposed areas which are blasted by high wind , or occasionally grow as a single @-@ trunked tree . The rough grey bark has fissures , the stems and branches are finely hairy when young and become smooth with age . The leathery bright green leaves are arranged whorled , or alternately on branches , and are borne on 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 1 mm long petioles . They measure 3 – 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 8 in ) in length , and 0 @.@ 7 – 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 5 in ) in width , and are elliptic in shape with entire ( straight ) recurved margins . They are initially hairy and become smooth with maturity , although their undersides remain covered with white hair . The golden @-@ yellow inflorescences appear in summer and autumn ( January to April ) and are 8 – 20 cm ( 3 – 8 in ) high and 6 @.@ 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) wide . The smooth pistils are 3 – 3 @.@ 5 cm long and hooked at the end . Individual flowers open from the base of the flower spike , the wave of anthesis moving up the inflorescence . Occasionally , flowers on exposed parts may open early . It takes around 9 @.@ 5 days for all flowers to open , and rates are similar during the day and night . The inflorescences age to grey and the individual old flowers linger for some time before falling . Up to 100 small woody follicles may follow on old flower spikes . Measuring 1 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 5 cm wide , 3 – 4 mm wide , and jutting out 2 – 3 mm from the spike , they open after several years , releasing the seed . Follicles more commonly appear in the middle third of the spike . The reasons for this are unknown , although timing of visits by pollinators or some anatomical factor may be relevant .

 = = = Discovery and naming = = = 
 The earliest known botanical collection of B. verticillata was made by Scottish surgeon and naturalist Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791 . As a result of this collection the species was introduced into cultivation in England , yet it did not result in formal publication of the species . 
 The next known collection was in December 1801 , during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound . Little is known of the circumstances of this collection , other than what is written on the specimen label : " King Georges Sound Dec [ <unk> ] r 1801 " . The specimen is credited to Robert Brown , but gardener Peter Good and the botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer also contributed to Brown 's specimen collection , often without attribution . A more precise date and location cannot be given , as neither Brown nor Good mentions the collection in his diary . Bauer did not publish an illustration of the species and his original field sketches are lost , but William Westall appears to have incorporated it into two of his field sketches , and certainly included it in the foreground of one of the oil paintings that he later worked up for the Admiralty . 
 Brown formally described and named the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu . He did not identify a type specimen , but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species . He also did not explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet , but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin <unk> ( " whorled " ) , in reference to the whorled leaf arrangement . 
 No subspecies or varieties of Banksia verticillata have been identified ; it has no taxonomic synonyms ; and its only nomenclatural synonym is Sirmuellera verticillata ( R.Br. ) Kuntze , which arose from Otto Kuntze 's unsuccessful 1891 attempt to replace Banksia with the new name Sirmuellera . 
 = = = Infrageneric placement = = = 
 In Brown 's arrangement of Banksia , B. verticillata was placed between B. compar ( now B. integrifolia subsp. compar ) and B. coccinea ( scarlet banksia ) in phyletic order . No infrageneric arrangement was provided other than the removal of one distinctive species into a subgenus of its own , because of its unusual domed flower head . As B. verticillata flowers occur in characteristic flower spikes , it was retained in Banksia verae , the " true banksias " . Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher in 1847 , with B. verticillata remaining between the same two species as in Brown 's sequence . A more detailed arrangement was published by Carl Meissner in 1856 . Eubanksia was demoted to sectional rank , and divided it into four series . B. verticillata was placed in series Salicinae because its leaves are more or less linear , and have white undersides . Based as they were on leaf characters , Meissner 's series were highly heterogeneous , and George Bentham discarded them all in his 1870 revision of Banksia . B. verticillata was instead placed in a new section , Oncostylis , because of its hooked styles . This arrangement would stand for over a century . 
 For many years there was confusion between B. verticillata and B. littoralis ( swamp banksia ) . Until 1984 , the latter was circumscribed as encompassing what is now Banksia seminuda ( river banksia ) , which has whorled leaves like B. verticillata . Thus it was easy to perceive B. verticillata as falling within the range of variation of this broadly defined species . The confusion was largely cleared up once B. seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon . 
 Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his landmark 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. ( Proteaceae ) . Endlicher 's Eubanksia became B. subg . Banksia , and was divided into three sections , one of which was Oncostylis . Oncostylis was further divided into four series , with B. verticillata placed in series Spicigerae because its inflorescences are cylindrical . 
 In 1996 , Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus , after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different from George 's arrangement . With respect to B. verticillata , their findings largely accorded with George 's arrangement : section Oncostylis was discarded as polyphyletic , but series Spicigerae was inferred to be monophyletic , and B. verticillata appeared in a succession of clades with the species previously identified as its closest relatives : first B. littoralis , then B. seminuda , then B. brownii , and finally B. occidentalis ( red swamp banksia ) : 
 This clade became the basis of Thiele and Ladiges ' B. subser . Occidentales , which was defined as " characterised by opposite @-@ <unk> seedling leaves and adult leaves in true whorls . " This arrangement stood until 1999 , when George largely reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series . Under George 's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia , B. verticillata 's taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows : 
 Banksia 
 B. subg . Banksia 
 B. sect . Banksia ( 9 series , 50 species , 9 subspecies , 3 varieties ) 
 B. sect . Coccinea ( 1 species ) 
 B. sect . Oncostylis 
 B. ser . Spicigerae ( 7 species , 2 subspecies , 4 varieties ) 
 B. spinulosa ( 4 varieties ) 
 B. ericifolia ( 2 subspecies ) 
 B. verticillata 
 B. seminuda 
 B. littoralis 
 B. occidentalis 
 B. brownii 
 B. ser . Tricuspidae ( 1 species ) 
 B. ser . Dryandroideae ( 1 species ) 
 B. ser . Abietinae ( 13 species , 2 subspecies , 9 varieties ) 
 B. subg . Isostylis ( 3 species ) 
 More recent molecular research by Austin Mast and colleagues provide further support of B. verticillata 's placement among its nearest relatives , but these do not appear to be closely related to the remaining members of B. ser . Spicigerae , but rather occur in a clade that is sister ( next closest relative ) to B. nutans : 
 ( B. seminuda is omitted because it was not sampled in the study , not because it occurs elsewhere in the cladogram . ) 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Banksia verticillata is found in scattered populations in two disjunct segments : one clustered around Walpole , and the other around Albany and eastwards to <unk> Beach . All but one are located within 2 km ( 1 @.@ 5 mi ) of the coast , the exception is less than 10 km ( 6 mi ) inland . Plants grow on exposed coastal granite outcrops , often in cracks within boulders as well as shallow rocky soils . It is the only Banksia which grows exclusively in a granite soil . It grows in association with <unk> marginata , Western Australian peppermint ( Agonis flexuosa ) , <unk> <unk> and species of Hakea in scrub and heath . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The New Holland honeyeater ( Phylidonyris novaehollandiae ) is a major visitor and pollinator of Banksia verticillata . These birds can travel 15 m ( 50 ft ) between inflorescences in a feeding session , and preferentially choose flower spikes with partly opened flowers . Other honeyeater species observed , the white @-@ cheeked honeyeater ( Phylidonyris nigra ) and western spinebill ( Acanthorhynchus superciliosus ) , visit this species to a much lesser extent . The brown honeyeater ( Lichmera indistincta ) has also been recorded as a visitor . Small mammals are not major pollinators , although bush rats ( Rattus fuscipes ) and house mice ( Mus musculus ) have been recorded . Honey bees ( Apis mellifera ) visit flower spikes but are not effective pollinators . 
 B. verticillata is significantly threatened by at least three microorganisms . Several populations have reduced or vanished from dieback ( Phytophthora cinnamomi ) , such as those at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Gull Rock National Park . The honey fungus Armillaria luteobubalina has killed plants in <unk> National Park , and aerial canker ( Zythiostroma ) has decimated populations at <unk> National Park east of Albany . 
 B. verticillata plants are generally killed by fire and regenerate from seed . A field study after a mild fire in <unk> National Park published in 1994 found that plants burnt by fire were ten times as likely to have seedlings come up under their crown as unburnt plants ( with an average of 25 @.@ 2 seedlings per burnt plant ) , and burnt spikes released double the number of seeds as unburnt spikes . Despite this , <unk> recruitment ( seedlings arising between fires ) has also been recorded , and might be more common than in other Banksia species . Observations at several of the populations showed many plants produced their first seed anywhere from 13 to 17 years of age , leading to a recommendation of 20 years between fires to allow seed banks to accumulate . If fire occurs too frequently , plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population . This may cause a population decline or even local extinction . Too long a time between fires also causes population decline , as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed , resulting in seed wastage . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Banksia verticillata has been declared vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 , and Rare under Western Australia 's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 . A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants . Apart from dieback and aerial canker , frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats . Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations , gathering more data on best response to fire , and restricting access to populations . Seed has been collected from many populations , but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii . <unk> is considered an option in the future , as is spraying with phosphite , particularly in the vicinity of Walpole . Used successfully on B. brownii but as yet <unk> with B. verticillata , phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants , and also acts as a direct fungicide . Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection , but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Banksia verticillata is seldom seen in cultivation . The natural growing conditions point to a sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation . It is good for coastal situations and erosion control . Very sensitive to dieback , B. verticillata ( like most other western Australian banksias ) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage . It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia . Seeds do not require any treatment , and take 19 to 49 days to germinate .

 = = Plot = = 
 A mysterious vehicle using a huge magnet steals a highly potent mutagen known as PX @-@ 41 from a secret laboratory in the Arctic Circle . The Anti @-@ Villain League ( AVL ) , headed by Silas Ramsbottom , tries to recruit former supervillain , <unk> Gru , to track down those responsible and recover the mutagen , but Gru refuses , claiming that he is now a legitimate businessman as well as the devoted father of Margo , Edith , and Agnes . Dr. Nefario , Gru 's friend and assistant , tells Gru that he " misses being evil " , and opts to leave him for new employment . Gru reluctantly agrees to investigate the theft of the mutagen , and is partnered with undercover AVL agent Lucy Wilde . The pair begin their search in the Paradise Shopping Mall , disguised as bakery employees . Gru immediately comes to suspect Mexican restaurant owner , Eduardo Pérez , of being the infamous " El Macho " , a legendary supervillain who supposedly died after skysurfing a shark into the center of an active volcano . Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo 's restaurant at night , but find nothing to prove that he is the culprit . Meanwhile , Agnes confides her dream to one day have a mother , and believes that Gru will fall in love with Lucy , but , despite her excitement , Gru tells her that his relationship with Lucy is strictly professional . 
 Although still suspicious of Eduardo , Gru agrees to pursue other suspects , including wig merchant Floyd Eagle @-@ san . However , after witnessing Eduardo 's two @-@ timing son , Antonio , sweep Margo off her feet , and invite everyone , including Margo , to his Cinco de Mayo party , Gru renews his focus on Eduardo . Afterwards , Gru is set up on what transpires to be a horrible dinner date with a vacuous woman named Shannon . During the meal , Shannon notices Gru 's wig and is about to humiliate him when Lucy , visiting the restaurant herself , renders Shannon unconscious with a tranquilizer dart . They take Shannon home and , after spending personal time with Lucy , Gru comes to realize that Agnes was right ; he has fallen in love with Lucy . 
 The next day , the AVL arrest Floyd Eagle @-@ san after an almost @-@ empty jar of the PX @-@ 41 mutagen is found in his shop , and Ramsbottom declares the investigation closed . Lucy is reassigned to Australia , but before leaving she gives Gru her lipstick Taser as a reminder of her . Realizing that he genuinely loves Lucy , Gru is heartbroken , yet still cannot find the courage to ask her out on a date . Instead , he brings the girls to the Cinco de Mayo party and , whilst there , finds undeniable proof that Eduardo is indeed " El Macho " . Gru discovers that El Macho and his partner , none other than Dr. Nefario , have been abducting Gru 's Minions and using the stolen PX @-@ 41 serum to mutate them into insanely savage , purple , hairy ' Evil Minions ' . El Macho announces his plan to launch rockets full of the mutated Minions into major cities in order to achieve world domination . He makes Gru an offer , proposing that they team @-@ up , but Gru leaves without giving an answer . 
 On her flight to Australia , Lucy realizes that she has also fallen in love with Gru . Using a backpack hang @-@ glider , she jumps out of the plane and hang glides down to the party , only to be captured by El Macho after his pet chicken , <unk> , retrieves her AVL ID badge from her purse . Fortunately , Dr. Nefario informs Gru , and to rescue Lucy , Gru visits Macho along with two Minions covered in purple paint , pretending he was captured by them . Fighting alongside his daughters and Nefario , Gru and his team spray all of the mutated Minions with jelly containing a powerful antidote that Dr. Nefario made , whereupon they revert to their friendly yellow state . Macho then takes the mutagen himself , but Gru and Dr. Nefario overcome him using Lucy 's lipstick Taser and a fart gun . 
 Gru sees Lucy strapped to a TNT @-@ loaded shark rocket and starts to untie her , but <unk> launches the rocket , sending the rocket flying towards the same volcano where Macho previously faked his death . Lucy accepts Gru 's invitation for a date , and the pair dive into the ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano . 
 After 147 dates , Gru and Lucy are married and Margo , Edith , and Agnes finally have a mother . The Minions close with a rendition of " I Swear " and " <unk> " as the whole family celebrates .

 In February 2012 , it was reported that Al Pacino had joined the cast to voice the villain , Eduardo . In April 2012 , producers confirmed that Steve Carell , Russell Brand , Miranda Cosgrove , Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher were returning to reprise their roles . Kristen Wiig , who voiced Miss Hattie in the original film , voices Lucy Wilde , an agent of the Anti @-@ Villain League ( AVL ) who recruits Gru to track and take down a tough , Mexican villain named El Macho . Steve Coogan joined the cast as Silas Ramsbottom , the head of the Anti @-@ Villain League . 
 On May 3 , 2013 , just a month before the film 's premiere , producers announced that Al Pacino had left the film over creative differences about how his character should come to life . At the time of his departure , Pacino 's character had already been fully voiced and animated . Chris Renaud , co @-@ director of the film , commented on Pacino 's departure : " So we don 't want an unhappy actor , and we want something that is well @-@ realized on all sides . If you don 't see eye to eye , sometimes it 's easier to ( part company ) and move on from there . " Benjamin Bratt , who had already been considered before Pacino , stepped in to voice Eduardo . Chris Meledandri , producer of the film , admitted that he was not " aware of any of the major animated films of the last 15 years that has brought an actor in at such a late stage " . Due to the finished animation , Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character 's mouth movement . Initially , during his five @-@ day recording , he tried to imitate Pacino 's voice , but found it impossible , saying " no one can out @-@ Al Pacino Al Pacino " . He ended up only using Pacino as an inspiration , and resolved to go with his own interpretation of the character . His work was commended by Variety , saying : " You 'd never guess he wasn 't the filmmakers ' first choice . "

 As with the first film , which did not have a theatrical release in China , the film 's distributor Universal Pictures had troubles releasing the sequel . When it was reported in July 2013 that the film had been denied a theatrical release in China , then the second largest film market in the world , some analysts attributed this to the protection of locally produced animation . There were also rumors that the film 's release was banned in China because the film 's minions too much resembled former Chinese president Jiang Zemin . China 's Film Bureau was " furious " about the negative comments , stating that the film was not submitted for censorship approval . In fact , there was reportedly a " commercial conflict " between Universal and <unk> Films , the film 's local distributor , over which titles are to be imported . <unk> had decided that the film " would not do well in China and decided against using one of the precious quota slots for the film . " In December 2013 , a few weeks after the Universal Pictures ' announcement that it would open a Beijing office , it was reported that Despicable Me 2 would be theatrically released in China on January 10 , 2014 .

" Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film two and a half stars out of four , saying " It 's fun . It 's cheerful . It 's lollipop colorful . Best of all , it features lots of minion mischief , which guarantees plenty of laughs . But what it doesn 't have is an edge . " Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film two and a half stars out of four , saying " It feels at times as if Despicable Me 2 actually is The Minions Movie . Coffin and Renaud and returning screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken <unk> haven 't managed to come up with a dastardly plot to rival the shrinking and stealing of the moon from the previous film . " 
 Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film two and a half stars out of five , saying " It is consistently diverting and so cute you 'll want to pet it .

" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars , saying " With its predecessor having made a whopping $ 540 million globally , it 's no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel . But it 's not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot . Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling . " Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a ' C ' grade , saying " By the end , every child in the audience will want his or her own monster @-@ minion toy .

" Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review , saying " While not quite as charming or unique as the original , Despicable Me 2 comes awfully close , extending co @-@ directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin 's delightfully silly sensibility to a bit larger universe . " Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars , saying " It 's a credit that the writing can be so funny in the moment , that it takes time to realize there 's no cohesive story , zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater . " 
 James Rocchi of MSN Movies gave the film four out of five stars , saying " <unk> and hilarious , smart and silly , action @-@ packed but never violent , Despicable Me 2 is that rare sequel that outshines its beginnings . " Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three out of four stars , saying " For an adult , the predictability could turn you blasé . For kids , revisiting these jokes is a howl . Pinkie promise . " Mary F. Pols of Time gave the film a positive review , saying " As a sequel it stands level with the first film , and may have the edge on it . " Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars , saying " Co @-@ directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin , who do Minion voices expertly , never let up on the laughs . A fart joke in 3 @-@ D may not be three times as wacky , but the high spirits of Despicable Me 2 are irresistible fun . " A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a ' C ' grade , saying " What 's missing — and this was the crucial component of part one — is a little sour to undercut the sweet .

" <unk> <unk> of Film.com gave the film a 6 @.@ 3 out of 10 , saying " Despicable Me 2 is fun , especially near the culmination .

 = Tropical Storm Chris ( 2006 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Chris was the fourth tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season . Forming on July 31 in the Atlantic Ocean east of the Leeward Islands from a tropical wave , Chris moved generally to the west @-@ northwest , skirting the northern fringes of the Caribbean islands . Chris was a relatively short @-@ lived storm , reaching a peak intensity with winds at 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) on August 2 , while positioned north of St. Martin . The storm gradually weakened before finally dissipating on August 5 , near eastern Cuba . Overall impact was minimal , amounting to moderate amounts of rainfall throughout its path . No deaths were reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved westward off the coast of Africa on July 27 . Initially , <unk> convection persisted throughout the wave axis , though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28 . The wind field remained well @-@ defined as it continued westward , and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis . Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection . On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west , indicating a small low pressure area formed . Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest , and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235 miles ( 375 km ) east @-@ southeast of Barbuda . 
 Forecasters initially predicted wind shear from an upper level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days . However , the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear , and the system intensified into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing . The convection gradually consolidated over the system , and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) while passing 50 miles ( 80 km ) north of the northern Leeward Islands . The structure of Chris continued to improve and become more symmetrical , and an upper level eye feature developed early on August 2 . Outflow improved in all quadrants , as well , and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) shortly thereafter while located 120 miles ( 195 km ) east of St. Thomas . Despite initial predictions of Chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west @-@ northwestward , upper level shear dissipated the well @-@ defined inner core of the storm , and Chris started to weaken . 
 Early on August 3 , strong wind shear over Chris detached the deep convection from the low level circulation , while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west into an area of drier air . By mid @-@ day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85 miles ( 135 km ) , while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola . Late on August 3 , deep convection developed over the center of circulation again , though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4 . Due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear , forecasters indicated the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) storm . However , convection remained minimal , and Chris degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure late on August 4 . Late on August 5 , convection increased in the remnants of the storm , and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions . Redevelopment never occurred , and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana , Cuba on August 6 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 When the National Hurricane Center issued its first advisory on Tropical Depression Three , the governments of Antigua and Barbuda , Anguilla , Saint Kitts and Nevis , and the British Virgin Islands issued a Tropical Storm Warning for their respective territories . When the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Chris , Tropical Storm Warnings were also issued for Saba , Sint Eustatius , Saint @-@ Barthélemy , and Saint Martin . Three Royal Caribbean cruise ships re @-@ routed their paths to avoid the storm . Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) representatives coordinated with local emergency management officials in the United States Virgin Islands to determine if preparation necessities would be adequate , such as hospital usage , shelters , and sand bags . 
 On August 1 , officials in Puerto Rico issued a tropical storm warning for the island . The next day , approximately 600 tourists evacuated the islands of Vieques and Culebra . On August 2 , the government of the Bahamas issued a Hurricane Watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands , the Acklins and Crooked Islands , Ragged Island , Inagua , and Mayaguana . In response to the threat , officials urged citizens to stock up on hurricane supplies , while boat owners in <unk> Cay secured their boats in preparation for the storm . 
 In response to the storm 's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico , prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London . Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2 . Anticipation of a threat to supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move . In New Orleans , officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane . The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst @-@ case scenario , intended to avoid a re @-@ occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior . Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers , and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation . Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall . Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm , though did not execute any preparation action . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Despite its initial threat , Chris caused little impact in the Lesser Antilles . Overall damage from Chris was minimal . The storm dropped light rainfall in Puerto Rico , peaking at 3 @.@ 09 inches ( 78 mm ) in Fajardo . The rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks , which temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island . 
 Rainfall reached up to 2 inches ( 50 mm ) across portions of Hispaniola , the Turks and Caicos , the Bahamas , and eastern Cuba , and reached 4 inches ( 100 mm ) in some mountainous areas . In Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic , heavy rainfall caused severe flooding . Las Américas reported 5 @.@ 01 inches ( 127 mm ) of rainfall from Chris . Several people were left temporarily homeless due to flooding entering their households . The flooding left many roads impassable near the capital city , and also resulted in landslides . The flooding also covered rice fields in the northeastern portion of the country . The National Office of Meteorology issued flood warnings for residents in low @-@ lying areas and near rivers in the northeast and southeast portions of the country . Despite the flooding , overall damage was minor , and there are no casualties associated with Chris . 
 = North American AJ Savage = 
 The North American AJ Savage ( later A @-@ 2 Savage ) was a carrier @-@ based medium bomber built for the United States Navy by North American Aviation . The aircraft was designed shortly after World War II to carry atomic bombs and this meant that the bomber was the heaviest aircraft thus far designed to operate from an aircraft carrier . It was powered by two piston engines and a turbojet buried in the rear fuselage . The AJ @-@ 1 first became operational in 1950 and several were based in South Korea during 1953 as a deterrent against the Communists . Of the 140 built , plus three prototypes , 30 were reconnaissance aircraft . Inflight @-@ refueling equipment was deployed on the Savage in the mid @-@ 1950s . The bomber was replaced by the Douglas A3D Skywarrior beginning in 1957 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 At the end of World War II , the U.S. Navy began a design competition on 13 August 1945 for a carrier @-@ based bomber which could carry a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 4 @,@ 536 kg ) bomb that was won by North American Aviation . Later that year , the Navy decided that it needed to be able to deliver atomic bombs and that the AJ Savage design would be modified to accommodate the latest Mark 4 nuclear bomb . A contract for three XAJ @-@ 1 prototypes and a static test airframe was awarded on 24 June 1946 . The first prototype made its maiden flight two years later on 3 July 1948 . That same year the US Navy began an interim capability program employing the Lockheed P @-@ 2 Neptune as its first carrier launched nuclear bomber aircraft until the Savage was in service , the Neptune launched using JATO assist but could not land on existing carriers , if launched they had to either ditch at sea after it 's mission or land at a friendly airbase . 
 The AJ @-@ 1 was a three @-@ seat , high @-@ wing monoplane with tricycle landing gear . To facilitate carrier operations , the outer wing panels and the tailfin could be manually folded . It was fitted with two 2 @,@ 300 @-@ brake @-@ horsepower ( 1 @,@ 700 kW ) Pratt & Whitney R @-@ 2800 @-@ 44W Double Wasp piston engines , mounted in nacelles under each wing with a large turbocharger fitted inside each engine nacelle , and a 4 @,@ 600 @-@ pound @-@ force ( 20 @,@ 000 N ) Allison J33 @-@ A @-@ 10 turbojet was fitted in the rear fuselage . Only intended to be used for takeoff and maximum speed near the target , the jet was fed by an air inlet on top of the fuselage that was normally kept closed to reduce drag . To simplify the fuel system , both types of engines used the same grade of avgas . One 201 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 760 l ; 167 imp gal ) self @-@ sealing fuel tank was housed in the fuselage , and another 508 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 1 @,@ 920 l ; 423 imp gal ) tank was located in each wing . The aircraft usually carried 300 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 1 @,@ 100 l ; 250 imp gal ) tip tanks and it could house three fuel tanks in the bomb bay with a total capacity of 1 @,@ 640 US gallons ( 6 @,@ 200 l ; 1 @,@ 370 imp gal ) . Other than its 12 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 5 @,@ 400 kg ) bombload , the bomber was unarmed . 
 Two of the three prototypes crashed during testing , but their loss did not materially affect the development of the aircraft as the first batch of Savages had been ordered on 6 October 1947 . The most significant difference between the XAJ @-@ 1 and the production aircraft was the revision of the cockpit to accommodate a third crewman in a separate compartment . The first flight by a production aircraft occurred in May 1949 and Fleet Composite Squadron FIVE ( VC @-@ 5 ) became the first squadron to receive a Savage in September . The squadron participated in testing and evaluating the aircraft together with the Naval Air Test Center ( NATC ) in order to expedite the Savage 's introduction into the fleet . The first carrier takeoff and landing made by the bomber took place from the USS Coral Sea on 21 April and 31 August 1950 , respectively . Many , if not most , surviving AJ @-@ 1s had their tails upgraded to the improved AJ @-@ 2 configuration . 
 A photo @-@ reconnaissance version of the Savage , initially known as the AJ @-@ 1P , but later designated as the AJ @-@ 2P , was ordered on 18 August 1950 . It had improved R @-@ 2800 @-@ 48 piston engines and the tail was redesigned to add 1 foot ( 30 cm ) of height to the tailfin . The 12 ° dihedral of the tail stabilizers was eliminated and the rudder enlarged which slightly lengthened the aircraft . Early AJ @-@ <unk> retained the three @-@ man crew , but late @-@ model aircraft added a fourth crewman to the upper cockpit facing aft . The Savage 's internal fuel capacity was also increased . The nose of the aircraft was remodeled with a prominent " chin " to accommodate a forward @-@ looking oblique camera and a variety of oblique and vertical cameras could be fitted in the bomb bay . Photo @-@ flash bombs could be carried for night photography missions . 
 The AJ @-@ 2 incorporated all of the changes made to the late model AJ @-@ 2P and 55 aircraft were ordered on 14 February 1951 . The AJ @-@ 2 deleted the separate compartment for the third crewman , but retained the third seat in the cockpit from the AJ @-@ 2P . 
 Around 1954 , NATC modified the sole surviving XAJ @-@ 1 to conduct inflight refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration . The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended out from the jet 's former exhaust opening . Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue . They were refueling aircraft during late 1954 . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 When first deployed , the AJ @-@ 1 was too large and heavy to be used by any American aircraft carrier except for the Midway class . The modernized Essex class carriers with reinforced decks and the very large Forrestal class could also handle the Savage . The aircraft was not popular aboard ship as " it was so big and cumbersome that it complicated any other flight operations the ship was required to conduct . " One problem was that the wings had to be folded one at a time by a crewman on top of the fuselage with a portable hydraulic pump , a time @-@ consuming process , so that the bomber could be moved out of the way to allow other aircraft to land or take off . One pilot reported that the AJ @-@ 1 was " a dream to fly and handled like a fighter " , when everything was working properly . The aircraft , however , was not very reliable , possibly because it was rushed into production before all the bugs could be worked out . 
 Early in the Savage 's career , squadrons would typically deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey , Morocco , for service with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers that were already deployed to the Mediterranean as needed . The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea . The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb . The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude , keeping the tail of the aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion . 
 VC @-@ 5 made the first of its three deployments to Port Lyautey in February 1951 . Fleet Composite Squadron SIX ( VC @-@ 6 ) received its first Savages in late 1950 and deployed to Port Lyautey in October 1951 before transferring to the Pacific Fleet in October 1952 . In July 1953 it deployed a detachment of two aircraft to K @-@ 3 Air Base in Korea to act as a nuclear deterrent . VC @-@ 7 , VC @-@ 8 , and VC @-@ 9 received their AJ @-@ 1s beginning in June 1951 and all remained on the East Coast of the United States . The Navy redesignated all of its Savage @-@ equipped composite squadrons as heavy attack squadrons ( VAH ) on 1 November 1955 . The squadrons retained their existing numbers except for VC @-@ 8 which became VAH @-@ 11 as all East Coast squadrons were odd @-@ numbered . 
 AJ tankers were used to refuel John Glenn 's Vought <unk> @-@ 1P Crusader during the Project Bullet transcontinental speed record flight in July 1957 ; AJ @-@ 2s from VAH @-@ 6 on the West Coast and AJ @-@ 1s from VAH @-@ 11 on the East Coast . Beginning in 1957 the Douglas A3D Skywarrior began to replace the Savages in the VAH Squadrons . Their refueling role was continued by the formation in January 1958 of VAH @-@ 15 on East Coast and VAH @-@ 16 on the West Coast . Both squadrons were equipped with AJ @-@ 2s , but both were short @-@ lived and disbanded early the following year . 
 The AJ @-@ 2P was flown by Photographic Squadron <unk> ONE ( VJ @-@ 61 ) and Photographic Squadron <unk> TWO ( VJ @-@ 62 ) , both of which were redesignated as Heavy Photographic Squadrons , VAP @-@ 61 and VAP @-@ 62 , respectively , on 2 July 1956 . VJ @-@ 61 was assigned to the Pacific Fleet and VJ @-@ 62 to the Atlantic Fleet . The squadrons never deployed as complete units , but rather deployed as one to three aircraft detachments . Detachment Queen was formed by VJ @-@ 61 during the Korean War at Naval Station <unk> Point , in the Philippines , to fly reconnaissance missions over the People 's Republic of China and North Korea . The detachment continued its missions after the war until at least June 1954 . Both squadrons frequently provided photographic mapping for agencies outside the Navy like the Army Map Service , the Army Corps of Engineers , the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and the U.S. Departments of the Interior and Agriculture . The AJ @-@ 2s in these squadrons were replaced by Douglas A3D @-@ 2P <unk> beginning in 1959 , although the last month that they were reported in squadron service was January 1960 . Surviving AJ @-@ 1 and AJ @-@ 2 aircraft became A @-@ <unk> and A @-@ <unk> , respectively , when the Department of Defense redesignated all U.S. military aircraft in a common series in 1962 . 
 Three AJ @-@ 2s were loaned to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as weightlessness simulators from January 1960 to September 1964 . They were eventually destroyed during firefighting training . Three AJ @-@ 1s were purchased by AJ Air Tankers , Inc. in early 1960 for use as water bombers . Their turbojets were removed before the delivery flight to California , during which one aircraft crashed . The two surviving aircraft were fully modified for the role after delivery and could carry 2 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 7 @,@ 600 l ; 1 @,@ 700 imp gal ) of fire retardant . They first flew missions during the 1961 fire season . Another aircraft crashed on takeoff in September 1967 when an engine failed and the sole survivor only made a few more flights before it was scrapped in 1968 – 69 . 
 At least one other AJ @-@ 2 was purchased and used as a water bomber before it was purchased in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the <unk> turbofan . The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance before it could be flown to Avco Lycoming 's home airfield at Stratford , Connecticut . The <unk> , too fat to fully fit in the bomb bay , was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests . The testing was conducted from January to July 1972 . Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102 , the ALF 502 , was performed between January 1979 and December 1980 . In 1984 , routine maintenance discovered several loose rivets on the spar and further examination showed that the skin was starting to separate from the spar . This damage was too uneconomical to repair so Avco Lycoming decided to donate the last surviving Savage to the National Museum of Naval Aviation . The AJ @-@ 2 was flown to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola , Florida on 9 May 1984 .

 = Lactarius rupestris = 
 Lactarius rupestris is a species of mushroom in the Russulaceae family . Described as a new species in 2010 , it is known only from the semi @-@ arid region in the National Park of Catimbau of Brazil . The mushroom is characterized by a stout fruit body with a smooth and sticky orange cap up to 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter . The gills on the underside of the cap are closely spaced and frequently anastomosed . The stem is 35 – 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 8 in ) long by 18 – 21 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 – 0 @.@ 83 in ) thick . The mushrooms exude a sparse cream @-@ colored latex when cut or injured . 
 = = Discovery and classification = = 
 The species was found in the Brazilian semi @-@ arid region in the National Park of Catimbau , in July 2007 . It was described as new to science in a 2010 Mycotaxon publication by Felipe <unk> of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco . L. rupestris is one of 19 species of Lactarius known from Brazil . The epithet rupestris refers to the <unk> <unk> montane savanna — the ecoregion where the type species was collected . 
 The authors note that the fungus does not readily fit into any of the infrageneric ( i.e. , below the level of genus ) classification schemes outlined by previous authorities . For example , although L. rupestris has several characteristics that make the section <unk> proposed by Annemieke Verbeken a somewhat close match , the taxon cannot be included because the surface of its cap is neither sufficiently areolate ( cracked ) nor dry enough , and its spores are excessively ornamented in comparison . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of L. rupestris is 60 – 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) , concave to somewhat funnel @-@ shaped , with a central depression . Its color is orange at the center to brownish @-@ orange towards the margin . The cap surface is somewhat sticky , and the texture is either smooth to slightly cracked . It has an indistinct layer of matted mycelial " hairs " . The margin lacks striations and grooves , and is curled inward slightly . The gills are slightly decurrent ( running slightly down the length of the stem ) , cream @-@ salmon in color , and crowded closely together . They are up to 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) broad and are frequently branched . The gill edges are smooth , and the same color as the gill face . There are several tiers of lamellulae ( short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem ) interspersed between the gills . The stem is 35 – 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 8 in ) long by 18 – 21 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 – 0 @.@ 83 in ) thick , centrally attached to the stem , cylindrical , and tapers slightly near the base . It is pale ochraceous @-@ salmon , and slight longitudinal ribs can be seen with a magnifying glass . The flesh is spongy , pale yellow @-@ ochre in the cap , and cream @-@ yellow in the stem . The latex is cream @-@ colored to roughly the same color as the gills , and not abundant . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spores are roughly ellipsoid to roughly spherical , and typically measure 7 – 8 @.@ 5 by 6 – 7 µm . The ornamentation on the spore surface is amyloid ( staining blue to blue @-@ black in Melzer 's reagent ) and finely wart @-@ like , with each wart ranging to 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 7 µm high . The warts are interconnected by thin ridges , but the ridges do not form a complete reticulum . The hilar appendage ( the part of a spore once attached to the basidium via the sterigma ) ranges in shape from narrowly obtuse to somewhat conical ; the plage is not very distinct , but has an amyloid spot . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells in the hymenium ) are 35 – 50 by 8 – 11 µm , club @-@ shaped , and bear mainly four , but sometimes two long ( 6 – 10 µm ) sterigmata . 
 <unk> are very scarce on the gill faces ; when present , they are thin @-@ walled , 170 µm long by 24 µm wide , with brownish refractive contents , and arise from deep in the tissue of the hymenophore . The edge of the gill is sterile ( lacking basidia ) , and has marginal cells that are 30 – 45 by 4 – 6 µm , cylindrical to somewhat sinuous ( curvy ) , thin @-@ walled , and hyaline ( translucent ) . The tissue of the cap has abundant sphaerocysts ( spherical , swollen cells common to the Russulaceae ) and measure 25 – 65 by 24 – 50 µm , in addition to filamentous hyphae that are up to 10 µm wide . <unk> ( latex @-@ containing ) hyphae are common in the cap tissue . They are up to 15 µm wide with a longitudinal orientation . Although they diverge from the trama somewhat ( spreading out from the center of the gill ) , they do not form projecting pseudocystidia . The subhymenium ( the layer of cells directly under the hymenium ) is made of club @-@ shaped to nearly spherical cells that are 16 – 27 by 9 – 17 µm . The tissue that comprises the hymenophore is made of several parts . It contains abundant , nearly <unk> ( 17 – 25 by 13 – 18 µm ) cells , and filamentous hyphae that measure 3 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 5 µm ; lactiferous hyphae are frequent , up to 7 – 12 µm wide , straight and only occasionally branching . The cap cuticle is a trichoderm — meaning the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel , like hairs , perpendicular to the cap surface . It is up to 140 µm thick and comprises two layers . The upper layer , the suprapellis , is made of plentiful , colorless hyphae that are 20 – 51 by 4 – 6 µm , thin @-@ walled ( up to 0 @.@ 5 µm ) , and range in shape from obtuse to somewhat acute to knob @-@ like or pear @-@ shaped . The lower layer of the cap cuticle , the subpellis , is made of both plentiful hyphae that are 3 – 8 µm wide and somewhat more inflated colorless cells up to 10 – 18 µm wide . Lactarius rupestris does not have clamp connections in its hyphae . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The mushroom was found buried with up to two @-@ thirds of the stem in sandy soil near several shrubs ( Fabaceae subfamily <unk> and others ) in a semi @-@ arid region , after heavy precipitation . The species is known only from the type locality in Vale do Catimbau National Park in Brazil , in the state of Pernambuco . It fruits at an elevation of 900 to 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . This is part of the biodiverse cerrado ecoregion , in an area known as the <unk> <unk> . Although the fungus is suspected to be mycorrhizal ( like all Lactarius ) , there was a wide diversity of plant species growing in the open , dry forest where the mushroom was found ( including members of the tree families Euphorbiaceae , Fabaceae , Myrtaceae , <unk> , and Polygonaceae — all known to form mycorrhizal associations ) , so the authors did not speculate on any specific interactions . 
 = All Good Things ... ( The Hills ) = 
 " All Good Things ... " is the series finale of The Hills . It originally aired on MTV on July 13 , 2010 . In the episode , Lo Bosworth moves into a house with her boyfriend , while Stephanie Pratt begins a romantic relationship . Audrina Patridge finds a house in Hermosa Beach , and Kristin Cavallari decides to leave Los Angeles and move to Europe . The series ' final scene reveals that her departure to the airport was filmed in a studio backlot , responding to longtime speculation that the program was scripted . 
 " All Good Things ... " was produced by Adam DiVello , Michael Friedman , Liz Gateley , Josh Lansky , Kristofer Lindquist , and Sara Mast . In addition to being the final episode , it serves as the twelfth installment of the sixth season . The episode received mixed reviews from critics , who were ambivalent towards the final scene . According to Nielsen ratings , it was watched by 3 million viewers , becoming the peak viewership of the season . The episode was released on DVD on September 21 , 2010 , packaged with the remainder of the sixth season . 
 Upon the conclusion of their month @-@ long morning marathon of The Hills , titled " RetroMTV Brunch " , MTV aired an alternate ending to the series on August 9 , 2013 . The scene replaced the original backlot clip with footage of Jenner and Lauren Conrad talking in his apartment . Critics appreciated Conrad 's return , but also felt that the revision was less shocking than the original clip . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As Audrina , Lo , Stephanie find themselves content with their lives , Kristin is unsure whether she should pursue her future endeavors . Brody believes that he can maintain a friendship with Kristin , though Frankie and Taylor are concerned that she may still have romantic feelings towards him . That evening , Kristin tells Stacie that she has decided to move to Europe , wanting to have a " new beginning " , though Stacie is concerned that she is seeking revenge against Brody . 
 Meanwhile , Audrina purchases a home in Hermosa Beach , while Stephanie begins a romantic relationship with Josh . To the surprise of the guests , Brody attended Kristin 's farewell party that evening . He confesses that he is saddened by her move , but she maintains that the decision is in her best interest . The next day , after much prior deliberation , Lo moves into her boyfriend Scott 's house and begins unpacking her belongings . 
 Brody visits Kristin and Stacie as they pack the last of her belongings before leaving for the airport . After giving their final goodbyes , Brody sees Kristin 's limousine off while it drives off her street . As Kristin looks out of the window , a montage of archived footage from the series ' earlier seasons is shown . In the final scene of the series , with the camera on Brody , the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away , while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot . In reality , the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner . 
 An alternate ending to the series was broadcast in August 2013 . The scene depicts Brody returning to his apartment after seeing Kristin 's limousine off to Europe . Lauren Conrad is revealed to be sitting on his couch , and comforts him that " it 's hard to say goodbye " to a " friend of [ his ] " , before the camera focuses on a smiling Lauren .

 " All Good Things ... " was produced by Adam DiVello , Michael Friedman , Liz Gateley , Josh Lansky , Kristofer Lindquist , and Sara Mast . The sixth season was first announced in December 2009 , and was confirmed to be the final season in March 2010 . Upon the announcement , speculation arose that original focal point Lauren Conrad would return for the finale . Her former boss Lisa Love suggested that a scene could be filmed of the pair reuniting in Paris , while series creator DiVello wished to see Conrad getting married , presumably to her then @-@ boyfriend Kyle Howard . Cavallari stated that it would be " amazing " to see Conrad return , adding that her appearance would provide the program with " closure " . Ultimately , Conrad did not appear in the final episode , but was featured in the live <unk> , The Hills Live : A Hollywood Ending . 
 DiVello stated that two versions of the final installment were filmed . He provided the MTV with both episodes , and added that he was unaware which version had been selected until it was broadcast . In July 2010 , Jenner stated that he had filmed an alternate ending of the series with Conrad , where " I [ would ] come back home , and basically Lauren 's at my place [ and I tell her about saying goodbye to a friend ] . We filmed this whole lovey @-@ dovey scene as if me and Lauren had been together this entire time " , which she confirmed that September . 
 Upon the conclusion of their month @-@ long morning marathon of The Hills , titled " RetroMTV Brunch " , MTV aired the alternate ending to the series on August 9 , 2013 , which was revealed to be the clip Conrad and Jenner had previously mentioned . DiVello had stated that he preferred the second ending , and upon learning that MTV had not selected it as the original finale , persuaded the network to broadcast the clip .

 " All Good Things ... " was met with generally mixed reviews from critics , many of whom were ambivalent towards the final scene . Despite criticizing the episode 's recurring theme of moving on , Emma Rosenblum from Vulture appreciated the ending as an " interesting twist " . Andy Dehnart of Reality Blurred felt that , from a production standpoint , the final scene was " really well @-@ done " and appeared realistic despite being filmed in a backlot . In contrast , Chadwick Matlin was displeased to see producers " capitalizing " on the controversy surrounding longtime scripting allegations , which he felt exploited its naive teenage fanbase . A writer for Daily News described the episode as " bittersweet " and " emotional " , but felt that the program " overstayed its welcome " . Megan Friedman from Time called the ending " surprisingly smart " , but felt it did not leave an impact on viewers who were already skeptical of the series ' truthfulness . 
 Similarly , critics were ambivalent towards the alternate finale . Jenna Mullins from E ! praised Conrad 's return as being " shocking and glorious at the same time " , and felt that " clearly [ viewers ] should all prefer the ending with Lauren Conrad . " Kaitlin Reilly from Bustle described the suggestion of another love triangle involving Conrad and Cavallari to " [ feel ] vaguely like the ending to a horror movie " in that " it 's starting again " , but nonetheless appreciated the ending as " a wink to loyal fans " . Billy Niles from Zap2It noted that there was " no winking nod to a soundstage " , and opined that " nothing that freaking awesome happened .

 = The Angel , Islington = 
 The Angel , Islington is a historic landmark and a series of buildings that have stood on the corner of Islington High Street and Pentonville Road in Islington , London , England . The land originally belonged to the Clerkenwell Priory and has had various properties built on it since the 16th century . The site was bisected by the New Road , which opened in 1756 , and properties on the site have been rebuilt several times up to the 20th century . The corner site gave its name to Angel tube station , opened in 1901 , and the surrounding Angel area of London . 
 The current structure was completed in 1903 and was known as the Angel Hotel . The building was acquired by J. Lyons and Co. in 1921 and was used as a restaurant . In 1935 it was chosen as a property for the British version of Monopoly . The building was sold to the London County Council in 1959 to be demolished as part of plans for road improvement works that did not take place . It was returned to private ownership , renovated from 1979 and reopened in 1982 as the Angel Corner House . It is currently used as offices and a branch of the Co @-@ operative Bank , and is a grade II listed building . In 1998 a new pub called the Angel , operated by J D Wetherspoon , opened at an adjacent premises .

 In the early 16th century , a building in this area of London on the Great North Road was known as the <unk> . It was named after lands belonging to St John 's Priory . The building was being used as an inn by the end of the 16th century and was known as the Angel by 1614 . The inn took its name from the Angel of the Annunciation which appeared on the sign . 
 The Angel Inn became a useful stop when travelling to the City of London , as the rural area outside it was considered dangerous , with travellers having armed escorts from Wood 's Close to Islington . Despite its name , and common association with Islington , the grounds of the inn and all of the western edge of Islington High Street were in neighbouring Clerkenwell . 
 = = = 17th – 18th century = = = 
 By 1630 , the inn was owned by William <unk> , officer of the Great Wardrobe . <unk> built an extension of the courtyard ranges on the site of the Angel Inn around 1638 , for which he was fined due to breaking building regulations . These ranges survived up to the early 19th century . By 1677 , the Angel was owned by James Compton , 3rd Earl of Northampton and occupied by Edward Fawcett , who ran the inn until his death in 1696 . The premises accommodated livestock traders destined for Smithfield Market as well as long distance travellers . 
 In the early 18th century , the Angel was the largest coaching house in a row of several along Islington High Street . Robert Bartholomew took over ownership of the inn in 1744 and was succeeded by his son , Christopher around 1766 , who continued to run it until the end of the century . The inn was the subject of William Hogarth 's 1747 drawing , The Stage @-@ Coach , Or The Country Inn Yard , which depicted busy coaching inn trade and traffic . In his book The Inns and Taverns of Old London published in 1909 , Henry C. Shelley said " The Angel dates back to before 1665 ... In the seventeenth century and later , as old pictures testify , the inn presented the usual features of a large old country hostelry . " 
 The building of the New Road in 1756 bisected the Angel Inn site and the stable buildings were cut off on the southern side . The inn was on the northern side , on the corner of what is now the junction of Islington High Street and Pentonville Road , while the stables were now on what is St John Street , adjacent to the New Inn , which had been established in 1744 . The Angel benefited from the extra traffic brought by the New Road , and in addition to accommodation provided a number of assembly rooms for public meetings . The author and political activist Thomas Paine is believed to have begun writing Rights of Man at the Angel in 1790 , and there is a monument on Islington High Street commemorating this . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 By the start of the 19th century , fields south of the Angel were being built on , resulting in all land towards the City of London being urban . The Angel was rebuilt during 1819 and 1820 to become a post house and meeting place for various London businesses . The redevelopment was directed by Charles Smith , and subsequently let to James Smith . The size of the inn was reduced and adjacent plots were sold off , allowing development of houses and shops , though the inn 's grounds remained substantial . It was now advertised as the " Angel Inn Tavern and Hotel for Gentlemen and Families " , and the front of the tavern faced the New Road . 
 By the 1850s , the Angel was reported to be in decline . The New Road was renamed Pentonville Road in 1857 , and the inn 's management successfully put shop fronts on the road around 1870 , along with extensive refurbishments . In 1880 , the Angel was refurbished internally for William Henry and Richard Baker , later to become large @-@ scale pub owners . In 1883 the stables were sold to the London Street Tramways and the main building was sold to the brewers Truman , Hanbury , Buxton & Co. in 1896 . 
 Construction of a new building in pale terracotta stone with a corner cupola was started in 1899 by the architects Frederick James <unk> and Sydney Herbert Meyers . The brewers proclaimed the new building to be " the widest @-@ known hostelry in the world " , and work was completed in 1903 . A panel on a second floor balcony still bears this opening date . The parish of Clerkenwell became the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury in 1900 and when the City and South London Railway opened a new tube station in the area in 1901 it was named Angel . 
 = = = 20th – 21st century = = = 
 The pub ceased trading in 1921 and the building was sold to restaurateurs J. Lyons and Co . It was adapted as the flagship site of the business , though it was not technically a standard Lyons Corners House . The restaurant remained popular , and could accommodate up to 300 people , as did Lyons Corner Houses across London throughout the 1920s and 30s , but fell out of favour as fast food began to become popular in the 1950s . 
 In 1959 The Angel was closed and sold to the London County Council as part of a plan to demolish it to make way for a new road scheme at the Angel intersection . It was used temporarily by the City University . Finsbury merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Islington to form the London Borough of Islington in 1965 and ownership of the site passed to the Greater London Council . The proposals for demolition of the site along with road changes were opposed by Homes before Roads and the Islington Society . Plans to alter the intersection and create a layout similar to that at Old Street roundabout were abandoned and the building was saved from demolition . 
 The Greater London Council sold the building to the New River Company , with the property becoming part of the London Merchant Securities portfolio . The building was renovated between 1979 and 1982 by McLaughlin & Harvey Ltd with architects <unk> Pack & Roberts converting the building for office use and renaming it Angel Corner House . The ground floor is now a branch of The Co @-@ operative Bank , and the ORC International market research agency occupies the upper floors . The building is now privately owned by Hamilton Investment Properties . 
 The building , along with this section of Islington High Street has been part of the Angel conservation area since 1981 and The Corner House has been a Grade II listed building since 1991 . The council describe this as " the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance " . Local planning regulations stipulate that new development in the area must not be taller than the dome on the Angel Corner House .

 On 27 October 1998 , a J D Wetherspoon pub named The Angel opened at 3 Islington High Street , adjacent to the former pub building . It stands on the part of the original Angel Inn site that was redeveloped as shops in 1820 . 
 Ten Four Pentonville Road is a redevelopment of Angel Mews . It is located at the site of the original Angel Inn 's stables . The Hilton London Angel Islington Hotel is named after the pub . It is located on Upper Street to the north of the original Angel .

 " The Angel Islington " is a property in the British version of Monopoly . In the game it is the third @-@ cheapest property on the board , reflecting the downmarket state of Islington through most of the 20th century until its gentrification in the 1980s . Victor Watson , of British manufacturers John Waddington Ltd , and his wife , Marge , decided to include the property on the board whilst taking tea at the cafe . This account of events appears on a plaque displayed in the bank within the building ; the inscription says it is the " only site on the board named after a building " . It is part of the light blue group with Pentonville Road and Euston Road . In the game , a house at the Angel costs £ 50 ; by the turn of the 21st century a house on Islington High Street fetched around £ 600 @,@ 000 . 
 In 1827 , James Pollard painted The Royal Mail Coaches for the North Leaving the Angel , Islington , currently on display in the Tate Gallery . The Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist contains a reference to the Angel , where " London began in earnest " .

 The first @-@ generation iPad ( / <unk> / EYE @-@ pad ) is a tablet computer designed and marketed by Apple Inc. as the first in the iPad line . The device features an Apple A4 processor , a 9 @.@ 7 " touchscreen display , and on certain variants the capability of accessing cellular networks . Using the iOS operating system , the iPad can play music , send and receive email and browse the web . Other functions , which include the ability to play games and access references , GPS navigation software and social network services can be enabled by downloading apps . 
 The device was announced and unveiled on January 27 , 2010 at a media conference . On April 3 , 2010 , the Wi @-@ Fi variant of the device was released in the United States , followed by the release of the Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular variant on April 30 . On May 28 , it was released in Australia , Canada , France , Japan , Italy , Germany , Spain , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . 
 The device received primarily positive reviews from various technology blogs and publications . Reviewers praised the device for its wide range of capabilities and labelled it as a competitor to laptops and netbooks . Some aspects were criticized , including the closed nature of the operating system and the lack of support for the Adobe Flash multimedia format . During the first 80 days , three million iPads were sold . By the launch of the iPad 2 , Apple sold more than 15 million iPads . 
 On March 2 , 2011 , Apple announced the iPad 2 and the discontinuation of production of the original iPad .

 Apple co @-@ founder Steve Jobs stated in a 1983 speech that his company ’ s 
 “ Strategy is really simple . What we want to do at Apple , is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes ... And we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don ’ t have to hook up to anything and you ’ re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers . ” 
 Apple ’ s first tablet computer was the Newton MessagePad 100 , introduced in 1993 , which led to the creation of the <unk> processor core with Acorn Computers . Apple also developed a prototype PowerBook Duo @-@ based tablet , the <unk> , but decided not to sell it in order to avoid hurting MessagePad sales . Apple released several more Newton @-@ based PDAs ; the final one , the MessagePad 2100 , was discontinued in 1998 . 
 Apple reentered the mobile @-@ computing market in 2007 with the iPhone . Smaller than the ( not yet announced ) iPad and featuring a camera and mobile phone , it pioneered the multitouch finger @-@ sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple ’ s iOS mobile operating system . 
 By late 2009 , the iPad 's release had been rumored for several years . Such speculation mostly talked about “ Apple ’ s tablet ” ; specific names included <unk> and <unk> . The actual name is reportedly an homage to the Star Trek PADD , a fictional device very similar in appearance to the iPad . The iPad was announced on January 27 , 2010 , by Jobs at an Apple press conference at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco . 
 Jobs later said that Apple began developing the iPad before the iPhone , but temporarily shelved the effort upon realizing that its ideas would work just as well in a mobile phone . The iPad ’ s internal codename was <unk> , which was revealed in the court case surrounding leaking of iPad information before launch . 
 Apple began taking pre @-@ orders for the iPad from US customers on March 12 , 2010 . The only major change to the device between its announcement and being available to pre @-@ order was the change of the behavior of the side switch from sound muting to that of a screen rotation lock . The Wi @-@ Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3 , 2010 . The Wi @-@ Fi + 3G version was released on April 30 . 3G service for the iPad in the United States is provided by AT & T and was initially sold with two prepaid contract @-@ free data plan options : one for unlimited data and the other for 250 MB per month at half the price . On June 2 , 2010 , AT & T announced that , effective June 7 , the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2 GB plan at slightly lower cost ; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan . The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time . 
 The iPad was initially only available for purchase on Apple ’ s online store and its retail locations ; it has since become available through retailers including Amazon , Walmart , and network operators . The iPad was launched in countries including Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Japan and the United Kingdom on May 28 . Online pre @-@ orders in those countries began on May 10 . Apple released the iPad in Hong Kong , Ireland , Mexico , New Zealand and Singapore on July 23 , 2010 . Israel briefly prohibited importation of the iPad because of concerns that its Wi @-@ Fi might interfere with other devices . On September 17 , 2010 , the iPad was officially launched in China .

 The first @-@ generation iPad features an Apple A4 SoC , which comprises a 1 GHz processor , 256 MB of RAM and a PowerVR <unk> GPU . There are four physical switches on the iPad , including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu , and three plastic physical switches on the sides : wake / sleep and volume up / down , plus a software @-@ controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates . Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation , but iOS 4 @.@ 2 changed it to a mute switch , moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu . In the iOS 4 @.@ 3 update , a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute . Unlike its successors , the first @-@ generation iPad has no cameras . 
 The iPad 's touchscreen display is a 1 @,@ 024 by 768 pixel , 7 @.@ 75 × 5 @.@ 82 in ( 197 × 148 mm ) liquid crystal display ( diagonal 9 @.@ 7 in ( 246 @.@ 4 mm ) ) , with <unk> and scratch @-@ resistant glass . As a result of the device 's screen dimensions and resolution , the screen has a pixel density of 132 ppi . The display responds to other sensors : an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3 @-@ axis accelerometer to sense the iPad 's orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes . Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch 's built @-@ in applications , which work in three orientations ( portrait , landscape @-@ left and landscape @-@ right ) , the iPad 's built @-@ in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations , including upside @-@ down . Consequently , the device has no intrinsic " native " orientation ; only the relative position of the home button changes . 
 The iPad was equipped with 16 GB , 32 GB , or 64 GB of memory . Furthermore , the device was available with two connectivity options : Wi @-@ Fi only or Wi @-@ Fi and Cellular . Unlike its successors , the Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular variant of the first @-@ generation iPad could only support carriers that utilized GSM / UMTS standards and was not compatible with CDMA networks ; however , like its successors , assisted GPS services are supported . 
 The weight of the first @-@ generation iPad varied , dependent upon the connectivity options chosen . The Wi @-@ Fi only variant weighs 1 @.@ 5 lb ( 680 g ) whereas the variant with Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular weighs 1 @.@ 6 lb ( 730 g ) .

 Media reaction to the announcement of the device and the device itself was mixed . The media noted that thousands of people queued on the first day of sale in a number of countries with many of those who waited claiming that " it was worth it . " 
 Walt Mossberg ( of The Wall Street Journal ) wrote , " It 's about the software , stupid " , meaning hardware features and build are less important to the iPad 's success than software and user interface , his first impressions of which were largely positive . Mossberg also called the price " modest " for a device of its capabilities , and praised the ten @-@ hour battery life . Others , including PC Advisor and the Sydney Morning Herald , wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating netbooks , most of which use Microsoft Windows . The base model 's price of $ 499 ( equivalent to $ 541 in 2015 ) was lower than pre @-@ release estimates by Wall Street analysts , and Apple 's competitors , all of whom were expecting a much higher entry price point . 
 The media also praised the quantity of applications , as well as the bookstore and other media applications . In contrast , some sources , including the BBC , criticized the iPad for being a closed system and mentioned that the iPad faces competition from Android @-@ based tablets . However , at the time of the first @-@ generation iPad 's launch , Yahoo News noted that the Android tablet OS , known as " Honeycomb " , was not open source and has fewer apps available for it than for the iPad , though Google has since released the source code for Honeycomb . The Independent criticized the iPad for not being as readable in bright light as paper but praised it for being able to store large quantities of books . After its UK release , The Daily Telegraph said the iPad 's lack of Adobe Flash support was " annoying " . 
 The iPad was selected by Time magazine as one of the 50 Best Inventions of the Year 2010 , while Popular Science chose it as the top gadget behind the overall " Best of What 's New 2010 " winner <unk> <unk> .

 Halo 3 is a 2007 first @-@ person shooter video game developed by Bungie for the Xbox 360 console . The third installment in the Halo franchise , the game concludes the story arc begun in 2001 's Halo : Combat Evolved and continued in 2004 's Halo 2 . The game was released on September 25 , 2007 , in Australia , Brazil , India , New Zealand , North America , and Singapore ; September 26 , 2007 , in Europe ; and September 27 , 2007 , in Japan . Halo 3 's story centers on the interstellar war between twenty @-@ sixth century humanity and a collection of alien races known as the Covenant . The player assumes the role of the Master Chief , a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier , as he battles the Covenant . The game features vehicles , weapons , and gameplay elements not present in previous titles of the series , as well as the addition of saved gameplay films , file sharing , and the Forge map editor — a utility which allows the player to perform modifications to multiplayer levels . 
 Bungie began developing Halo 3 shortly after Halo 2 shipped . The game was officially announced at E3 2006 , and its release was preceded by a multiplayer beta open to select players who purchased the Xbox 360 game Crackdown . Microsoft spent $ 40 million on marketing the game , in an effort to sell more game consoles and broaden the appeal of the game beyond the established Halo fanbase . Marketing included cross @-@ promotions and an alternate reality game . 
 On the day before its official release , 4 @.@ 2 million units of Halo 3 were in retail outlets . Halo 3 grossed US $ 300 million in its first week . More than one million people played Halo 3 on Xbox Live in the first twenty hours . To date , Halo 3 has sold in excess of 14 @.@ 5 million copies , making it the fifth best selling Xbox 360 game of all time , the second best selling game in the Halo franchise , the best selling Xbox 360 exclusive title and the best selling first person shooter on the console outside of the Call of Duty games . The game was also the best @-@ selling video game of 2007 in the U.S. Overall , the game was very well received by critics , with the Forge and multiplayer offerings singled out as strong features ; however some reviewers criticized single @-@ player aspects , especially the plot and campaign layout . A prequel to the game , Halo 3 : ODST , was released worldwide on September 22 , 2009 . A sequel , Halo 4 , released on November 6 , 2012 , was developed by 343 Industries and grossed $ 220 million on its launch day . Halo 3 was rereleased as part of Halo : The Master Chief Collection for the Xbox One on November 11 , 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Halo 3 is a shooter game where players primarily experience gameplay from a first @-@ person perspective . Much of the gameplay takes place on foot , but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat . The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the " Golden Triangle of Halo " : these are weapons , grenades , and melee attacks , which are available to a player in most situations . Players may dual @-@ wield some weapons , forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons . Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations . Unlike previous installments , the player 's secondary weapon is visible on their player model , holstered or slung across the player 's back . 
 Halo 3 introduces " support weapons " , which are cumbersome two @-@ handed weapons that slow the player , but offer greatly increased firepower in return . In addition to weapons , the game contains a new class of gear called equipment ; these items have various effects , ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares . Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time . The game 's vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and AI @-@ only vehicles . 
 Halo 3 contains non @-@ gameplay additions , such as Forge , a map @-@ editing tool . Forge enables players to insert and remove game objects , such as weapons , crates and vehicles into existing multiplayer maps . Almost all weapons , vehicles , and interactive objects can be placed and moved on maps with Forge . Players can enter Forge games and edit and manipulate objects in real time . A budget limits the amount of objects that can be placed . Players may also save up to 100 films of gameplay to their Xbox 360 's hard drive , viewing the action from any angle and at different speeds . Halo 3 offers a form of file sharing , where items such as saved films , screenshots , and custom variants can all be uploaded to Bungie 's official website , Bungie.net. Anyone can browse user created content that has been uploaded to Bungie 's website and tag it to automatically download to their console next time they sign into Xbox Live on Halo 3 . 
 = = = Modes = = = 
 Halo 3 's story or campaign mode can be played through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link . Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games , the first player plays as Master Chief , and the second player plays as the Arbiter . The other two players control two Covenant Elites , N <unk> ' <unk> and <unk> ' <unk> , each with their own backstories . No matter which character is played , each player has identical abilities , though their starting weapons vary . Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled , such as giving the enemies extra health , changing in @-@ game dialogue , or modifying AI behavior . These skulls , as well as the difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed , provide multipliers to the total score . Players are awarded <unk> points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level . 
 Local area network or Xbox Live supports up to sixteen players in multiplayer matches , with game modes including variations of deathmatch and Capture the Flag . Players must actively seek out other players through their Xbox Live Friends list , using the party invite system , or the LAN search feature to play multiplayer matches with their own custom rules and customized maps . If they are connected to Xbox Live however , a player can choose to have the game decide for them the exact rules and map to play on , as well as finding additional people to play against or with , using the " Matchmaking " system ( the automated grouping of players of similar skill ) . A player will decide from a selection of developer designed " playlists " which each contain a certain way to experience the game . 
 Like other multiplayer Xbox 360 titles , Halo 3 uses a customized version of <unk> ranking system for its matchmaking on a per @-@ playlist basis . A linear measure of a player 's experience with the <unk> portion of the game and each particular playlist is also tracked ( denoted as EXP ) . To help players have an enjoyable time online , several peace @-@ of @-@ mind features are implemented within easy reach , such as avoid / feedback options on a player 's service record , as well as voice chat mute straight from the in @-@ game scoreboard . Like Halo 2 , Halo 3 supports downloadable content and updates .

 Halo 3 is set in a science fiction setting during the years 2552 and 2553 . In the year 2525 , a theocratic alliance of alien races known as the Covenant discover humanity spread across dozens of interstellar colonies . The Covenant declare humanity an affront to their gods and begin destroying colonies by bombarding the planets with barrages of plasma , turning their surfaces into glass . Despite efforts to keep the Covenant from finding further human worlds , a Covenant fleet discovers Earth during Halo 2 . 
 " Halos " are massive ringworlds , ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of kilometers in diameter , scattered across the galaxy . These rings were constructed thousands of years ago by a race known as the Forerunners as weapons of last resort against the parasitic alien species known as the Flood . When activated , the Halos would destroy all sentient life in the galaxy , depriving the Flood of its food . The Forerunners disappeared after they activated the rings . In Halo : Combat Evolved , whilst fleeing the Covenant , the UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn stumbled upon one of these ringworlds , Installation 04 . The humans manage to destroy the ring , stopping the Flood ; the Covenant , unaware of the destructive nature of the rings , attempt to fire another ring , Installation 05 , during Halo 2 in order to fulfill their religious prophecy . One race in the Covenant , the Elites , learn the truth about the rings , and join forces with humanity in order to stop the firing of the ring . Though they are successful , the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail @-@ safe protocol , priming all the rings for firing from one location , referred to as the Ark . Still oblivious to the true nature of the rings , the Covenant High Prophet of Truth and the remaining loyalist Covenant proceed to head to Earth , where they believe the Ark is buried . 
 Halo 3 's protagonist is Master Chief Petty Officer John @-@ 117 , a surgically enhanced supersoldier known as a " Spartan " . The Chief fights alongside the Arbiter , a disgraced Covenant Elite commander . Two other Elite characters , N <unk> ' <unk> and <unk> ' <unk> , appear as the third and fourth players in cooperative play . Supporting characters from previous games return , including human soldiers Avery Johnson and Miranda Keyes . The Forerunner artificial intelligence 343 Guilty Spark , who tries and fails to stop the Master Chief from destroying its ringworld in Halo : Combat Evolved , also makes an appearance . Also playing a role in the story is the Flood entity known as the " Gravemind " . In Halo 2 , this leader of the Flood escapes from confinement on Installation 05 , invades the Covenant mobile capital city of High Charity , and captures Cortana , a human @-@ created artificial intelligence . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 After the events of the comic tie @-@ in Halo : Uprising , the Master Chief crashes in eastern Africa , where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter . The Chief , Johnson , and company fight Covenant in the jungle and arrive at a UNSC outpost . Here , Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader , the High Prophet of Truth , from activating a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa . The Chief clears anti @-@ air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth 's ships against the Prophet , but Truth activates the buried artifact , creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter . A Flood @-@ infested ship crash @-@ lands nearby ; Elite forces arrive and <unk> Flood @-@ infected areas of Earth , stopping the threat . Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship , the Chief , Arbiter , Elites , Johnson , Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal . Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark , who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld . 
 Traveling through the portal , the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark , far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy . Here , Truth can remotely activate all the Halos . The Flood arrive aboard High Charity in full force , beginning to infest the installation . Truth captures Johnson , as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology . Keyes is killed attempting a rescue , and Johnson is forced to activate the rings . Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth . The Arbiter , Master Chief , and Flood forces arrive and overwhelm Truth 's guards , rescuing Johnson and halting the installations ' activation . After the Arbiter kills Truth , Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter . 
 The Chief , Arbiter and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is constructing another Halo to replace the one that the Chief previously destroyed . The Chief decides to activate this Halo ; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction . To activate the ring , the Chief rescues Cortana , who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo , from High Charity and destroys the city . Arriving on the new Halo , Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring . The Chief , Arbiter , and Johnson travel to Halo 's control room to activate the ring . Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete , a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark . When Johnson ignores his warning , Guilty Spark fatally wounds him to protect " his " ring . Although the Chief destroys Guilty Spark , Johnson soon dies of his injuries . Chief activates the ring , and escapes the ring 's self @-@ destruction on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn . However , the force of Halo 's blast causes the slipspace portal to collapse , resulting in only the front half of Forward Unto Dawn , carrying the Arbiter , making it back to Earth . 
 A memorial service is held on Earth for the fallen heroes of the Human @-@ Covenant war , during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief . After the memorial service , the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet , Sanghelios . Meanwhile , the rear half of the Forward Unto Dawn drifts in unknown space . Cortana drops a distress beacon , but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued . The Chief enters cryonic sleep , telling Cortana to " wake me , when you need me . " If the game is completed at the Legendary difficulty level , the scene continues to show the piece of Forward Unto Dawn drifting towards an unknown planet , revealed in the sequel to be known as " Requiem " , the primary setting of the campaign of Halo 4 . 
 = = Development = = 
 Halo 3 was initially conceived before Halo 2 was released in 2004 . Much of the staff were preoccupied in making extra content for Halo 2 , while others continued with the groundwork for the development of Halo 3 . Bungie remained quiet as to what their new project was , leaving comments in their weekly update alluding to a " new project " . The game was officially announced with a real @-@ time cinematic trailer at E3 2006 . 
 Bungie kept the public informed on game development via weekly updates on their web site . During development , the game was divided into single player and multiplayer builds ; this made debugging and testing the much smaller multiplayer files quicker . While details of Halo 3 's multiplayer were widely disseminated in the sixteen months leading up to the release , the single @-@ player aspect of the storyline was kept relatively secret throughout much of the development to build up interest . The first campaign screenshots did not appear until a year after the announcement trailer , on July 5 , 2007 , as a " tease " for the planned pace of marketing . 
 A public beta test of the game 's online multiplayer features , as well as saved films and file share , took place four months before the full release . Players required a Crackdown disc to play the beta . 
 AI behavior was enhanced and improved ; the behavior of enemy Brutes the player faces was modified , giving them a " pack mentality " that causes the aliens to perform similar actions at the same time and altering gameplay . 
 = = = Graphics = = = 
 Halo 3 utilizes a proprietary , in @-@ house graphics engine . As detailed on the Bungie website , it employs advanced graphics technologies such as high dynamic range , global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes . Motion blurring was absent from the beta , but was added to the final game . Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real @-@ time shadows on themselves and the environment around them , including the game 's plant life . Halo 3 uses normal , bump , and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons . Players can see distances of up to ten miles ( 16 km ) away , all fully three @-@ dimensional . Real time reflections were written into the engine ; however , they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources . 
 Halo 3 does not natively render at true HD resolution ( at least 720 lines of vertical resolution ) . In a Bungie Weekly Update , it was confirmed that the game renders at 1152 × 640 resolution instead of the usual 1280 × 720 ( HD ) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use . This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one , so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game 's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate . The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360 . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 As with all titles on the Xbox 360 , Halo 3 fully supports 5 @.@ 1 surround sound audio . In the game , there are over 50 @,@ 000 pieces of audio , with nearly 40 @,@ 000 of those being NPC dialogue . This is far more than in either of the preceding Halo titles ; Halo 2 had over 15 @,@ 000 pieces of dialogue . The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly . Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta , and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in @-@ game depending on conditions . Distant gunfire sounds , which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound , may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game . 
 Marty O 'Donnell again composed the original score for the game . Some pieces of the game 's music are produced with a much larger real orchestra than any pieces in the prior two games . For example , the music for the announcement trailer was recorded with a 60 @-@ piece orchestra and a 24 @-@ piece choir . Halo 3 is the first game in the series to feature custom soundtracks , allowing players to replace in @-@ game music with their own choices . The Halo 3 Original Soundtrack was released on November 20 , 2007 . Included on the soundtrack is an original composition submitted by fans and judged by Nile Rodgers , Michael Ostin , and Marty O 'Donnell . 
 = = = Voice cast = = = 
 Voice actors returning to reprise their roles in Halo 3 include Jen Taylor as Cortana , David Scully as Sergeant Johnson and the Elites , Keith David as the Arbiter , Tim Dadabo as 343 Guilty Spark , Ron Perlman as Lord Hood , Robert Davi as Rtas ' Vadum , and Steve Downes as the voice of Master Chief . The game also features new voices , with Terence Stamp and Justis Bolding replacing Halo 2 voice actors Michael Wincott and Julie Benz as the Prophet of Truth and Miranda Keyes respectively . Additional voices include celebrity presenter Jonathan Ross , Nathan Fillion , Adam Baldwin , Alan Tudyk , Katee Sackhoff , and John DiMaggio . Members of the Halo machinima Red vs. Blue ( Burnie Burns , Gus <unk> , Matt <unk> , Jason Saldaña , Geoff Ramsey , and Joel Heyman ) have a cameo role . 
 = = = Leaks = = = 
 Months before the release of Halo 3 , the game 's final testing copy before its gold release — codenamed Epsilon and confirmed by Bungie to be almost complete — was leaked to the Internet . Microsoft reacted to this leak by having the Xbox Live accounts of gamers caught playing the Epsilon copy banned until the year 9999 . Two weeks before Halo 3 was due to be released , full retail copies of the game complete with photographs of the open game box started to appear on the internet auction site eBay . A week before Halo 3 was due for release , major UK catalog retailer Argos accidentally released some of their final retail copies of Halo 3 . Microsoft 's Entertainment and Devices division were quoted as being " disappointed that it happened " but that " it was just an honest mistake " and that Microsoft had no intention of punishing Argos for the error . 
 Halo 3 's final retail copy was leaked online over a week before its official release . The 6 @.@ 14 gigabyte file of the game was ripped and downloaded by " thousands " of people within 24 hours of the leak . Videos of the ending of Halo 3 , obtained from the leaked copy , were captured and posted on video sharing sites . 
 = = Release = = 
 Microsoft spent more than $ 40 million marketing Halo 3 . The goal of the campaign was to sell more Xbox 360 consoles and widen the appeal of the game beyond the " Halo faithful " to casual as well as hardcore gamers . Marketing took the form of stages , including trailers of the game , real @-@ time cinematics , recorded gameplay sequences , pre @-@ rendered CGI , and live action film . On September 12 , 2007 , the " Believe " Halo 3 ad campaign , focused on the epic nature of the story and heroism told through dioramas and third party accounts of Master Chief 's service , began with the video " Museum " and continued on past the game 's release . 
 Throughout the course of development Bungie released four " developer documentaries " that explained the processes behind creating parts of the game . A large @-@ scale multiplayer beta test was played on Xbox Live with more than 800 000 members of the public being able to take part and experience the game for themselves . Beginning in June 2007 , an alternate reality game called Iris involved players in slowly revealing background information for the game . The actual release was met with worldwide launch parties . 
 Halo 3 also had marketing tie @-@ ins and promotions . PepsiCo announced a new line of soft drink , a variant of Mountain Dew named Game Fuel , branded with the Halo 3 logo and the Master Chief . Much of the advertising focused on appealing to the general public , rather than just hardcore fans of the game ; for example , some 7 @-@ Eleven stores advertised Halo 3 and sold specialty cups and copies of the game . 
 Halo 3 was released in three separate retail versions , branded as " Standard " , " Limited " and " Legendary " editions . The Standard Edition contains the game disc , manual , and a small poster with the game 's control @-@ map and artwork . The Limited Edition , contained in a metal case , contains the game disc , manual , poster , Xbox 360 bonus disc with featurettes , and a hardcover @-@ bound " <unk> " , a collection of information and art covering the species , cultures , and civilizations of Halo 3 . The Legendary Edition contains the game disc , manual , poster , interactive bonus disc , the <unk> on a DVD , Legendary DVD containing exclusive content , and a scale replica of the Master Chief 's helmet as a case for the three discs . The slip @-@ cover packaging unfolds into a large heavy @-@ stock poster of Master Chief . Gamestation stores in the UK offered a limited edition Master Chief figurine to the first 1000 preorders . 
 Upon release , some of the Limited Edition versions of Halo 3 were found to have a defect in the hub that kept the discs in place , which could lead to scratched discs . Microsoft confirmed the problem and offered to replace scratched Halo 3 Limited Edition discs free of charge until the end of January 2008 . This was not a problem in either the Legendary Edition or the Standard Edition . 
 During October 16 – 31 , 2013 , Halo 3 was available as a free download for Xbox Live Gold subscribers . 
 = = Downloadable content = = 
 Halo 3 supports multiplayer map downloadable content as well as game updates via Xbox Live . The first three post @-@ release multiplayer maps , " Standoff " , " Rat 's Nest " , and " Foundry " , were released as a pack on December 11 , 2007 , collectively known as the " Heroic Map Pack " . A second group of three maps including a remake of Halo 2 map " Lockout " , titled " Blackout " , a new map " Ghost Town " and a remake of Halo : Combat Evolved map " Sidewinder " , titled " Avalanche " were bundled as the " Legendary Map Pack " , on April 15 , 2008 . These maps introduced visual filters to the Forge pallet , which change the way the maps look . A remake of the Halo : Combat Evolved map " Chill Out " , titled " Cold Storage " , was released as a free download on " Bungie Day " , July 7 , 2008 . The third multiplayer map pack , titled the " Mythic Map Pack " and consisting of the maps " Orbital " , " Assembly " , and " Sandbox " , was included with the Limited Collectors Edition of Halo Wars . The map pack was released over the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 9 , 2009 . The fourth and final multiplayer map pack , " Mythic II Map Pack " , was released on February 2 , 2010 . The map pack includes the three new maps from Halo 3 : ODST : " Citadel " , " Longshore " , and a remake of Halo 2 map " <unk> " , titled " Heretic " . 
 The first version update for Halo 3 was released on February 19 , 2008 , and addressed various bugs such as melee contest resolution and saved @-@ film theater errors . The next update ( called a Title Update ) was released September 23 , 2008 , and includes new Achievements , a new XP ranking system , and various new ways to detect and stop cheating in the game . No further Halo 3 updates were planned . 
 = = Reception = = 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Halo 3 received critical acclaim upon its release . It holds an average of 93 @.@ 53 % and 94 / 100 on aggregate web sites GameRankings and Metacritic . Pro @-@ G 's Wesley Yin @-@ Poole assured readers that Halo 3 lived up to the enormous hype surrounding it , writing that the game was " everything we hoped it would be , and much , much , more " . Reviewers including Eurogamer 's Rob Fahey , Games Radar 's Charlie Barrett , and GameSpot 's Jeff Gerstmann felt that the underlying formula of previous Halo games was unchanged , but that this was not a detriment . " Every type of Halo fan , from the hardcore to the casual to the brand new , will find something to satisfy them in Master Chief 's third adventure , " Barrett asserted , while IGN 's Hilary Goldstein referred to Halo 3 as " the most complete game available on any console " , specifically stating " the Forge and the replay functionality raise the bar for console shooters so high , it may never be surpassed this generation . " The gameplay additions to the game , such as equipment and new vehicles , were praised ; Gerstmann and Goldstein noted that equipment had much more relevance in multiplayer matches than the campaign . 
 Reception of the single @-@ player aspect varied . Yin @-@ Poole wrote that while the cliffhanger ending of Halo 2 was disappointing , the campaign of Halo 3 was much more satisfying . Gerstmann , GameSpy 's Gabe Graziani , and Goldstein maintained that the campaign was too short , especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co @-@ op . Goldstein was highly critical of the eighth level , stating " the penultimate chapter is so bad , just thinking about it puts a rotten taste in my mouth . " The New York Times ' Charles Herold said the game had a " throwaway " plot and Total Video Games judged the single @-@ player aspect ultimately disappointing . Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a part of the game 's story was lost by not having the Arbiter featuring as prominently as the character was in Halo 2 . 
 Most publications agreed that multiplayer was by far one of the best features ; IGN said that the multiplayer map lineup was the strongest of the series , and Gamespy added that " each [ multiplayer ] map is extremely well @-@ tuned " . The Forge level editor and saved films features were singled out as particularly strong features , in addition to superb voice acting and Martin O 'Donnell 's rich score . 
 Other complaints focused on the artificial intelligence ; critics praised the enemy AI but complained that the intelligence of the player 's allies was far poorer . Bryan Vore of Game Informer said that human faces and some textures were just " embarrassing " . 
 Halo 3 was nominated for seven awards from the Spike TV Awards , of which it won " Best Multiplayer Game " and " Most Addictive Video Game Fueled by Dew " . It won Time 's " Game of the Year " and IGN chose it as the Best Xbox 360 Online Multiplayer Game and Innovative Design of 2007 . The Visual Effects Society awarded Bungie the " Best Real Time Visuals in a Video Game " for Halo 3 . Halo 3 took the Calvin Award for " Best Videogame " as selected by Box Office Prophets . Halo 3 also took the award for Xbox 360 Game of the Year 2007 from GameTrailers , and was voted by fans as Game of the Year on G @-@ Phoria . Halo 3 won the Edge Award For Interactive Innovation in August 2008 . In 2010 , the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die . 
 = = = Sales = = = 
 First @-@ day sales of Halo 3 reached $ 170 million in the U.S. , setting a record for highest gross of an entertainment product within 24 hours of its release . The performance beat the previous record setter — Halo 2 — which earned $ 125 million within 24 hours after its launch . The game was preordered by more than one million people in North America . Worldwide more than US $ 300 million worth were sold in the first week , helping to more than double the sales of the Xbox 360 when compared with the weekly average before the Halo 3 launch . 
 In the U.S. , Halo 3 sold 3 @.@ 3 million copies in its first 12 days on sale , increasing to 3 @.@ 7 million copies by November 15 , 2007 . Reuters UK estimated that Halo 3 may have sold up to 5 @.@ 2 million copies worldwide in the first two weeks after launch . By November 30 , 2007 , Halo 3 had sold 5 million copies worldwide , and as of that point , was the best @-@ selling video game of 2007 in the U.S. , even though the game is only available on one console . On January 3 , 2008 , Microsoft announced that Halo 3 has sold 8 @.@ 1 million copies . The game drew over a million Xbox Live members to play online in the first 20 hours , making it the biggest day for Xbox Live gaming in history . The game returned to the top 20 sales charts more than a year after its release in February 2009 ; Gamasutra reported that the boost might have been due to the release of Halo Wars . By January 2008 , 8 @.@ 1 million copies had been sold . According to Microsoft , Halo 3 had sold 14 @.@ 5 million copies as of 2012 . 
 Advertising Age reported that movie studio executives were convinced the release of Halo 3 harmed box office receipts ; the week 's take was 27 % less than the previous year 's yield . While some executives decided the disparity in estimated and actual gross for films like The Heartbreak Kid was due more to the film 's poor reception , other analysts believed that " the audience on [ Halo 3 ] is the 18 @-@ to @-@ 34 demographic , similar to what you 'd see in cinemas " and that this led to a decrease in receipts . Later research suggested that the Halo 3 players still watched the same amount of television and movies , regardless of the time they spent playing the game . 
 = No Gun Ri Massacre = 
 The No Gun Ri Massacre ( Hangul : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; hanja : <unk> ; RR : <unk> Mingan @-@ in <unk> <unk> ) occurred on July 26 – 29 , 1950 , early in the Korean War , when an undetermined number of South Korean refugees were killed by a U.S. air attack and the actions of the 2nd Battalion , 7th U.S. Cavalry , at a railroad bridge near the village of No Gun Ri ( Korean : <unk> ) , 100 miles ( 160 km ) southeast of Seoul . In 2005 , a South Korean government inquest certified the names of 163 dead or missing , and 55 wounded , and added that many other victims ' names were not reported . The South Korean government @-@ funded No Gun Ri Peace Foundation estimated in 2011 that 250 – 300 were killed , mostly women and children . 
 The massacre allegations were little @-@ known outside Korea until publication of an Associated Press ( AP ) story in 1999 , in which 7th Cavalry veterans corroborated Korean survivors ' accounts . The AP also uncovered U.S. Army orders to fire on approaching civilians because of reports of North Korean infiltration of refugee groups . Some details were disputed , but the massacre account was found to be essentially correct . In 2001 , the U.S. Army conducted an investigation and , after previously rejecting survivors ' claims , acknowledged the killings , but described the three @-@ day event as " an unfortunate tragedy inherent to war and not a deliberate killing " . The army rejected survivors ' demands for an apology and compensation . United States President Bill Clinton issued a statement of regret , adding the next day that " things happened which were wrong " . 
 South Korean investigators disagreed with the U.S. report , saying that they believed that 7th Cavalry troops were ordered to fire on the refugees . The survivors ' group called the U.S. report a " whitewash " . The AP later discovered additional archival documents , showing that U.S. commanders had ordered troops to " shoot " and " fire on " civilians at the war front during this period ; these declassified documents had been found , but had not been disclosed by the Pentagon investigators . American historian <unk> Conway @-@ Lanz reported that among the undisclosed documents was a letter from the U.S. ambassador in South Korea , stating that the U.S. military had adopted a theater @-@ wide policy of firing on approaching refugee groups . Despite demands , the U.S. investigation was not reopened . 
 Prompted by the exposure of No Gun Ri , survivors of similar alleged incidents in 1950 @-@ 1951 filed reports with the Seoul government . In 2008 an investigative commission said more than 200 cases of alleged large @-@ scale killings by the U.S. military had been registered , mostly air attacks . 
 = = Background = = 
 The division of Japan 's former Korean colony into two zones at the end of World War II led to years of border skirmishing between <unk> South Korea and Soviet @-@ allied North Korea . On June 25 , 1950 , the North Korean Army invaded the south to try to reunify the peninsula , beginning the Korean War . 
 The invasion caught South Korea and its American ally by surprise , and sent the defending South Korean forces into retreat . The U.S. moved troops from Japan to fight alongside the South Koreans . The first troops landed on July 1 , and by July 22 , three U.S. Army divisions were in Korea , including the 1st Cavalry Division . These American troops were insufficiently trained , poorly equipped , and often led by inexperienced officers . In particular , they lacked training in how to deal with war @-@ displaced civilians . The combined U.S. and South Korean forces were initially unable to stop the North Korean advance , and continued to retreat throughout July . 
 In the two weeks following the first significant U.S. ground troop engagement on July 5 , the U.S. Army estimated that 380 @,@ 000 South Korean civilians fled south , passing through the retreating U.S. and South Korean lines . With gaps in their lines , U.S. forces were attacked from the rear , and reports spread that disguised North Korean soldiers were infiltrating refugee columns . Because of these concerns , orders were issued to fire on Korean civilians in front @-@ line areas , orders discovered decades later in declassified military archives . Among those issuing the orders was 1st Cavalry Division commander Maj. Gen. Hobart R. Gay , who deemed Koreans left in the war zone to be " enemy agents , " according to U.S. war correspondent <unk> King and U.S. diplomat Harold Joyce Noble . On the night of July 25 , that division 's 2nd Battalion , 7th Cavalry Regiment , hearing of an enemy breakthrough , fled rearward from its forward positions , to be reorganized the next morning , digging in near the central South Korean village of No Gun Ri . Later that day , on July 26 , 1950 , these troops saw hundreds of refugees approaching , many from the nearby villages of Chu Gok Ri and Im Ke Ri .

 = = = Events of July 25 – 29 , 1950 = = = 
 On July 25 , as North Korean forces seized the town of Yongdong , 7 miles ( 11 km ) west of No Gun Ri , U.S. troops were evacuating nearby villages , including hundreds of residents of Chu Gok Ri and Im Ke Ri . These villagers were joined by others as they walked down the main road south , and the estimated 600 refugees spent the night by a riverbank near Ha Ga Ri village , 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) west of No Gun Ri . Seven refugees were killed by U.S. soldiers when they strayed from the group during the night . In the morning of July 26 , the villagers found that the escorting soldiers had left . They continued down the road , were stopped by American troops at a roadblock near No Gun Ri , and were ordered onto the parallel railroad tracks , where U.S. soldiers searched them and their belongings , confiscating knives and other items . The refugees were resting , spread out along the railroad embankment around midday , when military aircraft strafed and bombed them . Recalling the air strike , Yang Hae @-@ chan , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy in 1950 , said that the attacking planes returned repeatedly , and " chaos broke out among the refugees . We ran around wildly trying to get away . " He and another survivor said that soldiers reappeared and began shooting the wounded on the tracks . Survivors first sought shelter in a small culvert beneath the tracks , but soldiers and U.S. ground fire drove them from there into a double tunnel beneath a concrete railroad bridge . Inside the bridge underpasses ( each 80 feet long , 22 feet wide and 40 feet high ) , they came under heavy machine gun and rifle fire from 7th Cavalry troops from both sides of the bridge . " Children were screaming in fear and adults were praying for their lives , and the whole time they never stopped shooting , " said survivor Park Sun @-@ yong , whose 4 @-@ year @-@ old son and 2 @-@ year @-@ old daughter were killed , while she was badly wounded . 
 Two communications specialists , Larry Levine and James <unk> , said that they remembered orders to fire on the refugees , coming to the 2nd Battalion command post from a higher level , probably from 1st Cavalry Division . They recalled the ground fire beginning with a mortar round landing among the refugee families , followed by what Levine called a " frenzy " of small @-@ arms fire . Some battalion veterans recalled front @-@ line company officers ordering them to open fire . " It was assumed there were enemy in these people , " said ex @-@ rifleman Herman Patterson . " They were dying down there . I could hear the people screaming , " recalled Thomas H. Hacha of the sister 1st Battalion , observing nearby . Others said that some soldiers held their fire . 
 Trapped refugees began piling up bodies as barricades and tried to dig into the ground to hide . Some managed to escape that first night , while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing , said Chung Koo @-@ ho , whose mother died shielding him and his sister . By the second day , the gunfire was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved or tried to escape . Some also recall planes returning that second day to fire rockets or drop bombs . Racked with thirst , survivors resorted to drinking blood @-@ filled water from a small stream running under the bridge . 
 During the killings , the 2nd Battalion came under sporadic artillery and mortar fire from the North Koreans , who advanced cautiously from Yongdong . Declassified Army intelligence reports showed that the enemy front line was two miles or more from No Gun Ri late on July 28 , the third day of the massacre . That night , the 7th Cavalry messaged division headquarters , " No important contact has been reported by our 2nd Battalion . " Unit documents never reported the refugee killings . In the predawn hours of July 29 , the 7th Cavalry Regiment withdrew from No Gun Ri . That afternoon , North Korean soldiers arrived outside the tunnels and helped those still alive , about two dozen , mostly children , feeding them and sending them back toward their villages . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 In the earliest published accounts of the killings , in August and September 1950 , two North Korean journalists with the advancing northern troops reported finding an estimated 400 bodies in the No Gun Ri area , and seeing some 200 bodies in one tunnel . The survivors generally put the death toll at 400 , including 100 in the initial air attack , with scores more wounded . In Pentagon interviews in 2000 , 7th Cavalry veterans ' estimates of No Gun Ri dead ranged from dozens to 300 . One who had a close look , career soldier Homer Garza , who led a patrol through one No Gun Ri tunnel , said that he saw 200 to 300 bodies piled up there . 
 In 2005 , the South Korean government 's Committee for the Review and Restoration of Honor for the No Gun Ri Victims , after a yearlong process of verifying claims through family registers , medical reports and other documents and testimony , certified the names of 150 No Gun Ri dead , 13 missing , and 55 wounded , including some who later died of their wounds . It said that reports were not filed on many other victims because of the passage of time and other factors . Of the certified victims , 41 percent were children under 15 , and 70 percent were women , children or men over age 61 . The South Korean government @-@ funded No Gun Ri Peace Foundation , which operates a memorial park and museum at the site , estimated in 2011 that 250 – 300 were killed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Information about the refugee killings reached the U.S. command in Korea , and the Pentagon , by late August 1950 , in the form of a captured and translated North Korean military document , which reported the discovery of the massacre . A South Korean agent for the U.S. counterintelligence command confirmed that account with local villagers weeks later , when U.S. troops moved back through the area , the ex @-@ agent told U.S. investigators in 2000 . Evidence of high @-@ level knowledge also appeared in late September 1950 in a New York Times article from Korea , which reported , without further detail , that an unnamed high @-@ ranking U.S. officer told the reporter of the " panicky " shooting of " many civilians " by a U.S. Army regiment that July . No evidence has emerged , however , that the U.S. military investigated the incident at the time . 
 = = = Petitions = = = 
 During the U.S.-supported postwar autocracy of President Syngman Rhee , survivors of No Gun Ri were too fearful of official retaliation to file public complaints . Survivor Yang Hae @-@ chan said that he was warned by South Korean police to stop telling others about the massacre . Following the April Revolution in 1960 , which briefly established democracy in South Korea , former policeman Chung Eun @-@ yong filed the first petition to the South Korean and U.S. governments . His two small children had been killed and his wife , Park Sun @-@ yong , badly wounded at No Gun Ri . Over 30 petitions , calling for an investigation , apology , and compensation , were filed over the next decades , by Chung and later by a survivors ' committee . Almost all were ignored , as was a petition to the U.S. and South Korean governments by the local Yongdong County Assembly . 
 In 1994 , Seoul newspapers reported on a book Chung published about the events of 1950 , raising awareness of the allegations inside South Korea . In that same year , the U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service in Korea dismissed one No Gun Ri petition by asserting that any killings took place during combat . The survivors ' committee retorted that there was no battle at No Gun Ri , but U.S. officials refused to reconsider . 
 In 1997 , the survivors filed a claim with a South Korean compensation committee under the binational Status of Forces Agreement . This time , the U.S. claims service responded by again citing what it claimed was a combat situation , and by asserting that there was no evidence the 1st Cavalry Division was in the No Gun Ri area , as the survivors ' research and the 1961 official Army history of the war indicated . 
 On April 28 , 1998 , the Seoul government committee made a final ruling against the No Gun Ri survivors , citing the long @-@ ago expiration of a five @-@ year statute of limitations . In June 1998 , South Korea 's National Council of Churches , on behalf of the No Gun Ri survivors , sought help from the U.S. National Council of Churches , which asked the Pentagon to investigate . In March 1999 , the Army told the U.S. council that it had looked into the No Gun Ri allegations , and " found no information to substantiate the claim " in the operational records of the 1st Cavalry Division and other frontline units . 
 = = = Associated Press story = = = 
 Months before the Army 's private correspondence with the church group , Associated Press reporters , researching those same 1950 operational records , found orders to shoot South Korean civilians . The U.S.-based news agency , which reported the rejection of the survivors ' claim in April 1998 , had begun investigating the No Gun Ri allegations earlier that year , trying to identify Army units possibly involved , and to track down their ex @-@ soldiers . On Sept . 29 , 1999 , after a year of internal struggle over releasing the article , the AP published its investigative report on the massacre , based on the accounts of 24 No Gun Ri survivors , corroborated by a dozen 7th Cavalry Regiment veterans . " We just annihilated them , " it quoted former 7th Cavalry machine gunner Norman Tinkler as saying . The journalists ' research into declassified military documents at the U.S. National Archives uncovered recorded instructions in late July 1950 that front @-@ line units shoot South Korean refugees approaching their positions . A liaison officer of the sister 8th Cavalry Regiment had relayed word to his unit from 1st Cavalry Division headquarters to fire on refugees trying to cross U.S. front lines . Major General William B. Kean of the neighboring 25th Infantry Division advised that any civilians found in areas supposed to be cleared by police should be considered enemies and " treated accordingly , " an order relayed by his staff as " considered as unfriendly and shot . " On the day the No Gun Ri killings began , the Eighth Army ordered all units to stop refugees from crossing their lines . In subsequent articles , the AP reported that many more South Korean civilians were killed when the U.S. military blew up two Naktong River bridges packed with refugees on Aug. 4 , 1950 , and when other refugee columns were strafed by U.S. aircraft in the war 's first months . 
 The AP team ( Sang @-@ hun Choe , Charles J. Hanley , Martha Mendoza and Randy <unk> ) was awarded the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for their reporting on No Gun Ri , along with receiving 10 other major national and international journalism awards . 
 Expanding on the AP 's work , in June 2000 , CBS News reported the existence of a U.S. Air Force memo from July 1950 , in which the operations chief in Korea said that the Air Force was strafing refugee columns approaching U.S. positions . The memo , dated July 25 , the day before the No Gun Ri killings began with such a strafing , said that the U.S. Army had requested the attacks on civilians , and " to date , we have complied with the army 's request " . A U.S. Navy document later emerged , in which pilots from the aircraft carrier USS Valley Forge reported that the Army had told them to attack any groups of more than eight people in South Korea . " Most fighter @-@ bomber pilots regarded Korean civilians in white clothes as enemy troops , " South Korean scholar <unk> Kim would later conclude after reviewing Air Force mission reports from 1950 . 
 In May 2000 , challenged by a skeptical U.S. News & World Report magazine article , the AP team did additional archival research , and reported that one of nine ex @-@ soldiers quoted in the original No Gun Ri article , Edward L. Daily , had incorrectly identified himself as an eyewitness , and instead had been passing on second @-@ hand information . A Pentagon spokesman said that this would not affect the Army 's No Gun Ri investigation , noting Daily was " just one guy of many we 've been talking to " . Army officer Robert Bateman , a 7th Cavalry veteran , who collaborated on the U.S. News & World Report article with a fellow 7th Cavalry association member , also published a book , No Gun Ri : A Military History of the Korean War Incident , repeating his contentions that the AP reporting was flawed . The AP 's methods and conclusions were defended by the AP in a lengthy , detailed refutation and by others . The Pulitzer committee reaffirmed its award and the credibility of the AP reporting . 
 = = = U.S. and South Korean military investigations = = = 
 On Sept . 30 , 1999 , within hours of publication of the AP report , Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered Army Secretary Louis Caldera to initiate an investigation . The Seoul government also ordered an investigation , proposing that the two inquiries conduct joint document searches and joint witness interviews . The Americans refused . 
 In the ensuing 15 @-@ month probes , conducted by the U.S. Army inspector general 's office and Seoul 's Defense Ministry , interrogators interviewed or obtained statements from some 200 U.S. veterans and 75 Koreans . The Army researchers reviewed 1 million pages of U.S. archival documents . The final weeks were marked by press reports from Seoul of sharp disputes between the U.S. and Korean teams . On January 11 , 2001 , the two governments issued their separate reports . 
 = = = = U.S. report = = = = 
 After years of dismissing the allegations , in its report , the Army acknowledged that the U.S. military had killed " an unknown number " of South Korean refugees at No Gun Ri with " small @-@ arms fire , artillery and mortar fire , and strafing . " But it held that no orders were issued to fire on the civilians , and that the shootings were the result of hostile fire from among the refugees , or was firing meant to control them . At another point , it suggested that soldiers may have " misunderstood " the Eighth Army 's stop @-@ refugees order to mean they could be shot . At the same time , it described the deaths as " an unfortunate tragedy inherent to war and not a deliberate killing . " The Army report dismissed the testimony of soldiers who spoke of orders to shoot at No Gun Ri because , it said , none could remember the wording , the originating officer 's name , or having received the order directly himself . 
 The report questioned an early , unverified South Korean government estimate of 248 killed , missing , and wounded at No Gun Ri , citing an aerial reconnaissance photograph of the area , said to have been taken eight days after the killings ended , that it said showed " no indication of human remains or mass graves . " Four years after this 2001 report , the Seoul government 's inquest committee certified the identities of a minimum 218 casualties . 
 = = = = South Korean report = = = = 
 In their report , South Korean investigators acknowledged that no documents showed specific orders at No Gun Ri to shoot refugees . But they pointed to gaps in the <unk> documents dealing with 7th Cavalry and U.S. Air Force operations . Missing documents included the 7th Cavalry 's journal , or communications log , for July 1950 , the record that would have carried No Gun Ri orders . It was missing without explanation from its place at the National Archives . 
 The South Korean report said that five former Air Force pilots told U.S. interrogators that they were directed to strafe civilians during this period , and 17 veterans of the 7th Cavalry testified that they believed there were orders to shoot the No Gun Ri refugees . The Koreans noted that two of the veterans were battalion communications specialists ( Levine and <unk> ) and , as such , were in an especially good position to know which orders had been relayed . Citing the Eighth Army order of July 26 to stop refugees , the Korean report concluded that the 7th Cavalry was " likely to have used all possible means to stop the approaching refugees . " Said South Korea 's national security director , Oh Young @-@ ho , " We believe there was an order to fire . " A joint <unk> " Statement of Mutual Understandings " issued with the reports did not repeat the U.S. report 's flat assertion that no orders to shoot were issued at No Gun Ri . 
 The Korean investigators cast doubt on the U.S. report 's suggestion of possible gunfire from among the refugees . Surviving documents said nothing about infiltrators at No Gun Ri , even though they would have been the 7th Cavalry 's first enemy killed @-@ in @-@ action in Korea . The No Gun Ri survivors denied it emphatically , and only three of 52 battalion veterans interviewed by the U.S. team spoke of hostile fire , and then inconsistently . 
 Regarding the aerial imagery that the U.S. report said suggested a lower death toll , the South Korean investigators , drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents , said that at least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives , or buried in soldiers ' abandoned foxholes , in the first days after the killings , and others remained inside one underpass tunnel , under thin layers of dirt , out of sight of airborne cameras , and awaiting later burial in mass graves . In addition , South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos , pointing out irregularities , including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film , raising the possibility that they were not , as claimed , from August 6 , 1950 , eight days after the killings .

 On the day the U.S. report was issued , then @-@ President Bill Clinton issued a statement declaring , " I deeply regret that Korean civilians lost their lives at No Gun Ri in late July , 1950 " . The next day , he told reporters that " things happened which were wrong " . But the U.S. did not offer the apology and individual compensation sought by the survivors and the South Korean government . Instead , the U.S. offered a $ 4 million plan for a memorial at No Gun Ri , and a scholarship fund . The survivors later rejected the plan , because the memorial would be dedicated to all the war 's South Korean civilian dead , rather than just the No Gun Ri victims . 
 = = = Reaction to U.S. report ; further evidence emerges = = = 
 The No Gun Ri survivors ' committee called the U.S. Army report a " whitewash " of command responsibility . " This is not enough for the massacre of over 60 hours , of 400 innocent people who were hunted like animals , " said committee head Chung Eun @-@ yong . The survivors rejected the notion that the killings were " not deliberate , " pointing to accounts from veterans and to documents attesting to front @-@ line orders to shoot civilians . Lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition party in South Korea criticized the U.S. position . 
 Former U.S. congressman Pete McCloskey of California , the only one of eight outside advisers to the U.S. inquiry to write a detailed analysis afterward , agreed with the Koreans , saying , " I thought the Army report was a whitewash . " In a letter to Defense Secretary Cohen , another U.S. adviser , retired Marine general Bernard E. Trainor , expressed sympathy with the hard @-@ pressed U.S. troops of 1950 , but said the killings were unjustified , and that " the American command was responsible for the loss of innocent civilian life in or around No @-@ Gun @-@ Ri . " 
 Journalists and scholars subsequently noted that the U.S. report either did not address , or presented incomplete versions , of key declassified documents , some previously reported in the news media . News reports pointed out that the U.S. review , in describing the July 1950 Air Force memo , did not acknowledge that it said refugees were being strafed at the Army 's request . Researchers found that the U.S. review had not disclosed the existence of U.S. Air Force mission reports during this period , documenting the strafing of apparent refugee groups , and air strikes in the No Gun Ri vicinity . The report did not address the commanders ' July 26 – 27 , 1950 , instructions in the 25th Infantry Division , saying that civilians in the war zone would be considered unfriendly and shot . In saying that no such orders were issued at No Gun Ri , the Army did not disclose that the 7th Cavalry log , which would have held such orders , was missing from the National Archives . 
 After the Army issued its report , it was learned that it also had not disclosed its researchers ' discovery of at least 14 additional declassified documents , showing high @-@ ranking commanders ordering or authorizing the shooting of refugees in the Korean War 's early months , such as communications from 1st Cavalry Division commander Gay , and a top division officer , to consider refugees north of the front line " fair game " and to " shoot all refugees coming across river " . In addition , interview transcripts obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests showed that the Army had not reported repeated testimony from ex @-@ soldiers that , as one put it , " the word I heard was ' Kill everybody from 6 to 60 ' " during their early days in Korea . 
 In 2005 , American historian <unk> Conway @-@ Lanz reported his discovery of a declassified document at the National Archives , in which the United States Ambassador to Korea in 1950 , John J. Muccio , notified the State Department , on the day the No Gun Ri killings began , that the U.S. military , fearing infiltrators , had adopted a policy of shooting South Korean refugee groups that approached U.S. lines , after firing warning shots . Pressed by the South Korean government , the Pentagon eventually acknowledged that it deliberately omitted the Muccio letter from its 2001 report . 
 = = = Law of war and No Gun Ri = = = 
 In disclaiming U.S. culpability in January 2001 , then @-@ President Clinton told reporters , " The evidence was not clear that there was responsibility for wrongdoing high enough in the chain of command in the Army to say that , in effect , the government was responsible . " American lawyers for the No Gun Ri survivors rejected that rationale , saying that whether 7th Cavalry troops acted under formal orders or not , " the massacre of civilian refugees , mainly the elderly , women and children , was in and of itself a clear violation of international law for which the United States is liable under the doctrine of command responsibility and must pay compensation " . Writing to the Army inspector general 's office in May 2001 , the lawyers also pointed out that numerous orders were issued at the war front to shoot civilians , and said that the U.S. military 's self @-@ investigation – " allowing enforcement to be subject to the unbridled discretion of the alleged perpetrator " – was an ultimate violation of victims ' rights . 
 In its 2005 report , the South Korean government 's inquest panel , the Committee for the Review and Restoration of Honor for the No Gun Ri Victims , cited six South Korean legal studies as saying that No Gun Ri constituted a crime against humanity . " The No Gun Ri Massacre overtly violates the basic principles of the law of war and customary international law , " legal scholar Tae @-@ Ung Baik wrote in one study . The committee itself concluded , " The United States of America should take responsibility for the No Gun Ri incident . " 
 American experts in military law agreed that the 1950 events violated the laws of war prohibiting targeting of noncombatants , but said that prosecuting ex @-@ soldiers a half @-@ century later was a practical impossibility . Nevertheless , Army Secretary Caldera said early in the investigation that he couldn 't rule out prosecutions , a statement that survivors later complained may have deterred some 7th Cavalry veterans from testifying .

 = = = Continuing appeals = = = 
 Although often supported by South Korean politicians and newspaper editorials , the No Gun Ri survivors ' repeated demands for a reopened U.S. investigation and compensation went unheeded . Meeting with South Korean officials in 2001 , the survivors asked that their government seek action at the International Court of Justice at The Hague , and in U.N. human rights forums , but were rebuffed . In 2002 , a spokesman for South Korea 's then @-@ governing party called for a new U.S. inquiry , but the Defense Ministry later warned the National Assembly that a reopened probe might damage U.S.-South Korean relations . 
 The disclosure in 2006 that Pentagon investigators had omitted the Muccio letter from their final report , along with other incriminating documents and testimony , prompted more calls for action . Two leaders of the National Assembly appealed to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a joint investigation , but no U.S. congressional body ever took up the No Gun Ri issue . In a 2015 book , David Straub , U.S. Embassy political chief during the No Gun Ri investigation , wrote that meeting the survivors ' demands would have set an undesirable precedent for similar cases from 1950 Korea . After a delegation 's visit to No Gun Ri , the annual General Assembly of the US Presbyterian Church adopted a resolution in June 2016 calling on church leadership to urge the U.S. president and Congress to issue an apology and appropriate compensation for the No Gun Ri killings . 
 = = = Graves , memorial park = = = 
 No Gun Ri villagers said that in later decades , two mass graves holding some victims ' remains were disturbed , and bones were removed during a reforestation project , and by farming activity . In 2007 , excavations at several places near the bridge turned up little . The forensics team said that it hadn 't found more , because so much time had passed , and any remains had been exposed to the elements and soil erosion , railway work , cultivation , and highly acidic soil . 
 After the United States refused to offer compensation , and the survivors rejected the plan for a war memorial and scholarship fund , South Korea 's National Assembly , on February 9 , 2004 , adopted a " Special Act on the Review and Restoration of Honor for the No Gun Ri Victims . " It established the committee that examined and certified the identities of the dead and wounded , and it provided medical subsidies for surviving wounded . The act also envisioned a memorial park at the No Gun Ri site , which had begun attracting 20 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 visitors a year . The 33 @-@ acre ( 13 @-@ ha . ) No Gun Ri Memorial Peace Park , built with $ 17 million in government funds , and featuring a memorial , museum , and peace education center , opened in October 2011 . In 2009 , Yongdong County established a nearby cemetery , to which some victims ' remains were moved from family plots . A publicly financed No Gun Ri International Peace Foundation also sponsored an annual peace conference , a No Gun Ri Peace Prize , and a summer peace camp at the park for international university students .

 In South Korea , the No Gun Ri story inspired works of nonfiction , fiction , theater , and other arts . In 2010 , a major Korean studio , Myung Films , released a No Gun Ri feature film , A Little Pond , written and directed by Lee <unk> @-@ woo and featuring Song Kang @-@ ho , Moon So @-@ ri and other Korean stars who donated their work . Besides commercial release in South Korea , the movie was screened at international film festivals , including in New York and London . In 2006 – 2010 , artist Park Kun @-@ <unk> and Chung Eun @-@ yong published <unk> Story , a two @-@ volume graphic narrative that told the story of the massacre , and the half @-@ century struggle for the truth , through thousands of drawings , based on Chung 's 1994 book . The Korean @-@ language work was also published in translation in Europe . In the United States and Britain , No Gun Ri was a central or secondary theme in five English @-@ language novels , including the U.S. National Book Award finalist Lark & Termite of 2009 , by Jayne Anne Phillips , and the James Bond thriller Trigger Mortis of 2015 , by British author Anthony Horowitz . 
 = = = Truth and Reconciliation Commission = = = 
 The 1999 No Gun Ri articles prompted hundreds of South Koreans to come forward to report other alleged incidents of large @-@ scale civilian killings by the U.S. military in 1950 – 1951 , mostly in the form of air attacks . In 2005 , the National Assembly created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of the Republic of Korea to investigate these allegations , as well as other human rights violations in southern Korea during the 20th century . The commission 's docket eventually held more than 200 cases of what it described as " civilian massacre committed by U.S. soldiers " . 
 By 2009 , the commission 's work of collating declassified U.S. military documents with survivors ' accounts confirmed eight representative cases of what it found were wrongful U.S. killings of hundreds of South Korean civilians , including refugees crowded into a cave attacked with napalm bombs , and those at a shoreline refugee encampment deliberately shelled by a U.S. warship . 
 The commission alleged that the U.S. military repeatedly conducted indiscriminate attacks , failing to distinguish between combatants and non @-@ combatants . In its most significant finding , the commission also confirmed that South Korean authorities had summarily executed thousands of suspected leftists in South Korea – possibly 100 @,@ 000 to 200 @,@ 000 – at the outbreak of the war , sometimes with U.S. Army officers present and taking photographs . 
 Of all American wars , the Korean conflict is believed to have been the deadliest for civilians as a proportion of those killed , including North and South Korean non @-@ combatants killed in extensive U.S. Air Force bombing of North Korea , and South Korean civilians summarily executed by the invading North Korean military . The commission also recommended that the Seoul government negotiate with the United States for reparations for large @-@ scale civilian killings by the U.S. military . This did not occur . Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Stanley Roth was quoted as saying in Seoul at the outset of the No Gun Ri investigation in 1999 that the United States would consider investigating any similar Korean War killings that came to light . The 1999 – 2001 investigation was the last conducted by the United States .

 Appian Way Productions was founded by Leonardo DiCaprio . Its first film was The Assassination of Richard Nixon ( 2004 ) , starring Sean Penn as Samuel <unk> who attempted to assassinate president Richard Nixon in 1974 . It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival . The company 's next film was the 2004 biopic The Aviator , produced in association with Forward Pass , Intermedia , and Initial Entertainment Group . Based on the 1993 non @-@ fiction book Howard Hughes : The Secret Life by Charles Higham , the film depicted the life of Howard Hughes ( DiCaprio ) , an aviation pioneer who became a successful film producer between the late 1920s and late 1940s while simultaneously growing more unstable due to severe obsessive – compulsive disorder . Writing for The Daily Telegraph , Sukhdev Sandhu described the film as " a gorgeous tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood " even though it " tips the balance of spectacle versus substance in favour of the former . " He praised Martin Scorsese 's direction , DiCaprio and the supporting cast but panned Kate Beckinsale 's performance . With a worldwide gross of $ 213 @.@ 7 million against a budget of $ 110 million , the film proved to be a commercial success . The film earned a total of eleven nominations at the 77th Academy Awards , including Best Picture , Best Director ( Scorsese ) and Best Actor ( DiCaprio ) , and won five of them , including a Best Supporting Actress award for Cate Blanchett . 
 Appian Way 's next film was released three years later — the comedy drama Gardener of Eden which , according to The Hollywood Reporter 's Frank Scheck , " lacks the necessary dramatic urgency or black humor to connect with audiences " . A few months later , it released The 11th Hour , a documentary about global warming . The film featured 50 experts on environmental issues and the solutions , and won the <unk> Environmental Film Award through the National Geographic Channel in March 2008 . DiCaprio wrote a three @-@ season television series Greensburg ( 2008 – 10 ) which was produced by the company . The company , along with Dark Castle Entertainment , released the 2009 psychological horror film Orphan , which told the story of a couple who , after the death of their unborn child , adopt a mysterious 9 @-@ year @-@ old girl . The film 's content , depicting a murderous adoptee , created controversy among the adoption community , which stated that it promotes negative stereotypes about orphans . Although the film received mixed reviews , it was a commercial success . Scorsese reunited with the company to make the film Shutter Island ( 2010 ) , a psychological thriller based on the 2003 novel of same name by Dennis Lehane . DiCaprio played U.S. Marshal Edward " Teddy " Daniels , who investigates a psychiatric facility located on an island but eventually comes to question his own sanity . A commercial success , the film received generally positive reviews ; Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised the film 's direction and performances but criticized its " silly twist ending " , calling it " supremely exasperating " . 
 Red Riding Hood , directed by Catherine Hardwicke , was Appian Way 's first release in 2011 . In the film , which is set in a village haunted by werewolves , a young girl falls in love with an orphan woodcutter , much to her family 's displeasure . Earlier in production , the film was titled The Girl with the Red Riding Hood . Although it was poorly received by critics — Mary Pols of Time named it one of the Top 10 Worst Movies of 2011 — it performed modestly at the box @-@ office . The company 's final release in 2011 was Detachment , a Tony Kaye @-@ directed drama on high school education system . Three films were produced by the company in 2013 ; the first was Runner Runner , an ensemble crime thriller , which The Guardian 's Xan Brooks described as " a lazy , trashy film that barely goes through the motions " . The thriller Out of the Furnace , the company 's second release , was also negatively received by critics and was a box office bomb . Scorsese directed the company 's final film in 2013 — The Wolf of Wall Street , a biopic on the life of Jordan Belfort ( DiCaprio ) , a New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and money laundering on Wall Street in the 1990s . The screenplay was adapted by Terence Winter from Belfort 's memoir of the same name . The film was banned in Kenya , Malaysia and Nepal for its controversial depiction of events , explicit sexual content , profanity , and hard drug use . Nonetheless , it was a major commercial success and it went on to be the 17th @-@ highest @-@ grossing film of 2013 . According to copyright infringement tracking site Excipio , the film was the most widely infringed of 2014 , as it was downloaded illegally over 30 million times via torrent sites . The film was nominated for several Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Actor , although it failed to win in any category . 
 In 2015 , DiCaprio produced and starred in the biographical western thriller The Revenant , which is based on in part on Michael <unk> 's 2002 novel of the same name , which itself is inspired by the life of frontiersman Hugh Glass . The film was well received by critics , with Justin Change of Variety reviewing : " Bleak as hell but considerably more beautiful , this nightmarish plunge into a frigid , forbidding American outback is a movie of pitiless violence , grueling intensity and continually breathtaking imagery " . As of October 2015 , the company is filming Live by Night , a crime film based on the 2012 novel of same name .

 The 2005 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2004 – 05 UEFA Champions League , Europe 's primary club football competition . The showpiece event was contested between Liverpool of England and Milan of Italy at the Atatürk Stadium in Istanbul , Turkey on 25 May 2005 . Liverpool , who had won the competition four times , were appearing in their sixth final , and their first since 1985 . Milan , who had won the competition six times , were appearing in their second final in three years and tenth overall . 
 Each club needed to progress through the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the final , playing 12 matches in total . Liverpool finished second in their group behind 2004 runners @-@ up AS Monaco and subsequently beat Bayer Leverkusen , Juventus and Chelsea to progress to the final . Milan won their group ahead of Barcelona and faced Manchester United , Internazionale and PSV Eindhoven before reaching the final . 
 Milan were regarded as favourites before the match and took the lead within the first minute through captain Paolo Maldini . Milan striker Hernán Crespo added two more goals before half @-@ time to make it 3 – 0 . In the second half Liverpool launched a comeback and scored three goals in a dramatic six @-@ minute spell to level the scores at 3 – 3 , with goals from Steven Gerrard , Vladimír Šmicer and Xabi Alonso . The scores remained the same during extra time , and a penalty shoot @-@ out was required to decide the champions . The score was 3 – 2 to Liverpool when Andriy Shevchenko 's penalty was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek . Thus Liverpool won their fifth European Cup , were awarded the trophy permanently , and claimed a multiple @-@ winner badge . Liverpool 's comeback gave rise to the final being known as the Miracle of Istanbul , and is regarded as one of the finest moments of the club 's history .

 Teams qualified for the Champions League group stage , either directly or through three preliminary rounds , based on both their position in the preceding domestic league and the strength of that league . Each club needed to progress through the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the final , playing 12 matches in total . Liverpool finished second in their group behind 2004 Champions League runners @-@ up AS Monaco and subsequently beat Bayer Leverkusen , Juventus and Chelsea to progress to the final . Milan won their group ahead of Barcelona and faced Manchester United , Internazionale and PSV Eindhoven before reaching the final . Liverpool entered the competition in the third qualifying round after finishing fourth in the 2003 – 04 FA Premier League . They faced Austrian side Grazer AK and won the first leg 2 – 0 at Grazer after two goals from captain Steven Gerrard . They lost the second leg 1 – 0 at Anfield but progressed to the group stage by virtue of winning the tie 2 – 1 on aggregate . Milan entered the competition in the group stage after winning Serie A. The group stages were contested as eight double round @-@ robin groups of four teams , the top two qualifying for the knockout stages . Knockout ties were decided based on home and away matches .

 The 2005 final was the sixth time Liverpool had reached the final and it was their first appearance since the 1985 European Cup Final , when they lost 1 – 0 to Juventus and were subsequently banned from European competition for an indefinite period due to the Heysel Stadium disaster . They had previously won the European Cup on four occasions in 1977 , 1978 , 1981 and 1984 . The match was Milan 's tenth appearance in the final . They had won on six occasions ( 1963 , 1969 , 1989 , 1990 , 1994 , 2003 ) , and lost three times ( 1958 , 1993 , 1995 ) . In total the teams had participated in 14 finals between them . Prior to the game , Milan were assured of entering the Champions League next season after finishing second in Serie A. Liverpool meanwhile had failed to finish in the top four in the Premier League , and had to win the final to enter the competition the following season . Even if they did win the match , they were not assured of a place after UEFA failed to confirm whether they would allow Liverpool to defend the championship . The Football Association supported Liverpool , stating , " We have already submitted a written request to have an additional place , should they win the Champions League " . Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti had his own view on the situation : " I think a team that wins should have the right to defend it but we may just do the English federation a favour and solve this " . 
 Each team was allocated 20 @,@ 000 tickets for the final , out of a total of 69 @,@ 500 .
