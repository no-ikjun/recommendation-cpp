 In his 1936 speech when presented with the RIBA 's Royal Gold Medal , Holden defined his position : " It was not so much a matter of creating a new style , as of discarding those incrustations which counted for style ... surface embroidery empty of structural significance " . His method was to focus on " those more permanent basic factors of architecture , the plan , and the planes and masses arising out of the plan . " He described his ideal building as one " which takes naturally and inevitably the form controlled by the plan and the purpose and the materials . A building which provides opportunities for the exercise and skill and pleasure in work not only to the designer but also for the many craftsmen employed and the occupants of the building . " 
 In a 1957 essay on architecture , he wrote " I don 't seek for a style , either ancient or modern , I want an architecture which is through and through good building . A building planned for a specific purpose , constructed in the method and use of materials , old or new , most appropriate to the purpose the building has to serve . "

 Holden won the RIBA 's London Architecture Medal for 1929 ( awarded 1931 ) for 55 Broadway . In 1936 he was awarded the RIBA 's Royal Gold Medal for his body of work . He was Vice President of the RIBA from 1935 – 37 and a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission from 1933 to 1947 . In 1943 he was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry for the design of transport equipment . He was awarded honorary doctorates by Manchester University in 1936 and London University in 1946 . Many of Holden 's buildings have been granted listed status , protecting them against demolition and unapproved alteration . 
 Holden declined the invitation to become a Royal Academician in 1942 , having previously been nominated , but refused because of his connection to Epstein . He twice declined a knighthood , in 1943 and 1951 , as he considered it to be at odds with his simple lifestyle and considered architecture a collaborative process . 
 The RIBA holds a collection of Holden 's personal papers and material from Adams , Holden & Pearson . The RIBA staged exhibitions of his work at the Heinz Gallery in 1988 and at the Victoria and Albert Museum between October 2010 and February 2011 . A public house near Colliers Wood Underground station has been named " The Charles Holden " , taking " inspiration " from the architect .

 G @-@ Police is a shooter video game , developed and published by Psygnosis in 1997 for the PlayStation and PC . The game spawned a single sequel , G @-@ Police : Weapons of Justice , released in 1999 for the PlayStation . This sequel received similar reviews to those of the original game . In 2007 , G @-@ Police was made available for download on the PlayStation Network ( Europe only ) . 
 The game has a science @-@ fiction setting , inspired by Blade Runner . The story takes place in the year 2097 , on a colonised Callisto ( one of Jupiter 's moons ) . The game charts the protagonist Slater 's attempts to discover the truth behind his sister 's mysterious death while working for the titular G @-@ Police . The game begins with the G @-@ Police combating organised criminals before fighting the private armies of powerful corporations in an unfolding conspiracy @-@ themed plot . The gameplay involves piloting VTOL aircraft resembling helicopters , engaging in combat with enemies and protecting allies . 
 The game made use of cutting edge technology such as force – feedback joysticks and controllers , 3D sound and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration and was largely well received . Critics noted that the game 's graphics were some of the most technically impressive of the time . Overall , however , critics had mixed response for the graphics , as the demanding graphics resulted in poor draw distance ; in particular , the PlayStation version struggled in this aspect . In general , the gameplay was favourably reviewed , with critics praising the solid , enjoyable missions , though there were complaints regarding a poor control system and unfairly high levels of difficulty . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 The game is set in 2097 , according to the introductory sequence . This sequence also provides the history of the game ’ s setting : in <unk> , the depletion of Earth ’ s resources coincided with widening space exploration . After a catastrophic war over ever @-@ declining resources , ending 10 years prior to the events of G @-@ Police , Earth ’ s governments were stripped of military power . As a result , powerful corporations had exerted control over Earth and the burgeoning space colonies . The Government Police ( G @-@ Police ) was formed by Earth ’ s remaining coalition government to maintain order in these colonies . 
 In the latter part of the introductory sequence , Slater , the game 's protagonist , introduces himself as a war veteran who had joined the G @-@ Police to conduct his own investigation of his sister Elaine ’ s apparent suicide , suspecting that she was murdered . He also provides his view of the G @-@ Police , stating they lack authority and “ turn a blind eye ” to “ shady corporate deals ” while attempting to maintain order . He describes the Havoc gun @-@ ships as outdated and the pilots as a mixture of desperate war veterans and naïve idealists . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The early levels of the game depict Slater combating enemy gangs . The G @-@ Police suspect " Krakov " corporation is supplying the gangs with weaponry . Krakov ’ s president however is subsequently the subject of an assassination attempt by the gangs . During this attempt , Tachikawa ( a pilot whom Slater describes as flying his gun @-@ ship " like he was born in it " ) dies when his gun @-@ ship crashes after mysteriously malfunctioning . In the interests of morale , his death is covered up ; Slater notes this incident is reminiscent of Elaine ’ s death . 
 After numerous terrorist attacks on their personnel and property , Krakov blames a rival corporation , " Nanosoft " , and begins openly attacking them with its private army . Lacking evidence for involvement with the criminal gangs , the G @-@ Police protect Nanosoft , ultimately destroying Krakov ’ s military power . The latter half of the game depicts a conflict between the G @-@ Police and Nanosoft ’ s private forces , which attack G @-@ Police after Krakov ’ s collapse . 
 In the unfolding plot , the player learns that Tachikawa and Slater ’ s sister , Elaine , were killed ( by the sabotage of their gun @-@ ships ) to procure microchips implanted in their brains . These chips can record a pilot 's knowledge and combat skills ; Nanosoft desired them to power the artificial intelligence in their weapons . The G @-@ Police commander Horton is assassinated by Slater 's traitorous wingman Ricardo , also to this end . The game ends with the destruction of a large spacecraft by Slater ; the closing sequence reveals that Nanosoft had planned to use this to exert military dominance over other corporations . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game involves piloting VTOL aircraft , described by critics as " jet helicopters " or " a helicopter without the rotors " . The player can choose to view the action from a variety of first- or third @-@ person perspectives , including views from within the cockpit , a variety of " chase " perspectives , including directly from above the craft ( for use when bombing ) . Combat in G @-@ Police involves both dogfighting with other aircraft and dropping bombs . The player is often required to " scan " suspect vehicles to determine if they are criminal or hostile . The game 's aircraft comes with numerous weapons which are upgraded as the player progresses to more difficult levels . An improved version of the basic " Havoc " aircraft ( the " Venom " ) is also available later in the game . Missions include seeking out and destroying enemies , escorting friendly ground units , preventing smuggling and bomb disposal . The player receives updates and new instructions as the mission proceeds . The main game mode features 35 missions and an additional training mode . Most of the game 's mission take place in urban " domes " filled with large buildings ; some , however , take place in the " outer domes " , with other themes such as agrarian settings . 
 = = Development = = 
 G @-@ Police was developed at Psygnosis ' Stroud Studio . Psygnosis ’ co @-@ founder Ian Hetherington called the studio in the South of England one of their " <unk> . " Staff consisted of around 70 people who were also responsible for developing Overboard ! at the same time . 
 A television advertisement was created to publicise the game , based around an animated sequence by Peter Chung — creator of Æon Flux . The original sequence was 21 seconds long , but was shortened to allow gameplay footage to appear in the advertisement . The animation was " done entirely using traditional hand @-@ drawn methods " , according to its creator . Regarding its development , Cheung also stated : 
 " I was at first daunted by the prospect of animating mechanical vehicles by hand that would hold up beside their computer @-@ generated versions . I decided to concentrate on the people inside the machines , emphasizing their emotions and expressions . Also , the computer imagery was very atmospheric , with lots of lighting effects . I used multiple layers of glows , highlights , and shadows to get the drawn artwork to match the atmosphere of the game footage . " 
 Cheung claimed that the decision to " concentrate on the people inside the machines " was informed by his belief that the game ’ s plot , setting and characters set G @-@ Police apart from other shooters of the day . 
 G @-@ Police was backed by a reported $ 2 @.@ 5 million advertising campaign , part of a wider $ 6 million campaign which also included F1 Championship Edition and Colony Wars . G @-@ Police continued to be closely associated with Colony Wars , another science fiction shooter from Psygnosis . IGN stated prior to the games ’ releases that " G @-@ Police is that rarest of games , a thinking man 's shooter , and Colony Wars looks like it 'll redefine the space shoot ' em up " . The online magazine indicated it was further anticipating the titles due to the credentials of the developer .

 G @-@ Police was awarded the " Creative Labs Best Use of Innovative Technology " award at the PC Zone awards ceremony 1997 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 IGN noted the Blade Runner influence on the game ’ s visuals and setting and praised the game ’ s expansion of the theme . The online magazine however derided the graphics as the " low point of the game " , pointing to the " terrible " draw distance and building textures . Nevertheless , the game was redeemed by its solid gameplay and attention to detail , and was awarded a rating of 8 / 10 . Though Edge disagreed regarding the buildings ' detail , praising them , the magazine agreed that the game stretched the PlayStation 's capabilities too far , though it was less harsh , calling the draw distance the " only fly in the ointment " ; the magazine noted that these problems were alleviated somewhat in the PC version . Edge praised the large city environments , flight simulation ( noting the support for the DualShock controller ) , " marvellous " cut scenes and " great variety and imagination " of the playable missions , giving the game an 8 / 10 rating . 
 Next Generation Magazine praised the game 's support of recent technical innovations , particularly force – feedback joysticks , 3D sound , and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration . The magazine also praised the graphics ( again noting the Blade Runner influence ) , responsive controls and enjoyable gameplay . However , the reviewer complained that the game became overly difficult after the first few missions and that the verbal instructions were easily missed . The magazine also recommended the PC version of the game over the PlayStation version due to improved graphics . 
 Previewing the game , James <unk> from GameSpot called the city environments " clean and generic " , though he noted the " Logan ’ s Run @-@ style " domes . However , he did praise the game for its weapon effects . Ultimately however , GameSpot gave both versions of the game mediocre reviews . Joe Fielder , reviewing the PlayStation version , held a mixed opinion of the game 's graphics , praising the explosions and gunfire effects while criticising the draw distance . He also derided the missions as being repetitive . Mark East praised the PC version 's graphics as " quite possibly the best looking game to hit the scene since the advent of 3D @-@ accelerator cards " and noted the " unprecedented " quality of the cut scenes . However , the reviewer complained that the game was all but unplayable without expensive hardware , particularly a 3D card . While he highly praised the graphics in addition to plot and sound , East claimed serious flaws in the gameplay , particularly the unintuitive controls and " downright ludicrous " level of difficulty .

 G @-@ Police : Weapons of Justice is the sequel to G @-@ Police , released in 1999 for the PlayStation . The game depicts the aftermath of the conflict between the G @-@ Police and Nanosoft , which involves initial battles with gangs attempting to take advantage of the colony 's instability . Later , another war arises between the G @-@ Police and a power hungry leader of Earth 's forces , originally sent to assist the G @-@ Police against the gangs . The game features additional vehicles : a VTOL spacecraft , an armoured personnel carrier and the " Raptor " — a mech with ability to leap airborne . The game received similar reviews to the original game : IGN praised its well @-@ crafted gameplay , story and sound , while GameSpot considered the controls awkward and the missions and setting repetitive . The graphics again received a mixed reception : IGN praised the attention to detail but criticised the poor draw distance , as did GameSpot . 
 In 2001 , a rumoured sequel for the PlayStation 2 was reported . The rumours later proved false however . While Sony contemplated the notion of a G @-@ Police game for the PlayStation 2 ( who had bought Psygnosis , renaming it Studio Liverpool ) , they decided that , because G @-@ Police was not as successful as other games , Studio Liverpool would instead concentrate on the Formula 1 and Wipeout franchises . Furthermore , the development team responsible for G @-@ Police and Weapons of Justice had moved on to other ventures . In 2007 , G @-@ Police was made available for download on PlayStation 3 . Computer and Video Games noted that the graphics looked poor by current standards but deemed it still enjoyable to play . 
 = Yeezus = 
 Yeezus is the sixth studio album by American rapper Kanye West . It was released on June 18 , 2013 by Def Jam Recordings . West gathered a number of artists and close collaborators for production on the album , including Mike Dean , Daft Punk , Arca , No I.D. and Hudson Mohawke . Yeezus also features vocal guest appearances from Assassin and King L , as well as previous collaborators Justin Vernon , Frank Ocean , Chief Keef , Kid Cudi and Charlie Wilson . Fifteen days before its release date , West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin to strip down the record 's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach . 
 Yeezus has been characterized as West 's most experimental and sonically abrasive work . It incorporates elements from an array of genres including industrial , acid house , dancehall , punk , electro , and Chicago drill while continuing West 's unconventional use of samples . The release features no album artwork , and the physical CD edition of the album was released in a clear jewel box with only a strip of red tape and sample credits . Initial promotion of Yeezus included worldwide video projections of the album 's music and live television performances . West released two singles from the album , the song " Black Skinhead " in July 2013 and " Bound 2 " the following month . 
 Yeezus received rave reviews from music critics , many of whom named it among West 's best work and commended its brash direction , though public response proved considerably more divided . The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 , selling 327 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of release . It topped the charts of 30 other countries , including the United Kingdom and Australia . Yeezus was nominated in two categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards , including Best Rap Album . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the release of his fifth album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ( 2010 ) , West collaborated with longtime friend Jay Z on Watch the Throne ( 2011 ) . In July 2012 , producer No I.D. revealed that he had been working on West 's sixth solo studio album ( and seventh overall ) and that it would be released after Cruel Summer ( 2012 ) , a collaborative compilation album between members of West 's record label GOOD Music . For Yeezus , West enlisted several collaborators , including Kid Cudi , Charlie Wilson , S1 , The <unk> , Mike Dean , Hudson Mohawke , Skrillex , Young Chop , Chief Keef , Frank Ocean , Odd Future , Travis Scott , The @-@ Dream , Cyhi the Prynce , Malik Yusef , King L , John Legend , James Blake , RZA , Mase and Pusha T. The album features additional vocals by Justin Vernon , Frank Ocean , Chief Keef , King L , Kid Cudi , Assassin and Charlie Wilson . 
 West was influenced primarily by minimalist design and architecture during the production of Yeezus , and visited a furniture exhibit in the Louvre five times . A single Le Corbusier lamp was his " greatest inspiration " . West worked closely with the architect Oana <unk> , and took " field trips " to Le Corbusier homes . Fascinated by <unk> 's comments on the unusual and radical nature of Corbusier design choices , West applied the situation to his own life , feeling that " visionaries can be misunderstood by their unenlightened peers . " West also met with architect Joseph <unk> and Belgian interior designer Axel <unk> , and had " rare Le Corbusier lamps , Pierre Jeanneret chairs and obscure body @-@ art journals from Switzerland " delivered to the loft . West also wanted a deep hometown influence on the album , and listened to 1980s house music most associated with his home city of Chicago for influence . Alejandro Jodorowsky 's The Holy Mountain was also an inspiration for the album . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 In 2012 , West began recording his seventh studio album with collaborators , including No I.D. and DJ Khaled . The first recordings were held in January 2013 , in the living room of his personal loft at a Paris hotel , referred to in the album 's credits as the " No Name Hotel " . West kept compositions simple in order to hear the tracks more clearly ; too much bass or complexity would simply overpower the room 's poor acoustics . The beats emanating from the loft space , which sometimes lasted through the night , provoked complaints from neighbors . Reports emerged that he and his then @-@ girlfriend Kim Kardashian had moved to the loft in order for West to begin work on the album . 
 The atmosphere in the studio was described by contributor Evian Christ as " very focused , " and West once again brought in several close collaborators . Producer Hudson Mohawke noted the inclusive " group " atmosphere of the sessions , in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces , with different elements ultimately selected from each . All involved were given a song to work on and return the next day to sit and critique , a process Anthony Kilhoffer compared to an art class . Producer Arca described being initially asked to send West music , noting that " I made sure to send maybe the strangest stuff I had , and it just so happened that Kanye was excited by that . " Describing West 's collaborative style , Arca stated : 
 It was a lot of coming up with design , like solving riddles . If the song called for something aggressive , it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was the best solution for that aggression in that moment . Everyone would approach it in completely different ways , and ultimately , it would all be edited by Kanye himself . In a weird way , he kind of produced it . Not only did he select it , but he stylized it . 
 Determined to " undermine the commercial , " several tracks were left off the finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with West 's previous material . West set parameters regarding sound and style , insisting that there be no " bass wobbles " reminiscent of dubstep . The album 's recording process was described as " very raw " by Thomas Bangalter of the French electronic duo Daft Punk , who produced four songs for the album , adding that West was " rapping – kind of screaming <unk> , actually . " While previous albums , particularly Dark Fantasy , took considerable time in the studio , Yeezus was described by Kilhoffer as " the fastest record we ever made . " In May 2013 , Def Jam executives listened to the " final product , " ( only later to be changed ) describing the album as " dark . " 
 W writer Christopher Bagley reports that West 's creative process often bordered on perfectionist . In March 2013 , West described the album to Bagley as near completion , only to revise this statement one month later to " [ the album is ] only 30 percent complete . " West made several last @-@ minute alterations to Yeezus , enlisting the co @-@ founder of Def Jam Recordings , Rick Rubin , as an executive producer for additional recording mere days before its release ; changes included re @-@ recording whole songs and rewriting entire verses . The rough cut West played Rubin ran nearly three and a half hours long . West 's orders to Rubin were to take the music in a " stripped @-@ down minimal direction " , often removing elements already recorded . 
 For several days in late May and early June 2013 , West and a " rotating group of intimates , collaborators and hangers @-@ on " holed up at Rubin 's Shangri @-@ La Studio in Malibu in service of completing the record . Rubin thought it impossible to meet the deadline and all involved ended up working long hours with no days off in order to complete the record . West had intended the album be 16 tracks until Rubin suggested cutting the album down to fewer tracks . Rubin gave as example " Bound " , which was " a more middle of the road R & B song , done in an adult contemporary style " before Kanye decided to replace the musical backing with a minimalistic sample , " a single note baseline in the hook which we processed to have a punk edge in the Suicide tradition . " Two days before the album had to be delivered to the label , West wrote and sung lyrics to two songs while also recording the vocals to three others in just two hours . Rubin also suggested to reduce the album from sixteen songs to just ten , saying the others could be reserved for a follow @-@ up . 
 = = Music and composition = = 
 According to Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot , Yeezus is a " hostile , abrasive and intentionally off @-@ putting " album that combines " the worlds of " 1980s Chicago acid @-@ house and 2013 Chicago drill music , 1990s industrial music , and the " avant @-@ rap " of Saul Williams , Death Grips and Odd Future . Slant Magazine critic Ted Scheinman described the album as " built on alien , angular beats , slowly morphing drones and sirens , abrupt periods of silence , and a pulse @-@ quickening style of delivery from Yeezy himself , " writing that West <unk> the " notion of what kind of music ( or noise ) can underpin hip @-@ hop . " According to Charles Aaron of Spin , Yeezus is " a hip hop album , not a rap album " , because of how its sounds and subject matter are assembled together , and although listeners can hear " ' punk ' or ' post @-@ punk ' or ' industrial ' " throughout , " hip @-@ hop has always been about noise and dissonance and dance music as agitation " . The album also incorporates elements of industrial and trap music . The record " most closely resembles " 1990s industrial rock , during which the genre had a significant pop culture impact , with artists such as Nine Inch Nails , Ministry , and Marilyn Manson gaining success . The industrial scene created a " vast global underground community , " and Esquire notes that one of its epicenters was in Chicago , where West was raised . Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club characterized its opening series of songs as electro and industrial hip hop . West , himself would later go onto describe the sound of the album as " a protest to music " 
 Yeezus is primarily electronic in nature , and boasts distorted drum machines and " synthesizers that sound like they 're malfunctioning , low @-@ resolution samplers that add a pixelated digital aura to the most analog sounds . " To this end , the album incorporates glitches reminiscent of CD skips or corrupted MP3 's , and Auto @-@ Tuned vocals are modulated to a point in which they are difficult to decipher . Esquire cites " On Sight " as an early example of the album 's connection to electronic music , citing its " droning synthesizer tone , " which is " modulated until the signal starts throwing off harshly treble @-@ heavy spikes and begins to clip , as if it were overloading a digital audio processor . " 
 Yeezus continues West 's practice of eclectic samples : he employs an obscure Hindi sample on " I Am a God " , and a sample of 1970s Hungarian rock group Omega on " New Slaves " . " On Sight " interpolates a melody from " Sermon ( He 'll Give Us What We Really Need ) " by the Holy Name of Mary Choral Family , although the track originally sampled an old vocal track from the original recording . As late as a week prior to release , lawyers were forced to track down the choir director and members of the choir on the South Side of Chicago in order to get clearance for such a sample . Def Jam executives were significantly worried enough the deal would not be in place in time for the record 's deadline , and producers re @-@ recorded the vocals with a new choir as the sample could not be cleared in enough time . " Bound 2 " features heavy soul music samples and has been described as the only song on Yeezus which recalls the sound of West 's early work . " Bound " , a 1971 song by American soul group Ponderosa Twins Plus One from their album 2 + 2 + 1 = Ponderosa Twins Plus One , serves as the primary sample used in West 's track . 
 The album 's second track " Black Skinhead " has alternately been called an industrial hip hop song and " a galloping punk @-@ rap manifesto " . " I Am a God " was inspired by a " diss " from a major fashion designer , who informed West of his invitation to a widely anticipated runway show on the condition he agree to not attend other shows . " I 'm in It " began with a different sample and melody , but West removed the sample and Rubin edited the track down from a six @-@ minute arrangement . " Blood on the Leaves , " which samples Nina Simone 's 1965 rendition of " Strange Fruit " and was the first track in the first incarnation of the track list , is an example of West 's signature dichotomy in which he melds the sacred and profane . " Strange Fruit " , first recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939 , brought the lynchings of black Americans to a " startling poignancy , " creating " one of the most towering , important songs of the 20th century . " West 's anthemic re @-@ telling instead details an MDMA @-@ fueled hookup and the perils of fame . 
 = = Promotion and release = = 
 On May 1 , 2013 , West used the social networking site Twitter to post a single message reading " June Eighteen " , leading several media outlets to speculate that the post referred to the release date of West 's upcoming album . On May 17 , he began promotion of the album by unveiling the previously unreleased song " New Slaves " through video projections in 66 assorted locations . The following day , West appeared on the American late @-@ night live television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live and performed the songs " New Slaves " and " Black Skinhead " . He subsequently revealed the album 's cover and title , Yeezus , on his official website . The iTunes Store made Yeezus available for pre @-@ order on May 20 , but the listing was subsequently taken down for unknown reasons . On May 29 , <unk> founder Jean <unk> unveiled an advertisement for Yeezus which stated that the album would not be available for pre @-@ order . Speaking about the album 's minimal promotion , West stated : " With this album , we ain 't drop no single to radio . We ain 't got no NBA campaign , nothing like that . Shit , we ain 't even got no cover . We just made some real music . " 
 The physical CD edition of Yeezus was released in a clear jewel box with no album artwork , reflecting the minimalist tone . The packaging consists of little more than a piece of red tape and a sticker affixed to the back , with sample credits and the album 's UPC . Other versions of this release have different colors of stickers , with green , yellow and orange being some of the other colors . The front is affixed with a Parental Advisory label . The Source pointed out a resemblance between the Yeezus CD packaging and a packaging concept designed for the single " Crystal " by the English band New Order in 2001 . 
 Def Jam confirmed in late June 2013 that " Black Skinhead " would be serviced to American radio as the album 's first single on July 2 , 2013 and that a music video for the track was being produced . It was officially released to radio in the United Kingdom on June 19 . The song peaked at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and 34 on the UK Singles Chart . In August 2013 , it was revealed that " Bound 2 " would be released as the second single from Yeezus . " Bound 2 " features vocals from American soul singer Charlie Wilson and incorporates numerous samples into its production , including prominent elements of the song " Bound " ( 1971 ) by soul group Ponderosa Twins Plus One . " Bound 2 " received general acclaim from music critics , who referred to the song as one of the highlights of the album and compared its soul sample @-@ based production to West 's early work from his debut studio album The College Dropout . The song has since peaked at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart . In November 2013 , producer Hudson Mohawke revealed that " Blood on the Leaves " would serve as the album 's third single . West subsequently made the announcement in an interview on New York 's 92 @.@ 3 NOW . 
 On September 6 , 2013 , Kanye West announced The Yeezus Tour , a North American tour to take place between October 19 through December 7 , 2013 . The tour was marketed as his " first solo tour in 5 years " , and featured Kendrick Lamar , Pusha T , A Tribe Called Quest and Travis Scott as a supporting acts . On October 30 , 2013 while on the road to Vancouver , a truck carrying custom @-@ made video screens and equipment for the show was involved in a car accident , the crash damaged the equipment beyond repair . The tour resumed on November 16 , 2013 , at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia . The missed Chicago and Detroit shows were rescheduled however , the rest of the missed dates were cancelled , Def Jam cited routing logistics as the reason .

 Within one day of availability on the iTunes Store , Yeezus topped sales in the UK , Canada , Australia and Germany , while remaining at number two in the United States behind J. Cole 's Born Sinner . Yeezus debuted at number one in 31 countries , while also landing top five spots in 20 more charts . It would eventually have chart @-@ topping performances in the United Kingdom , where Yeezus debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart on downloads alone , making the album West 's first number one on that chart since Graduation in 2007 , and Australia , where it became West 's first album to top the ARIA Charts . 
 Yeezus debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart , selling 327 @,@ 000 copies in the United States in its first week . The album failed to reach the 500 @,@ 000 sales projections , and marked West 's lowest solo opening week sales in the US . However , it still had the third @-@ best first week sales of 2013 at the time of its release and the best first week sales by a hip hop album since Drake 's 2011 album Take Care . The second @-@ week sales saw the album fall dramatically : although it still ended at number three on the chart , sales dropped by 80 % to 65 @,@ 000 units , making Yeezus the largest second @-@ week percentage drop for a number one @-@ debuting album in 2012 – 13 and the fourth @-@ largest for a number one @-@ bowing album in the SoundScan era . Billboard 's Keith Caulfield attributed the diminished figures to the non @-@ traditional marketing , considering that the lack of singles and public appearances led the album to find " difficulty in sustaining its momentum " . On August 12 , 2013 , The album was certified gold for sales of over 500 @,@ 000 copies .

 Public reaction to Yeezus , including its unorthodox and deliberate lack of promotion as well as its brash and aggressive sound , was mixed . Yeezus was noted as one of the most anticipated releases of 2013 by major publications , but the lack of a major radio single was regarded as a risky move . Regardless , radio stations have still played tracks from Yeezus on air , despite it being a departure from the normal playlists found on hip @-@ hop stations . " When I listen to radio , that ain 't where I wanna be no more , " stated West at his headlining June 9 , 2013 Governor 's Ball performance , where he unveiled several tracks from the record for the first time . Rolling Stone summarized the audience 's response : " Half the crowd cheered , half almost audibly rolled their eyes . " 
 West 's June 11 interview with Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was similarly viewed with a mixed reaction , with many outlets mocking West 's seemingly vain statements . In the article , West compares himself to Apple co @-@ founder Steve Jobs and refers to himself as " the nucleus of all society . " 
 Within four days prior to the release , Yeezus was leaked online . The New York Times wrote that the leak " stirred up a Twitter frenzy " and received widespread media coverage . The Washington Post commented on the significance of the leak : " Kanye West ’ s new album didn ’ t leak online over the weekend . It gushed out into the pop ecosystem like a million barrels of renegade crude — ominous , mesmerizing and of great consequence . " Critics were very kind to Yeezus regarding critical reviews , but others viewed the release as " musical and commercial suicide , " and " fans live @-@ blogged their own befuddlement on Twitter and Facebook . " The New Yorker 's Sasha Frere @-@ Jones suggests that Yeezus may be preferred over any of West 's previous works in coming decades by a new generation due to the " lean vibrancy " of the album . " One of the most fascinating aspects of Yeezus ' arrival is the discursive crisis it 's caused , produced by a fast @-@ react culture colliding with a work of art so confounding , " wrote The Atlantic columnist Jack Hamilton . 
 West was criticized by the UK and US Parkinson 's Disease Associations for controversial lyrics in lead @-@ song " On Sight " . In February 2014 , English singer Lily Allen announced that she would title her third studio album <unk> . In an interview with Australian radio station Nova , Allen stated that she is terrified that West would think it 's " a diss rather than a tribute . " She said that she thinks West is brilliant and praised him for speaking his mind all the time . Jack White , a vocal advocate of analog recording , remarked that the album " is obviously recorded on Pro Tools but sounds unbelievable , because it is very simple and there aren 't a lot of components going on , and this really allows the songs to shine . Plus he mixed using analogue components . "

 Yeezus received widespread acclaim from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 84 , based on 46 reviews . In The Guardian , lead critic Alexis Petridis found it " noisy , gripping , maddening , potent " , while Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph said it was " the most exciting album " she had heard in some time . Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone called it a " brilliant , obsessive @-@ compulsive career auto @-@ correct " that made other abrasive records by " mad geniuses " , such as In Utero by Nirvana and Radiohead 's Kid A , seem tame by comparison . Pitchfork Media critic Ryan Dombal viewed it as a " razor @-@ sharpened take " on West 's fourth album , 808s & Heartbreak , concluding that " cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on Yeezus , perhaps more than any other Kanye album . Each fluorescent strike of noise , incongruous tempo flip , and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the album 's fast 40 minutes . " Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt it was his most ambitious piece of music yet , and Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said it was his most uninhibited record : " Even by the standards of an artist who reinvents himself with each release , it 's a drastic departure " . In the opinion of AllMusic 's David Jeffries , the album was an " extravagant stunt with the high @-@ art packed in , offering an eccentric , audacious , and gripping experience that 's vital and truly unlike anything else . " Rock artist Lou Reed reviewed Yeezus shortly before his death , describing it as " majestic and inspiring ... no one 's near doing what [ West ] ' s doing , it 's not even on the same planet . " 
 In a less enthusiastic review for The New York Times , Jon Pareles felt West 's innovative transfiguration of his music , with unrefined electronica and drill elements , was undermined by his distasteful lyrics and appropriation of 1960s civil rights slogans " to his own celebrity or to bedroom exploits " . Robert Christgau , writing for The Barnes & Noble Review , said the combination of harsh rock and hip hop sounds on Yeezus was as bold as Public Enemy 's music during the 1980s , but found West 's lyrics grotesquely off @-@ putting : " He 's wordsmith enough to insure that his sexist imagery is very hard to take . " Chris Richards from The Washington Post found West 's lyricism to be perhaps " his least compelling " yet and " drunk on bitterness " , while Slant Magazine critic Ted Scheinman believed West was struggling to reinvent himself thematically and " seeking social @-@ commentary cred that he hasn 't earned . " Tiny Mix Tapes described the album as " a nebulous , dense , paranoid web of utterly unfiltered expression that ’ s utterly or negligibly fascinating depending on how much you care about Yeezy .

 Based on 146 individual year @-@ end top ten lists compiled by Metacritic , Yeezus was the most critically acclaimed album of 2013 , appearing on 61 lists and being named first on 18 of them . In October 2013 , Complex named Yeezus the sixth best hip hop album of the last five years . Yeezus was rated as album of the year by nine publications . Spin named it the best album of 2013 , writing , " Yeezus was a thorny <unk> puzzle of boxy headbanger <unk> that exemplified a year of equally stripped @-@ down , basal pleasures . " The A.V. Club named it the best album of 2013 saying " It ’ s magnificent , and it sounds like absolutely nothing else . " Rolling Stone named it the second best album of 2013 , comparing it in concept to Reed 's polarizing 1975 album Metal Machine Music : " No wonder the late , great Lou Reed embraced Yeezus , since it 's basically the Metal Machine Music concept translated into futuristic hip @-@ hop , all industrial overload and <unk> <unk> and hostile vibes . " Exclaim ! also named it the hip hop album of the year . NME named it the second best album of the year calling it " his most sonically challenging album to date . " Stereogum , TIME and Complex also named Yeezus the best album of 2013 . It was also nominated in two categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards including for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for " New Slaves " . West responded unfavorably to this due to not receiving more nominations . He then addressed the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at one of his concerts and referred to it as patronizing . 
 The Pitchfork online music publication ranked Yeezus in the eighth position of a list of the best 100 albums of the decade " so far " — between 2010 and 2014 — on August 19 , 2014 . In January 2014 , Yeezus was named the best album of 2013 by The Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop annual critics ' poll ; this is the fourth instance that a Kanye West album has topped the poll , after The College Dropout , Late Registration , and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2004 , 2005 , and 2010 , respectively . On the same poll for singles , " Bound 2 " , " New Slaves " , and " Black Skinhead " were ranked in the top 10 .

 = Darmstadtium = 
 Darmstadtium is a chemical element with symbol Ds and atomic number 110 . It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element . The most stable known isotope , darmstadtium @-@ 281 , has a half @-@ life of approximately 10 seconds . Darmstadtium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near the city of Darmstadt , Germany , after which it was named . 
 In the periodic table , it is a d @-@ block transactinide element . It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 10 elements , although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to platinum in group 10 . Darmstadtium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues , nickel , palladium , and platinum . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Darmstadtium was first created on November 9 , 1994 , at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research ( Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung , GSI ) in Darmstadt , Germany , by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg , under the direction of Sigurd Hofmann . The team bombarded a lead @-@ 208 target with accelerated nuclei of nickel @-@ 62 in a heavy ion accelerator and detected a single atom of the isotope darmstadtium @-@ 269 : 
 208 
 82Pb + 62 
 28Ni → 269 
 <unk> + 1 
 0n 
 In the same series of experiments , the same team also carried out the reaction using heavier nickel @-@ 64 ions . During two runs , 9 atoms of 271Ds were convincingly detected by correlation with known daughter decay properties : 
 208 
 82Pb + 64 
 28Ni → 271 
 <unk> + 1 
 0n 
 Prior to this , there had been failed synthesis attempts in 1986 – 7 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna ( then in the Soviet Union ) and in 1990 at the GSI . The IUPAC / IUPAP Joint Working Party ( JWP ) recognised the GSI team as discoverers in their 2001 report . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Using Mendeleev 's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements , darmstadtium should be known as eka @-@ platinum . In 1979 , IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called <unk> ( with the corresponding symbol of <unk> ) , a systematic element name as a placeholder , until the element was discovered ( and the discovery then confirmed ) and a permanent name was decided on . Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels , from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks , the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field , who called it " element 110 " , with the symbol of ( 110 ) or even simply 110 . 
 The name darmstadtium ( Ds ) was suggested by the GSI team in honor of the city of Darmstadt , where the element was discovered . The GSI team originally also considered naming the element <unk> , after the suburb of Darmstadt known as <unk> where the element was discovered , but eventually decided on darmstadtium . The new name was officially recommended by IUPAC on August 16 , 2003 . 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 For a detailed list of information on the discovery of each individual darmstadtium isotope , see isotopes of darmstadtium . 
 Darmstadtium has no stable or naturally @-@ occurring isotopes . Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory , either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements . Eight different isotopes of darmstadtium have been reported with atomic masses 267 , 269 – 271 , 273 , 277 , 279 , and 281 , although darmstadtium @-@ 267 is unconfirmed . Three darmstadtium isotopes , darmstadtium @-@ 270 , darmstadtium @-@ 271 , and darmstadtium @-@ 281 , have known metastable states ( although that of darmstadtium @-@ 281 is unconfirmed ) . Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay , but some undergo spontaneous fission . 
 = = = Stability and half @-@ lives = = = 
 All darmstadtium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive ; in general , the heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter . The most stable known darmstadtium isotope , <unk> , is also the heaviest known darmstadtium isotope ; it has a half @-@ life of 11 seconds , although a metastable state , <unk> , has been reported to have a longer half @-@ life of about 3 @.@ 7 minutes . The isotope <unk> has a half @-@ life of 0 @.@ 18 seconds respectively . The remaining six isotopes and two metastable states have half @-@ lives between 1 microsecond and 70 milliseconds . Some unknown isotopes in this region , such as 272Ds , 274 – <unk> , and <unk> , are predicted to also have rather long half @-@ lives of a few seconds . Before its discovery , 277Ds was predicted to have a half @-@ life of around 5 seconds , but it has since been found to have a half @-@ life of only 5 @.@ 7 milliseconds . 
 The undiscovered isotope <unk> has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay ; however , no known darmstadtium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay . Theoretical calculation in a quantum tunneling model reproduces the experimental alpha decay half @-@ life data for the known darmstadtium isotopes . It also predicts that the undiscovered isotope <unk> , which has a magic number of neutrons ( 184 ) , would have an alpha decay half @-@ life on the order of 311 years : exactly the same approach as for this latter case also predicts a ~ 3 @,@ 500 year half life for the non @-@ <unk> magic <unk> isotope , however .

 Darmstadtium is the eighth member of the 6d series of transition metals . Since copernicium ( element 112 ) has been shown to be a transition metal , it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would form a fourth transition metal series , with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal . Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum , thus implying that darmstadtium 's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements , nickel , palladium , and platinum . 
 Prediction of the probable chemical properties of darmstadtium has not received much attention recently . Darmstadtium is expected to be a noble metal . Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 10 elements , the most stable oxidation states of darmstadtium are predicted to be the + 6 , + 4 , and + 2 states ; however , the neutral state is predicted to be the most stable in aqueous solutions . In comparison , only palladium and platinum are known to show the maximum oxidation state in the group , + 6 , while the most stable states are + 4 and + 2 for both nickel and palladium . It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium ( element 107 ) to darmstadtium ( element 110 ) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution . Darmstadtium hexafluoride ( <unk> ) is predicted to have very similar properties to its lighter homologue platinum hexafluoride ( PtF6 ) , having very similar electronic structures and ionization potentials . It is also expected to have the same octahedral molecular geometry as PtF6 . Other predicted darmstadtium compounds are darmstadtium carbide ( <unk> ) and darmstadtium tetrachloride ( <unk> ) , both of which are expected to behave like their lighter homologues . 
 = = = Physical and atomic = = = 
 Darmstadtium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body @-@ centered cubic structure , unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face @-@ centered cubic structure , because it is expected to have different electron charge densities from them . It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34 @.@ 8 g / cm3 . In comparison , the densest known element that has had its density measured , osmium , has a density of only 22 @.@ 61 g / cm3 . This results from darmstadtium 's high atomic weight , the lanthanide and actinide contractions , and relativistic effects , although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical , and the sample would quickly decay . 
 The outer electron configuration of darmstadtium is calculated to be <unk> , which obeys the Aufbau principle and does not follow platinum 's outer electron configuration of <unk> . This is due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s2 electron pair over the whole seventh period , so that none of the elements from 104 to 112 are expected to have electron configurations violating the Aufbau principle . The atomic radius of darmstadtium is expected to be around 132 pm . 
 = = Experimental chemistry = = 
 Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of darmstadtium has yet to have been established due to the short half @-@ lives of darmstadtium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale . One of the few darmstadtium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is darmstadtium hexafluoride ( <unk> 
 6 ) , as its lighter homologue platinum hexafluoride ( <unk> 
 6 ) is volatile above 60 ° C and therefore the analogous compound of darmstadtium might also be sufficiently volatile ; a volatile <unk> ( <unk> 
 8 ) might also be possible . For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide , at least four atoms must be produced , the half @-@ life of the isotope used must be at least 1 second , and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week . Even though the half @-@ life of <unk> , the most stable confirmed darmstadtium isotope , is 11 seconds , long enough to perform chemical studies , another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of darmstadtium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained . Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the darmstadtium isotopes and automated systems can then experiment on the gas @-@ phase and solution chemistry of darmstadtium as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements ; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused . However , the experimental chemistry of darmstadtium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium . 
 The more neutron @-@ rich darmstadtium isotopes are the most stable and are thus more promising for chemical studies ; however , they can only be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements , and indirect synthesis methods are not favourable for chemical studies . The more neutron @-@ rich isotopes <unk> and 277Ds might be produced directly in the reaction between thorium @-@ 232 and calcium @-@ 48 , but the yield is expected to be low . Furthermore , this reaction has already been tested without success , and more recent experiments that have successfully synthesized 277Ds using indirect methods show that it has a short half @-@ life of 5 @.@ 7 ms , not long enough to perform chemical studies . 
 = Requiem ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Requiem " is the twenty @-@ second episode and the finale of the seventh season the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files , and the show 's 161st episode overall . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on May 21 , 2000 . The episode was written by Chris Carter , and directed by Kim Manners . The episode helped to explore the series ' overarching mythology . " Requiem " earned a Nielsen household rating of 8 @.@ 9 , being watched by 15 @.@ 26 million viewers in its initial broadcast . The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics . Many applauded the way it made the series ' increasingly marginalized alien mythology relevant again , although others lamented the partial loss of David Duchovny . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully return to the site of their first investigation together when a series of abductions take place . However , Scully 's failing health , and Mulder 's concern that she is in danger , cause him to take her off the case . Meanwhile , the Cigarette @-@ Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) — on his deathbed — reunites with Marita Covarrubias ( Laurie Holden ) and Alex Krycek in an attempt to revive the project . 
 " Requiem " was a story milestone for the series , featuring the alien abduction of Mulder . Mulder would appear sporadically in the next few seasons , only returning for about half of the episodes in season eight and only two episodes in season nine . Prior to being picked up for another season , however , many believed that the episode would serve as the series finale . As such , many elements from the show 's pilot episode were brought in to bring the show closure and help it segue into a movie franchise . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Bellefleur , Oregon , Detective Miles drives to the scene of a reported air crash in the forest . As Miles arrives , his car 's electricity cuts out , causing it to crash . After exiting the vehicle , an injured Miles finds his deputy sheriff , Ray Hoese , unconscious in his police cruiser . Miles is suddenly confronted by a man identical to Hoese who is bleeding green fluid , indicating he is an Alien Bounty Hunter . 
 Later , in Tunisia , Marita Covarrubias arranges for the release of Alex Krycek from a penal colony . Upon returning to the United States , the two meet with the wheelchair @-@ bound Smoking Man , who tells them that an alien craft has crashed in Oregon . The Smoking Man sees the crash as a chance to rebuild the Project , but claims that finding it will be complicated . 
 In Oregon , two teenage boys ( Gary and Richie ) are exploring the crash site when they encounter Deputy Miles , who denies any crash or the fire that was reported in the area . While they go through the area on their own , Gary is lifted off the ground and shaken like a rag doll by an invisible force , and Richie , although he stands within a few feet of him , can 't see him . Meanwhile , in Washington , Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles , an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior . The younger Miles tells him about Hoese 's disappearance , and his concern that the abductions have begun again . 
 The following morning , Mulder and Dana Scully arrive in Bellefleur , where they investigate the road where the incidents took place . Upon meeting Billy , they find he has become a local police officer . The agents also meet " Detective Miles " , unaware that he is a disguised Bounty Hunter who has killed Billy 's father . At the scene of Hoese 's disappearance , Scully finds three bullet casings , indicating that the deputy fired his weapon before vanishing . The agents later speak with Hoese 's wife and are surprised when she is revealed to be Theresa Nemman , one of the other 1993 abductees . Later , while going through case files , Scully becomes ill . 
 That night , Theresa is awakened by someone at her door . Mulder and Scully arrive at Theresa 's house to find it being investigated by police , with Billy informing them that Theresa was taken in the night and that nobody knows what happened . Scully suddenly feels nauseous , much to Billy 's concern , but she quickly shakes it off . Later , while investigating the reported crash site , Scully is lifted and shaken just as Gary was . Mulder finds her nearly passed out on the ground . 
 At the Miles family home , Billy , now highly suspicious , enters and pulls his gun on the man who appears to be his father . After the confrontation , Billy relinquishes his gun , at which point the other man physically morphs and reveals himself to be the Alien Bounty Hunter . At that point , Mulder and Scully pull up and walk into the house , unable to locate Billy or his father . 
 When the agents return to Washington , Walter Skinner approaches Mulder and Scully in their office , where they are joined by Marita and Krycek . Marita reveals that the Smoking Man is dying and that he wants to find the UFO in Oregon to restart the Project . Krycek informs them that the UFO is hidden behind an energy field . The group , along with the Lone Gunmen , find evidence pinpointing the UFO 's location . Mulder makes it clear to Scully that he is concerned for her health and refuses to let her accompany him back to Oregon . <unk> his concern , Scully refuses to let Mulder return alone ; Skinner accompanies Mulder instead . 
 While investigating the incident back in Washington , Scully and The Lone Gunmen find evidence that it was Mulder , not Scully , who would be in danger at the Oregon abduction site . However , immediately upon discovering this , Scully is taken ill , and The Lone Gunmen have her rushed to the hospital . 
 Returning to Oregon , Mulder and Skinner travel to the woods , equipped with lasers for finding the UFO . Noticing a spot where the lasers cease in mid @-@ air , Mulder walks through the force field . He finds and joins a group of abductees , including Billy and Theresa , standing below a pillar of light from a UFO ; they are soon accosted by the Bounty Hunter . Mulder is abducted with the group while a stunned Skinner witnesses the UFO 's departure . 
 At the Watergate , Krycek and Marita come to visit the Smoking Man , who is already aware of his plan 's failure but is resigned to his fate . With Marita holding back his assistant , Krycek wheels the Smoking Man out of the room and throws him down a flight of stairs , presumably killing him . After being hospitalized , Scully tells Skinner that , although she cannot understand it — and that it is important that he keep it secret — she is pregnant .

 = = = Background and writing = = = 
 " Requiem " was written by series creator Chris Carter . While filming was underway for the seventh season , many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season . Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained that " there was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day . " As the season progressed , however , the idea of producing another season emerged . Paul Rabwin explained that , " we found ourselves starting to get energized again . [ ... ] As we got toward the end of the season , everyone was kind of hopeful . " 
 As such , when it came time to pen " Requiem " , the producers found themselves at a crossroads . There were several ideas that were discussed on how to deal with the episode . The first idea was that " Requiem " could serve a series finale . Another idea that emerged was that the episode could function as either a cliffhanger for an eighth season or an X @-@ Files movie . During the drafting of the script , there were also talks of crafting a two @-@ hour episode , but these ideas were quickly discarded . The ending scene , featuring Scully revealing that she is pregnant , was written the day before it was filmed . Carter held it back because he did not want " the cat to get out of the bag . " This decision was made to prevent leaks and spoilers on the internet . 
 The episode attempted to bring closure to several aspects of the series . In one sequence , Alex Krycek throws The Smoking Man down a flight of stairs , presumably to his death . Nicholas Lea , the actor who portrayed Krycek , noted : " That 's one of the character 's great moments , when I get to push Bill Davis down a set of stairs . In a sense , he has nothing to lose because his life 's burned out . So death doesn 't have the same terror that it would to a young happy chap . " The episode also featured several tender moments between Mulder and Scully , which many fans found " nearly pornographic in the context of their long , chaste courtship " , according to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X @-@ Files . Gillian Anderson , however , defended the moments , arguing that there was ample amount of romance between Mulder and Scully prior to " Requiem " . 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 Because there was still a chance that the seventh season may have been the show 's last , the character of Billy Miles , played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode , was brought back in and featured in " Requiem " to bring the series full @-@ circle . Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well . After the conclusion of the episode , David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series . He explained , " I was kind of a free agent after season seven , and to me , there was not much else to do in terms of the character . So it was really about me wanting to pursue other parts of my career as a writer , director , and actor . " Rumors began spreading — and were eventually confirmed — that , since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season , that another character would take Mulder 's place . Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi , who portrayed Walter Skinner , would take the role ; Pileggi later called this guess " ridiculous . " 
 The episode was directed by Kim Manners . Manners originally thought that Chris Carter would have wanted to direct the episode , in case the episode would have been the show 's last . Originally , Carter planned on it , but eventually relented and asked Manners to direct the episode . Manners later noted that he felt " very honored " by this gesture . Principal shooting for the episode began on April 20 , 2000 on Soundstage 5 at the Twentieth Century Fox lot . Filming at the studio ended on Day 4 , and subsequently , the cast and crew relocated to the mountains resort Big Bear , located near Big Bear Lake , California . The forests around the area provided an " ideal backdrop " for the bulk of the episode , which was supposed to take place in Oregon ; the setting for both " Requiem " and the series pilot were supposed to take place in the same fictional city , Bellefleur . However , in the pilot , the outdoor scenes had originally been shot on location in Lynn Valley in North Vancouver , British Columbia , in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve — formerly known as the Seymour Demonstration Forest . Since production had moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles after the conclusion of the fifth season , a local California location was needed to stand in for Oregon . 
 The episode featured several elaborate effects , created through both digital and physical means . The scene wherein Scully encounters the alien forcefield was created by means of using a harness that hoisted Anderson into the air . Special effects producer Bill Millar created many of the special effects for the episode — including shots of the alien craft as well as its interaction with people — in a building in Big Bear . The episode contains a shot of Detective Miles morphing into the alien bounty hunter . In order to create the scene , various shots of Leon Russom and Brian Thompson were spliced together via blue screen technology . Producer Paul Rabwin called the shot " one of the best morphs we 've ever done . " 
 = = Themes = = 
 " Requiem " explores Mulder 's desire to leave his pursuit of the truth behind him . Michelle Bush , in her book Myth @-@ X notes that the episode 's theme , in a colloquial sense , is Mulder 's " realization that maybe it 's time to get out of the car " . The irony of the episode , however , is that as soon as Mulder discovers absolute proof of alien life , he is subsequently abducted and taken away . 
 While in Skinner 's office , the camera angles and position of the characters reveals that the scene is intended to be a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci 's famous painting The Last Supper . Skinner is standing in Saint Peter 's spot , and Scully is standing in Judas Iscariot 's place . Bush argues that , in this manner , the show is suggesting that Scully , like Judas , directly affects the fate of the savior , in this case Mulder . She notes that Scully 's actions result in a fate that " could not be realized without her participation " . This is not the first time Scully has been compared to Judas in the show : the previous seventh season episode " The Sixth Extinction II : Amor Fati " — which is heavily based on Nikos Kazantzakis 's novel The Last Temptation of Christ — features Scully in a role with direct literary parallels to Kazantzakis 's heroic interpretation of Judas .

 The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " . He argued that the episode was " the best season finale cliffhanger the show ever did " , and compared it to the second season finale " Anasazi " ; he noted that while the latter episode was " pretty amazing " , " Requiem " has " a finality " to it and a " sense that nothing will ever be the same " that made its cliffhanger ending work . VanDerWerff also wrote that the nods to the pilot episode helped to show how far the series had evolved in seven years . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations , gave the episode a largely positive review . Despite lamenting the loss of Fox Mulder , he noted that " the truth is The X @-@ Files has been a show like no other and ' Requiem ' proved once again there truly is a place for magic and beauty and love on the small screen and I am delighted to have witnessed it for seven seasons now . " Kessenich later named the episode one of the " Top 25 Episode of All Time " of The X @-@ Files , ranking it at number 20 . 
 Kenneth Silber from Space.com called the episode " intriguing " and felt that while " The X @-@ Files " foundered " for a large portion of its seventh season , " Requiem " marked " a much @-@ needed return to that mythology , " and that it set " the stage for what might be an interesting eighth season . " Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that " A lot of characters out of the woodwork come back for the season @-@ ending cliffhanger [ ... ] But that 's all window @-@ dressing for a trio of big surprises that wrap up Season 7 , in what many consider the show 's death knell , or perhaps just a proper ending . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five . The two noted that , despite the fact that it capped @-@ off a " lacklustre [ sic ] " season , the episode still managed to provide a good enough cliffhanger to hold fans until the premiere of the eighth season . Shearman and Pearson further noted that " against the odds , after all the disappointments of the year , ' Requiem ' is strong enough to leave its audience wanting more . " 
 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four . Despite noting that the episode was " the best mytharc episode and season finale in years " , she called the episode 's finale " one of the most egregious missteps yet in The X @-@ Files mythology " . 
 = Spooks ( series 3 ) = 
 The third series of the British spy drama television series Spooks ( known as MI @-@ 5 in the United States ) began broadcasting on 11 October 2004 on BBC One , before ending on 13 December 2004 . It consists of ten episodes which continue to follow the actions of Section B , a counter @-@ terrorism division of the British Security Services ( MI5 ) . It also sees the departure of three principal characters : Tom Quinn ( Matthew Macfadyen ) is decommissioned in the second episode , Zoe Reynolds ( Keeley Hawes ) is exiled to Chile in the sixth episode , and Danny Hunter ( David Oyelowo ) is killed in the series finale . In addition to Macfadyen , Hawes and Oyelowo , Peter Firth , Rupert Penry @-@ Jones , Nicola Walker , Hugh Simon , Shauna Macdonald and Rory MacGregor are listed as the main cast . 
 Though the producers knew that <unk> would leave the series , they did not know when he would do so , and so the first two episodes were initially written without him . In either case , the producers created a new character , Adam Carter . In addition , the writers heavily researched the episodes ; many of the story lines are based on truth . The producers also took information from advisors who were ex @-@ MI5 officers . The series was directed in five blocks of two episodes in each . Filming started in January 2004 and took place over six to seven months . Shooting took place almost entirely in London , England , with some scenes shot in a cross @-@ English Channel ferry in the fifth episode . 
 The third series was seen by an average of 5 @.@ 77 million viewers , a decline in ratings from the second series with viewership dropping below five million at one point . However the BBC had renewed Spooks for a fourth series before the third had begun broadcasting . Critical reaction was generally positive , though reviewers believed it did not perform as well as its preceding seasons . It was nominated for seven British Academy Television Awards ( BAFTA ) , winning one . The third series was released on DVD on 23 May 2005 in Region 4 , 5 September 2005 in Region 2 , and 31 January 2006 in Region 1 .

 The third series includes nine main cast members . Matthew Macfadyen returns as Tom Quinn in the first two episodes . Macfadyen intended to leave the series as he felt " your senses get dull doing a long @-@ running TV show . " As the producers were storylining the third series , they were " 99 per cent sure " Macfadyen would not return until they heard he wanted to come back for two episodes because he did not want to leave the series so soon . Keeley Hawes also returns in the series as Zoe Reynolds . Hawes wanted to leave the series also after the first six episodes . David Oyelowo makes a return as Danny Hunter . After Tom 's exit , it allowed Danny 's character to develop further . Oyelowo also announced his intention to leave the series , after the finale episode . Peter Firth returns as superior Harry Pearce . After two seasons , Firth attempted to lighten Harry up " a little bit " after his mother suggested the character " smile more , " despite the fact that Harry is a serious man . Nicola Walker returns as Ruth Evershed . First appearing in the second series , Walker felt more like the " new girl , " but felt more experienced upon her return to the third . Shauna Macdonald also returns as Sam Buxton . The five @-@ month filming gap between series two and three left Macdonald " a bit de @-@ <unk> " as she was more focused on her film career . Hugh Simon and Rory MacGregor returns as Malcolm Wynn @-@ Jones , and Colin Wells , respectively . 
 When the producers knew Macfadyen would leave , the producers decided to introduce new cast members , one of which was Rupert Penry @-@ Jones as Adam Carter , the new protagonist . Early on in the creation of Adam , the producers had an interest in casting Penry @-@ Jones for the role ; however , it took the actor three auditions until the producers finally decided to cast him . Unlike Tom , Adam would have a different character dynamic ; he has an MI6 background , and is married . A change from the girlfriend / boyfriend storyline for Tom and Ellie Simm in the first series , the producers noted it is common for secret service officers to be in a relationship with others in the same field of work . This led to the introduction of Fiona Carter , portrayed by Olga Sosnovska . Sosnovska was previously approached to appear in the second series , but was unavailable . She later auditioned for Fiona , and was later told she won the part when she was in New York City . The actress was only given a brief on her character — a ball breaker , ultimate professional , cold and calculated — which did not give her much to work with . Sosnovska initially found Fiona irritating in the fourth episode , but later opened up to the character after her return in the seventh . 
 The third series also sees a number of recurring characters and guest appearances . Megan Dodds returns as CIA liaison Christine Dale in the first episode . Tim <unk> recurs as <unk> chairman Oliver Mace . McInnerny was better known as a comedic actor , particularly for his role in Blackadder , but the producers felt that quality made Mace a more menacing character . Richard Harrington plays Will North , Zoe 's boyfriend turned fiancé . Ian McDiarmid guest stars as Fred Roberts . The producers noted that McDiarmid played Roberts with the right amount of vulnerability , strength and stubbornness . Indian actor Anupam Kher appears as Harakat in " Who Guards the Guards ? " . Oyelowo stated that Kher had an " instant quality of likeness , " which can make the audience sympathise with Danny after Harakat is killed in the episode . 
 " Love and Death " sees two guest stars who were personally involved with the cast and crew . Dermot Crowley , portrayer of Eric Newland , was the husband of one of the series ' casting directors , though Crowley still had to earn his role . Barnaby Kay plays Ruth 's potential love interest ; Kay was Nicola Walker 's real @-@ life boyfriend , now her husband . Andy Serkis guest stars as Riff in " Celebrity " . Created as an eccentric character , the producers believed it would fit in with Serkis ' acting . Owen Teale appears as Robert Morgan in " Frequently Asked Questions " . Producer Andrew Woodhead stated that Teale has a " strong physicality " that would make him a suitable equal for Adam . The series finale " The Suffering of Strangers " saw the introduction of two new characters that would receive expanded roles in the fourth series . Raza Jaffrey portrays Zafar Younis . Jaffrey 's first day of filming required him to perform a difficult speech he had to " launch into . " In addition James Dicker portrays Wes Carter , Adam and Fiona 's seven @-@ year @-@ old son . The producers held discussions whether to introduce Wes in the finale or in the fourth series ; they eventually chose the former . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Crew = = = 
 The third series of Spooks was produced by Kudos Film and Television for the BBC . Much of the production crew from the first two series returned . New crew members were brought in with the requirement that they were fans of the series and have ambition , so that they can understand Spooks . Andrew Woodhead was the series producer , with Jane Featherstone , Simon Crawford Collins and Gareth Neame as executive producers . Collins , who was the producer for the first two series , had to step back to executive producer , as he was <unk> producing Kudos crime series Hustle . Woodhead replaced him as he was accustomed to the show , but also added more vitality to the show . Christopher Aird was the assistant producer . The third series included five writers . Howard Brenton wrote the first , second and eighth episodes . Rupert Walters wrote the third and ninth episodes . Ben Richards wrote the fourth , sixth and tenth episodes . Richards previously wrote the ninth episode of series two , and accepted the offer to return . His script in the second series was his first script for television ; he found writing easier as time went by . Raymond Khoury wrote the seventh episode . Series creator David Wolstencroft wrote the fifth episode . Wolstencroft was poised to write the next episode , but found himself committed to other projects . 
 There were five directors , each directing two episodes ; Jonny Campbell , Cilla Ware , Justin Chadwick , Bill Anderson , and Alrick Riley . Featherstone wanted Campbell to direct for Spooks after they worked together producing the television series Glasgow Kiss . He was drawn to directing the first two episodes because of Brenton 's writing and the fact he would give Tom a send off . Faith Penhale was the series script executive . Simon Chaudoir , Jake Polonsky , Kieran McGuigan , Sue Gibson and Baz Irvine were the directors of photography . Barney Pilling and Paul Knight were the series editors . Stevie Herbert and Robert Foster were production designers . Jennie Muskett and Sheridan Tongue composed the original music . David Myers was the make @-@ up designer , whilst Iain Macauley was the costume designer . Mark Doman designed the on @-@ screen computer graphics , films surveillance shots and television footage from the series ' point of view . On occasion , crew members appeared as extras . For instance , pictures of every crew member were used as students and faculty for a university database in " The Sleeper " . In " Love and Death " , the crew members present on the ferry appeared as extras in a bar scene . Collins also voiced a florist on a telephone message at the end of the same episode . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 In producing the third series , the goal was to " raise the bar " higher to satisfy and surprise the audience . The second series finale " Smoke and Mirrors " ended on a cliffhanger which left Tom 's fate open . The producers were unsure whether Macfadyen would return at the time they began storylining . Brenton had already written the first two episodes as if he was not coming back . When Macfadyen announced his return for those episodes , they had to be rewritten . Brenton went through a " nightmare " rewriting the first episode as he " dug this enormous hole , and [ he ] had no idea how to get out of it . " It became a long process of growing the story where Tom turns the tables against Joyce . To make a suitable send off to the character , Brenton did not want Tom to be disillusioned ; instead he wanted him to " sort of [ become ] a human being , " as there have been real life instances where spies are attracted to the idea that " the world 's a stage to them all the time , " but later on they start to unravel . 
 Tom 's exit allowed the writers to pull the focus on the other characters , namely Danny and Zoe , to give the show more of an ensemble feel . Overall , the producers made the third series more character driven . Raymond Khoury felt that because the length of a Spooks episode is one and half times longer than the average American television episode , the writers could use the extra time to flesh out the characters . Khoury also noted another difference between Spooks and American television is that most American seasons usually consists of 22 episodes , much of those episodes are more plot driven , while Spooks series three only had 10 and hence all of them contain some character development . The main character developments include Zoe 's relationship with Will , which Danny did not like because he was in love with her . The writers initially wanted to expand on the potential Danny and Sam Buxton relationship which began in the second series , but the idea was dropped in favour of his affection towards Zoe , as the producers believed that was delivering more . Harry was given more depth by introducing his estranged daughter in " Who Guards the Guards ? " . Through the daughter 's introduction , Harry would appear more human as opposed to the boss who " barks orders " to his officers . When Hawes announced she wanted to leave , Richards decided to write a " big episode " to give Zoe a decent send off . Richards did not want to kill off the character , as he deemed it predictable . Oyelowo eventually decided to leave the series as well between filming episodes four and five ; by then the finale was not yet written . The actor wanted Danny to be killed off , reasoning that since Tom and Zoe left as disgraced officers , having Danny leave a disgraced officer also would be " one time too many " for a series that is meant to second guess the audience . In addition , Oyelowo did not want the " lingering thought " of a possible return . The producers wanted to use Danny 's death as a powerful end to the series . 
 Writing " The Sleeper " sees the characters in a different light . Although they are the protagonists who work to prevent terrorist threats , the episode sees the MI5 team going to great lengths to get the sleeper agent , Fred Roberts , to do what they want him to do so that the producers can make the audience sympathise with the character , as well as despise the main characters on some level for their methods . There were other instances of the main character going through great lengths to solve the case , including Adam 's interrogation methods , <unk> on torture , in " Frequently Asked Questions " . " Love and Death " sees Danny and Zoe ordered to carry out an assassination . Wolstencroft did not want to do it lightly , as he wanted somebody like Danny going through " something dreadful . " He previously did it before with the death of Helen Flynn in " Looking After Our Own " , but " Love and Death " did this in the point of view of the killer , not the victim . " Celebrity " introduces a new plot style , which does not involve terror threats . Brenton wrote it as a more light @-@ hearted episode that saw the characters <unk> in a world they cannot handle . Despite this , Collins stated that MI5 do other duties other than fighting terrorism , though they would not gain as much media attention . Penhale also stated MI5 in the episode are in a way protecting the country , as if a national icon is under threat , the country 's morale could drop . " Who Guards the Guards ? " and " Frequently Asked Questions " were considered for the second series , but because there was not room for them , the producers bumped the episodes back to the third series . 
 = = = = Research and realism = = = = 
 Although the series <unk> the world of MI5 , several storylines are based on truth . The series had advisors who were ex @-@ MI5 officers . The writers also research heavily on each episode . The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for , where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place , known as blowback . One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before pulling out of the country ; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al @-@ Qaeda . 
 Brenton modelled Fred Roberts in " The Sleeper " after the weapons scientist David Kelly , who committed suicide in July 2003 after he was outed as the source of BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan 's story alleging the British government " sexed up " the September Dossier about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . " Who Guards the Guards ? " sees a rivalry between MI5 and MI6 . According to the producers , there have been documented rivalries between the two organisations . The episode also based a true story of a man joining a militant group and was paid with a Russian army helicopter , as the group could not afford to pay him in cash . " A Prayer for My Daughter " deals with the Israeli – Palestinian conflict . Because the topic is controversial , it was a difficult area to work with without offending people from both sides . The producers made the episode as neutral as possible by consulting with experts from both sides of the conflict . Richards also wanted to fairly represent it by addressing the issue as political and not religious . 
 The producers learned from an ex @-@ MI5 officer that it is common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people to fall in love with civilians through just their voices . This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in " Love and Death " . Khoury based " Outsiders " on Internet security . He already became intoned with the area , as he once worked with an internet company . Although the story is dramatised , Khoury did research on what was feasible , such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees . Also in the episode , the G & J algorithm is based on an actual computer programme . " Frequently Asked Questions " deals with interrogation and torture . Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear , but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field . To get the interrogation as true as possible , the producers consulted with ex @-@ Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects . As the episode was first broadcast , a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news . In response to this , Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated " Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we 're ahead of the game . It 's just we know stuff that 's happening , and it 'll come out in the news a bit later on . " In the same episode , the weapons caches came from a true story that the Russians hid weapons in Britain during the Cold War , according to Collins . 
 = = = Filming and editing = = = 
 The third series was filmed across five blocks of two episodes , with a director in each block . Filming began in London in January 2004 , and took up to 140 days spanning seven months . Each filming day typically lasted eleven hours . Scheduling was often tight throughout the shoot ; sometimes the production crew had to " double up " on locations , and the cast often had to learn six pages of dialogue a day . The majority of cameras were handheld , and the filming crew used a variety of lenses , including long @-@ focus lenses , fisheye lenses , and swing and tilt lenses . The first two series was shot with a Fujifilm stock . The third series saw a switch to a new type of Kodak stock , becoming the first television series to use this model . 
 Filming began in the middle of winter , which presented problems for the cast and filming crew . Some scenes were delayed because of bad weather , even snow at one point , and as a result scheduling became tighter . Another problem was the cold temperatures . The beginning scene in " Who Guards the Guards ? " , where Mace and <unk> meet in Hebron , was filmed on a roof garden in below zero temperatures ; however , McInnerny and Paul Bhattacharjee wore summer clothes . To prevent hypothermia a heater was placed near them . The cameras used light @-@ coloured filters to make the environment look warmer . However , winter did have an advantage of longer nights , making night scenes easier ; summer nights would last as little as five hours . The producers hired real news presenters from Sky News and the programme London Tonight to present the news of the events from some episodes . All episodes begin with a recap from past episodes , which the producers regard as " an art in themselves " in terms of editing . The opening title sequence went through three changes over the course of the series . More split screen sequences were also added to create more tension for the audience . Overall , each episode took approximately six weeks to prepare , and would take approximately six weeks to edit . 
 = = = = Sets and locations = = = = 
 Shooting took place almost entirely in London . The directors somewhat followed the filming style of Bharat Nalluri , the director of the first two episodes of series one and two , who utilised London and the River Thames as characters in themselves . The exterior and interior of Freemasons ' Hall continued to be a stand @-@ in for Thames House , the headquarters of MI5 . However , the Grid , the base of operations of Section D , was a set constructed at the fifth floor in another building . Danny 's apartment was also filmed in the same building . Another constructed set was the back of mobile surveillance vans , which was housed near the Grid set . 
 Director Jonny Campbell helped search for several " interesting locations " for the first block to draw the audience with interesting visuals . This included a church in Smithfield and the Natural History Museum ; in the latter 's case , Campbell believed the location was " harking back " to traditional spy films . Filming there was expensive and management of the museum only allowed the crew to film for a few hours . The club Mace frequents was filmed at the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall . " The Sleeper " included scenes filmed at the University College London ; a lecture room in the college was where the third series started filming . The explosion scene at the beginning of the episode was filmed at a council estate in Peckham . The estate was condemned for demolition , which proved to be a suitable location for a big explosion . The crew returned there again a month later to gather footage of the demolition work . Several exterior shots where Harry meets with government officials and his officers were filmed on walkways outside the Houses of Parliament . The upper class home of Riff and B in " Celebrity " was filmed in a house in Kensington that was for sale for approximately £ 27 million at the time . Filming in public locations often took place on weekends , when they were closed off to the public . However , there were exceptions . Some scenes in " The Suffering of Strangers " were filmed outside the National Film Theatre in South Bank , a popular tourist destination . Shooting there became difficult as the crew had no control over the tourists . Other known London landmarks that were filmed at included Lord 's Cricket Ground , St Martin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields , Tate Modern , the Old Bailey criminal court , Waterloo station , Empress State Building , and 30 St Mary Axe ( the Gherkin ) . 
 " Love and Death " was filmed in an actual Stena Line ferry that travelled from Harwich to the Hook of Holland , Netherlands ; Stena allowed the producers to film in the ferry , though the cabins were filmed in a constructed studio set . The two actors present , Hawes and Oyelowo took precautions to avoid seasickness before boarding . After filming on board concluded , both actors had to re @-@ record some of the dialogue that was overshadowed by noises of the waves and engines . 
 = = = Stunts and effects = = = 
 The series ' stunts were coordinated by Andy Bradford . Several cast members participated in stunt work . The first scene Penry @-@ Jones filmed was a fight scene between three of Mace 's men , which the actor performed himself . Macfadyen held a special driving licence allowing him to perform some stunt driving , such as skidding a car outside the Freemasons ' Hall to drop off Joyce 's body in " Project Friendly Fire " . The sequence was considered for rescheduling due to snowfall before filming it , but the producers felt the icy road would become an advantage , and went ahead with it anyway . Several actors handled firearms during the shoot . One of scenes included Oyelowo and McGregor spent up to five hours firing guns at a shooting range for the beginning of " Love and Death " , which Oyelowo stated was " the most fun " he ever had in the series . However , Penry @-@ Jones was disappointed he was not given a gun at all throughout the third series . 
 In " Outsiders " a scene required a lorry crashing into a car in front of Danny . Oyelowo had to stand ten feet away from the crash . The production crew considered having Oyelowo wearing sunglasses to shield his eyes from any possible glass shards , but they later chose against it . There were scenes where some of the characters snorted cocaine . The " cocaine " was in actuality glucose powder that the actors did have to snort . Elsewhere , the crew used vegetable soup as vomit . The alcohol used in the series were made from non @-@ alcoholic drinks ; the production crew used fruit juices as wine , ginger ale as brandy , and cold tea as beer .

 The series began broadcasting on 11 October 2004 on BBC One during the 9 to 10 pm timeslot , and continued on every Monday night until 13 December 2004 . The second to ninth episodes were pre @-@ empted on Saturday nights , starting 16 October 2004 , on digital channel BBC Three . In the United States the series began broadcast on the A & E Network , where it is known as MI @-@ 5 , from the start of 2005 . However , because each episode last approximately an hour , 15 minutes had to be edited out on each to accommodate for advert breaks . However , the DVD release of the series in the United States included the episodes unedited . 
 The third series faced a decline in viewership from the second series . The season premiere received an overnight figure of six million viewers and a 25 per cent audience share . It was down almost two million from the series two premiere in June 2003 , which was seen by 7 @.@ 8 million . Ratings declines further as the series continues . The fifth episode dropped to five million . The penultimate episode dropped further to 4 @.@ 5 million , though the finale rose slightly back to five million . However , it was also down from the seven million who saw the series two finale in August 2003 . With consolidated figures factored in , the third series was seen by an average of 5 @.@ 77 million viewers . Despite the ratings decline , the BBC already commissioned a fourth series of Spooks before the third series even began broadcasting . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The third series received generally favourable reviews . In review of the DVD release of the series , Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema was disappointed by the " complete decimation of the group around which the show effectively revolved , " and had reservations for the introductions of the new characters , stating " despite ardent protests from both cast and crew , Tom and Adam are almost exactly the same character . The same goes for his wife Fiona , who more or less steps into Zoe 's shoes ( they even look similar ! ) , and in the final episode , it becomes abundantly clear that , in the next season , Zafar Younis ( Raza Jaffrey ) will be taking Danny 's place while ensuring that the " minority " <unk> remains ticked . " However , at the same time , Mackenzie thought " the psychology surrounding cast changes like these is extremely interesting . " In terms of the storylines , the reviewer stated " Spooks ' third season [ ... ] is something of a step down from both its predecessors , " although the series " has a number of fine moments . " Mackenzie ended up rating the series eight stars out of ten . 
 David Blackwell of the American review site Enterline Media said , " MI @-@ 5 really impressed me with the first two seasons . The third season does start out for the first three episodes before it reaches some highs and lows until it stabilizes with the last two episodes of season 3 . " He felt that Tom Quinn 's exit was his favourite moment in the first two episodes , and that Adam is " just [ as ] cold " as Tom . He also praised the character development , stating " character development is excellent in this season . Danny receives great moments as he is brought into the spotlight from his feelings for Zoe to his conflicted feelings about things he does in the name of Queen and Country , but Danny doesn 't break and let his emotions become a crutch like Tom did ( when Tom wanted a sleeper agent not to the job MI @-@ 5 wanted the sleeper to do ) . " Blackwell concluded by saying " sometime MI @-@ 5 fails as a show this season , but it still reaches levels of greatness . It will be interesting to see what they have in store for season 4 . "

 = Thaddeus McCotter presidential campaign , 2012 = 
 The Thaddeus McCotter presidential campaign of 2012 began when Congressman Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan filed papers with the Federal Election Commission on July 1 , 2011 , announcing his intention to run for the Republican Party 's 2012 nomination for President of the United States . He officially announced his candidacy the next day at a rock festival near Detroit . 
 McCotter , who had served in Congress since 2003 , was first mentioned as a potential presidential candidate on an April 2011 episode of Fox News ' Red Eye w / Greg Gutfeld . After entering the race two months later , McCotter based his campaign on " five core principles " listed on his campaign website , and used the slogan Seize Freedom ! , derived from the title of his 2011 book . During the campaign , he focused on reform of government and Wall Street . 
 Commentators noted McCotter 's lack of name recognition hindered his chances for nomination . When included in Republican presidential preference polls , he regularly received less than one percent support . Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates , he dropped his candidacy on September 22 , 2011 , and endorsed Mitt Romney . Thereafter , McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot , which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re @-@ election campaign . 
 = = Background = = 
 Thaddeus McCotter began his political career upon election to the Wayne County ( Michigan ) Commission in 1993 . Five years later , he left that position after winning a seat in the Michigan State Senate . He remained there until 2002 when elected to serve Michigan 's 11th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives . 
 In Congress , leadership assigned McCotter to the House Financial Services Committee . In addition , he joined the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership . In 2006 , he attained the chairmanship of the House Republican Policy Committee , and two years later was named head of his party 's Fiscal Integrity Task Force . On the task force , he gained a reputation as a leading opponent of pork barrel spending . He voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the Affordable Health Care for America Act of 2010 , but supported the bailout of the automobile industry in 2009 . He also supported an increase in the minimum wage and advocated fair trade with China . Nevertheless , the Detroit Free Press described him as a " conservative 's conservative " and GovTrack labeled him a " far @-@ right Republican " . 
 McCotter was also known as an " oddball " in Congress , displaying a wry sense of humor . Betsy Woodruff of National Review identified him as " the strangest Congressman . " Showing a fondness for rock music , he played lead guitar in the Second Amendments , and quoted Led Zeppelin lyrics on the floor of the House . President George W. Bush referred to him as " that rock and roll dude . " Moreover , McCotter frequently appeared on Fox News ' late night / early morning show Red Eye w / Greg Gutfeld . According to Matt Lewis of The Daily Caller , McCotter was " The Red Eye candidate " , who represented a subculture of " creative think [ ing ] " libertarian @-@ leaning Republicans , who enjoy rock music . Bloomberg Businessweek described his celebrity as a " tiny cult following of insomniac conservatives . " 
 = = Campaign speculation = = 
 Speculation about a presidential run began several months after the release of his February 2011 book Seize Freedom ! American Truths and Renewal in a Chaotic Age . The first instance occurred during the April 22 episode of Red Eye , where host Greg Gutfeld asked McCotter to enter the presidential race . Five days later , political commentator and fellow Red Eye frequenter S.E. Cupp listed McCotter as a potential candidate in her Daily News column . McCotter confirmed in May that he was seriously considering a run for the presidency . He told the newspaper Politico he felt most Republicans lacked enthusiasm for the current crop of candidates . Commentator Andrew Breitbart expressed excitement at the prospect of a McCotter run . Describing him as " blunt , sarcastic , pop @-@ culture @-@ savvy , constitutionally sound and an authentic voice , " Breitbart remarked " [ t ] here 's no one I 'd like to see more at a debate than McCotter . " 
 In May 2011 , speculation increased as McCotter attacked Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney as Romney visited Detroit . He connected Romney to President Barack Obama , arguing that people see Romney and Obama as running mates rather than as rivals . Later that month , he addressed the Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans and entered the event 's straw poll . Out of the 1 @,@ 542 votes cast , he received two , last place among those considered . At this time , McCotter remained undecided about a run , according to his aides , though he paid $ 18 @,@ 000 for a prime spot at the August 13 Ames Straw Poll . During a visit to Iowa , the first caucus state , McCotter announced he would reveal his campaign plans prior to the straw poll . On June 30 , Politico reported McCotter was ready to begin a campaign .

 McCotter filed a presidential campaign committee with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) and opened a campaign website on July 1 , 2011 . The website , which warned " your American Dream is endangered " was based on his book Seize Freedom ! and listed " five core principles " . These were : 
 " Our liberty is from God not the government " 
 " Our sovereignty is in our souls not the soil " 
 " Our security is from strength not surrender " 
 " Our prosperity is from the private sector not the public sector " 
 " Our truths are self @-@ evident not relative " 
 McCotter officially announced his candidacy at the <unk> @-@ sponsored " Freedom Festival " in Whitmore Lake , Michigan on July 2 . He declared , " what we need in Washington is someone who understands that the wave of the future is not big government , but self @-@ government " . He played with his rock band at the event . Upon his entrance , Charlie Cook of The Cook Political Report rated McCotter 's chances of nomination as " virtually impossible " . CBS News and other outlets commented on McCotter 's lack of name recognition and described him as a " little @-@ known " candidate . Nevertheless , the Free Press noted he had about $ 480 @,@ 000 available in his congressional account to transfer to his presidential campaign account . Political communications operative Mark Corallo was hired along with a core group of advisers that included former Senator Bill Frist 's chief of staff Eric <unk> , and former Iowa representative Christopher <unk> .

 As McCotter embarked on his first official campaign trip to the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation primary state of New Hampshire , he received media attention for his hometown newspaper 's reaction to his run . An editorial in The Oakland Press , based out of Oakland County , Michigan , wrote that the idea of a McCotter presidency " isn 't a pleasant thought and is , in fact , a bit scary " . It added , " the representative comes off as cold , arrogant and egotistical " . McCotter largely ignored the criticism , and continued his campaign in New Hampshire , focusing on the " fundamental restructuring of government " , and signing the Susan B. Anthony List 's Pro @-@ Life Leadership Pledge . Radio host Chris Buck was hired as leader of operations in New Hampshire . 
 McCotter returned to Iowa in mid @-@ July for further campaign events . Around this time , Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post placed McCotter 's odds of winning the Ames Straw Poll at one hundred to one , last place among the candidates listed . A Harris poll conducted July 11 – 18 found that 92 percent of voters were not familiar with McCotter , and less than one percent supported him when matched against his fellow presidential contenders . In a hypothetical head to head matchup with President Obama , McCotter received 43 percent , compared to 57 percent for the President . To build support , McCotter used Twitter , with which he attempted to bypass the news media and connect directly with supporters . Campaign spokesman Randall Thompson stated that McCotter was " relying on social media ... [ and ] ... developed a very loyal following " . 
 McCotter participated in the first @-@ ever Twitter presidential debate , on July 20 , against fellow candidates former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson , businessman Herman Cain , representative Michele Bachmann , former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich , and former Senator Rick Santorum . At one point , moderator S.E. Cupp asked whether President Obama was anti @-@ Israel , McCotter answered , " Obama 's motivations are not the issue , the impact of his policies , both proposed and pursued , have strained our relationship " with Israel . When asked to comment on the U.S. role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya , McCotter referred to the Obama administration 's mission as " ill @-@ defined , " and argued for " no US boots on ground . " However , he added the caveat , " once committed [ to the mission ] , we can 't abruptly withdraw . " 
 In late July , during the height of the debt ceiling crisis , McCotter canceled several appearances in Iowa and returned to Washington . He supported the plan of House Speaker John Boehner , and voted in favor of the compromise bill . He was the only presidential candidate in the House of Representatives to approve the bill in Congress since both fellow members Bachmann and Ron Paul voted against it . 
 Ahead of the Ames Straw Poll , McCotter had not reached the one percent polling threshold necessary to participate in the event 's August 11 debate on Fox News . At the time , McCotter had little support , even at home . Public Policy Polling showed him with only five percent from Michigan Republicans , a figure pollsters described as rare coming from a candidate 's homestate . With news of his standing , McCotter cancelled a scheduled stop in New Hampshire , and returned to his headquarters in Michigan to coordinate a debate inclusion effort . As part of the effort , the campaign filmed a YouTube video in a kitchen , featuring McCotter making puns about food , and concluding with " Thanks , dude . " The Los Angeles Times described the video as " unfortunate " . Despite the effort , McCotter did not meet the polling threshold and was excluded . He was the only candidate missing from the debate that had secured a spot on the ballot . 
 Just before the vote the Ames , McCotter addressed voters in what Politico described as " a slow , abstract , exceptionally sober speech " . It drew little crowd reaction other than applause at the denunciation of the " regime in Beijing " and the proclamation , " I will not cede the 21st Century to a Communist , nuclear @-@ armed dictatorship . " At his tent , McCotter spent a large amount of time playing guitar . In the straw poll , he finished last among ten candidates , receiving 35 votes or 0 @.@ 21 percent . Based on the $ 18 @,@ 000 he paid for campaign space , the result corresponded to $ 514 per vote . Senior adviser Christopher <unk> explained that the purpose of the straw poll " was not about votes , it was about introducing our candidate to the public in our first large forum ... By any measure , we did that " . 
 Three days after the straw poll , McCotter wrote an article in National Review outlining some of his economic plans . He advocated spending reductions , a twenty percent reserve requirement for banks to keep available as capital , and incentives to reduce home foreclosures . He campaigned in New Hampshire on August 19 , and filmed " Conversation with the Candidate " for WMUR @-@ TV . The next day , he attended a party with S.E. Cupp for the Young Republicans of <unk> . He returned to Iowa for his last campaign stop in the state from August 24 to August 27 . At the end of the month , McCotter appeared on the Dennis Miller Show and talked about his exclusion from debates . He failed to meet the requirements for both the September 7 MSNBC and the September 12 CNN debates . For the MSNBC debate , a candidate had to show one poll with four percent support . McCotter argued that while he did not meet this , in a Quinnipiac poll , he tied with Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman , Jr . , both of whom qualified . Other candidates who did not qualify included Gary Johnson and former Louisiana governor Buddy Roemer , who like McCotter , did not qualify for any televised debates . 
 McCotter continued his efforts to be included in the debates in September . In an interview with The Daily Caller he said the other candidates " don 't understand what 's wrong with the economy , let alone how to fix it " , and that foreign policy was not being discussed enough . He observed that since former United Nations ambassador John R. Bolton announced he would not run for president , foreign policy discussion had ceased . McCotter hoped the next president would select Bolton as Secretary of State . 
 On September 9 , McCotter made his last campaign trip to New Hampshire , attending events for two days . He was supposed to appear in Iowa again five days later , but had to cancel due to a vote in Congress . While in Washington , he introduced a Grover Norquist @-@ backed Social Security reform plan , which would have created private accounts for those under 50 years of age with limited guaranteed government benefits . He called on the other GOP presidential candidates to release their plans on Social Security . Shortly thereafter , McCotter participated in the California Republican Convention . In a speech there , he criticized President Obama , arguing , " No matter how many times his campaign clown car <unk> America , we know that the most prosperous and equitable economy in human history was created by you , the American people , not by bureaucrats in Washington . " At the event 's straw poll , he received less than one percent of the vote . McCotter tried to gain entry into the September 22 Fox News debate , but reported via Twitter , " @ <unk> has kindly advised me I will be excluded from the Orlando GOP <unk> debate . " 
 = = = Withdrawal = = = 
 On September 22 , 2011 , McCotter notified The Detroit News he would withdraw from the presidential race . He explained it " was sort of death by media " because of the exclusion from the presidential debates , and argued " if they keep you out of the debates , you are out of the conversation and you can 't run . " He then released a statement in which he endorsed Mitt Romney for president , and called on the Republican Party to unite behind Romney as the most electable candidate . In the press release , McCotter also announced that he would run for re @-@ election in his congressional district . 
 In reporting on the withdrawal , the Los Angeles Times wrote , " What 's that ? You 've never heard of Thaddeus McCotter ? Well , that 's the main reason he 's now a former candidate . " <unk> Bill Ballenger of Inside Michigan Politics said that McCotter " really had no business running for president . If he wants to have any political future , endorsing Mitt Romney now is the smart thing to do . " McCotter 's neighbor , former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox , remarked , " He tried it out , obviously it wasn 't working . And he 's doing the rational thing and dropping out . " Steve <unk> of Salon summarized the overall campaign as " a cautionary tale about what can go wrong when your average backbench member of Congress becomes a minor cable news celebrity and mistakes it for having a genuine national following . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 A few days after the campaign ended , The Detroit News asked McCotter whether he enjoyed his presidential campaign , he replied , " No . It was the worst 15 minutes of my life . " Fundraising totals for the three months of McCotter 's run were released to the FEC in October 2011 . Overall , he raised $ 548 @,@ 606 ( $ 468 @,@ 561 of which was transferred from authorized committees ) , paid $ 541 @,@ 532 on expenses , and had a debt of $ 105 @,@ 367 . As of June 2013 , a debt of $ 105 @,@ 636 remains . 
 In an interview with GQ ahead of the Michigan primary in February 2012 , McCotter expressed concern that Republicans were underestimating the strength of Democrats , and that winning in the Midwest would be difficult because of the Republicans ' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout . He maintained that though he disagreed with Romney on the auto industry bailout , Romney had the best chance to overcome the obstacles . 
 Though McCotter had decided to run for reelection in his congressional district , he failed to qualify for his district 's Republican primary after the majority of his petitions were declared fraudulent . An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued . McCotter argued that " somebody either panicked or it was sabotage ... My gut tells me that we got lied to by someone we trusted . " Steve <unk> suggested the fraud may have been related to the presidential campaign , if it " caused him to take his eye off the ball on his House reelection , " but McCotter rejected this as an " idiotic line of thinking . " He initially hoped to wage a write @-@ in campaign , but decided against it , finding he could not run the campaign while cooperating with the investigation and serving the remainder of his term in Congress . A month later , he resigned from Congress , claiming this was needed to fully assist with the petition fraud investigation . The investigation found that in addition to the 2012 petitions , McCotter 's Congressional reelection petitions from 2006 , 2008 , and 2010 , also showed evidence of fraud . McCotter sued two aides accusing them of intentional sabotage . Eventually , four aides , including one who was sued , were charged and convicted of violations related to the fraud . 
 A day prior to his resignation from Congress , The Detroit News reported that after ending his presidential campaign , McCotter took to writing a television pilot he titled , " Bumper Sticker : Made On Motown " . It centered on McCotter as the host of a variety show with characters based on his congressional staffers , who made fun of his presidential campaign and discussed such risqué topics as sex , race , and bodily functions . In one scene in the script , S.E. Cupp guest stars ; McCotter tries to conduct a serious interview with her , but the other characters make sexually explicit comments , leading Cupp to describe the show as a " train wreck . " A former staffer released the work to the media to show what McCotter did while in office . In response , McCotter denied any wrongdoing , saying it had been largely composed in his garage as a way to get over his failed presidential campaign . He said the script was unfinished and had not authorized it for release , but decided to discuss it with The News . He cited comedian Martin Mull 's short @-@ lived 1977 show Fernwood 2 Night as an inspiration , and revealed that he had planned to leave Congress in 2014 and was preparing for a future career . 
 = Bramble shark = 
 The bramble shark ( Echinorhinus brucus ) is one of the two species of sharks in the family <unk> . Aside from the eastern Pacific Ocean , it is found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide . This rarely encountered shark swims close to the bottom of the seafloor , typically at depths of 400 – 900 m ( 1 @,@ 300 – 3 @,@ 000 ft ) , though it may enter much shallower water . The bramble shark has a stout body with two small dorsal fins positioned far back and no anal fin . It can be readily identified by the large , thorn @-@ like dermal denticles scattered over its body , some of which may be fused together . It is purplish brown or black in color and grows up to 3 @.@ 1 m ( 10 ft ) long . 
 The diet of the bramble shark includes smaller sharks , bony fishes , and crabs , which this slow @-@ moving species may capture via suction . It is aplacental viviparous , with females producing litters of 15 – 52 pups . Harmless to humans , it is an occasional bycatch of commercial and recreational fishers , and may be used for fishmeal and liver oil . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species . However , its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries , likely because of overfishing . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The original description of the bramble shark was authored by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois <unk> de la nature . He named it Squalus brucus , from the Greek <unk> or <unk> meaning " from the depths of the sea " . The type specimen has since been lost . In 1816 , Henri de Blainville created the genus Echinorhinus for this species . Until the 1960s , specimens of the prickly shark ( E. cookei ) caught in the Pacific Ocean were misidentified as bramble sharks . Other common names for this species are spinous shark and spiny shark . 
 = = Description = = 
 The bramble shark has a thick , cylindrical body and a somewhat flattened head . The snout is blunt and shorter than the width of the mouth , with widely spaced nostrils that are preceded by small flaps of skin . The eyes lack nictitating membranes ; the tiny spiracles are located well behind them . The wide , curved mouth bears very short furrows at the corners . There are 20 – 26 upper and 22 – 26 lower tooth rows ; each tooth is knife @-@ like , with a single main cusp and up to three cusplets on either side . There are five pairs of gill slits , with the fifth pair the longest . 
 The pectoral fins are short and angular , while the pelvic fins are long and relatively large . The dorsal fins are small , with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the pelvic fin origins . There is no anal fin . The caudal peduncle is robust and lacks notches at the caudal fin origins . The asymmetrical caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin . 
 The skin is covered by a layer of foul @-@ smelling mucus several millimeters thick . The dermal denticles are scattered irregularly over the body and vary greatly in size , measuring up to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) across . Each denticle is thorn @-@ like in shape , with ridges radiating out from the central point over the base . As many as ten denticles may be fused together to form multi @-@ pointed plates . The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth is densely covered by small denticles in sharks under 90 cm ( 35 in ) long ; these denticles become larger and sparser in larger sharks . This species is brown to black above , with a metallic purplish hue , and paler below ; some individuals have red or black blotches . There is a report of one specimen that had a greenish glow when freshly caught . The bramble shark may reach 3 @.@ 1 m ( 10 ft ) in length . The maximum weight on record is 200 kg ( 440 lb ) for a 2 @.@ 8 m ( 9 @.@ 2 ft ) long female . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Records of the bramble shark are fairly rare and originate from widely scattered locations in tropical and temperate waters worldwide , save for the eastern Pacific Ocean . Most have come from the eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans , where its range extends from the North Sea and the British Isles to southern Mozambique , including the Mediterranean Sea . In the western Atlantic , this species is represented by a handful of specimens from Massachusetts , North Carolina , Louisiana , Tobago , Brazil , and Argentina . In the Indo @-@ Pacific , it is known from Oman , India , southern Japan , southern Australia , New Zealand , and possibly Kiribati . 
 Found close to the sea floor , the bramble shark most commonly inhabits continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 400 – 900 m ( 1 @,@ 300 – 3 @,@ 000 ft ) . However , it has been reported from as shallow as 18 m ( 59 ft ) , in areas with upwellings of cold water , and from as deep as 1 @,@ 214 m ( 3 @,@ 983 ft ) . At least in European waters , this species may migrate into shallower depths of 20 – 200 m ( 66 – 656 ft ) during the summer . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Sluggish in nature , the bramble shark feeds on smaller sharks ( including the spiny dogfish , Squalus acanthias ) , bony fishes ( including ling , catfishes , and lizardfishes ) , and crabs . The large size of its pharynx , relative to its mouth , suggests that it may capture prey by suction . This species is aplacental viviparous ; females have two functional ovaries and two uteruses . Recorded litter sizes have ranged from 15 to 52 , and newly born pups have been estimated to measure 40 – 50 cm ( 16 – 20 in ) long . The dermal denticles in near @-@ term embryos are underdeveloped , appearing as minute spines located within open pits in the skin . The size at sexual maturity is uncertain ; the smallest known mature males and females are 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) and 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) long respectively . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The bramble shark is not known to pose a danger to humans . It is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line , as well as by sport anglers . In the eastern Atlantic , this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance . Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine , whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles . Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries , such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean . This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure , to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large , deep @-@ sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans . Regarding the species as a whole , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient .

 = Baseball 's Sad Lexicon = 
 " Baseball 's Sad Lexicon , " also known as " Tinker to Evers to Chance " after its refrain , is a 1910 baseball poem by Franklin Pierce Adams . The poem is presented as a single , rueful stanza from the point of view of a New York Giants fan watching the Chicago Cubs infield of shortstop Joe Tinker , second baseman Johnny Evers , and first baseman Frank Chance complete a double play . 
 Tinker , Evers , and Chance began playing together with the Cubs in 1902 , and formed a double play combination that lasted through April 1912 . The Cubs won the National League pennant four times between 1906 and 1910 , often defeating the Giants en route to the World Series . 
 The poem was first published in the New York Evening Mail on July 12 , 1910 . Popular among sportswriters , numerous additional verses were written . The poem gave Tinker , Evers , and Chance increased popularity . It has been credited with their elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Frank Chance joined the Chicago Cubs in 1898 as a reserve catcher , backing up Tim Donahue and Johnny Kling . Frank Selee , the Cubs ' manager , decided that Chance would be better suited as a first baseman . Chance at first opposed the move and even threatened to quit , but ultimately obliged . Joe Tinker was a third baseman in minor league baseball , but in 1902 made the Cubs as a shortstop , replacing Barry McCormick . Johnny Evers made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 1 at shortstop , with Selee moving Tinker from shortstop to third base . Three days later , Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to second base to back up Bobby Lowe . 
 Lowe suffered a knee injury late in the 1902 season , providing Evers with more playing time . Tinker , Evers , and Chance first appeared in a game together on September 13 , 1902 . They turned their first double play on September 15 , 1902 . Lowe 's injury did not properly heal during the offseason , making Evers the new permanent second baseman for the Cubs in 1903 . Chance succeeded Selee as manager during the 1905 season when Selee became ill . 
 The Cubs , led by Tinker , Evers , and Chance , won the National League pennant in 1906 , 1907 , 1908 , and 1910 . In 1908 , the Cubs clinched the pennant after defeating the Giants in part due to Merkle 's Boner . In the Merkle game , Tinker hit a home run off of Christy Mathewson , and Evers alerted umpire Hank O 'Day to Merkle 's baserunning gaffe . In the replay of the Merkle game , Tinker hit a triple off of Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory , clinching the pennant . 
 From 1906 to 1910 , the Cubs turned 491 double plays , the third @-@ most in the NL during that time . According to Bill James ' formula , " expected double plays " , the Cubs led the NL with 50 more double plays than expected during those five seasons . From 1906 through 1910 , the " Tinker , to Evers , to Chance " double play happened 54 times in 770 games played , and the trio did not collaborate on a double play during any of their 21 World Series games . In 1906 , the trio committed 194 errors , though this was in part due to poor field conditions and scorers .

 Franklin Pierce Adams wrote a weekly column for the New York Evening Mail , called " Always in Good Humor " . Adams hoped to leave work to attend a Giants game , but his editor found that Adams had not produced enough content for his column . While traveling to the Polo Grounds to see the Giants play the Cubs , Adams wrote the poem that would become Baseball 's Sad Lexicon , while reflecting on Tinker , Evers , and Chance . He considered the lines to be forgettable as he wrote them , and an editor at the paper told him that he did not consider the work to be " much good " . 
 This work was first published as " That Double Play Again " in the New York Evening Mail on July 12 , 1910 ( not on July 10 as numerous sources state ) . The Chicago Daily Tribune reprinted it as " Gotham 's Woe " on July 15 , 1910 . Three days later , on July 18 , the New York Evening Mail republished it under the title by which it is best known today , " Baseball 's Sad Lexicon . " The poem was such a hit that other sportswriters submitted additional verses . 
 For the poem 's 100th anniversary , Tim Wiles , director of research at the Baseball Hall of Fame , conducted research on the poem . He revealed that the poem was part of series of poems published in the New York Evening Mail and the Chicago Tribune . During the research process , combing the archives in the New York Public Library and the Center for Research Libraries , they uncovered 29 poems , 15 of which detail a specific play or game that had occurred during the 1910 season , with " Baseball 's Sad Lexicon " the first poem published .

 In 1911 , the Giants overcame the Cubs , capturing the first of three consecutive league championships . The trio played their final game together on April 12 , 1912 . While Chance was hospitalized for a brain injury suffered while playing , club owner Charles Webb Murphy released him after an argument about Murphy 's releasing other players with high salaries . Murphy named Evers manager for the 1913 season , which displeased Tinker , who was traded to the Cincinnati Reds . 
 Murphy fired Evers as manager after one season , trading him against his will to the Boston Braves in February 1914 . As a consequence , National League president John K. Tener and newspaper owner Charles P. Taft ( who also owned the Philadelphia Phillies ) made a successful effort to drive Murphy out of baseball . Taft purchased the Cubs from Murphy in 1914 . Sporting Life commemorated the affair with this variation on the poem : 
 Brought to the leash and smashed in the jaw , 
 Evers to Tener to Taft . 
 Hounded and hustled outside of the law , 
 Evers to Tener to Taft . 
 Torn from the Cubs and the glitter of gold , 
 Stripped of the <unk> and glory untold , 
 Kicked in the stomach and cut from the fold , 
 Evers to Tener to Taft .

 Chance died in 1924 . Evers died in 1947 , and Tinker the next year . When members of the trio died , the poem was often used to memorialize them . 
 All three players were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 . Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams ' poem . Andy Coakley , a teammate with the Cubs as well as a coach for Columbia University , regarded Tinker , Evers , and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history . Bill James , in his 1994 book , Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame ? , argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis , who at the time was not a member of the Hall of Fame . 
 The poem gave the trio " everlasting fame " . Evers made an appearance on Information Please , a radio show on which Adams was a panelist in 1938 . Evers thanked Adams for writing the poem , which he credited with his being remembered . However , many forgot Harry Steinfeldt , the third baseman who started alongside Tinker , Evers , and Chance from 1906 through 1910 . Including Steinfeldt , the Cubs infield set a record for longevity surpassed by the Los Angeles Dodgers infield of first baseman Steve Garvey , second baseman Davey Lopes , shortstop Bill Russell , and third baseman Ron Cey , who played together for eight years , from 1973 through 1981 . 
 Despite their celebrated success at turning spectacular plays in collaboration , relations between the teammates were said to have been often strained . Tinker and Evers feuded for many years . On September 14 , 1905 , Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby . They did not speak for years following this event . According to some tellings , Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years , until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series , between the Cubs and the New York Yankees . Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited . However , in 1929 , Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten @-@ week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States .

 Ogden Nash 's poem " Line @-@ Up For Yesterday , " written in 1949 , references the poem : 
 <unk> ' is for Evers 
 His jaw in advance ; 
 Never afraid 
 To Tinker with Chance 
 The phrase " Tinker to Evers to Chance , " and variations of the phrase using other names , are colloquially used to characterize high @-@ caliber teamwork . Examples include : 
 The song " O 'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg " in the 1949 musical film Take Me Out to the Ball Game 
 An advertisement for The Hours , a 2003 film , praising the trio of Nicole Kidman , Meryl Streep , and Julianne Moore as the " acting version " of the three baseball players 
 The expression has also been used to characterize any process that happens with smoothness and precision , as a near @-@ synonym to expressions such as " like clockwork " or " a well @-@ oiled machine . " For example , in Raymond Chandler 's The Long Goodbye ( 1953 ) , detective Philip Marlowe goes through his mail , opens it , and tosses it into the waste bin , remarking , " Mail slot to desk to wastebasket , Tinker to Evers to Chance . " 
 Washington Post journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward used the phrase " Tinker to Evers to Chance " in their account of the Post investigation of the Watergate scandal in their 1974 book , All the President 's Men . The reference described the smooth operation of President Richard Nixon 's White House staff in responding to allegations of misconduct . 
 Musician Scott Miller , leader of the 1980s band Game Theory , chose Tinker to Evers to Chance as the ironic title of a 1990 compilation album of the band 's greatest would @-@ be hits which , despite significant critical acclaim , had struck out commercially . 
 The poem was set to music and recorded in 2010 by Chicago singer / songwriter guitarist Chris McCaughan . The song , also titled " Baseball 's Sad Lexicon , " appears on the album We Chase the Waves , by McCaughan 's solo project , <unk> . 
 = Truce term = 
 A truce term is a word or short phrase accepted within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity , such as tag or its variants . Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley , fainites , crosses , kings and <unk> ( s ) in the United Kingdom , pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia . In the United States , terms based on time @-@ out have , from the 1950s onwards , largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and <unk> ( s ) . Since the late 1980s time @-@ out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US . Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on the rules of the game . 
 Traditionally these terms are specific to certain geographical areas although some may be used by a particular social group such as pax in the UK , used primarily by children attending private schools . To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together . 
 The most extensive study of the use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie in the UK in their 1959 book , The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren , which mapped the use of truce terms across England , Wales and Scotland . The Opies considered it the most important word in a schoolchild 's vocabulary and one for which there was no adult equivalent . There has been little recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms , including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s , are still in general use . Studies conducted since the 1970s in English speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in Australia , New Zealand and the United States with a number of terms deriving from older terms used in the UK , but many not . 
 The use of a truce term is usually accompanied by a gesture , such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs . In the US a T @-@ shape made with both hands ( representing time @-@ out ) has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries . 
 = = Use = = 
 Truce terms are recorded as having been used in the following circumstances ; being out of breath , having a stitch , a shoelace being undone , fear of clothes being damaged , needing to go to the lavatory , checking the time , wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game , or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing . It does not mean to surrender , although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering . Truce terms are only used within a specific age group , have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years . However , research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century . 
 The vocabulary of children 's games , including truce terms , is described by <unk> Peter Trudgill in Dialects of England as being particularly rich in regional variation insofar as they are not based on official or television culture . They are an example of the subculture of young children which is transmitted by word of mouth .

 The Opies conducted a study of the use of truce terms throughout England , Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in a book called The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren . They found truce terms varied according to geographical location , with the exception of pax . In some places , more than one term was current and often four or five were known , although usually only one term predominated . Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both . The words used in urban areas were often at odds with words used in the surrounding countryside . The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations . The most widely used were barley , fainites , kings , crosses , keys , <unk> , cree and <unk> . 
 Barley was recorded by the Opies as the prevailing term in east Scotland and the Borders , the Lake District , north @-@ west England , west Midlands and in Wales , apart from the south east of Wales where cree prevailed . There were many variations such as barley @-@ bay , barley @-@ bees , <unk> or barrels . The use of <unk> as a truce term appears in the 14th century poem Sir <unk> and the Grene Knight and Tobias Smollett 's The Reprisal . It is recorded in lexicographer John Jamieson 's 1808 Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language as a term specifically used by children to demand truce . A probable variation also appears in the 1568 manuscript <unk> @-@ Kirk of the Grene , sometimes attributed to James I of Scotland , as follows ; 
 <unk> he was <unk> , he was <unk> <unk> , 
 With sic <unk> to <unk> ; 
 For frae his <unk> they dang a <unk> , 
 <unk> he cry 'd <unk> . 
 The " <unk> " ( thumb ) that is " <unk> " ( sliced ) in the quote above may refer to the thumb having been raised by the man calling <unk> , a common accompanying gesture to the use of a truce term in Scotland . 
 <unk> and fains ( or <unk> and <unk> ) predominated in London and throughout southern England , apart from the <unk> and screams of east Hampshire , and extended north as far as Olney in Buckinghamshire . Variations included <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Notes and Queries reported in 1870 that fains was in common use by London schoolboys . <unk> appeared in an 1889 dictionary of slang and <unk> in 1891 . According to philologist J. R. R. Tolkien , the term derives from the medieval term <unk> I , descended in turn from the Old French se <unk> meaning " to make excuses , hang back or back out of battle " . He also proposes that this use of the term throws light on line 529 of the Clerk 's Tale by Chaucer that " <unk> <unk> <unk> nat been <unk> " ( the lords orders cannot be treated with a fain I ; in other words , declined ) . Another translation of the Anglo @-@ Norman word <unk> is " pretend , feign , turn a blind eye to " , which is what the more powerful child does whilst granting respite . 
 Spoken English south of the Danelaw became , from at least the 11th century onwards , characterised by a pronunciation known as Southern Voicing , such as <unk> for frog , or <unk> for summer . <unk> or <unk> , variants of fainites or fains , are surviving examples of this on the borders of the Danelaw to the north of London . Other truce terms prevail within the Danelaw . 
 Kings was recorded by the Opies as common in eastern England . The English Dialect Dictionary recorded much the same in the nineteenth century . The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg 's 1851 Dialect of Northamptonshire . Queens is recorded as used in the kings area , sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart the game . Kings truce is found in Thomas Dekker 's The Honest Whore , Part One ( II , i ) , which appeared in 1604 . The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel . 
 Crosses , cruces , creases and cree were found in a broad band across England from crosses in Lincolnshire , cruce or cruces from Oxford through to Gloucester , creases in Berkshire and cree in South Wales and both sides of the Bristol Channel . There are some areas of <unk> , <unk> or screws in Essex and Suffolk . The Opies saw creases as a transitional word . 
 Exes , used around Ipswich and Norwich , was thought to be a variant of crosses . 
 Bars and sometimes <unk> were common in Devon in an otherwise predominantly fainites area . Bar was used the other side of the Bristol channel in Swansea . 
 <unk> or <unk> predominated in Northumberland and Durham , another term first recorded in a nineteenth @-@ century dialect dictionary . 
 Keys was found by the Opies to be the prevailing term in western Scotland and in a strip running through north @-@ west England in an otherwise predominantly barley area . 
 <unk> or squibs <unk> an area from Hampshire , to West Sussex and Surrey . Other Hampshire variants were <unk> , screens , <unk> , screams , creams and cribs . 
 Finns was used in Guernsey . 
 Pax , ( Latin for " peace " ) , was a group dialect word rather than a regional one as it was predominantly used in private schools and school stories . 
 Many individual cities , towns and rural districts had their own words , not used elsewhere such as bees , blobs , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , locks , peas , peril , nix , truce , snakes and twigs . 
 = = = Post @-@ Opie studies = = = 
 A study undertaken in Lincolnshire in 1974 confirmed the Opies ' findings . However , a later study undertaken in Croydon , Surrey in 1988 found the use of truce terms much less uniform . Croydon is firmly in the fainites area on the Opies ' map , but in 1988 fainites was only the third most commonly used term . The most common terms were pax ( 30 % ) , <unk> ( 25 % ) , fainites ( 20 % ) and cross keys ( 2 % ) . <unk> is a term not recorded by the Opies at all and there was some evidence that it derived from the word injection . <unk> was known more than it was used and was reported by one teacher to be " totally lacking in street credibility " . Pax was no longer a group word as reported by the Opies . Other terms reported included pips , force field and quits . The authors concluded that either the Opies had grossly oversimplified the picture or things had radically changed in 30 years ( some seven to eight generations of primary school children ) . They also noted that although some schools reported a marked preference for a particular term , all schools reported at least some children using different terms . 
 The Concise Scots Language Dictionary published in 1999 , records the use of keys as a truce term in Fife , south west and west central Scotland .

 According to researchers from the National Australian Dictionary Centre there is evidence that barley ( Scotland and the west of England ) , <unk> ( Aberdeen and a few English towns ) , bar ( Swansea ) and bars ( Devon ) , are used in Australia . In Australia the terms are used regionally with Victorians using barley , New South Welshmen using bar or bars and the people of Western Australia using <unk> . 
 = = New Zealand = = 
 A study undertaken between 1999 and 2001 in New Zealand by lexicographers Laurie and Winifred Bauer on traditional forms of play included truce terms . The terms they described in their study were regional and the most common were pegs ( widespread ) , twigs ( Taranaki ) , gates ( Auckland ) , tags ( Nelson Marlborough ) , and nibs ( Otago @-@ Southland ) . In Wellington schools the dominant term was fans , recorded in New Zealand before 1920 , which the authors state derives from fains or fain it as described by the Opies , itself dating back to <unk> times . The most widespread term was pegs , derived from pax . Apparently unrecorded before World War II this appears to have first changed to <unk> , probably from being shouted out at length , and then further mutated by virtue of broad New Zealand accents to pegs . The Bauers thought the most likely hypothesis for the use of this rather upper class term from the UK , was that it derived from books and stories about UK public schools . Similarly they thought nibs derived from nix , possibly via <unk> , originally from South Africa though unknown to the Opies save for a very small area of nicks possibly from <unk> . Nix is also UK public school slang though not as a truce term . <unk> and <unk> were recorded as having been described by a South African boy as prevalent in South Africa , and were thought by a South African linguist to have derived from an Afrikaans term . 
 Many of the common truce terms recorded by the Bauers such as bags , poison , gates , tags , flicks , are not listed by the Opies although they speculated that both bags and tags may derive from pax .

 In a study undertaken by historians Mary and Herbert Knapp in the 1970s , informants remembering terms from the 1930s reported kings X and kings . The use of kings X before the 1930s is well @-@ recorded . The 1985 edition of the Dictionary of American Regional English records the historical use of kings ex , kings sax , kings cruse , kings excuse and kings , chiefly west of the Mississippi River , the Gulf States and Ohio Valley . The earliest recorded use cited in the dictionary is of kings cruse in 1778 during an adult fight . 
 Scholarly speculation in the late nineteenth century postulated that kings X derived from kings truce , rendered as kings cruse and then kings excuse , becoming kings X as a shortened form . The Dictionary of American Regional English cites the Opies as a source for the derivation of the terms and states that exes probably refers to the use of crossed fingers , an important part of the demand for a truce , rather than deriving from " excuse " as originally thought . However , the Knapps state that although the Opies do not record kings X as such in the UK , they do record kings , crosses , exes , cruse and truce . They conclude that kings X derived from the users of kings and exes settling in the same areas of the US — the terms were then combined and shortened . Kings cruse , once popular in the US , might be accounted for in a similar manner . Barley has been recorded as a truce term in Ohio , Wisconsin , and Virginia . 
 The Knapps study in Monroe County , Indiana , found time @-@ out and times to be by far the most prevalent terms in the 1970s . Variations included I 've got times and time . Very few children reported the more traditional kings , queens or I 've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad . To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together . Time @-@ out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television . Historically the earliest reports for the use of time @-@ out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936 . However , only a small number of respondents reported anything other than time @-@ out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s . The few alternatives included pax , safe , base or home @-@ base and freeze with one small area of fins ( Mount Vernon ) . The Knapps reported that time @-@ out had , since the 1950s , supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term . 
 The use of times rather than time @-@ out and I 've got times rather than I call time appears to have been influenced by older forms such as kings and I 've got kings X. There was also one report of times X. Similarly derivatives of time @-@ out are often accompanied by the traditional crossed fingers .

 In France children use the word pouce as the equivalent of the English pax and the American time @-@ out . The literal translation of pouce is thumb or big toe . 
 = = Gestures = = 
 The Opies found that in England and Wales children usually held up crossed fingers . Sometimes crossing the fingers of both hands was required and occasionally the feet as well . The Opies found one area , Headington , where sitting cross @-@ legged was required . At Lydney , children could raise their right hand palm forward , whilst in Bradford @-@ on @-@ Avon the hand was held up with three fingers extended . In some parts of Scotland the custom was to put up one 's thumbs , sometimes licking them first . This also occurred in a few places in Lancashire . Anecdotally , the raising of a thumb may also accompany the use of pouce in France . 
 The 1988 Croydon study found a variety of gestures in common use . These were crossed fingers of one hand ( 44 % ) , crossed fingers of both hands ( 26 % ) , thumbs through fingers ( 6 % ) ( boys only ) and arms crossed across the chest ( 2 % ) . Other gestures , reported in ones and twos , included miming an injection into the arm , licking the thumb , making a T @-@ shape with the hands , three fingers held up and the " Vulcan " sign from Star Trek . Virtually all schools reported the use of crossed fingers . 
 The holding up of one hand with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999 – 2001 . The T @-@ shape was also used when saying time @-@ out . The time @-@ out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally , palm down , the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching the bottom of the horizontal hand . In the US , although the more modern time @-@ out has largely supplanted traditional terms , often accompanied by the time @-@ out gesture , the crossed fingers gesture remains common . 
 = Uzair = 
 Uzair - most often identified with the Judeo @-@ Christian Ezra ( <unk> , ' Uzair ) - is a figure mentioned in the Qur 'an , in the verse 9 : 30 , which states that he was revered by the Jews as " the son of God " . Jews do not agree with this statement . Historically , Muslim scholars have interpreted this verse as referring to a small group of Jews making such a reverence . 
 Uzair lived between the times of King Solomon and the time of Zachariah , father of John the Baptist . Although not explicitly mentioned in the Quran among the prophets , Uzair is considered as one by some Muslim scholars , based on Islamic traditions . On the other hand , Muslim scholars such as <unk> al @-@ <unk> and <unk> and notably Ibn Hazm and al @-@ Samaw 'al accused Uzair ( or one of his disciples ) of falsification of the Torah . Several sources state that the Qur 'an refers to Jews who began to call Uzair a " son of God " due to his religious achievements . 
 Gordon Darnell Newby states it may due to misunderstanding of <unk> 's position in the Jewish faith as a Bene Elohim . Other Western scholars , relying on exegetical material from Ibn Abbas and Ibn Qutaybah , consider Uzair not to be Uzair but Azariah , mentioned in the Book of Daniel as Abednego .

 The Quran claims that Jews exalted Ezra as a son of God : 
 The Jews call Ezra a son of God , and the Christians call the Christ a son of God . That is a saying from their mouth ; ( in this ) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say . May Allah destroy them : how they are deluded away from the Truth ! ( Quran 9 : 30 ) 
 According to Islamic sources , this Quranic verse was revealed to Muhammad at Medina in the month of Dhu al @-@ Qi 'dah in <unk> ( ~ 630 AD ) . By that time , most of the Jewish population of Medina had been exiled ( or in the case of the tribe of Banu Qurayza , killed en masse ) . 
 = = = Islamic tradition and literature = = = 
 In some Islamic texts , Ezra is identified as the person mentioned in Qur 'an 2 : 259 : 
 Or ( take ) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet , all in ruins to its roofs . He said : " Oh ! how shall God bring it ( ever ) to life , after ( this ) its death ? " but God caused him to die for a hundred years , then raised him up ( again ) . He said : " How long didst thou tarry ( thus ) ? " He said : ( Perhaps ) a day or part of a day . " He said : " Nay , thou hast tarried thus a hundred years ; but look at thy food and thy drink ; they show no signs of age ; and look at thy donkey : And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people , Look further at the bones , how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh . " When this was shown clearly to him , he said : " I know that God hath power over all things . " ( Quran 2 : 259 ) 
 According to the classical Quranic <unk> , Ibn Kathir , after Ezra questioned how the resurrection will take place on the Day of judgment , God had him brought back to life many years after he died . He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place . But the people did not recognize him , nor did his household , except the maid , who was now an old blind woman . He prayed to God to cure her blindness and she could see again . He meets his son who recognized him by a mole between his shoulders and was older than he was . Ezra then led the people to locate the only surviving copy of Torah as the remaining were burnt by Nebuchadnezzar . It was rotting and crumpled , so Ezra had a new copy of the Torah made which he had previously memorised . He thus renovated the Torah to the Children of Israel . Ibn Kathir mentions that the sign in the phrase " And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people " was that he was younger than his children . After this miracle , Ibn Kathir writes that Jews began to claim that Ezra was the ' son of God ' . 
 The Quranic exegesis of Sayyid Abul Ala <unk> states : Uzair ( Ezra ) lived during the period around 450 B.C. The Jews regarded him with great reverence as the revivalist of their Scriptures which had been lost during their captivity in Babylon after the death of Prophet Solomon . So much so that they had lost all the knowledge of their Law , their traditions and of Hebrew , their national language . Then it was Ezra who re @-@ wrote the Old Testament and revived the Law . That is why they used very exaggerated language in his reverence which misled some of the Jewish sects to make him ' the son of God ' . The Qur 'an , however , does not assert that all the Jews were unanimous in declaring Ezra as ' the son of God ' . What it intends to say is that the perversion in the articles of faith of the Jews concerning Allah had degenerated to such an extent that there were some amongst them who considered Ezra as the son of God . 
 Sheikh Ahmad Kutty has said this verse referred to " the Jews of Arabia " who called Ezra " the son of God " . 
 In A History of the Jews of Arabia : From Ancient Times to Their Eclipse under Islam , scholar Gordon Darnell Newby notes the following on the topic of Uzair , the angel Metatron and the Bene Elohim ( lit . " Sons of God " ) : 
 ... we can deduce that the inhabitants of Hijaz during Muhammad 's time knew portions , at least , of 3 Enoch in association with the Jews . The angels over which Metatron becomes chief are identified in the Enoch traditions as the sons of God , the Bene Elohim , the Watchers , the fallen ones as the <unk> of the flood . In 1 Enoch , and 4 Ezra , the term Son of God can be applied to the Messiah , but most often it is applied to the righteous men , of whom Jewish tradition holds there to be no more righteous than the ones God elected to translate to heaven alive . It is easy , then , to imagine that among the Jews of the Hijaz who were apparently involved in mystical speculations associated with the <unk> , Ezra , because of the traditions of his translation , because of his piety , and particularly because he was equated with Enoch as the Scribe of God , could be termed one of the Bene Elohim . And , of course , he would fit the description of religious leader ( one of the <unk> of the Qur 'an 9 : 31 ) whom the Jews had exalted . 
 However , the Quranic claim that Jews consider Ezra the " son of God " is unattested either in Jewish or other extra @-@ Quranic <unk> and it is improbable that the Jews of Arabia believed so . Jacob Saphir recorded that Arabian Jews had " a pronounced aversion for the memory of Ezra " and even excluded his name from their category of proper names , one theory is this could be due to their perceived reverence to Ezra . It is most likely the text was referring to a specific group of Jews found at the time in Arabia as opposed to all Jews . 
 = = = Jewish tradition and literature = = = 
 As in Islam , a fundamental tenet of Judaism is that God is not bound by any limitations of time , matter , or space , and that the idea of any person being God , a part of God , or a mediator to God , is heresy . The Book of Ezra , which Judaism accepts as a chronicle of the life of Ezra and which predates Muhammad and the Qur 'an by around 1000 years , gives Ezra 's human lineage as being the son of <unk> and a direct descendant of Aaron . Tractate Ta <unk> of the Jerusalem Talmud , which predates Muhammad by two to three hundred years , states that “ if a man claims to be God , he is a liar . ” Exodus <unk> 29 says , " ' I am the first and I am the last , and beside Me there is no God ' I am the first , I have no father ; I am the last , I have no brother . Beside Me there is no God ; I have no son . " However the term ' sons of gods ' occurs in Genesis . The Encyclopedia of Judaism clarifies that the title of ' son of God ' is attributed a person whose piety has placed him in a very near relationship to God and " by no means carries the idea of physical descent from , and essential unity with , God " . 
 There is no evidence of any Jewish community venerating Ezra as the ' son of God ' in Jewish literature . The Qur 'anic verse on Ezra appears in one of Maimonides 's discussions about the relationship between Judaism and Islam where he says “ … they [ Muslims ] lie about us [ Jews ] , and falsely attribute to us the statement that God has a son . ” 
 The Encyclopedia Judaica states : 
 " Muhammed claims ( Sura 9 : 30 ) that in the opinion of the Jews , Uzayr ( Ezra ) is the son of God . These words are enigma because no such opinion is to be found among the Jews , even though Ezra was singled out for special appreciation ( see Sanh . 21b ; <unk> . <unk> ) . " 
 The Jewish Encyclopedia states : 
 " In the Koran ( ix . 30 ) the Jews are charged with worshiping Ezra ( " ' Uzair " ) as the son of God — a malevolent metaphor for the great respect which was paid by the Jews to the memory of Ezra as the restorer of the Law , and from which the Ezra legends of apocryphal literature ( II <unk> <unk> . 37 @-@ 49 ) originated ( as to how they developed in Mohammedan legends see <unk> , " <unk> al @-@ <unk> , " i . 304 @-@ 305 ) . It is hard to bring into harmony with this the fact , related by Jacob Saphir ( " Eben <unk> , " i . 99 ) , that the Jews of South Arabia have a pronounced aversion for the memory of Ezra , and even exclude his name from their category of proper names . " 
 Abraham Geiger remarked the following concerning the claim that Jews believed Ezra to be the son of God : “ According to the assertion of Muhammad the Jews held Ezra to be the Son of God . This is certainly a mere misunderstanding which arose from the great esteem in which Ezra was undoubtedly held . This esteem is expressed in the following passage ‘ Ezra would have been worthy to have made known the law if Moses had not come before him . ’ Truly Muhammad sought to cast suspicion on the Jews ’ faith in the unity of God , and thought he had here found a good opportunity of so doing . ” 
 = = Accusations of falsification = = 
 Ibn Hazm , an Andalusian Muslim scholar , explicitly accused Ezra of being a liar and a heretic who falsified and added interpolations into the Biblical text . Ibn Hazm provided a polemical list of what he considered " chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions ; theological impossibilities ( anthropomorphic expressions , stories of fornication and whoredom , and the attributing of sins to prophets ) , as well as lack of reliable transmission ( <unk> ) of the text " , Hava Lazarus @-@ <unk> states . In response to attacks on the personality of Ezra , the Byzantine Emperor Leo III defended Ezra as a pious , reliable person . The Jewish convert to Islam al @-@ Samaw 'al ( d . 1175 ) accused Ezra of interpolating stories such as Gen. 19 : 30 @-@ 8 in the Bible in order to sully David ’ s origins and to prevent the rule of the Davidic dynasty during the second Temple . The writings of Ibn Hazm and al @-@ Samaw 'al was adopted and updated only slightly by later Muslim authors up to contemporary times . 
 = = Uzayr as Azariah = = 
 Viviane <unk> , Professeur in Islamic literature at <unk> , considers the possibility of Quranic Uzair not being Ezra but Azariah instead , relying on Ibn Qutaybah , and identifying a confusion committed by Muslim exegetes . She declares : " There is , from <unk> traditionalists , a confusion between two distinct characters , Ezra [ ' <unk> ] et Azariah [ ' <unk> ( h ) ] ( ... ) Thus , it is possible that the <unk> <unk> Uzayr could find its origin in Azariah 's one . " 
 The deuterocanonical version of the book of Daniel confirms this hypothesis . The <unk> 's version , used by Catholics and Orthodox Christians contains the Prayer of Azariah , an apocryphal prayer added by Hellenistic rabbis in the Septuagint version of the book of Daniel , which curiously mentions Abednego by his other name , Azariah , rather than Abednego which is used in the whole chapter 3 of the Hebrew and Protestant version , without any mention of the name " Azariah " in this chapter . This mention precedes the appearance of an angel qualified by Nebuchadnezzar as having the form of the " son of god " . Legends from Jewish communities of Arabia which were using the Septuagint version of the Book of Daniel made the confusion between the fourth character , the angel who is like the son of god , and Azariah himself , as confirmed by H. Schwarzbaum . In this perspective , the Quranic narrator seems to blame the Jews who believed in such a legend and who considered Azariah as the son of God , legend which finds its origin in a confusion due to an addition in the original biblical corpus by the rabbis who elaborated the Septuagint . 
 = = Title of son of God in Judaism = = 
 The title of son of God ( servant of God ) is used by the Jews for any pious person as is evident according to Encyclopedia of Judaism which states that the title of son of God is attributed by the Jews " to any one whose piety has placed him in a filial relation to God ( see Wisdom ii . 13 , 16 , 18 ; v. 5 , where " the sons of God " are identical with " the saints " ; comp . <unk> . [ Sirach ] iv . 10 ) . It is through such personal relations that the individual becomes conscious of God 's fatherhood . " Jews consider Ezra among the pious . 
 = Bound ( Star Trek : Enterprise ) = 
 " Bound " is the seventeenth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , originally broadcast on April 15 , 2005 . It was written by showrunner Manny Coto , and directed by Allan Kroeker . The episode featured the return of the Orion slave girls , which had been originally seen in the original pilot of Star Trek : The Original Series , " The Cage " . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . In this episode , three Orion slave girls come on board the ship , and the crew , with the exception of Commander " Trip " Tucker and Commander T 'Pol who seem to have a resistant psychic bond , begin acting strangely . 
 The episode featured the return of <unk> Batten and William Lucking who had both previously appeared in multi @-@ episode parts in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . Four time MTV Music Video Award for Choreography winner Travis Payne was brought on board to oversee the extensive choreography for the three actresses playing the Orion women . Each actress went through a four to five @-@ hour make @-@ up process for each day of filming , which required them to be sprayed green . " Bound " received Nielsen ratings of 1 @.@ 8 / 3 % , and critical reaction was mixed with one reviewer listing it amongst the best episodes of Enterprise while another listed as the worst episode ever of any Star Trek series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Enterprise is en route to the <unk> system , one of the proposed locations for a Starfleet starbase , when it is approached by an Orion Syndicate vessel . Captain Archer is invited to visit the Orion ship by its captain , Harrad @-@ Sar . During the visit , Archer and Lieutenant Reed are entertained by three Orion dancers , Navaar , D <unk> , and Maras . Archer negotiates with Harrad @-@ Sar and they agree a joint magnesite mining operation , and the three slaves are given to him . They return to Enterprise with the slaves and set a course to survey the planet . 
 En route , the presence of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew : men become increasingly aggressive , while women increasingly suffer from headaches . Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer , while D <unk> seduces Commander Kelby . Arriving at the planet , a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship , but he refuses and it escapes . Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him . Afterwards , Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones , causing the crew 's adrenaline levels to spike . Only Commander T 'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected , since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond . 
 The Orions are placed under guard in the decontamination chamber . Harrad @-@ Sar returns in his vessel and attacks the now disabled Enterprise , and then begins to tow it away . He reveals that , in fact , the Syndicate seeks Archer 's head , and in this matter he is the slave and the Orion women are his masters . The Orions escape and travel to the Bridge , as do T 'Pol and Tucker . Navaar tells Archer to arrest T 'Pol , but Tucker stuns all the male crew @-@ members with his phaser , and T 'Pol disables the Orion ship with a pulse sent from Enterprise 's deflector dish . They send the Orions back to their ship , and T 'Pol finally admits she would personally like Tucker to return , and he replies that he has already requested a transfer back to Enterprise . 
 = = Production = = 
 The Orion slave girls had been introduced in the original Star Trek : The Original Series pilot " The Cage " , footage from which was later adapted to appear in the episode " The Menagerie " . The make @-@ up was designed by Fred Phillips , which was originally tested on Majel Barrett , before it was applied to Susan Oliver . <unk> Batten , Crystal Allen and <unk> Fortunato played the three Orion women in " Bound " . Batten had previously appeared as Tora <unk> , the daughter of Gul Dukat in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine in the episodes " Indiscretion " and " Return to Grace " . She also appeared in " Drive " , an episode Star Trek : Voyager , as Irina . William Lucking had appeared as a Bajoran called <unk> in three episodes of Deep Space Nine ; " <unk> " , " The Darkness and the Light " and " Ties of Blood and Water " . Derek Magyar returned as Commander Kelby , following his introduction earlier in the previous episode " Divergence " . 
 Allen recalled the The Original Series , and said that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl . However , she was not pleased with the make @-@ up process which took between four and five hours to apply , and required each actress to be sprayed with green make @-@ up over their whole body . Removal of the make @-@ up was via the showers in the Paramount lot 's executive gym . The make @-@ up team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode 's plot . 
 Allan Kroeker , who was the director of " Bound " had previously directed two episodes earlier in the season , " Storm Front " and " Home " . Fortunato praised the director and described the Orions , saying that they " move very slowly , very seductively . I would like to compare us to snakes – we like to slither and creep around , versus a human . So we ’ re a little sneaky . The three of us are trying to get something accomplished , and each one of us has our target , so to speak , to try to manipulate them to get what we want in the end . " 
 The choreography was overseen by Travis Payne , who had won the MTV Music Video Award for Best Choreography on four occasions and worked with Madonna , Michael Jackson and Britney Spears amongst others . Both Batten and Fortunato were trained dancers , with Batten being a former member of The Pussycat Dolls burlesque dance troupe , while Allen had previously appeared in films such as Maid in Manhattan and television series such as Boston Legal alongside William Shatner . After being cast , Fortunato said that the actresses playing the Orion women were not shown any film footage of the previous appearances of Orion slave girls , but were allowed to see a magazine article about Bobbi Sue Luther appearing as one in the episode " Borderland " in order to demonstrate what the make @-@ up would look like . 
 Filming began on January 6 , 2005 and concluded on January 14 . Only six days were used to shoot , with January 10 spent working on choreography for the dance scene and for shooting additional footage for " Divergence " . Filming on the earlier episode had also overlapped on the first day of filming . While the actresses playing the Orion women were required on all days , Lucking filmed all his scenes on the final day of shooting . The main cabin of the Orion ship was constructed in full specifically for this episode while the bridge was only a single wall as it was only seen on screen as a view @-@ screen background .

 " Bound " was first aired in the United States on UPN on April 15 , 2005 . It received a 1 @.@ 8 / 3 % share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This means that it was seen by 1 @.@ 8 percent of all households , and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast . This was lower than the following episode , where the first installment of the two @-@ part " In a Mirror , Darkly " received ratings of 2 @.@ 0 / 3 % . 
 The critical response was mixed . James Hunt of the website Den of Geek listed " Bound " as the fourth best episode of Enterprise , saying that it " found a way to include [ the Orion slave girls ] in a way that preserved the eye candy and shifted the power in the Orion relationships . " However , Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website " Jammer 's Reviews " gave " Bound " a score of one out of four , saying that it was " too dumb , too obvious , too boring , and too rooted in gender stereotypes " . He said that it was sexist and " the worst episode of Enterprise in more than two years " . Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation said that it was the single worst episode of any Star Trek series , including " Spock 's Brain " . She considered it a statement in misogyny and also thought that it represented a scenario where homosexual characters do not exist . 
 " Bound " was released on home media in the United States on November 1 , 2005 , as part of the season four DVD box set of Enterprise . The Blu @-@ ray edition was released on April 1 , 2014 . 
 = Geography of Wales = 
 Wales ( Welsh : Cymru ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and is part of the island of Great Britain and offshore islands . It is bordered by England to its east , the Irish Sea to its north and west , and the Bristol Channel to its south . It has a total area of 2 @,@ 064 @,@ 100 hectares ( 5 @,@ 101 @,@ 000 acres ) and is about 170 mi ( 274 km ) from north to south and at least 60 mi ( 97 km ) wide . It has a number of offshore islands , by far the largest of which is Anglesey . The mainland coastline , including Anglesey , is about 1 @,@ 680 mi ( 2 @,@ 704 km ) in length . As of 2014 , Wales had a population of about 3 @,@ 092 @,@ 000 ; Cardiff is the capital and largest city and is situated in the urbanised area of South East Wales . 
 Wales has a complex geological history which has left it a largely mountainous country . The coastal plain is narrow in the north and west of the country but wider in the south , where the Vale of Glamorgan has some of the best agricultural land . Exploitation of the South Wales Coalfield during the Industrial Revolution resulted in the development of an urban economy in the South Wales Valleys , and the expansion of the port cities of Newport , Cardiff and Swansea for the export of coal . The smaller North Wales Coalfield was also developed at this time , but elsewhere in the country , the landscape is rural and communities are small , the economy being largely dependent on agriculture and tourism . The climate is influenced by the proximity of the country to the Atlantic Ocean and the prevailing westerly winds ; thus it tends to be mild , cloudy , wet and windy . 
 = = Physical geography = = 
 Wales is located on the western side of central southern Great Britain . To the north and west is the Irish Sea , and to the south is the Bristol Channel . The English counties of Cheshire , Shropshire , Herefordshire and Gloucestershire lie to the east . Much of the border with England roughly follows the line of the ancient earthwork known as Offa 's Dyke . The large island of Anglesey lies off the northwest coast , separated from mainland Wales by the Menai Strait , and there are a number of smaller islands . 
 Most of Wales is mountainous . Snowdonia ( Welsh : Eryri ) in the northwest has the highest mountains , with Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) at 1 @,@ 085 m ( 3 @,@ 560 ft ) being the highest mountain in England and Wales . To the south of the main range lie the <unk> Group , Cadair Idris and the Berwyn Mountains . In the northeast of Wales , between the Clwyd Valley and the Dee Estuary , lies the Clwydian Range . The 14 ( or possibly 15 ) peaks over 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 914 m ) , all in Snowdonia , are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s . 
 The Cambrian Mountains run from northeast to southwest and occupy most of the central part of the country . These are more rounded and undulating , clad in moorland and rough , <unk> grassland . In the south of the country are the Brecon Beacons in central Powys , the Black Mountains ( Y <unk> Duon ) spread across parts of Powys and Monmouthshire in southeast Wales and , confusingly , Black Mountain ( Y Mynydd Du ) , which lies further west on the border between Carmarthenshire and Powys . 
 The Welsh lowland zone consists of the north coastal plain , the island of Anglesey , part of the Llŷn Peninsula , a narrow strip of coast along Cardigan Bay , much of Pembrokeshire and southern Carmarthenshire , the Gower Peninsula and the Vale of Glamorgan . The main rivers are the River Dee , part of which forms the boundary between Wales and England , the River Clwyd and the River Conwy , which all flow northwards into Liverpool Bay and the Irish Sea . Further round the coast , the Rivers Mawddach , Dovey , Rheidol , Ystwyth and Teifi flow westwards into Cardigan Bay , and the rivers Towy , Taff , Usk and Wye flow southwards into the Bristol Channel . Parts of the River Severn form the boundary between Wales and England . 
 The length of the coast of mainland Wales is about 1 @,@ 370 mi ( 2 @,@ 205 km ) , and adding to this the coasts of the Isle of Anglesey and Holy Island , the total is about 1 @,@ 680 mi ( 2 @,@ 704 km ) . Cardigan Bay is the largest bay in the country and Bala Lake ( Llyn <unk> ) the largest lake at 1 @.@ 8 sq mi ( 4 @.@ 7 km2 ) . Other large lakes include Llyn <unk> at 1 @.@ 8 sq mi ( 4 @.@ 7 km2 ) , Lake <unk> at 1 @.@ 7 sq mi ( 4 @.@ 4 km2 ) , Llyn <unk> at 1 @.@ 4 sq mi ( 3 @.@ 6 km2 ) , Llyn Celyn at 1 @.@ 2 sq mi ( 3 @.@ 1 km2 ) and Llyn Alaw at 1 @.@ 2 sq mi ( 3 @.@ 1 km2 ) . Bala Lake lies in a glacial valley blocked by a terminal moraine , but the other lakes are reservoirs created by impounding rivers , to provide drinking water , hydroelectric schemes or flood defences , and many are also used recreationally . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The geology of Wales is complex and varied . The earliest outcropping rocks are from the Precambrian era , some 700 Mya , and are found in Anglesey , the Llŷn peninsula , southwestern Pembrokeshire and in places near the English border . During the Lower Palaeozoic , as seas periodically flooded the land and retreated again , thousands of metres of sedimentary and volcanic rocks accumulated in a marine basin known as the Welsh Basin . 
 During the early and middle Ordovician period ( 485 to 460 Mya ) , volcanic activity increased . One large volcanic system , which was centred around what is now Snowdon , emitted an estimated 60 cubic kilometres ( 14 cu mi ) of debris . Another volcano formed <unk> Fawr near Dolgellau . During this period , great accumulations of sand , gravel and mud were deposited further south in Wales , and these gradually consolidated . Some of the volcanic ash fell in the sea and formed great banks , where unstable masses sometimes slid into deeper water , creating submarine avalanches . This caused great turbidity in the sea , after which the particles began to settle out according to particle size . The strata thus formed are called turbidites , and these are common in central Wales , being particularly obvious in the sea cliffs around Aberystwyth . 
 By the beginning of the Devonian period ( 400 Mya ) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses , forming a new range of mountains , the Welsh <unk> . The strata were compressed and deformed , and in places , the clay minerals <unk> , developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage , making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate . In the Carboniferous period ( 360 to 300 Mya ) , erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones . A <unk> of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone , and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures . Southwestern Wales , in particular , was affected by the Variscan orogeny , a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata . 
 During the Permian , Triassic and Jurassic ( 300 to 150 Mya ) , further episodes of desertification , subsidence and uplift occurred and Wales was alternately inundated by the sea and raised above it . By the Cretaceous ( 140 to 70 Mya ) , Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene ( 2 @.@ 5 Mya to recent ) , it underwent several exceptionally cold periods , the ice ages . The mountains we see today largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age , the Devensian glaciation . 
 In the mid 19th century , two prominent geologists , Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick , used their studies of the geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . From the Latin name for Wales , Cambria ( derived from Cymru ) , was derived the name of the earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era , the Cambrian . After much dispute , the next two periods of the Paleozoic era , the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after pre @-@ Roman Celtic tribes of Wales , the Ordovices and Silures . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Wales has a maritime climate , the predominant winds being southwesterlies and westerlies blowing in from the Atlantic Ocean . This means that the weather in Wales is in general mild , cloudy , wet and windy . The country 's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in amounts of sunshine , rainfall and temperature . Rainfall in Wales varies widely , with the highest average annual totals in Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons , and the lowest near the coast and in the east , close to the English border . Throughout Wales , the winter months are significantly wetter than the summer ones . Snow is comparatively rare near sea level in Wales , but much more frequent over the hills , and the uplands experience harsher conditions in winter than the more low @-@ lying parts . 
 The mean annual temperatures in Wales are about 11 ° C ( 52 ° F ) on the coast and 9 @.@ 5 ° C ( 49 ° F ) in low @-@ lying inland areas . It becomes cooler at higher altitudes , with a mean decrease in annual temperatures of approximately 0 @.@ 5 ° C ( 0 @.@ 9 ° F ) for each 100 metres ( 330 feet ) of increased altitude . Consequently , the higher parts of Snowdonia experience mean annual temperatures of 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) . At nights , the coldest conditions occur when there is little wind and no cloud cover , especially when the ground is snow @-@ clad ; the lowest temperature recorded in Wales was in conditions of this sort at Rhayader on New Year 's Day , 1940 , when the temperature fell to − 23 @.@ 3 ° C ( − 9 @.@ 9 ° F ) . Occasionally , the coastal area of North Wales experiences some of the warmest winter conditions in the United Kingdom , with temperatures up to 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) ; these result from a Foehn wind , a south @-@ westerly airflow warming up as it descends from the mountains of Snowdonia . 
 Rainfall in Wales is mostly as a result of the arrival of Atlantic low pressure systems and is heaviest between October and January over the whole country . The driest months are usually April , May and June , and Wales experiences fewer summer thunderstorms than England . Rainfall varies across the country with the highest records being from the greatest elevations . Snowdonia experiences total annual rainfalls exceeding 3 @,@ 000 mm ( 118 in ) whereas coastal regions of Wales and the English border may have less than 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 39 in ) . The combination of mountainous areas and Atlantic lows can produce large quantities of rain and sometimes results in flooding . The amount of snowfall varies with altitude and enormously from year to year . In the lowlands , the number of days with lying snow may vary from zero to thirty or more , with an average of about twenty in Snowdonia . 
 Wales is one of the windier parts of the United Kingdom . The strongest winds are usually associated with Atlantic depressions ; as one of these arrives , the winds usually start in the southwest , before veering to the west and then to the northwest as the system passes by . The southwest of Pembrokeshire experiences the most gale force winds . The highest wind speed ever recorded in Wales at a lowland site was gusts of 108 knots ( 200 km / h ; 124 mph ) at <unk> , in the Vale of Glamorgan , on 28 October 1989 . 
 = = Land use = = 
 The total terrestrial surface of Wales is 2 @,@ 064 @,@ 100 hectares ( 5 @,@ 101 @,@ 000 acres ) . The area of land used for agriculture and forestry in the country in 2013 was 1 @,@ 712 @,@ 845 hectares ( 4 @,@ 232 @,@ 530 acres ) . Of this 79 @,@ 461 hectares ( 196 @,@ 350 acres ) was used for arable cropping and fallow , 1 @,@ 449 hectares ( 3 @,@ 580 acres ) for horticulture , and 1 @,@ 405 @,@ 156 hectares ( 3 @,@ 472 @,@ 220 acres ) was used for grazing . Woodland occupied 63 @,@ 366 hectares ( 156 @,@ 580 acres ) and 10 @,@ 126 hectares ( 25 @,@ 020 acres ) was unclassified land . In addition , there were 180 @,@ 305 hectares ( 445 @,@ 540 acres ) of common rough grazing , giving a total area of all the land used for agriculture purposes , including common land , of 1 @,@ 739 @,@ 863 hectares ( 4 @,@ 299 @,@ 300 acres ) . 
 In order of area planted , the arable crops grown in Wales were : foods for stock @-@ feeding , spring barley , wheat , maize , winter barley , other cereals for combining , oilseed rape , potatoes and other crops . The grassland was predominantly permanent pasture , with only 10 % of the grassland being under five years old . Compared with other parts of the United Kingdom , Wales has the smallest percentage of arable land ( 6 % ) , and a considerably smaller area of rough grazing and hill land than Scotland ( 27 % against 62 % ) . 
 = = Natural resources = = 
 The South Wales Coalfield extends from parts of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire in the west , to Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen in the east , and the rather smaller North Wales Coalfield underlies parts of Flintshire and Denbighshire . Vast quantities of coal were mined in Wales during the Industrial Revolution and the earlier part of the twentieth century , after which coal stocks dwindled and the remaining pits became uneconomical as foreign coal became available at low prices . The last deep pit in Wales closed in 2008 . 
 Ironstone outcrops along the northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield were extensively worked for the production of iron and were important in the initiation of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales . Lead was mined at Pentre Halkyn in Flintshire during the Roman occupation of Britain and there were ore @-@ bearing sites in Clwyd where lead , silver and sometimes zinc were mined . These metals were also mined in the upland areas of the Rivers Ystwyth and Rheidol . Manganese , titanium and numerous other minerals occur in various parts of Wales . Gold is found in southern Snowdonia and at Dolaucothi , and Snowdonia had a flourishing copper industry from the early 1800s . Although exploited in the past , none of these minerals is mined on a commercial scale today . 
 Stone is quarried in various parts of Wales , and slate quarrying has been a major industry in North Wales . The Cilgwyn Quarry was being worked in the 12th century , but later Blaenau Ffestiniog became the centre of production . The Penrhyn Quarry is still producing slates , though at a reduced capacity compared to its heyday , and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been converted into a visitor attraction . Several of the railways that used to carry the slates to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions , including the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway . 
 Wales has some potential for the onshore production of oil and gas . Shale gas may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in <unk> coal seams that may be extractable . Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce <unk> , a mixture of hydrogen , methane and carbon monoxide . 
 With its mountainous terrain and ample rainfall , water is one of Wales ' most abundant resources . The country has many man @-@ made reservoirs and supplies water to England as well as generating power through hydroelectric schemes . The largest reservoirs , such as the <unk> , are in the Elan Valley , and other notable bodies of water include Lake <unk> , Talybont Reservoir and Llyn Brianne . Some of these are popular resorts for outdoor activities such as sailing , kayaking , cycling , fishing and bird @-@ watching . 
 Wind is another resource that Wales has in abundance . The <unk> y <unk> is one of several offshore wind farms off the coast of North Wales and Anglesey , and is the second largest such wind farm in the world . Other wind farms are found on inland , mostly upland sites , but there are none in the Snowdonia and Brecon Beacons national parks . 
 = = Political geography = = 
 = = = Border between Wales and England = = = 
 The modern border between Wales and England was largely defined by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 , based on the boundaries of medieval Marcher lordships . According to the Welsh historian John Davies : 
 Thus was created the border between Wales and England , a border which has survived until today . It did not follow the old line of Offa 's Dyke nor the eastern boundary of the Welsh dioceses ; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias , where the Welsh language would continue to be spoken for centuries , districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as Cambria irredenta . Yet , as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England , the location of the Welsh border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers . 
 The boundary has never been confirmed by referendum or reviewed by a Boundary Commission . The boundary line very roughly follows Offa 's Dyke from south to north as far as a point about 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the northern coast , but then swings further east . It has a number of anomalies , but some were ironed out by the Counties ( Detached Parts ) Act 1844 . For instance , it separates Knighton from its railway station , and divides the village of Llanymynech where a pub straddles the line . 
 = = = Local government = = = 
 Wales is divided into 22 unitary authorities , which are responsible for the provision of all local government services , including education , social work , environmental and road services . Below these in some areas there are community councils , which cover specific areas within a council area . The unitary authority areas are known as " principal areas " . The Queen appoints Lords Lieutenant to represent her in the eight preserved counties of Wales . 
 In the Office for National Statistics Area Classification , local authorities are clustered into groups based in the six main census dimensions ( demographic , household composition , housing , socio @-@ economic , employment and industry sector ) . Most of the local authorities in mid and west Wales are classified as part of the ' Coastal and Countryside ' supergroup . Most of the south Wales authorities , Flintshire and Wrexham are in the ' Mining and Manufacturing ' supergroup ; Cardiff is part of the ' Cities and Services ' supergroup and the Vale of Glamorgan is part of ' Prospering UK ' . 
 = = Demography = = 
 The population of Wales in 2014 was about 3 @,@ 092 @,@ 000 , an increase of 9 @,@ 600 ( 0 @.@ 31 % ) on the previous year , which was the slowest growth rate for any country in the United Kingdom . The main population and industrial areas in Wales are in South Wales , specifically Cardiff , Swansea and Newport and the adjoining South Wales Valleys . Cardiff is the capital city and had a population of around 346 @,@ 000 at the 2011 census . This was followed by the unitary authorities of Swansea ( 239 @,@ 000 ) , Rhondda Cynon Taf ( 234 @,@ 400 ) , Carmarthenshire ( 183 @,@ 800 ) , Caerphilly ( 178 @,@ 800 ) , Flintshire ( 152 @,@ 500 ) , Newport ( 145 @,@ 700 ) , Neath Port Talbot ( 139 @,@ 800 ) , Bridgend ( 139 @,@ 200 ) and Wrexham ( 134 @,@ 800 ) . Cardiff was the most heavily populated area in Wales with 2 @,@ 482 people per square kilometre ( 6 @,@ 428 per sq mile ) while Powys had just 26 . 
 A high proportion of the Welsh population lives in smaller settlements : nearly 20 % live in villages of less than 1 @,@ 500 persons compared with 10 % in England . Wales also has a relatively low proportion of its population in large settlements : only 26 % live in urban areas with a population over 100 @,@ 000 ; in comparison , nearly 40 % of the English population live in urban areas larger than the largest in Wales . Another feature of the settlement pattern in Wales is the share of the population living in the sparsest rural areas : 15 % compared with only 1 @.@ 5 % in England . 
 = = Communications = = 
 Communications within Wales are influenced by the topography and the mountainous nature of the country : the main rail and road routes between South and North Wales loop to the east and pass largely through England . The only motorway in Wales is the M4 motorway from London to South Wales , entering the country over the Second Severn Crossing , passing close to Newport , Cardiff and Swansea and extending as far west as the Pont Abraham services before continuing northwest as the A48 to Carmarthen . The A40 is a major trunk road connecting London to Fishguard via Brecon and Carmarthen . The A487 coast road links Cardigan with Aberystwyth , and the <unk> links Aberystwyth with Rhayader , Leominster and Worcester .

 Wales has three designated national parks . Snowdonia National Park in northwestern Wales was established in 1951 as the third national park in Britain , following the Peak District and the Lake District . It covers 827 square miles ( 2 @,@ 140 km2 ) of the mountains of Snowdonia and has 37 miles ( 60 km ) of coastline . The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park was established the following year to protect the spectacular coastal scenery of West Wales . It includes <unk> Island , the <unk> estuary and the Preseli Hills , as well as the entire length of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path . The Brecon Beacons National Park was established five years later and extends across the southern part of Powys , the northwestern part of Monmouthshire and parts of eastern Carmarthenshire . In each case , the park authority acts as a special purpose local authority and exercises planning control over residential and industrial development in the park . The authorities have a duty to conserve the natural beauty of the area , and to promote opportunities for members of the public to enjoy and appreciate the park 's special qualities . 
 Wales also has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty . These differ from National Parks in that the authorities have a duty to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape but do not have an obligation to promote the enjoyment of the public and additionally , they have no control over planning . In 1956 , the Gower Peninsula became the first designated AONB in Britain . Other AONBs are : the whole of Anglesey ; the Llŷn Peninsula ; the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley ; and the Wye Valley , part of which is in England . 
 Wales has many waterfalls , including some of the most striking in the United Kingdom . One such is the 240 ft ( 73 m ) Pistyll Rhaeadr near the village of <unk> @-@ ym @-@ <unk> . It is formed as a mountain stream drops over a cliff and changes character to a lowland river , the Afon Rhaeadr . The site has been designated by the Countryside Council for Wales as the 1000th Site of Special Scientific Interest in Wales , because of its importance to an understanding of Welsh geomorphology . The 19th @-@ century English author George Borrow remarked of the waterfall , " I never saw water falling so gracefully , so much like thin , beautiful threads , as here . " 
 = Lucky Star ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Lucky Star " is a song by American singer Madonna from her eponymous debut studio album Madonna ( 1983 ) . Originally released in the United Kingdom on September 8 , 1983 by Sire Records , it was the fourth single from the album . The song also appears on her greatest hits compilations The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) and Celebration ( 2009 ) . " Lucky Star " was written by Madonna and produced by Reggie Lucas . However , during recording , Madonna was not impressed by Lucas ' version . She called her then @-@ boyfriend John " Jellybean " Benitez to remix the track according to her ideas . " Lucky Star " is a medium @-@ paced dance track and combines the heavy beats of a drum with the sounds of a guitar played in a high riff . The lyrics juxtapose the male body with the heavenly stars in the sky . 
 Both contemporary and modern critics praised the song , heralding it as the introduction to upbeat dance music . " Lucky Star " became Madonna 's first top @-@ five hit on the Billboard Hot 100 , when it reached the peak position of number four , becoming the second single in her record @-@ breaking string of 17 consecutive top @-@ ten hits . It had already become Madonna 's first number @-@ one song on the Billboard dance charts , when it peaked the chart alongside the previously released single " Holiday " . 
 The music video portrayed Madonna dancing in front of a white background , accompanied by her dancers . After the video was released , Madonna 's style and mannerisms became a fashion trend among the younger generation . Scholars noted that in the video , Madonna portrayed herself as narcissistic and an ambiguous character . She referred to herself as the lucky star , unlike the lyrical meaning of the song . Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances , most recently at the Rebel Heart Tour ( 2015 – 16 ) . It has also been covered by a number of artists . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1983 , Madonna was recording her first studio album with Warner Music producer Reggie Lucas and her then boyfriend John " Jellybean " Benitez . However , she did not have that much new material to ensure a full LP album . Lucas produced a number of songs for the album , namely " Borderline " , " Burning Up " , " Physical Attraction " , " I Know It " , " Think of Me " and lastly " Lucky Star " . The song was written by Madonna for DJ Mark Kamins , who previously promised to play the track at his club Danceteria , where he worked as a DJ . However , the track was instead used by Madonna for her debut album , which she planned to call Lucky Star . She believed that " Lucky Star " song , along with " Borderline " , were the perfect foundation for her album . But problems arose after recording the song . Madonna was unhappy with the way the final version turned out . According to her , Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the songs . This led to a dispute between the two and after finishing the album , Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna 's specifications . Hence , Madonna brought Benitez to remix " Borderline " and " Lucky Star " , along with some of the other recorded tracks . In a later interview , Benitez reflected back on the recording sessions and commented , 
 " She was unhappy with the whole damn thing , so I went in and sweetened up a lot of music for her , adding some guitars to ' Lucky Star ' , some voices , some magic . [ ... ] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her . When we would play back ' Holiday ' or ' Lucky Star ' , you could see that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded . You wanted to help her , you know ? As much as she could be a bitch , when you were in groove with her , it was very cool , very creative . " 
 = = Release and composition = = 
 " Lucky Star " was initially decided to be released as the third single from the album , but " Holiday " had already become a dance @-@ hit in the United States . Hence it was released as the fourth single from the album . Music executive Jeff Ayeroff , who was instrumental in green @-@ lighting Madonna 's career , recalled how Madonna initially didn 't want to release " Lucky Star " as a single . He says that around that time Madonna was getting sued and needed money , so he told her " Let me release ' Lucky Star ' , and I guarantee that you 'll sell enough records to pay that off . " According to Ayeroff , he was right because " ' Lucky Star ' broke the first album wide open . " 
 Musically a medium @-@ paced dance track , " Lucky Star " starts off with a sparkle of synth note and is followed by heavy beats of electronic drum and handclaps . A guitar is played in high riff and a bubbling bass synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound . The song revolves around the " star light , star bright " hook for more than a minute , before going to the chorus . According to author Rikky Rooksby , the lyrics are repetitive and inane and revolves around the transparent ambiguity of the stars and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky . " Lucky Star " is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate dance tempo of 108 beats per minute . It is set in the key of G major with Madonna 's voice spanning from the tonal nodes of G3 to F ♯ 5 . The song has a basic sequence of G – A – B ♭ – D – E ♭ – F ♯ as its basic chord progression . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 Author J. Randy Taraborrelli , in his biography of Madonna , called the song as " fluffy , dance @-@ able , but forgettable . " However he noted the song 's ingenuity which he credited to come from its simplicity and dance @-@ music nature . Author Rikky Rooksby noted that Madonna had a " cutesy " voice in the song and compared her vocals with those of singer Cyndi Lauper 's . Author Simon Gage of the book Queer noted that the song was a " happy disco number " . The song was appreciated by authors Santiago Fouz @-@ Hernández and Freya Jarman @-@ Ivens , who complimented it in their book Madonna 's Drowned Worlds . They noted that with songs like " Lucky Star " and " Burning Up " ( 1983 ) , Madonna introduced a " style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to future gay audiences . " English tenor and academic John Potter , in his book The Cambridge companion to singing , commented that " Lucky Star " is a soft @-@ soul , disco @-@ influenced style song but criticized the song 's reverb and double tracking which he believed made the song " de @-@ personalized " . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the track had " unknowingly prefaced her recent foray into the glittery halls of electronic @-@ pop . " Bill Lamb from About.com described the song , along with " Holiday " and " Borderline , " as " state of the art dance @-@ pop . " While reviewing Madonna 's 1990 compilation The Immaculate Collection , David Browne from Entertainment Weekly complimented the remixed version of the song . Rock critique Robert Christgau , while reviewing The Immaculate Collection , called the song " blessed " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic described the song as effervescent .

 = = Music video = = 
 The music video was directed by Arthur Pierson , and was produced by Glenn Goodwin , while Wayne Isham was in charge of photography . At the time of the song 's release , Madonna 's style of dress was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and her fans . The most prominent among her fashion accessories were the crucifixes she wore as earrings and necklaces . Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is " kind of offbeat and interesting . I mean , everything I do is sort of tongue @-@ in @-@ cheeks . Besides , the crucifixes seem to go with my name . " In reality , she was trying to find a separate image for herself , being inspired by then artists like Boy George , Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie , and their constantly shifting image and persona . Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV — launched in 1981 — was instrumental in popularizing her image . 
 The rush for Madonna 's fashion started with the music video for " Lucky Star " . In the video , Madonna wore an all @-@ black outfit with leggings , ankle boots , and belly button , with her tangled hair tied in a floppy black ribbon . This was coupled with a shiny black miniskirt , an earring on her right ear , cut @-@ off gloves and rubber bangles . Madonna 's friend Erika Belle was credited with designing the outfit , although biographer Mary Cross noted that Madonna was after all wearing her day @-@ to @-@ day outfit . Mary Lambert , then a Rhode Island School of Design graduate , was decided for directing the video . However , Arthur Pierson replaced her as the director . Warner Bros. gave Pierson a small budget to make the video , shot in an afternoon . Madonna 's brother , Christopher Ciccone , is a back @-@ up dancer in the video . In his book Life with My Sister Madonna he says that although he was only paid $ 200 to dance in the video , at the time he was " just happy to be part of it . " The video starts with the close @-@ up of Madonna 's face , as she slides her sunglasses down her nose . This scene was a reference to the character of Lolita in Stanley Kubrick 's 1962 film of the same name , and Audrey Hepburn in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany 's ( 1961 ) . The image then fades to white , denoting the celestial stars dazzle , and then resumes itself in color . Madonna is shown dancing against a stark white background , along with closeups of her mesmerised gaze . She is accompanied by Belle and brother Christopher , as backup dancers . The video ends with the initial black @-@ and @-@ white image repeated , but in retrograde , as Madonna puts back on the sunglasses . The taking down and putting up of those sunglasses provided a frame to contain the song , functioning like a curtain that marks the opening and closing of a stage performance . 
 Dance historian Sally Banes , in her book Before , between , and beyond : three decades of dance writing , noted that the video portrayed Madonna as both the subject and the object of the song . She believed that in the video , Madonna taking off her sunglasses symbolized herself as a movie star , thus creating an ambiguous characterization of herself , and a narcissistic theme . Author Peter Goodwin , in his book Television under the Tories : Broadcasting Policy 1979 – 1997 , commented that although " Lucky Star " is not a narrative video , in the clip Madonna plays at least four characters : — the person in sunglasses looking ; a break @-@ dancing girl ; an androgynous social dancer ; and a seductress . The juxtaposition of all these characterizations portray Madonna as a narcissistic self @-@ lover . Images of Madonna 's body writhing against the white background generates the question whether she is addressing her lover or herself in the song . According to Goodman , Madonna created an eroticized woman for her own pleasure only . Cathy Smith from Time magazine noted that " [ s ] he 's sexy , but she doesn 't need men [ ... ] she 's kind of there all by herself . "

 " Lucky Star " has been a setlist staple on four of Madonna 's concert tours : The Virgin Tour ( 1985 ) , the Who 's That Girl World Tour ( 1987 ) , the Confessions Tour ( 2006 ) , and the Rebel Heart Tour ( 2015 – 16 ) . On The Virgin Tour , Madonna performed the song wearing an entirely black costume , consisting of a crop top worn beneath a vest , fringed elbow length gloves , a fringed miniskirt , leggings , and low heel leather boots . She also wore a crucifix earring in one ear and a silver cross pattée was pinned to the right shoulder of her vest . Madonna sang the original version of the song , and pranced around the stage while showing her stomach . The performance was included in the Madonna Live : The Virgin Tour VHS , released in 1985 . At the Who 's That Girl World Tour , " Lucky Star " was performed as the second song of the set list . Madonna wore a black bustier like the music video to her single " Open Your Heart " ( 1987 ) . Her hair was platinum blond and in a big bushy shape . The performance of " Lucky Star " included a disco ball spinning above the stage , as Madonna and her dancers moved around it as the light from the ball flickered on them like a star . Two different performances are found in Ciao Italia : Live from Italy tour video filmed at Stadio Communale in Turin , Italy on September 4 , 1987 and the Who 's That Girl : Live in Japan tour video filmed at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo , Japan on June 22 , 1987 . 
 On the Confessions Tour , " Lucky Star " was performed with Madonna dressed in a purple and white leotard , designed by Jean @-@ Paul Gaultier . Following the performance of " La Isla Bonita " Madonna lies face @-@ down on the stage . Her dancers wrap a cape around her that proclaim the word " Dancing Queen " at the back . The intro to " Lucky Star " is heard , Madonna gets up and faces the audience . The lights go off and Madonna opens the cape to reveal the inside of the cape to be lit . Her backup singers join her and together they move around the stage , while singing the song . Towards the end of the song , Madonna also sings the chorus of the next performance , " Hung Up " . The performance was included on both the CD and the DVD version of The Confessions Tour , released in 2007 . Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine compared Madonna 's performance of " Lucky Star " as " a soul butterfly fluttering to the disco heavens during a remix of [ the song ] that actually makes [ it ] sound good . " Thomas Inskeep from Stylus called the performance fresh . Christian John Wikane from PopMatters was not impressed with the performance ; he felt that singing the song over the newly arranged chord progression , is cold and pairing the original arrangement with the ABBA sample is " [ a ] match not made in heaven , though Madonna 's skin @-@ tight , ABBA @-@ esque jump suit is an amusing <unk> . " 
 On the Rebel Heart Tour , " Lucky Star " was performed in a flamenco @-@ style medley with " Dress You Up " , " Into the Groove " and " Everybody " . During the sequence the singer dressed by in a Latin and gypsy inspired dress , created by Alessandro Michele for Gucci consisting off a shawl , flamenco hat , lace , skirts and jacquard bodysuit .

 " Lucky Star " was featured in the 1988 movie Running on Empty in the scene where River Phoenix 's character is in music class . It was used in the 2000 British movie Snatch , directed by Guy Ritchie who fathered a child with Madonna during the making of the film .

 = 1973 Kentucky Derby = 
 The 1973 Kentucky Derby was the 99th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville , Kentucky . Secretariat won the Derby in a record time of 1 : 59 2 ⁄ 5 , 2 1 ⁄ 2 lengths ahead of Sham , while Our Native finished in third position . Of the thirteen horses that entered and started the race , all horses completed the event . The event was viewed in person by a then @-@ record crowd of 134 @,@ 476 , while also being broadcast both on television and over the radio . 
 In the days leading up to the race , Secretariat was seen as the favorite to win by many ; however there were doubts about him following a third @-@ place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby . In the wake of Secretariat 's loss , Angle Light and , in particular , Sham were the horses that were seen as the most likely to win the Derby , aside from Secretariat . Many sportswriters believed that the horses in the field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken . 
 Shecky Greene took the lead first and led for the majority of the first seven furlongs . Sham took the lead from Shecky Greene near the three quarter mile mark . As the horses entered the homestretch , Secretariat passed Sham in the final furlong and distanced himself to consolidate his lead . Secretariat would go on to win the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in the succeeding weeks , thus becoming the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing . 
 = = Pre @-@ race coverage = = 
 Thirteen horses entered the Derby , which could have at most twenty participants . Horse owners had to pay a final entry fee of $ 2 @,@ 500 to have their horses officially entered . The field was larger than anticipated because of new entries following Secretariat 's loss at the Wood Memorial Stakes in New York . 
 The Wood Memorial had been the last prep race for three year @-@ olds before the Kentucky Derby . It was a 1 1 ⁄ 8 mile contest held two weeks prior at Aqueduct Racetrack . Angle Light , whom groom Edward Sweat called a " very quiet horse , " won the race by a length ahead of Sham , while Secretariat finished in third , four lengths behind . Secretariat 's third @-@ place finish led spectators and sportswriters to question his ability and health ; but it was later thought that his performance in the Wood had been affected by a mouth abscess discovered prior to the race . It was his first defeat since he had finished fourth in his first race and had been relegated from first to second place because of an infraction during the Champagne Stakes , both of which occurred during his two @-@ year old campaign . 
 Secretariat was nonetheless the morning line favorite of the Derby entrants , despite losing the Wood . This was because he had been 1972 American Horse of the Year for a two @-@ year @-@ old campaign that featured seven victories in nine starts . Secretariat also won the two races he had entered prior to the Wood Memorial , the Gotham and Bay Shore Stakes . Sham 's trainer , Frank " Pancho " Martin , stated that Secretariat was the horse to beat and the only way to " knock " the horse was to beat him . 
 Sham , who had won the Santa Anita Derby , was seen as the most formidable challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory . Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood , Angle Light was seen as a threat to win . Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin , along with as Secretariat , and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes . Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season , causing him to be named as a contender . Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene , who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes , were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline , which also resulted in their odds being coupled . Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks . <unk> , who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby , was initially entered in the race , but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel . None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner . 
 Florida Derby winner Royal and Regal had been suffering some problems with his feet going into the race and was seen as a horse that could potentially be scratched before the race began . Shecky Greene , Angle Light , and Royal and Regal were thought to be the only horses in the field that had " appreciable early speed " and would challenge to be the leader out of the gates . My Gallant was to be ridden by Angel Cordero , but Cordero was suspended for ten days starting the day of the Derby for a rules infraction on a race on May 2 . Braulio Baeza was chosen to jockey My Gallant , after being dropped by the owners of Shecky Greene in advance of the race because they were unsure whether that horse would be entered in to the Derby . Larry Adams was ultimately selected as the jockey for Shecky Greene . With the speed of the horses entered , many thought that course record of 2 : 00 would be broken . 
 Chicago Tribune writer David Condon chose Shecky Greene to win the race because he felt the course was suited for him and because his great grandfather was Bull Lea , who sired three Derby winners . Condon picked Warbucks as his second @-@ place finisher because Warbucks ' trainer , Don Combs , trained the 1970 Kentucky Derby winner Dust Commander and his jockey , Bill <unk> , was " long overdue " for a win and would have Warbucks near the front . Gerald <unk> of the Washington Post believed Sham could win the race if he allowed Shecky Greene or Royal and Regal lead the majority of the race and made a move towards the end . <unk> picked Sham to win and My Gallant to finish second .

 Robert " Bobby " Peel ( 12 February 1857 – 12 August 1941 ) was an English professional cricketer who played first @-@ class cricket for Yorkshire between 1883 and 1897 . Primarily a left @-@ arm spin bowler , Peel was also an effective left @-@ handed batsman who played in the middle order . Between 1884 and 1896 , he was regularly selected to represent England , playing 20 Test matches in which he took 101 wickets . Over the course of his career , he scored 12 @,@ 191 runs and took 1 @,@ 775 wickets in first @-@ class cricket . A match @-@ winning bowler , particularly when conditions favoured his style , Peel generally opened the attack , an orthodox tactic for a spinner at the time , and was highly regarded by critics . 
 Peel began playing for Yorkshire in 1883 but , after a successful debut , was overshadowed in the team by Edmund Peate and often played only a minor role with the ball . Improvements in his batting and his excellence as a fielder kept him in the team and when Peate was sacked for drunkenness in 1887 , Peel became Yorkshire 's main spinner . He had already played for England , touring Australia with two professional teams , although he did not play a Test in England until 1888 . Over the following years he regularly took over 100 wickets in each season and often played in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players matches . He was generally Yorkshire 's leading bowler — until the emergence of George Hirst , he generally received little support from other members of the attack — and often among their leading batsmen . His best season in county cricket came in 1896 , when he recorded the double of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets , and made his highest first @-@ class score of 210 . Among his notable feats in Tests , he bowled England to victory after they had followed on in Australia in 1894 – 95 and took six for 23 in his final Test . The first English cricketer to reach 100 wickets against Australia , in 1894 – 95 he also became the first player who failed to score in four successive Test innings . 
 As a player , Peel was very popular and admirers often entertained him socially ; he became well known for liking alcohol . On the morning of the match that England won after following on , Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up . In 1897 , he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match . Although it is unclear what exactly happened — Peel said he slipped when fielding , but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave , bowled a ball in the wrong direction — he never played for the county again . Decades later , a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away . Historians consider the story unlikely , and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter . Peel continued to play and coach cricket for most of his life and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again . Among his other jobs , he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill . He died in 1941 at the age of 84 .

 Peel was born in Churwell , a village close to Morley , on 12 February 1857 . He was the son of a miner , and Peel himself worked in the mines for a time . From the age of 16 , he played with increasing frequency for the Churwell cricket team , and by 1882 was part of the Yorkshire Colts . At the time , Ted Peate was the first @-@ choice left @-@ arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team , and his presence restricted Peel 's opportunities . An injury to Peate allowed Peel to make his first @-@ class debut for Yorkshire against Surrey at Sheffield on 10 July 1882 . Peel took nine wickets in the game , including five for 83 ( five wickets taken while conceding 83 runs ) in the second innings . Lord Hawke — who assumed the captaincy of Yorkshire later that season — subsequently described Peel 's debut as one of the most impressive for Yorkshire . 
 Peel played regularly alongside Peate between 1883 and 1886 . He had a junior role , and his bowling was used sparingly ; in five seasons he took 163 wickets for Yorkshire , and he only took over 50 first @-@ class wickets in a season once before 1887 . His obituary in Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack in 1942 stated : " Yorkshire were singularly rich in bowling talent , so that [ Peel ] had to wait several years before attaining real distinction " . Peel retained his place through his ability as a batsman and fielder ; in his history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club , R. S. Holmes judges that Peel was " brilliant " as a fielder and that it was " probably the marked improvement in [ his ] batting which first secured him a place in the County eleven . " He had occasional success with the ball , for example taking eleven for 87 in the match against Gloucestershire in 1884 — a match in which Peate did not play . Meanwhile , his batting average gradually improved until it reached the mid @-@ 20s in 1887 . At the time , the Yorkshire team was generally inconsistent . 
 = = = Test debut = = = 
 During the English winter of 1884 – 85 , Peel was included in the team which toured Australia under the management of Alfred Shaw , Arthur Shrewsbury and James Lillywhite . English teams that toured Australia at this time were not composed exclusively of the best cricketers in England . The 1884 – 85 English team , like most earlier tours , contained only professional cricketers ; less usually , the team contained nine players who , critics judged , would likely have been in a full @-@ strength England side . Much of the cricket was overshadowed by off @-@ field clashes with the Australian team that had toured England in 1884 ; the disputes mainly concerned each team 's share of match receipts . Peel was required to bowl a large number of overs ; in minor matches , mainly played against the odds ( where the opposition teams included more players than the English team ) , he took 321 wickets at an average of less than five . In first @-@ class matches , he was the leading wicket @-@ taker with 35 wickets , but his average of 19 @.@ 22 was relatively high . 
 During the tour , Peel made his Test debut and played all five matches . His first Test began on 12 December 1884 . Opening the bowling , took eight wickets in the match ; in the second innings , he took five for 51 on a pitch affected by rain . He was less effective in the remaining games , ending the series with 21 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 47 , and scored 37 runs at an average of 7 @.@ 40 . He was not selected in the next Test matches played by England , against Australia in 1886 , and missed the next English tour of Australia , in the winter of 1886 – 87 , again organised by Shaw , Shrewsbury and Lillywhite .

 In 1886 , Lord Hawke became full @-@ time captain of the Yorkshire team . One of his first actions , with the support of the Yorkshire committee , was to sack Peate early in the 1887 season . At the time , many professional cricketers drank heavily and the Yorkshire team had many players who liked alcohol . Peate had been the chief offender for some years , and while he remained Yorkshire 's leading left @-@ arm spinner , his disruptive influence and disregard for authority was having a negative influence on the team . The historian Mick Pope suggests that Hawke may have felt able to act as he knew that Peel was available as a replacement . With Peate unavailable , Peel began to play a leading role . In the 1887 season , a year in which good weather produced conditions generally in favour of batsmen , he took 85 wickets at an average of 17 @.@ 32 . He also improved his record with the bat , scoring 835 runs at 25 @.@ 30 . According to his Wisden obituary , he recorded at least two match @-@ winning performances that season : against Kent he took five for 14 and scored 43 runs in a low @-@ scoring game ; in the match against Leicestershire he took eleven wickets for 51 . Twice in 1887 , Peel appeared for the professional Players in their prestigious match against the Gentlemen , the first time he had been selected for the team . He played regularly for them until 1897 . 
 During the winter of 1887 – 88 , the Melbourne Cricket Club organised another English tour of Australia . The team was mainly composed of amateurs , but Peel was included with three other professionals . At the same time , a rival English team , organised by Shaw , Shrewsbury and Lillywhite , also toured Australia . The resulting confusion affected the attendances at games and the financial success of both tours . The lack of success for the Australian team in this period lessened the quality of Tests and , amid declining spectator interest , touring teams no longer generated profits . In his history of early international cricket , Malcolm Knox observes that " two England teams were coming when Australian cricket was not strong enough to host one " . Peel took 49 first @-@ class wickets on the tour , finishing second in the bowling averages for the team , and scored 449 runs in first @-@ class matches at an average of 34 @.@ 53 , which placed him second in the batting averages . Although various matches were played by both teams against combined Australian teams , only one official Test match was played on the tour . The best eleven players from both English teams combined to defeat an Australian team which had several leading players missing ; later writers questioned whether the match should have the status of a Test . Peel took nine wickets in the match , including five for 18 in the first innings as Australia were bowled out for 42 runs . 
 = = = Home Test matches = = = 
 In 1888 , an unusually rainy summer led to wet pitches which made batting difficult . Peel took 171 first @-@ class wickets , the first time he had passed 100 wickets in a season , at an average of 12 @.@ 22 . He also topped the Yorkshire bowling averages for county matches . His best performance came against Nottinghamshire , when he took eight for 12 in the first innings on the way to fourteen for 33 in the match ; for the Players against the Gentlemen , he took six for 34 . In the season , Peel scored 669 runs at 13 @.@ 38 . That year , an Australian team toured England and Peel was chosen for his first Test matches in England . The Australian team , missing several key players , won the first Test match before England recovered to win the final two games . Playing all three Tests , Peel took 24 wickets at an average of 7 @.@ 54 . In the decisive third Test , he took seven for 31 in the first Australian innings and finished with match figures of eleven for 68 . Wisden noted that Peel " bowled remarkably well " in the second Test ; it stated that , in the third , " the Australians were helpless against Peel " and judged his overall performance " altogether admirable " . Peel 's performance in 1888 resulted in his selection , prior to the 1889 season , as one of Wisden 's " Six Great Bowlers " ; this was the first time Wisden had made the award which in later years became the prestigious Wisden Cricketer of the Year . The citation said : " During his early career [ Peel ] was contemporary with Peate , and naturally did not get the same chances that have fallen to his lot during the last two years . He has won his way to the very front rank by sheer merit , and bats and fields so well that he would be worth playing in any eleven if he could not get a wicket . " 
 Yorkshire had a poor season in 1889 , finishing second @-@ from @-@ last in the list of counties ; writing in 1904 , Holmes described this as " the low @-@ water mark of Yorkshire cricket " . The team lost twelve games and won eight , affected by the decline of several leading players . The fielding was poor ; Peel had twelve catches dropped from his bowling in one game . Only Peel had a good season , and Holmes pondered : " Where would Yorkshire have been without Peel ? " He took 130 wickets at an average of 16 @.@ 39 ; with the bat , he scored 991 runs , his best seasonal aggregate to that point , at an average of 22 @.@ 02 . He came top of both the Yorkshire batting and bowling averages and had three times more wickets than any other player . Additionally , he was the only player in the team to score a century in matches against another county ; against Middlesex at Lord 's , he scored 158 runs , his maiden first @-@ class hundred . At the end of the season , Hawke ended the careers of several players ; the Yorkshire president told the committee that the " demon drink " was to blame . 
 In 1890 , Peel took 171 wickets at an average of 13 @.@ 71 and scored 817 runs at 18 @.@ 56 . He missed several Yorkshire games while playing representative matches , but was comfortably their leading bowler with 91 wickets for the county — the next best figure was 37 wickets . The Australians toured England again that year , and Peel took six wickets in the first Test at Lord 's . The touring team 's results were poor , which resulted in a loss of prestige for the Test matches . The newly formed County Championship was a rival attraction , and several players were withdrawn from the England team to play for their counties — Andrew Stoddart , for example , was withdrawn by Middlesex before the first Test . With Middlesex due to play Yorkshire , Stoddart was also withdrawn from the second Test ; upon finding this out , Lord Hawke withdrew his Yorkshire players from the England XI , including Peel . In the Middlesex – Yorkshire game , Peel dismissed Stoddart twice . The third Test was rained off completely . 
 During the 1891 season , Peel took 99 wickets at 17 @.@ 35 and scored 971 runs at 24 @.@ 27 , including his second first @-@ class century , but Yorkshire again performed poorly . This prompted a reorganisation of the club over the following two years . Peel led the Yorkshire batting averages and came second in the bowling . In the winter of 1891 – 92 , he was included in the touring team to Australia organised by Lord Sheffield and captained by W. G. Grace . He came fourth in the team 's bowling averages with 15 wickets at 18 @.@ 86 and finished fifth in the batting averages with 229 runs at 25 @.@ 44 . He played in all three Test matches , taking six wickets at 21 @.@ 33 , and scoring 134 runs at 26 @.@ 80 . In the third game , he scored 83 , his first Test match fifty , but did not bowl ; The Lancashire cricketer Johnny Briggs bowled Australia out on a rain @-@ damaged pitch but this was England 's only victory as Australia won the series 2 – 1 . 
 In first @-@ class matches during 1892 , Peel scored 772 runs at 19 @.@ 79 and took 121 wickets at 16 @.@ 80 . Additionally , in a non @-@ first @-@ class games against Leicestershire , he scored 226 as well as taking five wickets in Leicestershire 's first innings . In the 1893 season , he took slightly more wickets at a lower average ( 126 at 14 @.@ 51 ) but his run aggregate fell to 550 runs at 13 @.@ 75 . He was part of a successful Yorkshire team . The county won their first official County Championship title and the team was no longer as dependent on Peel with the ball — Ted Wainwright took more wickets than he did . The Australians toured England once again , but Peel played in just one of the three Test matches . He did not take a wicket , did little with the bat , and was left out of the team for the second Test . As the Australians had proved poor on the field , Lord Hawke withdrew Peel and Stanley Jackson from the team for the third Test so that they could play for Yorkshire . In 1894 , Peel scored 699 runs at 16 @.@ 25 , failing to score a half @-@ century . With the ball , he took 145 wickets at 13 @.@ 44 . During the season , he was awarded a benefit match at Bradford , which raised £ 2 @,@ 000 . The retirement of George Ulyett that season made Peel the team 's senior professional , an important position at the time . 
 = = = Australian tour of 1894 – 95 = = = 
 During the 1894 season , the Melbourne Cricket Club and the trustees of the Sydney Cricket Ground combined to organise another English tour of Australia . They asked Andrew Stoddart to raise a team , and Peel was chosen . Peel was successful in the opening first @-@ class matches of the tour . He took five wickets in innings against South Australia , Victoria and New South Wales ; after three games , he had taken 23 wickets , and he and Briggs provided the main threat with the ball . Against Victoria , Peel also scored 48 and 65 with the bat . He played a leading role in the first Test , which Wisden described as " probably the most sensational match ever played either in Australia or in England " . Australia scored 586 in their first innings ; England scored 325 and , following @-@ on , scored 437 to leave a target of 177 to win . At the end of the fifth day 's play , Australia had scored 113 for two , and were overwhelming favourites to win . 
 Until then , Peel had been ineffective in the match . Several of the England team , including Peel , drank heavily in the night thinking the game was lost , but overnight rain drastically changed the nature of the pitch . Peel had not sobered up when play was scheduled to start , although Stoddart had given him a cold shower to speed up the process , and arrived late . As another player was also missing , the start was delayed ; this allowed the pitch to dry further and therefore become more sticky and difficult to bat on . Peel had slept through the overnight storm and was astonished when he saw the state of the pitch , suspecting someone had watered it . He reportedly said : " Gi ' me t <unk> , Mr Stoddart . Ah 'll get t <unk> out before lunch " . With Briggs , Peel bowled Australia out , taking five wickets to go with the one he took the previous evening to finish with six for 67 . Australia scored 166 and lost by ten runs . One Australian newspaper reported that Peel " found the match rather a trying one , and came in fairly done up " . The English team were praised for fighting back , but the role of the weather was acknowledged , and some critics blamed the Australians for batting badly in the second innings . 
 England won the second Test ; after both teams ' first innings were low @-@ scoring , Peel , appearing at number six , batted for 150 minutes in the second innings to score 53 without hitting any fours . Stoddart 's 173 set Australia a big target , and Peel took four for 77 to bowl England to a 94 @-@ run win . Australia won the third Test by 382 runs ; Peel took four wickets in the game , but was dismissed in both innings without scoring . It is possible that around this time , Peel was threatened by Stoddart with expulsion from the tour owing to his drinking . Australia won the fourth Test to level the series at 2 – 2 . In very favourable bowling conditions , Peel took three for 74 but Australia totalled 284 . England were bowled out twice to give Australia an innings victory , and Peel suffered his second consecutive pair ( i.e. failing to score in either innings ) . He was the first player to score four successive ducks in Test cricket , a succession of failures not repeated until 1936 , and this remained the record number of successive ducks until 1985 . 
 Amid great public interest — the game was advertised as " the match of the century " — and great tension , the decisive final Test match was played . Peel took four wickets in Australia 's first innings , then scored 73 runs in the first innings , sharing a 162 @-@ run partnership with Archie MacLaren . In Australia 's second innings , Peel took three more wickets to return match figures of seven for 203 in 94 overs . Jack Brown scored a century to guide England towards a target of 297 , and Peel eventually hit the winning runs . Peel ended the series with 27 wickets at 26 @.@ 70 , second in the averages behind Tom Richardson , and 168 runs at 18 @.@ 67 , placing him sixth in the batting averages . David Frith suggests that this series was vital in establishing the importance of Test cricket , and that the interest felt in both England and Australia , and the coverage by the press , set up the pattern and expectations of future Test series . In all first @-@ class games , Peel scored 421 runs at 21 @.@ 05 , to be eighth in the averages , and took 57 wickets at 25 @.@ 28 , placing him third in the averages behind Richardson and Briggs , although the latter had fewer wickets . 
 = = = Final seasons = = = 
 Returning to England for the 1895 season , Peel took 180 wickets , the most he took in any season , at an average of 14 @.@ 97 . This included the best figures of his career when he took nine for 22 against Somerset ; in total he took fifteen wickets in that match , and Wisden described this performance as " causing a sensation " . He led the Yorkshire bowling averages , and George Hirst became his regular partner opening the bowling . Both men took over 130 wickets for Yorkshire that season and the pair established an effective bowling partnership until the end of Peel 's career . With the bat in 1895 , Peel scored 847 runs at 17 @.@ 28 . In 1896 , Peel performed the double of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets for the only time in his first @-@ class career . In a dry summer which favoured batsmen , his wickets came at a higher average : he took 128 at 17 @.@ 50 , but he scored 1 @,@ 206 runs at 30 @.@ 15 , his best batting aggregate and average in an English season . He came third in the Yorkshire batting averages , and often succeeded in scoring runs when the team were under pressure . Against Warwickshire , he scored 210 not out , the highest first @-@ class innings of his career , and one of four centuries in the innings , out of a Yorkshire total of 887 . A contemporary critic described Peel 's innings as the best ever played by a left @-@ hander . He shared a partnership of 292 for the eighth wicket with Lord Hawke . As of 2014 , this remains Yorkshire 's highest partnership for that wicket , and the fifth @-@ highest eighth @-@ wicket partnership recorded in first @-@ class cricket . He also took a hat @-@ trick against Kent . 
 The Australians played three Tests in England in 1896 , but Peel only played in the final one . Before the match , several English professionals — not including Peel — threatened to strike , but the dispute was settled . Then , before the third day of the game , the pitch was mysteriously watered , becoming very difficult for batting . Australia only needed a small total , but Peel believed that he could bowl them out . He took six of the last seven Australian wickets at a cost of 23 runs to bowl England to victory ; in recognition of this achievement , Stanley Jackson , a team @-@ mate in this game , gave him a gold watch @-@ chain ornament . He was less successful with the bat , scoring a pair once again . This was his final Test match . In total , Peel played 20 Tests , scoring 427 runs at an average of 14 @.@ 72 and taking 101 wickets at 16 @.@ 98 . 
 In January 1897 , the Australian Fred Spofforth claimed in a letter to the Sporting Life that Peel occasionally threw the ball , an accusation he also levelled at Tom McKibbin , an Australian bowler . Spofforth wrote that Peel " has no need to resort to throwing . I acknowledge that he does not often take to it , still , it is well known to cricketers that at times he does ' shy ' [ throw ] . " Peel denied this and claimed that leading umpires would support him . 
 = = Dismissal by Yorkshire = = 
 In the 1897 season , Peel was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness . Alcohol was popular with many professional cricketers , and the careers of several Yorkshire players in this period , including Peate , had been ended for this reason . Peel was always known to be a heavy drinker , but his behaviour had been tolerated . His fame , brought about by his performances , made the problem worse . Derek Hodgson , in the official Yorkshire club history , writes : " A cheerful , gregarious man , [ Peel ] took to hospitality and entertaining with alacrity and moved in such society , particularly in London , that when one of the foremost journalists of the day asked to see him he was <unk> off by a man who announced himself as ' Peel 's secretary ' , adding : ' He does not like interviews and has little to say . He sent me to take his place . ' " Hodgson observes : " It is not impossible , of course , that Bobby was either shy , or ' indisposed ' at that particular moment " , and suggests that Peel 's downfall , like Peate 's before him , was because he " was too often the toast of the town " . 
 In 1897 , Peel had played regularly until July with some success . He scored 115 against Leicestershire , and took eight for 53 against Kent . He then suffered an injury in a match against Lancashire that caused him to miss around a month of cricket . He returned to the Yorkshire team to play Middlesex at Sheffield on 16 August . In Middlesex 's first innings , Peel took five for 71 , but on the third day , he appeared on the field drunk . Later that day , the Yorkshire committee met and resolved to suspend Peel for the remainder of the season for " presenting himself on the field in a state of intoxication " . According to Anthony Woodhouse , in his history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club , this was not Peel 's first such offence . Contemporary accounts give no indication of trouble on the field involving Peel , but the influential Lord Hawke may have encouraged the press to remain silent . The decision to suspend Peel was made public on 19 August , the following day . 
 There are several conflicting versions of what happened on the field in the Middlesex game . On the morning of 19 August , replying to suggestions that he was drunk , Peel spoke to a newspaper reporter and stated : " Before I went on the ground at Sheffield — I don 't blush to say it — I had two small glasses of gin and water . At luncheon time I had nothing " . Peel said that he opened the bowling with Stanley Jackson and was eventually rested without a word being said to him . He stated that he later slipped twice while fielding , but the cause was that the spikes on his boots were broken . That evening , when he went to collect his wages at the end of the game , the Yorkshire secretary , Joseph Wolstenholme , informed him of the suspension on the grounds that his play was " unsatisfactory " , and when pressed by Peel for an explanation , he told him : " You have had a glass too much " . 
 The cricket writer A. A. Thompson relates a different story told to him fifty years later by Hirst , who was playing in the match . According to this account , Hirst was having breakfast when Peel came in drunk . Anxious that Peel would be seen , and worried about bringing the team into disrepute , Hirst forced Peel to return to bed and went to the ground , where he told Lord Hawke that Peel had been taken ill in the night and would not be able to play . Hawke promised to see Peel that evening and took the twelfth man onto the field . According to Thompson , when Hirst went onto the field , he saw " with dawning dismay that there were not eleven fieldsmen present but twelve . There , his face red , his cap awry , the ball in his hand , stood Peel " . Peel was even more drunk than at breakfast , and Hawke ordered him from the field . Peel replied that he was fine , and according to Hirst bowled a ball to demonstrate his fitness , but in his confusion did so in the wrong direction . Peel was then led from the field . After falling asleep in the hotel , he was advised by Hirst to apologise to Lord Hawke , but refused , claiming that he was indispensable to the team and would be recalled . 
 A different , widely circulated story suggests that Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke . Woodhouse , writing in 1989 , suggested that " it is difficult to ascertain the truth behind this long @-@ standing tale " , while Hodgson observes : " I have never been convinced of this account because it has always seemed to be so much out of character for a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving ' like a gentleman ' even in one 's cups . " Mick Pope writes : " The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust , unproven and such a myth ... that it should have no place in any study of Bobby Peel , the cricketer . " The story originated in a cricket publication , Cricket Quarterly , in 1968 . The historian Rowland Bowen , in an article called " Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897 " , claimed that an " aged Yorkshireman of 85 " told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then . Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen 's information came to him second @-@ hand . The 85 @-@ year @-@ old had not used the word " urinated " but had actually said " pissed at the wicket " , meaning that Peel was drunk ( " pissed " being slang for drunk ) on the pitch ( " at the wicket " ) . Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story , not the new information claimed by Bowen . Rosewater self @-@ published his findings in a book called An Unjust <unk> on Bobby Peel in 1997 . 
 Peel , having concluded that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career , signed a contract to play for Accrington Cricket Club . He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair , that he had been given no opportunity to explain , and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family . In 1900 , he told Cricket magazine that , before his suspension , he had been bedridden for three weeks as a result of an injury he suffered while batting , that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation . He later said of the incident : " [ Lord Hawke ] put his arm around me and escorted me off the field and out of Yorkshire cricket . What a gentleman " . The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was " either very gracious , or exceedingly sarcastic . " Hawke later described Peel 's sacking as " the most decisive action of my whole career ... It had to be done for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket . Nothing ever gave me so much pain . " At the time , Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship , but the team had only two more games to play in that season 's competition , and it was mathematically impossible for them to win . Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked , and that whenever the pair met afterwards , they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity . Although Peel considered himself indispensable , the following year he was replaced by Wilfred Rhodes , who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4 @,@ 184 first @-@ class wickets . Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal , and they supported him rather than believing the reports . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Peel made two further first @-@ class appearances in 1897 after his suspension by Yorkshire . He played in two end @-@ of @-@ season festival games at Hastings , first for the North against the South and then for the Players against the Gentlemen , but did little with bat or ball . In all first @-@ class games that year he took 72 wickets at 19 @.@ 51 and scored 566 runs at 22 @.@ 64 . His only other appearances in first @-@ class cricket came in 1899 , when he played for A. J. Webbe 's XI against Oxford University and for an England XI against the touring Australians . He ended his first @-@ class career with 12 @,@ 191 first @-@ class runs at an average of 19 @.@ 44 and 1 @,@ 775 wickets at 16 @.@ 20 . 
 In 1898 , Peel played for Accrington . His signing was widely reported in the press . Before this , most professionals in league cricket were neither famous names nor particularly good cricketers . According to Pearson , in his survey of club cricket in the north of England , Peel was the first international cricketer to play in a league . He took 80 wickets that season , but only received a third of his salary ; the committee withheld the rest because of unspecified problems during the season . His contract was not renewed and he instead became the professional at Morley . Pearson suggests that Peel 's signing showed the clubs that big @-@ name signings could bring benefits . Peel also accepted a position as a coach at Essex in 1899 , and remained there until at least 1904 . The press suggested that he would qualify for Essex , but he never played for that team . He later became the landlord of a public house in Churwell . In 1923 he resumed his connection with Yorkshire when he undertook a coaching and scouting programme for the county , in association with George Hirst , organised by the Yorkshire Evening News . Peel remained close to the Yorkshire players . When the four Yorkshire members of the English team that toured Australia in 1932 – 33 departed from Leeds , Peel was present and gave each of them a white rose — the symbol of Yorkshire . He attended the funeral of Roy Kilner in 1928 , and was one of many Yorkshire cricketers to attend the memorial service for Lord Hawke in 1938 . Peel continued to play cricket and coach locally into his seventies . In his later years , he worked in a woollen mill in Morley . 
 Peel was married in 1878 ; he and his wife , Annie Louise , were married for over fifty years and had four children , one of whom was killed in the First World War . Peel 's wife died in 1933 . Peel lived until 1941 , when he died at the house of his daughter . Among those who attended his funeral were Hirst and Rhodes . 
 = = Technique and personality = = 
 Wisden said that as a bowler , Peel had a " fine length , easy action and splendid command of spin " , which meant that he " was often a match @-@ winner " . Peel consistently bowled a good length and varied the flight of the ball to deceive batsmen . He also bowled a quicker ball which , in contrast to his usual delivery , travelled in a straight line instead of turning . On a pitch affected by rain , batsmen found him very difficult to face , and he was very successful in these conditions . When bowling on pitches where the ball came more slowly off the surface , Peel often bowled faster ; this pace made it difficult for batsmen to score runs against him even when conditions were in their favour . After he delivered the ball , the spin he imparted often made it curve in the air before it reached the batsman . According to Woodhouse , when bowling , " Peel brought his arm behind his back with a peculiar flourish @-@ like action and then ' whipped the ball down ' " . He generally opened the bowling , including when he played for England . At the time , it was general practice to open the bowling with a fast bowler and a left @-@ arm spinner . 
 Peel was the first English bowler to take 100 Test wickets against Australia . At a time when international matches were relatively rare , his 20 Test matches were a considerable achievement , and it was unusual for a player to tour Australia as often as he did : he went there four times . His main rival as a spinner and for a place in the England team was Johnny Briggs ; Peel bowled faster , which made him harder to hit . Archie MacLaren , who captained England from the late 1890s and was a team @-@ mate and captain of Briggs , described Peel as " the cleverest bowler of my time " . MacLaren stated that Peel thoroughly understood tactics and could spot weaknesses in a batsman 's technique . He concluded : " I place Peel first on my list of great left @-@ handed bowlers on account of his wonderful judgement , his diabolical cleverness and his great natural ability . " When Rhodes took over the role of left @-@ arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team , there was some debate over who out of Peate , Peel and Rhodes was the best left @-@ arm spinner to play for Yorkshire . Historians regard Peel as part of a long @-@ lasting chain of successful Yorkshire left @-@ arm spinners , preceded by Peate and succeeded by Rhodes . 
 Wisden described Peel as a " punishing left @-@ handed batsman " . Batting in the middle order , he was often effective when other batsmen had failed . For England , he most often batted at number six . Wisden also called him " a capital fieldsman , especially at cover @-@ point " . 
 During his playing days , Peel was famous and well @-@ respected — the actor Henry Ainley claimed that the highlight of his life was carrying Peel 's bag . According to the historian David Frith , Peel was not a considerate husband . Frith also suggests that he was sometimes involved in embarrassing situations ; for example , when Ranjitsinhji invited him on a hunting trip , " Peel blasted eight barrels at a hare , removing its legs , an ear and much else before chasing the remnants of the animal into a neighbouring property , still firing away , until all life was extinguished " . Frith believes that Peel had a " perverse " character , exemplified by Lord Hawke 's comment that he showed no pleasure at his many successes . Pearson suggests that some of Peel 's problems may have been connected to depression , but Frith records that he mellowed in later life . 
 = Battle of Grunwald = 
 The Battle of Grunwald , First Battle of Tannenberg or Battle of Žalgiris , was fought on 15 July 1410 during the Polish – Lithuanian – Teutonic War . The alliance of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło ( Jogaila ) and Grand Duke Vytautas ( Witold ; <unk> ) , decisively defeated the German – Prussian Teutonic Knights , led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen . Most of the Teutonic Knights ' leadership were killed or taken prisoner . Although defeated , the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege of their fortress in Marienburg ( Malbork ) and suffered minimal territorial losses at the Peace of Thorn ( 1411 ) ( Toruń ) , with other territorial disputes continuing until the Peace of Melno in 1422 . The knights , however , would never recover their former power , and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands under their control . The battle shifted the balance of power in Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish – Lithuanian union as the dominant political and military force in the region . 
 The battle was one of the largest in Medieval Europe and is regarded as the most important victory in the histories of Poland , Belarus and Lithuania . It has been used as a source of romantic legends and national pride , becoming a larger symbol of struggle against foreign invaders . During the 20th century the battle was used in Nazi and Soviet propaganda campaigns . Only in recent decades have historians moved towards a dispassionate , scholarly assessment of the battle , reconciling the previous narratives , which differed widely by nation . 
 = = Names and sources = = 
 = = = Names = = = 
 The battle was fought in the territory of the monastic state of the Teutonic Order , on the plains between three villages : <unk> ( Grunwald ) to the west , Tannenberg ( <unk> ) to the northeast , and Ludwigsdorf ( <unk> , <unk> ) to the south . Władysław II Jagiełło referred to the site in Latin as in loco conflictus nostri , quem cum <unk> de <unk> <unk> , dicto <unk> . Later Polish chroniclers interpreted the word <unk> as Grünwald , meaning " green forest " in German . The Lithuanians followed suit and translated the name as Žalgiris . The Germans named the battle after Tannenberg ( " fir hill " or " pine hill " in German ) . Thus there are three commonly used names for the battle : German : Schlacht bei Tannenberg , Polish : Bitwa pod <unk> , Lithuanian : <unk> <unk> . Its names in the languages of other involved peoples include Belarusian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> , Russian : <unk> <unk> , Czech : <unk> u <unk> , Romanian : <unk> de la Grünwald . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 = = = Lithuanian Crusade and Polish – Lithuanian union = = = 
 In 1230 the Teutonic Knights , a crusading military order , moved to Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against the pagan Prussian clans . With support from the pope and Holy Roman Emperor , the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s and shifted their attention to the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania . For about 100 years the Knights raided Lithuanian lands , particularly Samogitia , as it separated the Knights in Prussia from their branch in Livonia . While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness , the Knights gained very little territory . The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War ( 1381 – 1384 ) in the Treaty of Dubysa . The territory was used as a bargaining chip to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the internal power struggle . 
 In 1385 Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania agreed to marry Queen Jadwiga of Poland in the Union of Kreva . Jogaila converted to Christianity and was crowned as the King of Poland ( Władysław II Jagiełło ) , thus creating a personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . The official Lithuanian conversion to Christianity removed the religious rationale for the order 's activities in the area . Its grand master , Conrad Zöllner von <unk> , supported by the Hungarian king , Sigismund of Luxemburg , responded by publicly contesting the sincerity of Jogaila 's conversion , bringing the charge to a papal court . The territorial disputes continued over Samogitia , which had been in Teutonic hands since the Peace of Raciąż in 1404 . Poland also had territorial claims against the Knights in Dobrzyń Land and Danzig ( Gdańsk ) , but the two states had been largely at peace since the Treaty of Kalisz ( 1343 ) . The conflict was also motivated by trade considerations : The knights controlled the lower reaches of the three largest rivers ( the Neman , Vistula and Daugava ) in Poland and Lithuania . 
 = = = War , truce and preparations = = = 
 In May 1409 an uprising in Teutonic @-@ held Samogitia started . Lithuania supported it and the knights threatened to invade . Poland announced its support for the Lithuanian cause and threatened to invade Prussia in return . As Prussian troops evacuated Samogitia , Teutonic Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on 6 August 1409 . The Knights hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania separately , and began by invading Greater Poland and Kuyavia , catching the Poles by surprise . The Knights burned the castle at <unk> ( Dobrzyń nad Wisłą ) , captured Bobrowniki after a 14 @-@ day siege , conquered Bydgoszcz ( Bromberg ) and sacked several towns . The Poles organized counterattacks and recaptured Bydgoszcz . The Samogitians attacked Memel ( Klaipėda ) . However , neither side was ready for a full @-@ scale war . 
 Wenceslaus , King of the Romans , agreed to mediate the dispute . A truce was signed on 8 October 1409 and was set to expire on 24 June 1410 . Both sides used this time to prepare for war , gathering troops and engaging in diplomatic maneuvering . Both sides sent letters and envoys accusing each other of various wrongdoings and threats to Christendom . Wenceslaus , who received a gift of 60 @,@ 000 florins from the knights , declared that Samogitia rightfully belonged to the knights and only Dobrzyń Land should be returned to Poland . The knights also paid 300 @,@ 000 ducats to Sigismund of Hungary , who had ambitions regarding the Principality of Moldavia , for mutual military assistance . Sigismund attempted to break the Polish – Lithuanian alliance by offering Vytautas a king 's crown ; Vytautas 's acceptance would have violated the terms of the Ostrów Agreement and created Polish @-@ Lithuanian discord . At the same time , Vytautas managed to obtain a truce from the Livonian Order . 
 By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas had agreed on a common strategy : Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march together towards Marienburg ( Malbork ) , capital of the Teutonic Knights . The Knights , who took a defensive position , did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion — by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig ( Gdańsk ) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards <unk> ( Neman ) . To counter this perceived threat , Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in <unk> ( Świecie ) , a central location from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction rather quickly . Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of <unk> , Rhein ( Ryn ) near <unk> ( <unk> ) , and Memel ( Klaipėda ) . To keep their plans secret and mislead the knights , Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories , thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 The precise number of soldiers involved has proven difficult to establish . None of the contemporary sources provided reliable troop counts . Jan Długosz provided the number of banners , the principal unit of each cavalry : 51 for the knights , 50 for the Poles and 40 for the Lithuanians . However , it is unclear how many men were under each banner . The structure and number of infantry units ( pikemen , archers , crossbowmen ) and artillery units is unknown . Estimates , often biased by political and nationalistic considerations , were produced by various historians . German historians tend to present lower numbers , while Polish historians tend to use higher estimates . The high @-@ end estimates by Polish historian Stefan <unk> of 39 @,@ 000 Polish – Lithuanian and 27 @,@ 000 Teutonic men have been cited in Western literature as " commonly accepted " . 
 While less numerous , the Teutonic army had advantages in discipline , military training and equipment . Their heavy cavalry was among the best in Europe . The Teutonic army was also equipped with bombards that could shoot lead and stone projectiles . Both forces were composed of troops from several states and lands , including numerous mercenaries ; for example , Bohemian mercenaries fought on each side . The knights also invited guest crusaders . Twenty @-@ two different peoples , mostly Germanic , joined them . Teutonic recruits included soldiers from Westphalia , Frisia , Austria , Swabia and Stettin ( Szczecin ) . Two Hungarian nobles , Nicholas II Garay and <unk> of <unk> , brought 200 men for the Knights , but support from Sigismund of Hungary was disappointing . The Polish Crown 's troops included seven Ruthenian banners . 
 Poland brought mercenaries from Moravia and Bohemia . The Czechs produced two full banners , under the command of Jan Sokol of <unk> . Serving among the Czechs was possibly Jan <unk> , future commander of the Hussite forces , who , according to some historians , might have lost an eye . Alexander the Good , ruler of Moldavia , commanded an expeditionary corps . Vytautas gathered troops from Lithuanian , Ruthenian ( modern Belarus and Ukraine ) and Russian lands – one , 36 and 3 banners , respectively . The three Russian banners of Smolensk regiments were part of Lithuanian army , due to Smolensk being part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the period of 1387 – 1514 . The Smolensk regiments were under the command of Władysław II Jagiełło 's brother <unk> , while the contingent of Tatars of the Golden Horde was under the command of the future Khan Jalal ad @-@ Din . The overall commander of the joint Polish – Lithuanian force was King Władysław II Jagiełło ; however , he did not directly participate in the battle . The Lithuanian units were commanded directly by Grand Duke Vytautas , who was second in command , and helped design the grand strategy of the campaign . Vytautas actively participated in the battle , managing both Lithuanian and Polish units . Jan Długosz stated that the low @-@ ranking sword bearer of the Crown , <unk> of <unk> , commanded the Polish army , but that is highly doubtful . More likely , marshal of the Crown Zbigniew of <unk> commanded the Polish troops in the field . 
 = = Course of the battle = = 
 = = = March into Prussia = = = 
 The first stage of the Grunwald campaign was the gathering of all Polish – Lithuanian troops at <unk> , a designated meeting point about 80 km ( 50 mi ) from the Prussian border , where the joint army crossed the Vistula over a pontoon bridge . This maneuver , which required precision and intense coordination among multi @-@ ethnic forces , was accomplished in about a week , from 24 – 30 June 1410 . Polish soldiers from Greater Poland gathered in Poznań , and those from Lesser Poland , in <unk> . On 24 June 1410 Władysław II Jagiełło and Czech mercenaries arrived in <unk> . Three days later the Polish army was already at the meeting place . The Lithuanian army marched out from Vilnius on 3 June and joined the Ruthenian regiments in Hrodna . They arrived in <unk> on the same day the Poles crossed the river . After the crossing , Masovian troops under Siemowit IV and Janusz I joined the Polish – Lithuanian army . The massive force began its march north towards Marienburg ( Malbork ) , capital of Prussia , on 3 July . The Prussian border was crossed on 9 July . 
 The river crossing remained secret until Hungarian envoys , who were attempting to negotiate a peace , informed the Grand Master . As soon as Ulrich von Jungingen grasped the Polish – Lithuanian intentions , he left 3 @,@ 000 men at <unk> ( Świecie ) under Heinrich von Plauen and marched the main force to organize a line of defense on the <unk> River ( <unk> ) near <unk> ( <unk> ) . The river crossing was fortified with stockades . On 11 July , after meeting with his eight @-@ member war council , Władysław II Jagiełło decided against crossing the river at such a strong , defensible position . The army would instead bypass the river crossing by turning east , towards its sources , where no other major rivers separated his army from Marienburg . The march continued east towards <unk> ( <unk> ) , although no attempt was made to capture the town . The Teutonic army followed the <unk> River north , crossed it near Löbau ( <unk> ) and then moved east in parallel with the Polish – Lithuanian army . The latter ravaged the village of <unk> ( <unk> ) . Von Jungingen was so enraged by the atrocities that he swore to defeat the invaders in battle . 
 = = = Battle preparations = = = 
 In the early morning of 15 July 1410 both armies met in an area covering approximately 4 km2 ( 1 @.@ 5 sq mi ) between the villages of Grunwald , Tannenberg ( <unk> ) and Ludwigsdorf ( <unk> ) . The armies formed opposing lines along a northeast – southwest axis . The Polish – Lithuanian army was positioned in front and east of Ludwigsdorf and Tannenberg . Polish heavy cavalry formed the left flank , Lithuanian light cavalry the right flank and various mercenary troops made up the center . Their men were organized in three lines of wedge @-@ shaped formations about 20 men deep . The Teutonic forces concentrated their elite heavy cavalry , commanded by Grand Marshal Frederic von Wallenrode , against the Lithuanians . The Knights , who were the first to organize their army for the battle , hoped to provoke the Poles or Lithuanians into attacking first . Their troops , wearing heavy armor , had to stand in the scorching sun for several hours waiting for an attack . One chronicle suggested that they had dug pits that an attacking army would fall into . They also attempted to use field artillery , but a light rain dampened their powder and only two cannon shots were fired . As Władysław II Jagiełło delayed , the Grand Master sent messengers with two swords to " assist Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas in battle " . The swords were meant as an insult and a provocation . Known as the " Grunwald Swords " , they became one of the national symbols of Poland . 
 = = = Battle begins : Lithuanian attack and retreat = = = 
 Vytautas , supported by a few Polish banners , started an assault on the left flank of the Teutonic forces . After more than an hour of heavy fighting the Lithuanian light cavalry began a full retreat . Jan Długosz described this development as a complete annihilation of the entire Lithuanian army . According to Długosz , the Knights assumed that victory was theirs , broke their formation for a disorganized pursuit of the retreating Lithuanians and gathered much loot before returning to the battlefield to face the Polish troops . He made no mention of the Lithuanians , who later returned to the battlefield . Thus Długosz portrayed the battle as a single @-@ handed Polish victory . This view contradicted Cronica conflictus and has been challenged by modern historians . Starting with an article by <unk> <unk> in 1909 , they proposed that the retreat was a planned , strategic maneuver borrowed from the Golden Horde . A false retreat was used in the Battle of the Vorskla River of 1399 , where the Lithuanian army was dealt a crushing defeat and Vytautas himself barely escaped alive . This theory gained wider acceptance after the discovery and publication of a German letter by Swedish historian Sven <unk> in 1963 . The letter , written a few years after the battle , cautions the new Grand Master to look out for false retreats of the kind that were used in the Great Battle . Stephen Turnbull asserted that the Lithuanian retreat did not quite fit the tried formula of a false retreat . Such a retreat was usually staged by one or two units ( as opposed to almost an entire army ) and was swiftly followed by a counterattack ( whereas the Lithuanians returned late in the battle ) . 
 = = = Battle continues : Polish – Teutonic fight = = = 
 While the Lithuanians were retreating , heavy fighting broke out between Polish and Teutonic forces . Commanded by Grand Komtur Kuno von Lichtenstein , the Teutonic forces concentrated on the Polish right flank . Six of von <unk> 's banners did not pursue the retreating Lithuanians , instead joining the attack on the right flank . A particularly valuable target was the royal banner of Kraków . It seemed that the Knights were gaining the upper hand , and at one point the royal standard @-@ bearer , Marcin of <unk> , lost the Kraków banner . However , it was soon recaptured and fighting continued . Władysław II Jagiełło deployed his reserves — the second line of his army . Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen then personally led 16 banners , almost a third of the original Teutonic strength , to the right Polish flank , and Władysław II Jagiełło deployed his last reserves , the third line of his army . The melee reached the Polish command and one Knight , identified as <unk> or <unk> of <unk> , charged directly against King Władysław II Jagiełło . Władysław 's secretary , Zbigniew <unk> , saved the king 's life , gaining royal favor and becoming one of the most influential people in Poland . 
 = = = Battle ends : Teutonic Knights defeated = = = 
 At that time the reorganized Lithuanians returned to the battle , attacking von Jungingen from the rear . The Teutonic forces were by then becoming outnumbered by the mass of Polish knights and advancing Lithuanian cavalry . As von Jungingen attempted to break through the Lithuanian lines , he was killed . According to Cronica conflictus , <unk> of Oleśnica thrust a lance through the Grand Master 's neck , while Długosz presented <unk> of <unk> as the killer . Surrounded and leaderless , the Teutonic Knights began to retreat . Part of the routed units retreated towards their camp . This move backfired when the camp followers turned against their masters and joined the manhunt . The knights attempted to build a wagon fort : The camp was surrounded by wagons serving as an improvised fortification . However , the defense was soon broken and the camp was ravaged . According to Cronica conflictus , more Knights died there than on the battlefield . The battle lasted for about ten hours . 
 The Teutonic Knights attributed the defeat to treason on the part of Nikolaus von <unk> ( Mikołaj of <unk> ) , commander of the Culm ( Chełmno ) banner , and he was beheaded without a trial . He was the founder and leader of the Lizard Union , a group of Knights sympathetic to Poland . According to the Knights , von <unk> lowered his banner , which was taken as a signal of surrender and led to the panicked retreat . The legend that the Knights were " stabbed in the back " was echoed in the post @-@ World War I stab @-@ in @-@ the @-@ back legend and preoccupied German historiography of the battle until 1945 .

 The defeat of the Teutonic Knights was resounding . About 8 @,@ 000 soldiers were killed and an additional 14 @,@ 000 taken captive . According to Teutonic payroll records , only 1 @,@ 427 men reported back to Marienburg to claim their pay . Of 1 @,@ 200 men sent from Danzig , only 300 returned . According to different sources , some 200 or 400 brothers of the Order were killed , including much of the Teutonic leadership — Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen , Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode , Grand Komtur Kuno von Lichtenstein , Grand Treasurer Thomas von <unk> , Marshal of Supply Forces Albrecht von <unk> , and ten of the <unk> . Markward von <unk> , Komtur of Brandenburg ( Ushakovo ) and Heinrich Schaumburg , <unk> of Sambia , were executed by order of Vytautas after the battle . The bodies of von Jungingen and other high @-@ ranking officials were transported to Marienburg Castle for burial on 19 July . The bodies of lower @-@ ranking Teutonic officials and 12 Polish knights were buried at the church in Tannenberg . The rest of the dead were buried in several mass graves . The highest @-@ ranking Teutonic official to escape the battle was Werner von <unk> , Komtur of Elbing ( Elbląg ) . 
 Polish and Lithuanian forces took several thousand captives . Among these were Dukes Konrad VII of Oels ( Oleśnica ) and Casimir V of Pomerania . Most of the commoners and mercenaries were released shortly after the battle on condition that they report to Kraków on 11 November 1410 . Only those who were expected to pay ransom were kept . Considerable ransoms were recorded ; for example , the mercenary <unk> von <unk> had to pay 150 <unk> of Prague groschen , amounting to more than 30 kg ( 66 lb ) of silver . 
 = = = Further campaign and peace = = = 
 After the battle , the Polish and Lithuanian forces delayed their attack on the Teutonic capital in Marienburg ( Malbork ) , remaining on the battlefield for three days and then marching an average of only about 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) per day . The main forces did not reach heavily fortified Marienburg until 26 July . This delay gave Heinrich von Plauen enough time to organize a defense . Władysław II Jagiełło also sent his troops to other Teutonic fortresses , which often surrendered without resistance , including the major cities of Danzig ( Gdańsk ) , Thorn ( Toruń ) , and Elbing ( Elbląg ) . Only eight castles remained in Teutonic hands . The besiegers of Marienburg expected a speedy capitulation and were not prepared for a long siege , suffering from lack of ammunition , low morale and an epidemic of dysentery . The Knights appealed to their allies for help , and Sigismund of Hungary , Wenceslaus , King of the Romans , and the Livonian Order promised financial aid and reinforcements . 
 The siege of Marienburg was lifted on 19 September . The Polish – Lithuanian forces left garrisons in the fortresses they had taken and returned home . However , the Knights quickly recaptured most of the castles . By the end of October only four Teutonic castles along the border remained in Polish hands . Władysław II Jagiełło raised a fresh army and dealt another defeat to the Knights in the Battle of <unk> on 10 October 1410 . Following other brief engagements , both sides agreed to negotiate . 
 The Peace of Thorn was signed in February 1411 . Under its terms , the Knights ceded the <unk> Land ( Dobrzyń Land ) to Poland and agreed to resign their claims to Samogitia during the lifetimes of Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas , although another two wars — the Hunger War of 1414 and the <unk> War of 1422 — would be waged before the Treaty of Melno permanently resolved the territorial disputes . The Poles and Lithuanians were unable to translate the military victory into territorial or diplomatic gains . However , the Peace of Thorn imposed a heavy financial burden on the Knights from which they never recovered . They had to pay an indemnity in silver , estimated at ten times the annual income of the King of England , in four annual installments . To meet these payments , the Knights borrowed heavily , confiscated gold and silver from churches and increased taxes . Two major Prussian cities , Danzig ( Gdańsk ) and Thorn ( Toruń ) , revolted against the tax increases . The defeat at Grunwald left the Teutonic Knights with few forces to defend their remaining territories . Since Samogitia became officially christened , as both Poland and Lithuania were for a long time , the Knights had difficulties recruiting new volunteer crusaders . The Grand Masters then needed to rely on mercenary troops , which proved an expensive drain on their already depleted budget . The internal conflicts , economic decline , and tax increases led to unrest and the foundation of the Prussian Confederation , or Alliance against Lordship , in 1441 . This in turn led to a series of conflicts that culminated in the Thirteen Years ' War ( 1454 ) .

 The Battle of Grunwald is regarded as one of the most important in the histories of Poland and Lithuania . In the history of Ukraine , the battle is better associated with Vytautas the Great , who stood as the leader of Eastern Orthodox Christianity at that time . In Lithuania the victory is synonymous with the grand duchy 's political and military peak . It was a source of national pride during the age of Romantic nationalism and inspired resistance to the Germanization and Russification policies of the German and Russian Empires . The Knights were portrayed as bloodthirsty invaders and Grunwald as a just victory achieved by a small , oppressed nation . 
 In 1910 , to mark the 500th anniversary of the battle , a monument by Antoni <unk> was unveiled in Kraków during a three @-@ day celebration attended by some 150 @,@ 000 people . About 60 other towns and villages in Galicia also erected Grunwald monuments for the anniversary . 
 About the same time Nobel Prize @-@ winner Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote the novel The Knights of the Cross ( Polish : Krzyżacy ) , prominently featuring the battle in one of the chapters . In 1960 Polish filmmaker Aleksander Ford used the book as the basis for his film , Knights of the Teutonic Order . A museum , monuments and memorials were constructed at the battlefield in 1960 . The battle site is one of Poland 's official , national Historic Monuments , as designated October 4 , 2010 , and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland . The battle has lent its name to military decorations ( Cross of Grunwald ) , sport teams ( BC Žalgiris , FK Žalgiris ) , and various organizations . 
 An annual battle reenactment takes place on 15 July . In 2010 a pageant reenacting the event and commemorating the battle 's 600th anniversary was held . It attracted 200 @,@ 000 spectators who watched 2 @,@ 200 participants playing the role of knights in a reenactment of the battle . An additional 3 @,@ 800 participants played peasants and camp followers . The pageant 's organizers believe that the event has become the largest reenactment of medieval combat in Europe . 
 The Battle of Grunwald is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , Warsaw , with the inscription " <unk> 15 VII 1410 " .

 The Germans generally saw the Knights as heroic and noble men who brought Christianity and civilization to the east . In August 1914 , during World War I , Germany won a battle against Russia near the site . When the Germans realized its propaganda potential , they named the battle the Battle of Tannenberg , despite it having actually taken place much closer to <unk> ( Olsztyn ) , and framed it as revenge for the Polish – Lithuanian victory 504 years earlier . Nazi Germany later exploited the sentiment by portraying their Lebensraum policies as a continuation of the Knights ' historical mission . 
 Due to the participation of the three Smolensk regiments , Russians saw the battle as a victory of a Polish – Lithuanian – Russian coalition against invading Germans . Chronicler Jan Długosz praised the Smolensk banners , who fought bravely and were the only banners from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania not to retreat . In Soviet historiography , the Battle of Grunwald was styled as a racial struggle between Slavs and Germanics . The Teutonic Knights were portrayed as the medieval forerunners of Hitler 's armies , while the battle itself was seen as the medieval counterpart to the Battle of Stalingrad . 
 In William Urban 's summary , almost all accounts of the battle made before the 1960s were more influenced by romantic legends and nationalistic propaganda than by fact . Historians have since made progress towards dispassionate scholarship and reconciliation of the various national accounts of the battle .
