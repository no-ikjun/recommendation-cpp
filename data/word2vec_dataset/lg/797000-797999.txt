 Mirror 's Edge is an action @-@ adventure platformer developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts . The game was announced on July 10 , 2007 , and was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2008 . A Microsoft Windows version was released on January 13 , 2009 . Mirror 's Edge is powered by the Unreal Engine 3 , with the addition of a new lighting solution , developed by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE . 
 Mirror 's Edge is set in a quasi @-@ futuristic dystopian society , in which a network of ' runners ' , including the main character , Faith , act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance . In the style of a three @-@ dimensional platform game , the player guides Faith over rooftops , across walls , through ventilation shafts , and otherwise within urban environments , negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour . The game has a brightly colored style and differs from most previous first @-@ person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment , allowing for a wider range of actions — such as sliding under barriers , tumbling , wall @-@ running , and shimmying across ledges ; in having no heads @-@ up display ; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs , arms , and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on @-@ screen . 
 Mirror 's Edge has received positive reviews , with the PC version garnering a Metacritic aggregated score of 81 . The game 's uniqueness and its expansive environments have received praise , while criticism has centred on its weakness of plot , trial and error gameplay and short length . The game won the Annual Interactive Achievement Award for Adventure Game of the Year . A soundtrack featuring remixes of the final credits song " Still Alive " by Swedish singer Lisa Miskovsky was also released . A side @-@ scroller mobile game , also titled Mirror 's Edge , was released for iPad on April 1 , 2010 , and for the iPhone on September 2 , 2010 . A port of the game was released for Windows Phone on July 13 , 2012 , with an initial exclusivity period for owners of Nokia Lumia phones . A reboot , Mirror 's Edge Catalyst , was officially announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 and was released on June 7 , 2016 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Mirror 's Edge , the player controls the protagonist , Faith , from a first @-@ person perspective as she is challenged to navigate across a gleaming city , by jumping between rooftops , running across walls , and gaining access to buildings through ventilation shafts . This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the discipline of parkour . According to senior producer Owen O 'Brien , Mirror 's Edge aims to " convey [ ... ] strain and physical contact with the environment " , with the goal of allowing a freedom of movement previously unseen in the first @-@ person genre . In order to achieve this , camera movement pays more attention to character movement . For example , as Faith 's speed builds up while running , the rate at which the camera bobs up and down increases as well . When a roll is executed , the camera spins with the character . Faith 's arms , legs , and torso are prominent and their visibility is used to convey movement and momentum . The character 's arms pump and the length of her steps increase with her gait , and her legs cycle and arms flail during long jumps . 
 In gameplay , the character 's momentum becomes an asset . The player must attempt to conserve it through fluidity of physical actions , encouraging the creation of chains of moves . If Faith does not have the momentum required to traverse an object , she will fall off or short of it . Controls are simplified by being context @-@ sensitive ; the " upwards movement " button will cause Faith to traverse an obstacle by passing over it ( i.e. , by jumping , vaulting , climbing , or grabbing set pieces like zip @-@ lines ) while the " downwards movement " button will cause her to perform other manoeuvres like sliding , rolling , or crouching . To assist the player in creating these chains of moves , the game employs a system called " Runner Vision " , which emphasises environmental pieces useful for progression . Certain pipes , ramps , and doors are highlighted in red as Faith approaches , allowing the player to instantly recognize paths and escape routes . Further along in the game , the number of these visual hints is reduced to only the end goal , and the player can opt to turn off this hint system entirely . It is also used to create puzzles in which the player must figure out how to combine the highlighted set pieces into a chain of moves in order to reach the target . Another means of assistance to the player is a system called " Reaction Time " , a form of bullet time activated by the player , slowing down time and allowing the player to plan and time their next move without losing momentum or tactical advantage . 
 The player character can hold weapons , but O 'Brien stressed that " this is an action adventure . We 're not positioning this as a shooter – the focus isn 't on the gun , it 's on the person . " Gameplay in Mirror 's Edge focuses on finding the best route through the game 's environments while combat takes a secondary role . Completing the game without shooting a single enemy unlocks an achievement for the player . Consequently , guns may be obtained by disarming an enemy , but when the magazine is empty , it will need to be discarded . Additionally , carrying a weapon slows Faith down ; the heavier the gun , the more it hinders her movement . This introduces an element of strategy in determining when to trade agility for short @-@ term firepower . 
 Along with the campaign mode , Mirror 's Edge features a time attack mode , where the player must try to complete one of a set of special maps in the shortest amount of time . Best times can be uploaded to online leaderboards , where players can also download ghosts of other players to compete against . The maps are unlocked by playing through the campaign mode . According to producer Tom Ferrer , the time trial portions of Mirror 's Edge are " bite @-@ sized and short so you can grind them and play them and get faster and faster . It 's not like playing an entire level . " 
 The mobile phone port includes many parkour moves from the PC and console versions , however , the perspective is shifted from first person to third person . The game does not feature cutscenes , and the plot is explained with scrolling text in between levels . The iOS version has since been removed from the app store due to problems with the game on iOS 8 .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Mirror 's Edge takes place in Glass , a ' utopian ' city where life is comfortable and crime almost non @-@ existent . But the city 's state of bliss is the achievement of a domineering and totalitarian regime which monitors all communication , controls the media , spies on its citizens and has policies which include the outright prohibition of smoking and alcohol . The City also operates sham trials , and runs on a sham democracy . Eighteen years before the events of the game they had opened fire on a protest against their rule , killing many civilians . 
 As the story begins the mayoral elections are near and a new candidate , Robert Pope , is challenging the incumbent Mayor Callaghan on a platform of deregulation . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 According to senior producer Owen O 'Brien , " [ Mirror 's Edge ] asks how much of your personal freedom are you willing to give up for a comfortable life . It 's not one girl against this police @-@ state dictatorship . It 's more subtle than that . " 
 American TV series Firefly and film spin @-@ off Serenity were cited by O 'Brien as inspirations . " Our other theme is you can 't force other people to live by your rules and your society , even if your society is better , " he said . " In Serenity The Operative actually says , ' This is not an evil empire . We just don 't understand why you don 't want to be part of our happy club . ' Obviously they take it too far , and that 's kind of what happens in our game as well . " 
 Writer Rhianna Pratchett has said that the game 's story examined why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited . It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this . The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George Orwell described as an ' anti @-@ utopia ' and a Nanny State .

 The protagonist of Mirror 's Edge is 24 @-@ year @-@ old Faith Connors ( voiced by Jules de Jongh ) , who has a distinctive tattoo around her right eye , imitated by the game 's logo . Faith earns her living as a " Runner " , a courier who carries physical communiqués around the city , her services retained by revolutionary groups who avoid communicating via highly monitored telephone and e @-@ mail channels . Faith 's attitude towards the totalitarian government is rooted in her past ; her parents were active in protest movements when she was young , campaigning to keep the city from shifting to the oppressive regime . Her mother was killed during the " November riots " — peaceful protests gone wrong — and Faith ran away from home when she was 16 , living a thief 's life on the city streets . Faith became a Runner after meeting Mercury ( or Merc ) , a former Runner who now trains new hires , sources jobs for them , and provides them with intelligence and radio support while on the job . Other characters include Faith 's sister , Kate Connors , an officer with the city police ; Drake , another Runner @-@ trainer ; Faith 's friends Celeste and <unk> , another pair of Merc 's Runners ; and Jacknife , a former Runner . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Faith , after completing a delivery to fellow Runner Celeste , learns that her sister Kate may be in trouble at Pope 's office . When she arrives , she finds Kate standing beside Pope 's body , insisting she has been framed for murder and requesting Faith to discover the cause . Faith finds a piece of paper with the name " Icarus " on it in Pope 's hand . Kate refuses to flee with Faith , saying it would only make her look guilty , and is arrested . From a former Runner , Jacknife , Faith learns that Pope 's head of security , former wrestler Travis " Ropeburn " Burfield , may be connected to Pope 's murder . Faith meets Lt. Miller , at Kate 's behest , narrowly avoiding arrest . At Ropeburn 's office , she overhears him setting up a meeting at a new place downtown . At the meeting , Ropeburn discovers Faith 's presence and attacks her , but Faith gains the upper hand and throws him off the roof . As he is hanging above a long drop , she tries to interrogate Ropeburn , but before he can reveal anything he is killed by an unknown assassin . 
 Lacking other leads , Faith investigates the security firm that has begun aiding the police force in their crackdown of Runners . She finds they are behind " Project Icarus " , a program designed to train their forces in parkour style to oppose the Runners , giving them the ability to chase down and eliminate the Runners . Faith follows the trail of Ropeburn 's killer to a boat in port ; after chasing the unknown person , Faith discovers the assassin is actually Celeste , who is colluding with Project Icarus to keep herself safe , and Celeste warns Faith to consider the same . The arrival of the police allows Celeste to escape . 
 With Kate convicted for Pope 's murder , Merc plans a way for Faith to ambush the police convoy transporting her to prison , and Faith helps to free Kate . She gives Kate her <unk> unit that she and Merc use and tells her that he will guide her back to his hideout . When Faith returns to the hideout , she finds it in ruins , with Merc dying and Kate recaptured . In his dying words , Merc tells Faith that Kate is now at the Shard , which contains Mayor Callaghan 's office and the servers that run the city 's surveillance systems . With Miller 's help , Faith is able to enter the Mayor 's private offices , destroying many of the servers to gain access to the roof . On the roof , she finds Kate held at gunpoint by Jacknife . Jacknife reveals that he too is part of Project Icarus , and has been part of the plan all along to lure the Runners out of hiding . When Jacknife tries to take Kate onto a waiting helicopter , Faith jumps on before it can leave , knocking Jacknife out of the helicopter to fall to his death but also damaging the helicopter in the process . Faith helps Kate to escape safely from the falling helicopter . 
 During the end credits , the media reports that Faith 's actions have only served to intensify Project Icarus , and Faith and Kate are still wanted for Pope 's murder . However , with the surveillance infrastructure damaged , the population is cautioned to avoid using electronic means of communications until their " security " is restored , with the location of Faith and Kate remaining unknown .

 In 2007 , DICE creative director Ben Cousins told GamesIndustry.biz that the studio was looking to create " something fresh and interesting " , anticipating a need to diversify away from the successful Battlefield franchise the studio was known for . 
 In June 2007 , Computer and Video Games magazine revealed that DICE was working on a game called Mirror 's Edge , which was expected to " shake up the [ first @-@ person shooter ] genre " . On July 10 , 2007 , Mirror 's Edge was officially announced by Electronic Arts , and at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in February 2008 , the first demonstration of gameplay was shown . A video featuring entirely in @-@ game footage was released at the Sony PlayStation Day in London on May 6 , 2008 . 
 Mirror 's Edge has a distinct visual style , with the outdoor environments predominantly featuring white and distinctively lacking in green ( for example , trees and foliage would appear completely white instead of in their natural colors ) , punctuated by deliberate use of strong primary colours . According to Senior Producer Owen O 'Brien , the stylistic choice allows the player to focus on the Runner Vision guidance , as well as serving as a health meter ; the colours become less saturated as Faith starts to take damage . Because development of Mirror 's Edge began before DICE 's own Frostbite was completed , the game uses Epic 's Unreal Engine 3 . A lighting system called " Beast " was developed for the Unreal Engine by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE . The new software would accentuate the different art style of Mirror 's Edge , by allowing for the reflection of colours as well as light . In order to address the issue of simulation sickness associated with the free movement of the camera in first @-@ person view , a small reticle was placed in the centre of the screen . The reticle serves as an aiming and focal point , preventing dizziness in similar fashion to the dance technique called spotting . Aside from this reticle ( which can be hidden by the player ) , no heads @-@ up display exists in the game . 
 The demo for Mirror 's Edge , consisting of the game 's prologue chapter , was released via the PlayStation Store on October 30 , 2008 , followed by the Xbox LIVE Marketplace on October 31 . On November 7 , 2008 , DICE announced that Mirror 's Edge had achieved gold status , and PS3 and Xbox 360 versions would be shipping to retailers on November 13 . On January 16 , 2009 , a Microsoft Windows version of the game was released . The PC version features support for NVIDIA 's PhysX , adding detail and physics to glass , smoke and soft materials . The game includes the SecuROM <unk> ( activation based ) DRM software , unless bought from Steam . 
 The game was at the centre of EA 's conflict with EDGE Games , a California @-@ based development studio . EDGE Games is not related to Edge magazine beyond the licensing of its trademark . In September 2009 , EA petitioned to have EDGE Games ' trademarks cancelled , alleging continued threats of legal action . Tim Langdell , president of EDGE responded by accusing EA of engaging EDGE in settlement talks as a " play for time " . Langdell 's company claimed true legal ownership of the phrase " Mirror 's Edge " among other variations of " Edge " . After a court found that EDGE 's claims were " suspect " , the company settled with EA and surrendered many of its trademarks .

 Buyers who pre @-@ ordered Mirror 's Edge at Game Crazy received a code that unlocked a time trial portion of the demo , as well as a Mirror 's Edge @-@ themed t @-@ shirt . A time trial code was also included in GameStop preorders , along with a yellow " Runner Bag " resembling the messenger bags used in the game . Preorders from UK retailer GAME included a Mirror 's Edge @-@ edition Fenchurch t @-@ shirt . The game could also be bought through the Electronic Arts website , where a package deal with a red <unk> messenger bag was available . The bag featured the game 's logo on the outside , while the inside featured a portrait of Faith .

 In May , the Mirror 's Edge Original Videogame Score was released in online @-@ only form . The album was composed by Swedish electronic musician Magnus <unk> , also known as Solar Fields , who stated that " the music should reflect the environment , the story , the gameplay and Faith 's mood " and that the soundtrack is a mixture of electronic and <unk> music . 
 On October 7 , 2008 , EA announced the release of a remix album featuring the Mirror 's Edge theme song " Still Alive " by Swedish musician Lisa Miskovsky . Contributing artists included Benny Benassi , Junkie XL , Paul van Dyk , Teddybears and Armand Van Helden . Although " Still Alive " is also the name of the closing credits song of 2007 game Portal , the two tracks are unrelated . The album , titled Still Alive – the Remixes , was released on November 11 , 2008 . The album was included free in the standard game in later releases for all platforms . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Mirror 's Edge has received mostly positive reviews , with score aggregator Metacritic reporting scores of 81 / 100 for the PC version and 79 / 100 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions . Official Xbox Magazine gave the game 9 @.@ 5 out of 10 , praising its " brilliant sense of motion and gameplay " . Play awarded it 9 out of 10 , while <unk> gave it 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 . Computer and Video Games was also positive , calling it " A brilliant and unique experience , even if the small shooting parts aren 't quite up to scratch . " IGN awarded the game 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 , calling it a " thrilling and stylish venture " , but " the first chapter of a franchise that 's still finding its feet . " GameSpot praised the immersive gameplay environments , but criticised the inconsistency of gameplay speed . Ian Bogost of Gamasutra commended the game for being unconventional , calling it " a shooter that makes you hate to shoot " . 
 Edge gave the game 5 out of 10 , stating that the levels felt contrived and that there was no true freedom through the levels , merely multiple preordained paths . The Guardian noted the game 's short length , and many reviews criticised the " trial and error " nature of the play . Despite giving the game a score of 8 out of 10 , Eurogamer dismissed the storyline as rambling , adding that " [ Mirror 's Edge ] is going to divide audiences down the middle ... Some will be able to overlook the gaping flaws , but others will never appreciate its moments of brilliance , and both positions are justifiable ... " Other issues raised were the stylistic choice of animated cutscenes , and the " cramped " feel of some of the levels . 
 The developers initially projected a total of three million copies of Mirror 's Edge to be sold , but in February 2009 , Electronic Arts reported sales of over one million . According to an October 2010 court document pertaining to the legal conflict between EA and Edge Games ( see Mirror 's Edge : Development and release ) , Mirror 's Edge has sold more than two million copies worldwide , with more than 750 @,@ 000 of those copies having been sold in North America . The iPhone @-@ compatible version of the game has sold more than 37 @,@ 000 copies . In June 2013 , the executive vice president of the EA Games revealed the game has sold " about 2 @.@ 5 million units " .

 On December 4 , 2008 , EA announced the creation of seven all @-@ new time trial maps for Mirror 's Edge , slated for release in January 2009 . According to Owen O 'Brien , Senior Producer for DICE , “ The freedom of movement and control in first person has been the most popular aspect of Mirror 's Edge so we decided to distill these down to their purest form for this map pack ... We deliberately chose a more abstract aesthetic that is still within our distinctive art style and then focused on flow and gameplay to create an experience and challenge very different from the main game . ” In January 2009 , the release date was specified as January 29 . The release was delayed until February 19 , 2009 , when the " Time Trial Map Pack " was made available as downloadable content for the Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 and PC . An eighth map is available exclusively for the PlayStation 3 version of the game . The time trials DLC has proven to be incompatible with versions of Mirror 's Edge purchased from Steam . 
 A side @-@ scrolling browser game interpretation of Mirror 's Edge titled Mirror 's Edge 2D was released by Electronic Arts in conjunction with independent developer Borne Games . The game is similar to and uses the modified engine of Borne 's popular game Fancy Pants Adventures . A one @-@ level beta was released on November 11 , 2008 , with an expanded three @-@ level beta released on February 24 , 2009 . The developer 's site states that " the full Mirror 's Edge 2D has been released , but we 're still in beta . " 
 A version of Mirror 's Edge for the iPhone and iPod Touch was announced on December 2 , 2009 . It is a side @-@ scrolling game with 3D graphics , featuring 14 levels and dynamic camera angles , and was scheduled for release in January 2010 . It was then later revealed that the iPhone and iPod Touch versions were pushed back to an April release . EA Mobile released Mirror 's Edge for iPhone and iPod touch on September 1 , 2010 . An iPad version was released on April 1 , 2010 . The game was also ported to Windows Phone in 2012 .

Electronic Arts later confirmed that the game will be an " open @-@ world action adventure " . According to DICE 's general manager Karl Magnus <unk> , the prequel will have combat mechanics that are more refined than those in the first game . In January 2014 , writer Rhianna Pratchett had announced on Twitter that neither she nor any other members of the first game 's writing team would be involved with the new game 's development . Some early developments of the game were featured at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 . On June 8 , 2015 , EA filed a trademark for the upcoming Mirror 's Edge game Mirror 's Edge : Catalyst which was later confirmed as the game 's official title the next day on June 9 .

The trade was postponed slightly because Mota failed to pass a physical , so the Indians put him on a conditioning program before spring training . However , he was still expected to be the setup man for closer Bob Wickman . He started the season well , as he did not allow an earned run in his first seven games . However , he struggled after that , and he lost the setup role to Rafael Betancourt in May . Over his next 27 games , Mota had a 7 @.@ 89 ERA , and opponents batted .314 against him .

 Falling Skies was renewed on July 7 , 2011 , for a second season . TNT announced production had begun on the second season on October 24 , 2011 . For the second season , Brandon Jay McLaren joined the cast in October as Jamil Dexter , a mechanic . McLaren will feature in seven episodes . 
 Filming took place in Vancouver and at the Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam from October 2011 to March 2012 . For the first season , production took place in Hamilton and Toronto . Noah Wyle said that the change in location made filming significantly different . A new crew came in for the second season , with only " two or three people on staff that were there in season one . " The new staff includes a new writing staff and showrunner . 
 Remi Aubuchon was hired as the showrunner for the second season in May 2011 before the first season premiere . Once Aubuchon entered the writer 's room , he began speaking of the cliffhanger " it became a really fun challenge . " Out of that cliffhanger , says Aubuchon , " came some really positive things that propel a lot of the storytelling in the second season . And the writers came up with a pretty cool way for Tom Mason to get off that spaceship again . " " You 'll always catch people after a huge trauma saying , ' Oh , it wasn 't that bad . ' Or , ' It was fun , ' Or , ' It was cool falling off that cliff , ' " says Aubuchon . " The truth is , at first it was like , ' Oh my God , should i just say I can 't do this job ? ' Ultimately , though , I think it turned out cool . " 
 Series lead Noah Wyle received several phone calls after the first season finale aired . The number one question was " What the hell were you doing getting on that spaceship ? " He said that they " wrote themselves into a corner " . Moon Bloodgood , who plays Dr. Anne Glass , says she was sort of daunted but impressed by the writing . Aubuchon added that Tom Mason 's capture helped the writer 's change the character slightly . He stated : " Tom comes away from that experience feeling used and manipulated . It wasn 't the experience [ he expected ] . He thought he was going to be having a nice conversation with an extraterrestrial being . It turned out to be worse than that . More than that , I won 't say . But that 's what made it fun . " 
 Greg Beeman , who directed the episode , spoke about Remi Aubuchon 's hiring . He said that Remi had " a lot of ideas about how to keep the good stuff we ’ d established in Season 1 " , and " diminish the things that weren ’ t as strong " . Steven Spielberg 's original conception of Falling Skies was that the characters in the series would be nomadic . The idea for the second season was to " create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag @-@ tag tents . " Chris <unk> , who was the Director of Photography in the first season , was unable to return due to commitments on another series , and Nate Goodman was hired . Aubuchon and Beeman discussed what was a head for the characters this season , and soon after , Beeman called Connor Jessup , who plays Ben Mason , and said " I ’ ve just heard what the plans are for you for this season . And my strong advice is that you get a trainer and start eating your Wheaties ! You are in a <unk> storyline is going to revolve around you … You ’ re a warrior , you ’ re a <unk> killer and you ’ re a badass ! " Jessup hired a trainer that very day .

 Sir Thomas Hugh William Beadle CMG OBE PC ( 6 February 1905 – 14 December 1980 ) was a Rhodesian lawyer , politician and judge who served as his country 's <unk> Justice from 1961 to 1977 . He came to international prominence against the backdrop of Rhodesia 's Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( UDI ) from Britain in 1965 , upon which he initially stood by the British Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs as an adviser ; he then provoked acrimony in British government circles by declaring Ian Smith 's post @-@ UDI administration legal in 1968 . 
 Born and raised in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury , Beadle read law in South Africa and England before commencing practice in Bulawayo in 1931 . He became a member of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly for Godfrey Huggins 's ruling United Party in 1939 . Appointed Huggins 's Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1940 , he retained that role until 1946 , when he became Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice ; the Education and Health portfolios were added two years later . He retired from politics in 1950 to become a judge of the Southern Rhodesian High Court . In 1961 , he was knighted and appointed Chief Justice ; three years later he became president of the High Court 's new Appellate Division and a member of the British Privy Council . 
 Beadle held the Rhodesian Front , the governing party from 1962 , in low regard , dismissing its Justice Minister Desmond Lardner @-@ Burke as a " small time country solicitor " . As independence talks between Britain and Rhodesia gravitated towards stalemate , Beadle repeatedly attempted to arrange a compromise . He continued these efforts after UDI , and brought Harold Wilson and Smith together for talks aboard HMS Tiger . The summit failed ; Wilson afterwards castigated Beadle for not persuading Smith to settle . 
 Beadle 's de jure recognition of the post @-@ UDI government in 1968 outraged the Wilson administration and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along . His true motives remain the subject of speculation . After Smith declared a republic in 1970 , Beadle continued as Chief Justice ; he was almost removed from the Privy Council , but kept his place following Wilson 's electoral defeat soon after . Beadle retired in 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences . He died in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980 , aged 75 . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Thomas Hugh William Beadle ( generally known as Hugh ) was born in Salisbury , Southern Rhodesia on 6 February 1905 , the only son and eldest child of Arthur William Beadle and his wife Christiana Maria ( née Fischer ) . He had two sisters . The family was politically conservative and favoured joining the Union of South Africa during the latter years of Company rule , sharing a firm consensus that Sir Charles Coghlan and his responsible government movement were , in Beadle 's recollection , " a pretty wild bunch of <unk> " . Responsible government ultimately prevailed in the 1922 referendum of the mostly white electorate , and Southern Rhodesia became a self @-@ governing colony the following year . 
 After attending Salisbury Boys ' School , Milton High School in Bulawayo and Diocesan College , Rondebosch , Beadle studied law at the University of Cape Town . He completed his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1928 , then continued his studies in England as a Rhodes Scholar at The Queen 's College , Oxford . There he played rugby and tennis for the college , boxed for the university and qualified as a pilot with the Oxford University Air Squadron . He graduated with a second @-@ class Bachelor of Civil Law degree in 1930 , and soon after was called to the English bar . He briefly read in London chambers before commencing practice in Bulawayo in 1931 . In 1934 he married Leonie Barry , a farmer 's daughter from <unk> in the Cape of Good Hope ; they had two daughters .

 After returning to Rhodesia , Beadle took an interest in politics ; he joined the United Party , created from the former Rhodesia Party and the conservative faction of the Reform Party to contest the 1934 general election . He was attracted to the United Party not so much by its policies but by his admiration for its leading figures — he considered the Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins " a man of the calibre I think of Rhodes " . The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote . The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race , but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards , the electoral roll and the colonial Legislative Assembly were overwhelmingly from the white minority ( about 5 % of the population ) . The United Party broadly represented commercial interests , civil servants and the professional classes . 
 Beadle stood in Bulawayo South in the 1934 election , challenging Harry Davies , the Labour leader . Davies defeated Beadle by 458 votes to 430 , but the United Party won decisively elsewhere and formed a new government with 24 out of the 30 parliament seats . Huggins , who remained Prime Minister , held Beadle in high regard and made him a close associate . In the 1939 election , Beadle won a three @-@ way contest in Bulawayo North with 461 votes out of 869 , and became a United Party MP . Beadle was seconded to the Gold Coast Regiment with the rank of temporary captain following the outbreak of the Second World War , but was released from military service at the request of the Southern Rhodesian government to serve as Huggins 's Parliamentary Private Secretary , " with access to all ministers and top @-@ ranking officials on the PM 's business to speed up affairs " . He held this post from 1940 to 1946 , during which time he was also Deputy Advocate General for the Southern Rhodesian armed forces . 
 In the first post @-@ war election in 1946 , Beadle defeated Labour 's Cecil Maurice Baker in Bulawayo North by 666 votes to 196 . He was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice . The same year he was made a Queen 's Counsel and appointed OBE . Two years later , after retaining his seat in the 1948 election with a large majority , he was assigned two more portfolios , those of Education and Health . Around this time he turned down an approach from a group of Liberal and rebel United Party MPs to challenge Huggins 's premiership . Beadle had entered the Cabinet at a time when relations between the United Party and the British Labour Party were warming . He formed a good relationship with Aneurin Bevan , the UK Minister of Health , and put considerable work into attempting to create a Southern Rhodesian system similar to National Insurance in Britain . These efforts were largely unsuccessful , but did lead to a maternity grant for white mothers , nicknamed the " Beadle baby scheme " . Beadle retired from politics in 1950 to accept a seat on the Southern Rhodesian High Court . This decision surprised many of his contemporaries ; Beadle would explain later that he left politics as he did not feel he would work well under his United Party colleague Edgar Whitehead , who he correctly predicted would rise to the premiership . 
 = = = Chief Justice = = = 
 Beadle filled the seat on the High Court bench vacated by Sir Robert Tredgold , who had just been appointed Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia . Despite his close relationship with Huggins , Beadle had strong misgivings regarding Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland , which became Huggins 's flagship project . Beadle argued that since the British government would never devolve indigenous African affairs to Federal responsibility , native policy in the three territories would never be co @-@ ordinated , meaning " the thing was bound to crash " . Nevertheless , Huggins sent him to London in 1949 to discuss the legal problems of the proposed Federation with the British government . Beadle later expressed regrets that he had not played a bigger role in drawing up the constitution for the Federation , which was inaugurated as an indissoluble entity in 1953 , following a mostly white referendum in Southern Rhodesia . Huggins spent three years as Federal Prime Minister before retiring in 1956 . Whitehead became Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia in 1958 . 
 After Leonie 's death in 1953 , Beadle married Olive Jackson , of Salisbury , in 1954 . He later said that he was repeatedly asked to resign from the bench to become the Federal Minister of Law or stand for Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia , but " didn 't regard any of the issues as crucial enough to warrant my going back " . Beadle 's biographer Claire Palley describes him as " a learned , fair but also adventurous judge " . He was appointed CMG in 1957 . In August 1959 , amid rising black nationalism and opposition to the Federation , particularly in the two northern territories , Beadle chaired a three @-@ man tribunal on the Southern Rhodesian government 's preventive detention of black nationalist leaders without trial during the disturbances . He upheld the government 's actions , reporting that the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress had disseminated " subversive propaganda " , encouraged racial hatred , intimidated people into joining and undermined the authority of tribal chiefs , government officials and police . 
 In 1960 Beadle was a member of the Monckton Commission on the Federation 's future . According to Aidan Crawley , a British member of the commission , Beadle began the process " as a radical advocate of white supremacy " but later expressed markedly different views . The commissioners " hardly agreed on anything " , in Beadle 's recollection . While not recommending dissolution , the Monckton report was strongly critical of the Federation . It advocated a wide range of reforms , rejected any further advance towards Federal independence until these were implemented , and called for the territories to be permitted to secede if opposition continued . Beadle was knighted in 1961 and the same year appointed <unk> Justice of Southern Rhodesia . A primary school in Bulawayo was named after him . In Mehta v. City of Salisbury ( 1961 ) , a case challenging the racial segregation of a public swimming pool , Beadle decided that apartheid made precedents in South African case law invalid , ruled that the plaintiff 's dignity had been unlawfully affronted , and awarded him damages . Following continued black nationalist opposition to the Federation , particularly in Nyasaland , the British government announced in 1962 that Nyasaland would be allowed to secede . This was soon extended to Northern Rhodesia as well , and at the end of 1963 the Federation was dismantled . 
 Whitehead 's United Federal Party was defeated in the 1962 Southern Rhodesian general election by the Rhodesian Front ( RF ) , an all @-@ white , firmly conservative party led by Winston Field whose declared goal was independence for Southern Rhodesia without major constitutional changes and without commitment to any set timetable regarding black majority rule . RF proponents downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation , and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics — whites made up 5 % of the population , but over 90 % of registered voters — the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity . Beadle expressed an extremely low opinion of the RF . Ian Smith , who replaced Field as Prime Minister in 1964 , was in Beadle 's eyes an unconvincing leader ; Desmond Lardner @-@ Burke , the Justice Minister , was a " fascist " and a " small time country solicitor ... incapable of producing correct documents for an undefended divorce action " . The same year Smith took over , Beadle became a member of the Privy Council in London and president of the new Appellate Division of the Southern Rhodesian High Court . In this latter role he blocked a Legislative Assembly act to extend periods of preventive restriction outside times of emergency , ruling it against the declaration of rights contained in Southern Rhodesia 's 1961 constitution . 
 = = = UDI = = = 
 Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland , renamed Zambia and Malawi respectively , under black majority governments in 1964 . As independence talks between the British and Southern Rhodesian governments continued with little progress , speculation began to mount that the colonial government might attempt a unilateral declaration of independence ( UDI ) if no accommodation could be found . The British High Commissioner in Salisbury , J B Johnston , had few doubts about how Beadle would respond to such an act , writing that he was " quite certain that no personal considerations would deflect him for a moment from administering the law with absolute integrity . " Arthur Bottomley , the British <unk> Secretary , took a similar line , describing Beadle to the Prime Minister Harold Wilson as " a staunch constitutionalist " who would be disposed to " frustrate any illegal action by Mr Smith 's government " . 
 Beadle told Wilson that he and the judiciary would stand by the law in the event of a UDI , but that he expected the armed forces and police to side with the post @-@ UDI authorities . He thought UDI would be a political and economic mistake for Rhodesia , and attempted to dissuade Smith from this course of action , but at the same time asserted that if UDI occurred it was " not the function of a court to attempt to end the revolution and restore legality " . He warned his High Court colleagues that he would not direct " a judicial rebellion against the Rhodesian government " . 
 Smith and Wilson made little progress towards a settlement during 1964 and 1965 ; each accused the other of being unreasonable . The RF won a decisive victory in the May 1965 general election . After efforts to forge a compromise in London in early October 1965 failed , Wilson , desperate to avert UDI , travelled to Salisbury later that month to continue negotiations . Beadle 's " irrepressible ingenuity led to an incredible succession of proposals for a settlement " , Wilson recalled , but these talks also failed . The two sides agreed on an investigatory Royal Commission , possibly chaired by Beadle , to recommend a path towards independence , but could not settle on the terms . Beadle continued to seek a compromise , and on 8 November persuaded Smith to allow him to go to London to meet Wilson again . Beadle told Wilson that he thought Smith was personally disposed to continue talks but under pressure from some of his ministers to abandon negotiations . Wilson told the British House of Commons that Beadle had provided " wise advice " to both governments , and was " welcome [ in ] this country not only for his sagacity , judgement , and humanity but as a man with the courage of a lion . " 
 Beadle later wrote to his fellow High Court judge Benjamin Goldin that he thought he had " saved the situation " by going to London , having persuaded Wilson to give some ground on the terms for the Royal Commission , but his trip alarmed the pro @-@ UDI camp in the Rhodesian Cabinet , who feared that Beadle might be carrying a message to the Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs telling him to prorogue parliament . Smith and his Cabinet declared independence on 11 November 1965 , while Beadle was at Lusaka Airport on his way home . Smith later rejected the suggestion that Beadle could have had anything significant to tell them on his return , saying that " the only thing that Beadle could have done when he got back was to have talked us out of insisting on our questions " . 
 Before announcing UDI to the nation , Smith , Lardner @-@ Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House to inform him personally and ask him to resign . Gibbs made clear that he would not do so , but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm . When Beadle arrived later in the day , he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence , but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support . On Beadle 's counsel , Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal . When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down , Smith 's government effectively replaced him with Dupont , appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI . Lardner @-@ Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont , but was rebuffed ; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so . 
 The UK government introduced extensive economic and political sanctions against Rhodesia and indicated that any dialogue had to take place through Gibbs . Beadle was told to liaise with Lardner @-@ Burke regarding any proposals Smith 's government might have . Beadle would later recount that the post @-@ UDI government briefly threatened him , telling him to " go now , otherwise you lose your job " , but he was ultimately left alone . The Chief Justice noted in his diary that Smith 's government was " not prepared to force [ a ] showdown with the judges " . 
 = = = Madzimbamuto case and Tiger talks = = = 
 During the immediate post @-@ UDI period Beadle , in his role as Chief Justice , occupied a unique position as he could speak directly with all of the main players — Gibbs , Smith and Wilson . He became the main intermediary between them , and received a dormant commission from the UK government to replace Gibbs as Governor in case of necessity . He visited London in January 1966 and , according to Wilson 's Attorney General Elwyn Jones , was " scornful of the 1965 constitution " . Some in Rhodesia criticised Beadle for going to London , or accused him of siding with Gibbs against Smith . The Chief Justice insisted that he was just trying to do his best for Rhodesia , a claim Smith accepted , saying Beadle " thought more of his country than of his position " . The UK Foreign Office remained wary , speculating in a January 1966 report that while the British government hoped to reclaim Rhodesia " in such a way that policy and thinking is reoriented , racial attitudes changed , and the path to majority rule firmly laid , " the Chief Justice " would be content to see a 1961 @-@ type constitution , without independence , remain for a long time " . 
 Beadle summarised the Rhodesian judiciary 's position in light of UDI by saying simply that the judges would carry on with their duties " according to the law " , but this non @-@ committal stance was challenged by legal cases heard at the High Court . The first of these was Madzimbamuto v. Lardner @-@ Burke N. O. and Others , concerning Daniel Madzimbamuto , a black nationalist detained without trial five days before UDI under emergency powers . When Lardner @-@ Burke 's ministry prolonged the state of emergency in February 1966 , Madzimbamuto 's wife appealed for his release , arguing that since the UK government had declared UDI illegal and outlawed the Rhodesian government , the state of emergency ( and , by extension , her husband 's imprisonment ) had no legal basis . The High Court 's General Division ruled on 9 September 1966 that the UK retained legal sovereignty , but that to " avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law " the Rhodesian government should be considered to be in control of law and order to the same extent as before UDI . Madzimbamuto appealed to Beadle 's Appellate Division , which considered the case over the next year and a half . 
 Beadle arranged " talks about talks " between the British and Rhodesian governments during 1966 , which led to Smith and Wilson meeting personally aboard HMS Tiger off Gibraltar between 2 and 4 December . Beadle had to be hoisted aboard because of a back injury . Negotiations snagged primarily over the matter of the transition . Wilson insisted on the abandonment of the 1965 constitution , the dissolution of the post @-@ UDI government and a period under a British Governor — conditions that Smith saw as tantamount to surrender , particularly as the British proposed to draft and introduce the new constitution only after a fresh test of opinion under UK control . Indeed , Smith had warned Beadle before the summit that unless he " could assure his people that a reasonable constitution had been agreed " , he would feel unable to settle . Smith said he could not agree without first consulting his ministers in Salisbury , infuriating Wilson , who declared that a central condition of the talks had been that he and Smith would have plenipotentiary powers to make a deal . 
 Beadle agreed with Smith that a deal ending UDI without any prior agreement on the replacement constitution would meet with widespread opposition among white Rhodesians , but still felt that Salisbury should agree . He asked Smith to commend the terms to his colleagues in Salisbury , speculating that if he did the Cabinet would surely accept . Smith refused to make such a commitment , much to the disappointment of Beadle and Gibbs , and signed the final document only to acknowledge it as an accurate record . Wilson was furious with Beadle , feeling that he should have taken a far firmer line to persuade Smith to settle ; after Beadle left the meeting , Wilson said that he " could not understand how any man could have a slipped disc whom Providence had failed to provide with a backbone " . Beadle and Gibbs urged Smith to reconsider during the journey home , but made little headway . 
 During the Rhodesian Cabinet meeting on the proposals , the judges were kept informed by the " expression on Sir Hugh 's face and from comments of increasing despair " , Goldin later wrote ; the Chief Justice " spent the whole day in his chambers looking more anxious and despondent after each occasion on which he was smuggled into the Cabinet meeting to explain the meaning or effect of particular provisions " . On 5 December 1966 , when Beadle heard at Government House that Smith 's ministers had rejected the terms , he stood " as though pole @-@ axed " , Gibbs 's Private Secretary Sir John <unk> recalled , and appeared close to collapse . The judge 's wife and daughter helped him to slowly return to his room . 
 = = = De facto decision ; rejection of royal prerogative = = = 
 The United Nations instituted mandatory economic sanctions against Rhodesia in December 1966 . Over the next year British diplomatic activity regarding Rhodesia was diminished ; the UK government 's stated policy shifted towards NIBMAR — " no independence before majority rule " . Beadle grappled with the Rhodesian problem privately and in correspondence , attempting to reconcile the Smith administration 's control over the country with the unconstitutional nature of UDI . Erwin Griswold , the United States Solicitor General , wrote to him that as he saw it the Rhodesian judges could not recognise the post @-@ UDI government as de facto while also claiming to act under the Queen 's commission . 
 Ruling on Madzimbamuto 's appeal in January 1968 , Beadle and three other judges decided that Smith 's post @-@ UDI order was not de jure but should be acknowledged as the de facto government by virtue of its " effective control over the state 's territory " . Sir Robert Tredgold , the former Southern Rhodesian and Federal Chief Justice , told Gibbs that Beadle had thereby " sold the pass " and " should be asked to leave Government House " . The following month , considering the fate of James Dhlamini , Victor Mlambo and Duly Shadreck , three black Rhodesians sentenced to death before UDI for murder and terrorist offences , Beadle upheld Salisbury 's power to execute the men . Whitehall reacted by announcing on 1 March 1968 that at the request of the UK government , the Queen had exercised the royal prerogative of mercy and commuted the sentences to life imprisonment . Dhlamini and the others promptly applied for a permanent stay of execution . 
 At the hearing for Dhlamini and Mlambo on 4 March 1968 , Beadle dismissed the statement from London , saying it was a decision by the UK government and not the Queen herself , and that in any case the 1961 constitution had transferred the prerogative of mercy from Britain to the Rhodesian Executive Council . " The present government is the fully de facto government and as such is the only power that can exercise the prerogative , " he concluded . " It would be strange indeed if the United Kingdom government , exercising no internal power in Rhodesia , were given the right to exercise the prerogative of clemency . " The Judge President Sir Vincent Quenet and Justice Hector Macdonald agreed , and the application was dismissed . Dhlamini , Mlambo and Shadreck were hanged two days later . 
 Justice John Fieldsend of the High Court 's General Division resigned in protest , writing to Gibbs that he no longer believed the High Court to be defending the rights of Rhodesian citizens . Beadle told reporters that " Her Majesty is quite powerless in this matter , " and that " it is to be deplored that the Queen was brought into this " . At Government House , the Chief Justice berated Gibbs for " dragging the Queen into the political argument " . To the Governor 's astonishment , Beadle conceded that for some time he had no longer considered himself to be sitting under the 1961 constitution , but had not made this clear as he had not fully accepted the 1965 constitution as valid . Gibbs told him to leave Government House forthwith . They never met again . 
 In his analysis of Beadle 's behaviour , Manuele Facchini suggests that the Chief Justice considered the matter from a dominion @-@ style viewpoint — by stressing the 1961 constitution and the rights held by Salisbury thereunder , he was repudiating not the royal prerogative itself , but rather the attempt to exercise it at the behest of British rather than Rhodesian ministers . Kenneth Young comments that the British government 's involvement of the Queen inadvertently strengthened the post @-@ UDI authorities ' position ; outraged , many in Rhodesia who had heretofore rejected UDI now threw their weight behind the RF . Beadle , deeply disillusioned , wrote to a friend that he was " thoroughly fed up with the way the Wilson government had behaved in this whole affair . " 
 = = = De jure decision = = = 
 Madzimbamuto petitioned for the right to appeal against his detention to the Privy Council in London ; the Rhodesian Appellate Division ruled that he had no right to do so , but the Privy Council considered his case anyway . It ruled in his favour on 23 July 1968 , deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether they were under the 1961 or 1965 constitution , and that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained . Harry <unk> Davies , one of the Rhodesian judges , announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy . Justice J R Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies 's ruling on 12 August and four days later became Chief Justice of Botswana . Madzimbamuto would remain in prison until 1974 . 
 Beadle and his judges granted full de jure recognition to the post @-@ UDI government on 13 September 1968 , while rejecting the appeals of 32 black nationalists who one month earlier had been convicted of terrorist offences and sentenced to death . Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council " so far as possible " , the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution . He asserted that as he could not countenance a legal vacuum , the only alternative was the 1965 constitution . Referring to the Privy Council 's decision that the UK might yet remove the post @-@ UDI government , he said that " on the facts as they exist today , the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government ... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so " . UDI , the associated 1965 constitution and the government were thereafter considered de jure by the Rhodesian legal system . 
 The British Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson expressed outrage , accusing Beadle and the other judges of breaching " the fundamental laws of the land " , while Gibbs stated that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution he could only reject the ruling . An internal UK Foreign Office memorandum rejected Beadle 's argument but recognised his belief that " because of the effect of the effluxion of time , he was entitled to take a different view " , and concluded that the Chief Justice 's argument was " sufficiently plausible to make it difficult to say that that position is manifestly improper or that , in adopting it , Sir Hugh Beadle is manifestly guilty of misconduct . " Beadle explained in a 1972 interview : " We had been doing our best to try and uphold the law and when the thing was in the revolutionary stage we dug our toes in , we wouldn 't budge . But then as the government became more and more entrenched we had to apply the principle of law , which says that if a revolution succeeds the law changes with it . Yet because we accepted the inevitable we 're blamed by a lot of people for being responsible for the revolution , which is a very different thing . " 
 = = = Threatened removal from Privy Council ; republican Chief Justice = = = 
 Beadle 's acceptance of the post @-@ UDI order effectively placed him on the side of the RF and removed any chance of his regaining an intermediary role with Wilson . The British Prime Minister minimised the political impact of the Chief Justice 's decision by presenting it as evidence that Beadle had furtively supported UDI all along , and subsequently excluded him from the diplomatic dialogue . Wilson pursued a second initiative which led to a fresh round of talks with Smith off Gibraltar aboard HMS Fearless in October 1968 . Marked progress towards agreement was made but the Rhodesian delegation demurred on a new British proposal , the " double safeguard " . This would involve elected black Rhodesians controlling a blocking quarter in the Rhodesian parliament , with the power to veto retrogressive legislation , and thereafter having the right to appeal passed bills to the Privy Council in London . Smith 's team accepted the principle of the blocking quarter but agreement could not be reached on the technicalities ; the involvement of the Privy Council was rejected by Smith as a " ridiculous " provision that would prejudice Rhodesia 's sovereignty . The talks ended without success . 
 Smith 's government held a referendum on 20 June 1969 in which the mostly white electorate overwhelmingly voted in favour of both a new constitution and the declaration of a republic . Four days later the UK Foreign Office released Gibbs from his post , withdrew the British residual mission in Salisbury and closed the post @-@ UDI government 's representative office at Rhodesia House in London . The 1969 constitution introduced a President as head of state , a multiracial senate , separate black and white electoral rolls ( each with qualifications ) and a mechanism whereby the number of black MPs would increase in line with the proportion of income tax revenues paid by black citizens . This process would stop once blacks had the same number of seats as whites ; the declared goal was not majority rule , but rather " parity between the races " . 
 Michael Stewart , Wilson 's Foreign Secretary , recommended that Britain take preliminary steps towards removing Beadle from the Privy Council if the Chief Justice did not resign or dissociate himself from the republic " within a week or two " after the new constitution came into force . Given the gravity of such an action — only one Privy Counsellor , Edgar Speyer , was struck off the list during the 20th century — and the likelihood that accusations of vindictiveness would result , the British government was loath to do this , and hoped that Beadle would remove the need for it by resigning . 
 Smith officially declared a republic on 2 March 1970 , and on 10 April the RF was decisively returned to power in the first republican election , winning all 50 white seats out of a total of 66 . Six days later , Dupont was sworn in as the first President of Rhodesia . British officials learned only from the Rhodesian radio that Dupont 's oath of office was administered not by Beadle but by the " Acting Chief Justice " , Hector Macdonald . Beadle 's absence prompted speculation in British quarters , but this promptly dissipated after The Rhodesia Herald reported on 29 April that a High Court farewell to Sir Vincent Quenet , a retiring judge , would be presided over by the republic 's Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle . 
 On 6 May 1970 , Stewart suggested to Wilson that they should formally advise the Queen to remove Beadle from the Privy Council . Wilson resolved to wait until after the British general election the following month . This decision proved decisive for Beadle as , to the surprise of many , the Conservatives won the election , and Edward Heath replaced Wilson as Prime Minister . Heath 's government decided against removing Beadle from the Privy Council , surmising that this would only hinder progress towards an accommodation with Smith . Beadle remained a Privy Counsellor for the rest of his life . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 In May 1973 Beadle chaired the High Court appeal hearing for Peter Niesewand , a freelance reporter for the overseas press who had been convicted of espionage under the Official Secrets Act , prompting outcry abroad . Niesewand had written three articles in November 1972 claiming to describe the Rhodesian military 's plans for combating communist @-@ backed black nationalist guerrillas , and had been sentenced by a magistrate to two years ' hard labour , one year suspended . Beadle , Goldin and Macdonald rejected the state prosecution and unanimously overturned the conviction , ruling that Niesewand 's reports had embarrassed the government but did not damage the Rhodesian state . " Factual evidence as opposed to opinion was never given , " Beadle commented . The government promptly expelled Niesewand from Rhodesia . 
 After Olive 's death in a motor accident in 1974 , Beadle married Pleasance Johnson in 1976 . He retired as Chief Justice in 1977 ; Macdonald succeeded him . For the rest of his life , Beadle served as an acting judge in special trials where suspected insurgents were tried for terrorist offences carrying the death penalty . In March 1977 he refused to try Abel <unk> and <unk> Bango , two Botswana citizens facing arms charges , ruling that since Rhodesia and Botswana were not at war and the Rhodesian Army had crossed into Botswana to capture the accused , the court had no jurisdiction . " Were it not so it would mean this Court condoned the illegal abduction of Botswana nationals , " he explained . 
 Beadle continued to serve under the short @-@ lived , unrecognised government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia , which replaced the Rhodesian republic in June 1979 , and under the British interim authorities following the Lancaster House Agreement of December that year . Following fresh elections in February – March 1980 , the UK granted independence to Zimbabwe under the leadership of Robert Mugabe in April . Beadle died , aged 75 , in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980 . Hugh Beadle Primary School in Bulawayo retains its name in the 21st century . 
 = = Personality and appraisal = = 
 " A short , stocky man of ruddy complexion with a toothbrush moustache , " Claire Palley writes , " Beadle had a blunt manner , looking hard at all whom he encountered . His drive and enthusiasm were overwhelming , whether at work , in charitable activities , or as a courageous hunter and fisherman . He had a warm family life and many friends . " According to J R T Wood , Wilson " hated Beadle perhaps because Beadle was clever but spoke his mind " ; the British Prime Minister described Beadle to Lord Alport shortly after UDI as combining " the courage of a lion " with " the smartness of a fox " . In Robert Blake 's History of Rhodesia , Beadle is characterised as " an irrepressible , bouncy extrovert , who does not always perceive the reaction which he causes in others . " Sir Garfield Todd , Southern Rhodesia 's Prime Minister from 1956 to 1958 , saw Beadle as " impulsive " and " always inclined to overstate his case " . 
 The black nationalist movement regarded Beadle as a white supremacist , pointing to his 1959 preventive detention ruling as evidence . Wilson and other British figures saw him as two @-@ faced for first supporting Gibbs , then declaring Smith 's post @-@ UDI government legal , and concluded that the judge must have always been a furtive UDI supporter , a theory that many have accepted . Wilson 's private assistant Marcia <unk> identified Beadle as " the villain of the piece " , while Bottomley dubbed him UDI 's " evil genius " . Others , including Palley , Wood and Facchini , contend that Beadle was determined to avert UDI and afterwards sincere in his search for an accommodation until he came to believe this was not possible . " Beadle accepted the rebellion when he realised that he was identifying himself with ' the code of an Empire that had ceased to exist ' , " Facchini concludes . " Thus , he retained his Privy <unk> as a vestige of the Rhodesia he had known all his life . " 
 Palley asserts that but for UDI , " Beadle would have been remembered as a Commonwealth chief justice who upheld individual liberty " . " The thing that I 've regretted most is this UDI and also I 've regretted more than anything the fact that later it wasn 't settled , " Beadle said in 1972 ; " I think it could have been settled at a much earlier stage if Wilson had been a bit more reasonable . " Julian Greenfield , a close friend and colleague of Beadle , considered him " one who put service to the country first and foremost and laboured unceasingly on what he believed to be its true interests . " According to Palley , Beadle 's own view was similar — that " he did his best for his country in a time of difficult choices " . 
 = St Twrog 's Church , Bodwrog = 
 St Twrog 's Church is a small rural church at Bodwrog in Anglesey , North Wales . Built in the late 15th century in a medieval style , some alterations have been made but much of the original structure still remains . It has two 15th @-@ century doorways ( one later converted into a window ) and some 15th @-@ century windows . The bull 's head decoration used on the church denotes a connection with the Bulkeleys of Beaumaris , a prominent north Wales family over several centuries . Set in a remote part of the countryside in the middle of Anglesey , it is dedicated to St Twrog , who was active in the late 5th and early 6th centuries . The church 's tithes were paid for at least two hundred years to Jesus College , Oxford , which has historically strong links with Wales , and the college at one point built a house for the priest who served St Twrog 's and a neighbouring parish . 
 The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , as one of seven churches in a Ministry Area . It is a Grade II * listed building , a national designation given to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " , in particular because it is regarded as " a good rural late Medieval church " . It is built from rubble masonry with a slate roof . The interior is lit by gas lamps .

 The church is in a churchyard in " a remote rural location " on Anglesey , Wales , about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from the county town of Llangefni , at the side of a small road between Gwalchmai and <unk> . The date of first construction of a Christian building at this location is unknown . The parish takes its name from Twrog , a saint who lived in the late 5th and early 6th centuries , to whom the church is dedicated : the Welsh word bod means " abode " or " dwelling " , and " <unk> " is a modified form of the saint 's name – i.e. " Twrog 's dwelling " . One of his brothers , St <unk> , is commemorated in another Anglesey church , St <unk> 's Church , Penmynydd . 
 The present church dates from the time of King Henry VII ( ruled 1485 – 1509 ) , when a significant amount of building work took place in Wales . Some more windows were added in the 17th or 18th century , and the church was restored in the mid to late 19th century . The writer Samuel Lewis recorded in 1849 that St Twrog 's was attached to St <unk> 's Church , Llandrygarn , with the priest serving the two parishes residing in Llandrygarn . The church tithes had been paid to Jesus College , Oxford ( who had built a " neat parsonage @-@ house " in Llandrygarn ) since 1648 , Lewis said , subject to a small deduction for distribution to the poor of the parish . The tithes were given to the college ( which has had strong connections with Wales since its foundation in 1571 ) by a Dr Wynne , Chancellor of Llandaff Cathedral . 
 St Twrog 's is still in use for worship by the Church in Wales . It is one of seven churches in a group of parishes served by the same priest ( Llandrygarn with Bodwrog with Heneglwys with <unk> with Llannerch @-@ y @-@ medd ) . Other churches in the combined parishes include St Cwyllog , Llangwyllog and St Mary , Llannerch @-@ y @-@ medd . It is within the deanery of Malltraeth , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the parish does not have a rector , and the position has been vacant since December 2000 . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 The church is built from rubble masonry , dressed with limestone ; the roof is made from slate , with a stone bellcote at the west end and a bell dating from 1668 . There is no structural division between the nave and chancel , although there is a step and a rail denoting the sanctuary , and overall the church measures about 46 by 13 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 by 4 @.@ 0 m ) . On the south side of the church , there are two windows and a 15th @-@ century square @-@ framed entrance door , which is at the west end ; there are three windows on the north side . The east window and the two eastern @-@ most windows on the north and south sides date from the late 15th century . Like the rest of the windows , these are made wholly or mainly from clear glass ; none of the windows is made entirely of stained glass . The east window has three long narrow lights ( sections of window separated by mullions or tracery ) each with an ogee ( double arc shaped ) curve at the top , topped with eight smaller lights arranged with four in the centre . The other two 15th @-@ century windows are set in square frames and have pairs of lights headed with cinquefoils ( a five leaf pattern ) . The rectangular windows in the middle of the north and south walls were added in the 17th or 18th century , and have pairs of lights . The western @-@ most window on the north side is a converted 15th @-@ century door ; it bears designs of a leaf pattern on one side and three bull 's heads on the other . The three bull 's heads pattern is associated with the Bulkeley family of Beaumaris , who were prominent and influential landowners , in Anglesey and elsewhere in north Wales , from the 15th to the 19th centuries . In 1500 , about the time that the church was rebuilt , Richard Bulkeley was Archdeacon of Anglesey and so would have been involved in the work here , and is likely to have contributed towards the cost . A bull 's head is carved into a stone above the doorway . 
 The roof dates from the 19th century and the supporting woodwork structure can be seen from inside the church . The church , which is lit by gas lamps , contains box pews in the nave , and a panelled reading desk with a matching pulpit , one on each side in the sanctuary . Cream paint has been used for the pews , pulpit and reading desk . There are some 18th @-@ century memorial tablets on the south wall of the nave . A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted an oak collecting shovel dated 1733 , a silver cup dated 1773 and a font of uncertain date . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II * listed building – the second @-@ highest of the three grades of listing , designating " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . It was given this status on 5 April 1971 , and has been listed because it is regarded as " a good rural late Medieval church " . Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes that the church has " a simple traditional character " , and that it retains " many original features . " 
 Writing in 1862 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the east window was similar to windows in the south aisle of St Cybi 's Church , Holyhead . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region also comments upon the east window , saying that it was " surprisingly grand " . A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that St Twrog 's is in " an elevated spot in a remote rural location . " It notes that the east window was " much weathered " , but that overall the building " appears to be in fairly good condition . "

 William Gabriel Davy was born in 1780 in <unk> , Gloucestershire . He was the eldest son of Major William Davy , Persian Secretary to Warren Hastings , the first Governor @-@ General of Bengal . Educated at Eton College , Davy became a lieutenant in the 61st Foot of the British Army in 1797 . He transferred to the 5th battalion of the 60th Foot at the beginning of 1802 , and was made a captain . He was promoted to major and lieutenant @-@ colonel on 5 February 1807 and 28 December 1809 , respectively . After becoming the battalion 's commander in May 1808 , he led the battalion early in the Peninsular War . 
 The battalion departed from Cork on 12 July 1808 . On 1 August , they arrived at <unk> Bay in Portugal , where the first British troops to participate in the Peninsular War landed ; Davy 's battalion was the first to land . The Battle of <unk> was especially difficult , as Davy 's battalion was in the middle of the fighting . At one point , the troops ascended a mountain " so covered with brushwood that [ their ] legs were ready to sink under [ them ] . " In December 1809 , just after being promoted to lieutenant @-@ colonel , he moved to the regiment 's 7th battalion . However , he never participated in physical combat again . He married Mary Ann Carruthers in Adel , Yorkshire on 20 June 1814 . In July 1830 , Davy was made a major general . He remarried in 1840 , to the sister of Major @-@ General Sir Richard England , and was promoted to lieutenant @-@ general in November of the following year . In November 1842 , Davy became colonel of the 1st battalion of the 60th Foot . He was promoted to general in 1854 . From his purchase of the property in 1820 , Davy resided at Tracy Park , Gloucestershire . He died there on 25 January 1856 , aged 77 .

 Davy was awarded the Field Officer 's Gold Medal , a clasp , and a gold ribbon buckle for his service in the battles of <unk> , <unk> and Talavera during the Peninsular War . He was also praised by distinguished figures , such as Secretary of State Lord Castlereagh . Davy became a Companion of the Bath in June 1815 . King William IV knighted Davy and made him a Knight Commander of the Royal <unk> Order in 1836 . 
 = Battle of Chelsea Creek = 
 The Battle of Chelsea Creek was the second military engagement of the Boston campaign of the American Revolutionary War . It is also known as the Battle of Noddle 's Island , Battle of Hog Island and the Battle of the Chelsea Estuary . This battle was fought on May 27 and 28 , 1775 , on Chelsea Creek and on salt marshes , mudflats , and islands of Boston Harbor , northeast of the Boston peninsula . Most of these areas have since been united with the mainland by land reclamation and are now part of East Boston , Chelsea , Winthrop , and Revere . 
 The American colonists met their goal of strengthening the siege of Boston by removing livestock and hay on those islands from the reach of the British regulars . The British armed schooner Diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by the Colonial side . This was the first naval capture of the war , and it was a significant boost to the morale of the Colonial forces . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 drew thousands of militia forces from throughout New England to the towns surrounding Boston . These men remained in the area and their numbers grew , placing the British forces in Boston under siege when they blocked all land access to the peninsula . The British were still able to sail in supplies from Nova Scotia , Providence , and other places because the harbor side of the city remained under British naval control . Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet and the complete absence of a Continental Navy in the spring of 1775 . However , there was one remaining local area that continued to supply the British forces in Boston after the war began . 
 Farmers to the east of the city in coastal areas and on the Boston Harbor islands found themselves vulnerable once the siege began because they were exposed to British influence from the sea . If they continued to sell livestock to the regulars they would be viewed as Loyalists in the eyes of the Patriots , but if they refused to sell then the British would consider them rebels and raiding parties would simply take what they wanted . On May 14 , the Massachusetts Committee of Safety under Joseph Warren issued the following order : 
 Resolved , as their opinion , that all the live stock be taken from Noddle 's Island , Hog Island , Snake Island , and from that part of Chelsea near the sea coast , and be driven back ; and that the execution of this business be committed to the committees of correspondence and selectmen of the towns of Medford , Malden , Chelsea , and Lynn , and that they be supplied with such a number of men , as they shall need , from the regiment now at Medford . 
 A few days before the battle , Warren and General Artemas Ward , commander of the besieging forces , inspected Noddle 's Island and Hog Island , which lay to the northeast of Boston , and east of Charlestown . They found no British troops there but plenty of livestock . The animals in other coastal areas had been moved inland by their owners . On May 21 , the British had sailed troops to Grape Island in the outer harbor near Weymouth to get hay and livestock , and had been driven off by militia mustered from the nearby towns , which then removed the livestock and burned the hay on the island . 
 The British Navy around occupied Boston was under the command of Vice @-@ Admiral Samuel Graves . The Royal Marines were under the command of Major John Pitcairn . The British forces as a whole were led by Governor General Thomas Gage . Graves had , in addition to hay and livestock , hired storage on Noddle 's Island for a variety of important naval supplies , which he felt were important to preserve , owing to the " almost impossibility of replacing them at this Juncture . " 
 = = Prelude to Battle = = 
 Vice @-@ Admiral Graves , apparently acting on intelligence that the Colonials might make attempts on the islands , posted guard boats near Noddle 's Island . These were longboats that included detachments of Marines . Sources disagree as to whether or not any regulars or marines were stationed on Noddle 's Island to protect the naval supplies . 
 The " regiment now at Medford " mentioned by the Committee of Safety was Colonel John Stark 's 1st New Hampshire Regiment of about 300 men stationed near Winter Hill with its headquarters in Medford . Taking his instructions from General Ward , Stark and his regiment crossed the bridge over the Mystic River just after midnight on May 27 . Their route took them far to the north of Chelsea Creek through Malden and parts of what are now the cities of Everett and Revere . Additional local men most likely joined them during their march . Hog Island was accessible at low tide from the east by fording Belle Isle Creek near the current location of Belle Isle Marsh Reservation . This crossing was effected without Graves ' guard boats taking notice . 
 Stark began to move his force to Hog Island at about 10 am and directed most of his men to round up livestock there while he forded Crooked Creek to Noddle 's Island with a group of thirty men . Stark 's small contingent on Noddle 's Island scattered into small groups , killed the animals they could find , and set fire to haystacks and barns . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Islands = = = 
 The British first took notice when they spotted the smoke from the burning hay . Vice @-@ Admiral Graves on his flagship , HMS Preston saw smoke from the burning hay at about 2 pm , and signaled for the guard marines to land on Noddle 's island , which they did , engaging Stark 's scattered forces . Graves also ordered the schooner Diana , under the command of his nephew Lieutenant Thomas Graves , to sail up Chelsea Creek to support the operation and cut off the colonists ' escape . Eventually , a combined force of roughly 400 marines was landed , formed ranks and began to systematically drive Stark 's men back to the east . The colonists fled without fighting until they reached Crooked Creek . There they dropped into marshy ditches and fired on their pursuers from strong defensive positions . A pitched battle followed , in which the colonists " Squat [ t ] ed down in a Ditch on the ma [ r ] sh " and engaged in " a hot <unk> <unk> the Regulars retreated " . 
 The Marines withdrew from their positions to the interior of Noddle 's Island , and Stark 's men left Crooked Creek to join the main body of his forces on Hog Island . Diana and the other vessels continued northeast up Chelsea Creek in pursuit . By sunset , hundreds of cattle , sheep , and horses had been driven from Hog Island to the mainland . Also around sunset , Diana turned about in an attempt to avoid being trapped in the shallows of the creek . However , Lieutenant Graves realized he would require assistance , and raised a signal . Vice @-@ Admiral Graves ordered barges manned by marines into the creek to tow Diana out , along with the sloop Britannia , tender of HMS Somerset ( under the command of another of Graves nephews , Lieutenant John Graves ) to assist and provide additional firepower . 
 Sources disagree on the timing of the dispatching of the various vessels . A number of sources ( <unk> and A Documentary History of Chelsea among them ) claim that Diana , Britannia , and the barges were all dispatched together ; Nelson and Ketchum , possibly on the basis of more recent research , claim the account as told above . 
 = = = Mainland coast = = = 
 Some of Stark 's men were engaged in driving the livestock further up the coast . Others noticed that Diana was in trouble , and called for reinforcements . General Putnam and as many as 1000 troops ( including Joseph Warren ) came up on the shore near Diana , a place at the mouth of Chelsea Creek , in the modern Chelsea neighborhood by the McArdle bridge to East Boston . Putnam waded out into the harbor up to his waist and offered quarter to the sailors of Diana if they would surrender , but its cannon continued to fire , and attempts to tow her into deeper water continued . Colonial forces continued firing on the ship , supported by two field pieces positioned on the shore . Britannia and field pieces the British had landed on Noddle 's Island also joined the cannonade . At about 10 pm , the British rowers were forced to abandon the rescue of Diana due to the heavy fire . Diana drifted and ran aground again on the Mystic River side of the Chelsea coast , tipping onto one side . Lieutenant Graves abandoned Diana and transferred his men to Britannia , which was successfully towed to deeper water . 
 American forces boarded Diana and rapidly removed everything of value , including guns , rigging , sails , clothing , and money . They laid hay under the stern to serve as kindling , and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am to prevent it from falling back into British hands . The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 This skirmish was apparently the first use of field pieces by the Colonists in the American Revolution . They suffered no fatalities , with only a small number of wounded , and their morale was greatly boosted by the successful capture and destruction of Diana . The action was also a boost to Israel Putnam , whose appointment by the Second Continental Congress as a General in the Continental Army was unanimously approved , in part due to reports of this skirmish . 
 General Gage was understated in his casualty report to London : " Two men were killed and a few wounded . " Others , however , apparently exaggerated , reporting large casualties . The Pennsylvania Journal reported on June 21 , 1775 , that General Gage himself recorded at least one hundred killed while other sources said more than three hundred . From another source : " The regulars were said to have suffered very much , not to have had less than two hundred killed and wounded . The loss was probably greatly exaggerated ; that , however , had a good effect on the provincials . The affair was a matter of no small triumph to them and they felt upon the occasion more courageous than ever . " Gage ordered cannon mounted on Copp 's Hill in Boston , and Vice @-@ Admiral Graves moved the Somerset , which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown , into deeper waters to the east of Boston , where it would have improved maneuverability if fired upon from land . He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle 's Island ; the Colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island . 
 = = Geographic changes = = 
 In the years since the American Revolution , the geography of the Boston area has undergone significant expansion , and the islands named Hog and Noddle 's are no longer islands . In the late 19th and early 20th century , the channel that separated Noddle 's and Hog was filled in , and that between Hog Island and the mainland was filled in over the course of the late 19th century and early 20th century leaving just a small , narrow creek between the former islands and the mainland . In terms of modern geography , the Orient Heights neighborhood of East Boston is the present location of Hog Island and nearby Breeds Island , and much of the remainder of East Boston is what was then Noddle 's Island . The Chelsea Creek has been narrowed due to the expansion of Chelsea and has been dredged and straightened to create a deep shipping channel . 
 While occasional attempts have been made to locate the remains of the Diana in Chelsea Creek , which has been extensively dredged and industrialized in the years since the battle , no wrecks found in that body have been identified as hers . In 2009 , the National Park Service gave funds for a state @-@ led effort to locate the wreck . 
 = Thomas Ferens = 
 Thomas Robinson Ferens ( 4 May 1847 – 9 May 1930 ) was a British politician , a philanthropist , and an industrialist . He was the Member of Parliament for Hull East for 13 years , and served the city as a Justice of the Peace and as High Steward . He helped establish Reckitt & Sons , a manufacturer of household goods , as one of Kingston upon Hull ’ s foremost businesses . His career with the company spanned 61 years — from his initial employment as a confidential and shorthand clerk until his death , as chairman , in 1930 . 
 In the House of Commons , Ferens spoke to further the cause of Women 's Rights . He supported women 's suffrage at home , and repeatedly drew attention to the trafficking of women and girls in the colonies . But never a great orator , and by nature a retiring man , much of his work at Westminster was completed in the committee rooms , away from the limelight . He did not seek re @-@ election after being unseated in acrimonious campaign in 1918 . 
 A devout Wesleyan Methodist , Ferens made numerous charitable donations throughout his life . His gifts to Hull include the Ferens Art Gallery and a donation of £ 250 @,@ 000 for the establishment of University College ( now the University of Hull ) . He is memorialized in the University 's motto : <unk> Ferens . In other parts of the country he made substantial donations to schools , hospitals and charitable organisations .

 Ferens was born on 4 May 1847 in East <unk> , a village close to the market town of Bishop Auckland , County Durham . He was the third of the seven children of George Waller Ferens ( 1817 – 1893 ) , a flour miller , and his wife , Anne , née Jackson . After attending Bishop Auckland private school until the age of thirteen , he found employment as a clerk in the Shildon office of the mineral department of the Stockton and Darlington Railway . Six years later , he left home for Stockton where he worked as a clerk to Head , Wrightson & Co . 
 A committed autodidact , he taught himself grammar , arithmetic , mechanics , and shorthand . At weekends he taught at Sunday School and enjoyed playing cricket . In 1868 , after working in Stockton for two years , he left to take up a post as a confidential shorthand clerk to James Reckitt of Reckitt & Sons in Kingston upon Hull .

 In Hull , Ferens continued to teach in Sunday School , a practice he began during his time in Stockton . While teaching at the Brunswick Sunday School he met Ester Ellen ( <unk> ) Field , a fellow teacher and a wealthy merchant ’ s daughter of " rather masculine appearance . " They married in 1873 at Sculcoates Registry Office ; and they continued to teach at the Sunday School for the rest of their lives . Though <unk> remained childless , the couple adopted her nephew , John Johnson Till ( known as Till ) , in 1880 . Till Ferens separated from his wife and became estranged from his adoptive parents during the 1914 – 18 war . Till Ferens , like Thomas , was a Liberal and stood for the Liberal Party at Gainsborough in the 1935 general election . 
 = = A career in industry = = 
 Reckitt & Sons was already a successful firm when Ferens joined it in 1868 . It produced household wares such as starch , washing blue and black lead . It had been acquired by Isaac Reckitt , a Quaker , in 1840 and was now run by his sons , also Quakers , George ( 1825 – 1900 ) , Francis ( 1827 – 1917 ) and James ( 1833 – 1924 ) . 
 Ferens was industrious and forward @-@ thinking ; he moved swiftly through the company 's managerial ranks . In 1874 he became Works Manager with a share in profits ; in 1879 , Secretary ; in 1880 , General Manager . He joined the board of directors in 1888 when Reckitt & Sons became a private joint @-@ stock company . When James Reckitt died , 36 years later , Ferens was named joint chairman . 
 Under the guidance of Ferens and James Reckitt , the company flourished , becoming one of the most successful in the city . It opened offices in London and New York and expanded into pharmaceuticals — a natural progression from its disinfectants business . Dettol was launched in 1932 . 
 = = Politics and public life = = 
 In 1894 Ferens was appointed a Justice of the Peace . In 1911 he was made a Freeman of the City of Hull . He entered parliament as Liberal member for Hull East in 1906 after an unsuccessful bid for the same seat six years earlier . In 1912 King George V appointed him to the Privy Council , and in the same year he became High Steward of Hull . 
 He was not a frequent speaker in parliament but he chaired several committees and was a member of the Inter @-@ Parliamentary Union before the First World War . Hansard , the printed record of parliamentary debates , records that his first parliamentary contribution related to schools in orphan homes , and his last to the health of troops in Palestine . 
 A recurrent theme in Ferens ' parliamentary contributions is Women 's Rights . In 1910 he presented a petition in favour of the enfranchisement of women . In 1912 , when the House discussed an allegedly inflammatory speech by Emmeline Pankhurst , Ferens wondered whether her speech might have been influenced by the " example of some Privy counsellors . " The following year , he asked several questions regarding slave @-@ trading in women ; including the trade in West African women , and the trade of European and Japanese women to India . In 1917 he questioned the Home Secretary on the role of women in the police force . 
 Ferens ' personal and religious convictions are evident in other of his parliamentary contributions . He tabled a number of questions concerning temperance , both at home and in the colonies . His first question in the Commons was about orphan schools . He later asked about railway accidents to children , and about trafficking of young girls in India . 
 In 1915 Ferens opened a parliamentary debate on the increase in the cost of living caused by the war , which was " causing much hardship , especially to the poor . " He noted that " Many labourers ' families have now to be content , owing to the high price of the necessaries of life , with one meal of meat in the week . " In replying , the Prime Minister , Herbert Asquith , agreed that prices were high but he felt they were not as high as might have been expected considering the scale of the global conflict . He remarked that the current high prices were not without precedent , even in peacetime ; the price of coal was no higher than it had been in 1875 . 
 Ferens also intervened on behalf of his constituency and its inhabitants . In April 1913 he drew the attention of the Postmaster @-@ General to the case of a post office sorting @-@ clerk who was having difficulties claiming his pension . On 10 August 1916 , after a fatal raid by a Zeppelin in the early of the previous morning , against which the city had been able to muster only a single searchlight and one gun , he asked that adequate defences be provided and brought to action where necessary . 
 The 1918 election campaign was acrimonious and Ferens was subjected to personal attacks accusing him of being a Little Englander . In reporting on the four contested Hull seats , The Times spoke of “ Slashing attacks , covert insults , challenges , <unk> and the incessant chatter of other weapons ... ” It noted that Ferens ’ opponent , Charles Murchinson , was “ busy digging out ' Little Navy ’ speeches of Mr Ferens in 1909 [ <unk> Englander ] ... ” Murchinson was elected and Ferens resolved never to stand again . After the war he became an active supporter of the League of Nations . Away from politics , Ferens was an important figure in the Nonconformist community although , typically , he stayed out of the limelight . In a survey of the personalities of Free Church leaders , the Times noted that “ among the most respected counsellors of Nonconformity are men who seldom figure on platforms ” , and went on to list Ferens among their number . “ The leadership of Nonconformity is largely in the hands of laymen ” , it commented . 
 In 1924 Ferens attempted to intervene on behalf William George Smith , a Ship ’ s Painter who had been sentenced to death for murder at York Assizes . A telegram addressed to the King was sent in the early hours of 9 December appealing for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative . But the appeal was unsuccessful and Smith was executed at Hull Gaol later that morning . 
 = = Temperance = = 
 Ferens was a lifelong teetotaller and a strong advocate of temperance . In his youth he attended Band of Hope meetings . In 1913 he was elected treasurer of the United Kingdom Alliance . 
 In 1923 he shared a platform with the Archbishop of Canterbury at the Mansion House . The occasion was the inaugural meeting of the National United Campaign of the Churches , which was organised by The Temperance Council of the Christian Churches of England and Wales . 
 The campaign 's objectives were to present “ the modern scientific indictment of alcoholic beverages and its moral implications ” , and to “ rally local support for the Council ’ s immediate legislative program ” , which included the prohibition of the sale of alcohol to persons under the age of 18 , and the banning of the sale of alcohol on Sundays . But the Campaign was firmly opposed to Prohibition , as is plain in the Times ' report of the Archbishop 's address : 
 " To his mind prohibition was the very antithesis of temperance ( Cheers . ) It was an open confession of failure . " 
 Ferens donated £ 1 @,@ 000 to a fund established to accomplish the aims of the campaign . 
 = = A benevolent man = = 
 From the time he started earning a salary , Ferens allocated 10 % of his income to charity . His personal wealth increased quickly , inline with the growth of Reckitt & Sons , affording him the opportunity to make ever more generous donations . This he deemed " one of the greatest blessings of my life . " By 1920 he was distributing £ 47 @,@ 000 out of his annual income of £ 50 @,@ 000 . 
 In 1917 Ferens purchased a plot of land in Queen Victoria Square in Hull city centre . The land was the site of a former Church , Saint John 's . Later in the year he wrote to the council , informing them that he intended to donate the land to the city , and that he would also donate shares in Reckitt & Sons worth £ 35 @,@ 000 . In his letter , which was read out at a council meeting , Ferens explained that the shares and the land were to be used to build an art gallery . 
 Nine years later the Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone for The Ferens Art Gallery . Afterwards , the prince visited the premises of Reckitt & Sons where he was greeted by the company ’ s workforce which now numbered 6000 . The Ferens Art Gallery finally opened in 1927 . 
 Educational establishments and hospitals were often the beneficiaries of Ferens ’ munificence . In 1924 he donated £ 30 @,@ 000 to extend Kingswood School for Boys , Bath . A year later , the Queen opened an extension to Farrington Girls School , <unk> , which Ferens had made possible with a donation of a similar amount . In the same year a new post @-@ graduate Theological College , to which he had donated £ 17 @,@ 000 , was opened in Cambridge for the training of Wesleyan ministers . 
 In February 1927 Ferens formally handed over the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology to Prince Arthur , which he had made possible by a donation of £ 20 @,@ 000 . In handing over the institute , Ferens said that he hoped that it would attract workers from all parts of the Empire , and from countries outside it . 
 In 1925 Ferens made his largest single donation . He wrote to the Lord Mayor of Kingston upon Hull to inform him that he intended to donate £ 250 @,@ 000 towards the foundation of a university college in the city . The college would be built in the west of city on an eighteen and a half acre site , which Ferens had previously donated . The Duke of York laid the foundation stone in 1928 , and Prince George opened the new college in 1929 . Ferens became the college 's first president , and is memorialized its motto : " <unk> Ferens " — " carrying the light ( of learning ) . " The dove in the university 's logo , which signifies peace , is taken from Ferens ' coat of arms . 
 Ferens remained a modest man ; he saw giving as a moral duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement . In replying to the headmaster ’ s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926 , the King said : 
 “ The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens ’ s benefactions in other parts of the country ; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner , and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part , I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today . ”

 In March 1930 , ill health prevented Ferens from attending the company ’ s Annual Meeting . It was the first he had missed in 50 years . He had not fulfilled any public engagements for some weeks ; nevertheless , he wrote out his speech and it was presented by Sir Harold Reckitt . In the speech Ferens was again able to present the board with pleasing figures . The net profit was £ 1 @,@ 277 @,@ 683 , an increase of £ 33 @,@ 108 over 1928 , which was itself a record year . It was a source of great gratification for him “ to be able to say that the most cordial relations exist between the workers , the management and the board ” . Ferens died in his home , Holderness House , in East Hull on 9 May 1930 . Hettie had predeceased him eight years earlier . In his will he bequeathed the house and its grounds , together with an endowment of £ 50 @,@ 000 , to be used as a rest home for poor gentlewomen and to be preserved as an open space for East Hull .

 The year after his death , a pageant was held to mark the opening of Ferensway , a major new thoroughfare in the centre of the city . The Times reported that it would “ rank as one of the finest in the North of England ” , and continued , “ The street is 100 ft wide , 10 ft wider than Regent Street in London .

 = Battle of Schliengen = 
 At the Battle of Schliengen ( 24 October 1796 ) , both the French Army of the Rhine and Moselle under the command of Jean @-@ Victor Moreau and the Austrian army under the command of Archduke Charles of Austria claimed victories . The village of Schliengen lies in the present @-@ day Kreis Lörrach close to the border of present @-@ day Baden @-@ Württemberg ( Germany ) , the Haut @-@ Rhin ( France ) , and the Canton of Basel @-@ Stadt ( Switzerland ) . 
 During the French Revolutionary Wars , Schliengen was a strategically important location for the armies of both Republican France and Habsburg Austria . Control of the area gave either combatant access to southwestern German states and important Rhine river crossings . On 20 October Moreau retreated from Freiburg im Breisgau and established his army along a ridge of hills . The severe condition of the roads prevented Archduke Charles from flanking the French right wing . The French left wing lay too close to the Rhine to outflank , and the French center , positioned in a 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) semi @-@ circle on heights that commanded the terrain below , was unassailable . Instead , he attacked the French flanks directly , and in force , which increased casualties for both sides . 
 Although the French and the Austrians claimed victory at the time , military historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage . However , the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen . A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine , when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy . The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . 
 = = Background = = 
 Initially , the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as a dispute between the French king and his subjects , and not something in which they should interfere . As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident , they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family ; this Declaration of Pilnitz ( 27 August 1791 ) threatened ambiguous , but quite serious , consequences if anything should happen to the royal family . The position of the revolutionaries became increasingly difficult . Compounding their problems in international relations , French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter @-@ revolution . Finally , on 20 April 1792 , the French National Convention declared war on Austria . In this War of the First Coalition ( 1792 – 98 ) , France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her , plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire . Despite some victories in 1792 , by early 1793 , France was in terrible crisis : French forces had been pushed out of Belgium ; also there was revolt in the Vendée over conscription ; wide @-@ spread resentment of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy ; and the French king had just been executed . The armies of the French Republic were in a state of disruption ; the problems became even more acute following the introduction of mass conscription , the levée en masse , which saturated an already distressed army with thousands of illiterate , untrained men . For the French , the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved especially disastrous , although they had achieved some success in other theaters of war ( see for example , War of the Pyrenees ( 1793 – 95 ) ) . 
 = = = Campaign in 1796 = = = 
 The armies of the First Coalition included the imperial contingents and the infantry and cavalry of the various states , amounting to about 125 @,@ 000 ( including three autonomous corps ) , a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force by the standards of the Revolutionary wars . In total , though , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief Archduke Charles ' troops stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea and Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser 's , from the Swiss @-@ Italian border to the Adriatic . Habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army , but the thin white line of Habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from Basel to Frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of their opponents . Compared to French coverage , Charles had half the number of troops covering a 211 @-@ mile ( 340 km ) front that stretched from Renchen near Basel to Bingen . Furthermore , he had concentrated the bulk of his force , commanded by Count Baillet Latour , between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt , where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely , as it offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna , with good bridges crossing a relatively well @-@ defined river bank . To his north , Wilhelm von Wartensleben 's autonomous corps covered the line between Mainz and Giessen . The Austrian army consisted of professionals , many moved from the border regions in the Balkans , and conscripts drafted from the imperial circles . 
 Two French generals , Jean Baptiste Jourdan and Jean Victor Moreau , commanded ( respectively ) the Army of Sambre @-@ et @-@ Meuse and the Army of the Rhine and Moselle at the outset of the 1796 campaign . The French citizens ' army , created by mass conscription of young men and systematically divested of old men who might have tempered the rash impulses of teenagers and young adults , and had already made itself odious , by reputation and rumor at least , throughout France . Furthermore , it was an army entirely dependent upon the countryside for its material support . After April 1796 , pay was made in metallic value , but pay was still in arrears . Throughout the spring and early summer , the unpaid French army was in almost constant mutiny : in May 1796 , in the border town of Zweibrücken , the 74th Demi @-@ brigade revolted . In June , the 17th Demi @-@ brigade was insubordinate ( frequently ) and in the 84th Demi @-@ brigade , two companies rebelled . The French commanders understood that an assault into the German states was essential , not only in terms of war aims , but also in practical terms : the French Directory believed that war should pay for itself , and did not budget for the payment or feeding of its troops . 
 In Spring , 1796 , when resumption of war appeared eminent , the 88 members of the Swabian Circle , which included most of the states ( ecclesiastical , secular , and dynastic ) in Upper Swabia , had raised a small force of about 7 @,@ 000 men . These were literally raw recruits , field hands and day laborers drafted for service , but usually untrained in military matters . It was largely guess work where they should be placed , and Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location . Consequently , in early late May and early June , when the French started to mass troops by Mainz as if they would cross there — they even engaged the Imperial force at Altenkirchen ( 4 June ) and Wetzler and Uckerath ( 15 June ) — Charles thought that main attack would occur there and felt few qualms placing the 7 @,@ 000 @-@ man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl . On 24 June , though , at Kehl , Moreau 's advance guard , 10 @,@ 000 , preceded the main force of 27 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 000 cavalry directed at the Swabian pickets on the bridge . The Swabians were hopelessly outnumbered and could not be reinforced . Most of the Imperial Army of the Rhine was stationed further north , by Mannheim , where the river was easier to cross , but too far away to support the smaller force at Kehl . Neither the Condé 's troops in Freiburg nor Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg 's force in Rastatt could reach Kehl in time to support them . Within a day , Moreau had four divisions across the river . Thrust out of Kehl , the Swabian contingent reformed at Rastatt by 5 July . There they managed to hold the city until the French turned both flanks . Charles could not move much of his army away from Mannheim or Karlsruhe , where the French had also formed across the river , and Fürstenberg could not hold the southern flank . Furthermore , at Hüningen , near Basel , on the same day that Moreau 's advance guard crossed at Kehl , Ferino executed a full crossing , and advanced unopposed east along the German shore of the Rhine with the 16th and 50th Demi @-@ brigades , the 68th , 50th and 68th line infantry , and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons . 
 The Habsburg and Imperial armies were in danger of encirclement , as the French pressed hard at Rastatt . Ferino moved quickly east along the shore of the Rhine ; from there , an approach from the rear might have flanked the entire force . To prevent this , Charles executed an orderly withdrawal in four columns through the Black Forest , across the Upper Danube valley , and toward Bavaria , trying to maintain consistent contact with all flanks as each column withdrew through the Black Forest and the Upper Danube . By mid @-@ July , the column encamped near Stuttgart . The third column , which included the Condé 's Corps , retreated through Waldsee to Stockach , and eventually Ravensburg . The fourth Austrian column , the smallest ( three battalions and four squadrons ) , Ludwig Wolff de la Marselle , marched the length of the Bodensee 's northern shore , via Überlingen , Meersburg , Buchhorn , and the Austrian city of Bregenz . 
 Given the size of the attacking force , Charles had to withdraw far enough into Bavaria to align his northern flank in a perpendicular line with Wartensleben 's autonomous corps to protect the Danube valley and deny the French primary access to Vienna . His own front would prevent Moreau from flanking Wartensleben from the south and together they could resist the French onslaught . In the course of this withdrawal , he abandoned the Swabian Circle to the French . For the Swabians to negotiate neutrality , their militia needed to disband . At the end of July , eight thousand of Charles ' men executed a dawn attack on the camp of the remaining three thousand Swabian and Condé 's immigrant troops , disarmed them , and impounded their weapons . As Charles withdrew further east , the neutral zone established in Swabia expanded , eventually to encompass most of southern German states and the Ernestine Duchies . 
 = = = Summer of maneuvers = = = 
 The summer and fall included various conflicts throughout the southern territories of the German states as the armies of the Coalition and the armies of the Directory sought to flank each other : 
 By mid @-@ summer , the situation looked grim for the Coalition : Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east @-@ northeast despite Charles ' orders to unite with him . It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would outmaneuver Charles by driving a wedge between his force and that of Wartensleben . At Neresheim on 11 August , Moreau crushed Charles ' force , forcing him to withdraw further east . At last , however , with this loss , Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction , moving his corps to join at Charles ' northern flank . At Amberg on 24 August , Charles inflicted a defeat on the French , yet that same day , his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg . Regardless , the tide had turned in the Coalition 's favor . Both Jourdan and Moreau had overstretched their lines , moving far into the German states , and were separated too far from each other for one to offer the other aid or security . The Coalition 's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau , similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben . As the French withdrew toward the Rhine , Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward . On 3 September at Würzburg , Jourdan attempted to halt his retreat . Once Moreau received word of the French defeat , he had to withdraw from southern Germany . He pulled his troops back through the Black Forest , with Ferino supervising the rear guard . The Austrian corps commanded by Latour drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4 @,@ 000 men taken as prisoners , some standards and artillery , after which Latour followed at a more prudent distance . 
 = = Terrain = = 
 The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the Swiss Cantons . The High Rhine ( <unk> ) , the 80 @-@ mile ( 130 km ) stretch between the Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen and Basel , cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed ; in such places as the former rapids at Laufenburg , it moves in torrents . A few miles north and east of Basel , the terrain flattens . The Rhine makes a wide , northerly turn , in what is called the Rhine knee , and enters the so @-@ called Rhine ditch ( Rheingraben ) , part of a rift valley bordered by the Black Forest on the east and Vosges Mountains on the west . In 1796 , the plain on both sides of the river , some 19 miles ( 31 km ) wide , was dotted with villages and farms . At the farthest edges of the flood plain , especially on the eastern side , the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon . Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest , creating deep defiles in the mountains . The tributaries then wound in rivulets through the flood plain to the river . 
 The landscape was impressive , but rugged . As a nineteenth @-@ century traveler described it , 
 the mountains in the vicinity [ of Müllheim ] are bold ; the dark ravines contrasting with its sunny fronts offer some exquisite scenes . The Rhine ... lay revealed before us for many a league , twisting and twining like a serpent of silver ... dotted with innumerable islands , and flowing through a most extensive plain , perfectly flat . Our elevation was considerable and the eye ranged over a great extent of country : <unk> [ sic ] , in France , and the level country as far as Bingen , would have been seen to their furthest limits had not the distance melted the extreme verges into ' thin air ' . Many were the villages , and hamlets , and woods sprinkled over the landscape .... 
 The traveler described additional walks , in which the forest of dark pine bordered directly on the road , " <unk> [ sic ] by glades in which browsed sheep and goats . " 
 The Rhine River itself looked different in the 1790s than it does today ; the passage from Basel to Iffezheim was " corrected " ( straightened ) between 1817 and 1875 . Between 1927 and 1975 , a canal was constructed to control the water level . In 1790 , though , the river was wild and unpredictable , in some places four times wider or more than it is in the twenty @-@ first century , even under regular water levels . Its channels wound through marsh and meadow , and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods .

 Throughout September and early October , Charles maintained his pressure on Moreau 's army , pushing it further to the west . On 18 September , part of an Austrian division under Feldmarschall @-@ Leutnant Petrasch swept from Karlsruhe , south to Kehl and stormed the Rhine bridgehead there ; he succeeded in holding it , with high losses ( about 2 @,@ 000 of his 5 @,@ 000 men were killed , wounded or missing ) . Immediately , though , General Schauenburg , the French garrison commander , counter @-@ attacked and drove the Austrians back ; the French lost 1 @,@ 200 killed or wounded , and 800 captured . Even though the French still held the crossing at Kehl and Strasbourg , Petrasch 's Austrians prevented Moreau from using the crossing to escape to France , leaving as his only reliable route to France the bridge at Hüningen . If Moreau , at that point situated in Freiburg , withdrew too soon from the Breisgau , Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino ' s column would be trapped there . 
 The next contact occurred on 19 October at Emmendingen , in the Elz valley which winds through the Black Forest . The section of the valley involved in the battle runs southwest through the mountains from Elzach , through Bleibach and Waldkirch . Just to the southwest of Waldkirch , the river emerges from the mountains and flows north @-@ west towards the Rhine , with the Black Forest to its right . This section of the river passes through Emmendingen before it reaches Riegel . Riegel sits in a narrow gap between the Black Forest and an isolated outcropping of volcanic hills known as the Kaiserstuhl . Here the archduke split his force into four columns . 
 Column Nauendorf , in the upper Elz , had 8 battalions and 14 squadrons , advancing southwest to Waldkirch ; column Wartensleben had 12 battalions and 23 squadrons advancing south to capture the Elz bridge at Emmendingen . Latour , with 6 @,@ 000 men , was to cross the foothills via Heimbach and <unk> , and capture the bridge of <unk> , between Riegel and Emmendingen , and column Fürstenberg held <unk> , about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Riegel . Michael Fröhlich and Condé ( part of Friedrich Joseph , Count of Nauendorf 's column ) were to pin down Ferino and the French right wing in the Stieg valley . Nauendorf 's men were able to ambush Saint ' Cyr 's advance ; Latour 's columns attacked Beaupuy at Matterdingen , killing the general and throwing his column into confusion . Wartensleben , in the center , was held up by French riflemen until his third ( reserve ) detachment arrived to outflank them . In the ensuing melee , Wartensleben was mortally wounded . The French retreated across the rivers , destroying all the bridges . 
 Lack of bridges did not slow the Coalition pursuit . The Austrians repaired the bridges by Matterdingen , and moved on Moreau at Freiburg . On 20 October , Moreau 's army of 20 @,@ 000 united south of Freiburg im Breisgau with Ferino 's column . Ferino 's force was smaller than Moreau had hoped , bringing the total of the combined French force to about 32 @,@ 000 . Charles ' combined forces of 24 @,@ 000 closely followed Moreau 's rear guard from Freiburg , southwest , to a line of hills stretching between Kandern and the river . 
 = = = French dispositions = = = 
 After a retreat of approximately 38 miles ( 61 km ) in which his rear guard was continually harassed by the vanguard of his enemy , Moreau halted at Schliengen and distributed his army in a 7 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 12 km ) semicircle along a ridge that commanded the approaches from Freiburg . He placed his right wing , commanded by Ferino , at the neighboring heights of Kandern ( altitude 1 @,@ 155 feet ( 352 m ) ) and Sitzenkirch , and his left wing at Steinstadt . His center occupied the village of Schliengen ( altitude 820 feet or 250 meters ) , which lay about 3 miles ( 5 km ) from the Rhine river . His entire force guarded a front protected by a small stream , the 14 @-@ mile ( 23 km ) long Kander that meandered out of the mountains west of Kandern and plunged 755 feet ( 230 m ) into the Rhine when it passed Steinstadt . For extra protection , Moreau also posted a body of infantry in front of his center , giving it added depth . His position on the heights gave him the advantage in any approach ; his troops could fire downhill on any advancing troops . The French position , in the chain of abrupt and woody heights , seemed nearly impregnable . 
 = = = Austrian strategy = = = 
 The Austrian army , augmented by the Army of Condé under the prince 's command , approached from Freiburg . Charles had a couple of options open to him . Any direct assault on the French position would be costly ; Moreau had chosen an almost unassailable position , especially for his center . Any Habsburg force would have to cross the Kandern ; in most cases , it would have to advance uphill into withering fire . Charles could avoid a battle by leaving a force to keep the French occupied and directing a part of his army through the mountains to the left of the Kandern , descending into the valley to Wies and disrupt the French line with Hüningen . However , this operation would take time , and the roads were bad from the rain , making any such maneuver difficult . 
 Rather than see his enemy slip from his grasp , Charles decided to turn Moreau 's right flank at Kandern . He redistributed the four columns : Condé 's Emigré Corps formed the far right column , and Condé 's grandson , Louis Antoine , Duke of Enghien , commanded its vanguard ; the second column , commanded by the young but reliable Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg , included 9 battalions and 26 squadrons . Charles ordered the first two columns to keep the left wing of the French army in check , preventing it from swinging around his own army 's rear in a flanking maneuver . This force also maintained contact with Petrasch 's force by Kehl . 
 The third column , commanded by the experienced Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour , included 11 battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry . The fourth , commanded by the dependable Friedrich Joseph , Count of Nauendorf , included the entire vanguard of Charles ' corps and approached on the far Austrian left . The two larger columns , under Latour and Nauendorf , were to attack the French right wing in force , and to turn it so that the French army 's back was to the Rhine . This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances : they would approach the French uphill from them . Nauendorf divided his column into several smaller groups , and approached Kandern from several sides , up the steep slopes , by coordinating contact between his column and Latour 's , using Maximilian , Count of Merveldt 's regiment as the link between them . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Condé 's Corps formed down river at Neuburg and Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg 's column formed at Müllheim . Their role was specific : keep the French left from flanking the main Austrian force . Yet , despite specific orders to the contrary , the Duke of Enghien , Condé 's grandson , led a spirited attack on Steinstadt with the Army of Condé ; they took the village with a bayonet charge and remained there under severe artillery and musket fire for the rest of the daylight hours . Republican fire continued , incessant and terrible . An officer was killed as he stood between the Royal Highnesses ( Condé , his son , and grandson ) and the Duke of Berry . Taking advantage of the royalist acquisition , the second column took the hill opposite Schliengen , which was heavily defended by General of Division Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr . Saint @-@ Cyr tried several times to retake the position , but Fürstenberg 's column clung to its prize throughout the day , despite a heavy cannonade from the French divisions opposite it . 
 On the opposite side of the battlefield , Latour 's column marched through part of the night to Feldburg , passed through <unk> at 47 ° 47 ′ N 7 ° 37 ′ E to Feldberg , after which it separated into two smaller columns . At 07 : 00 , the right column attacked Ferino 's positions in two vineyards which lay approximately 6 miles ( 10 km ) to the northeast at 47 ° 46 ′ 0 @.@ 12 ″ N 7 ° 39 ′ 0 @.@ 00 ″ E. This column forced the French to retire behind Liel at 47 ° 45 ′ N 7 ° 36 ′ E , 0 @.@ 8 miles ( 1 km ) east of Schliengen . The left column , meanwhile , had attacked another position by <unk> . After fierce fighting , Latour 's column dislodged the French after obstinate resistance ; the second portion of Latour 's column approached the hamlet <unk> from the reverse angle , and forced a French contingent from the village . <unk> combat followed as the Austrians made the steep , uphill advance . 
 The greater part of the battle , yet to come , fell to Nauendorf 's column . His men had marched all of the preceding night ; his column moved with the corps of General Latour to Feldburg , but by the castle of <unk> 3 @.@ 9 miles ( 6 km ) to the east at 47 ° 44 ′ 0 ″ N 7 ° 49 ′ 0 ″ E , it turned to the left ( west ) to penetrate to the source of the Kandern stream . Finally , by 14 : 00 , two in the afternoon , Nauendorf 's column had slogged through mud and muck and came fully into the action . Despite determined opposition , his troops ousted the French from Kandern and Sitzenkirch , and all the high ground above the river and <unk> . The fighting there , between Ferino 's and Nauendorf 's columns , was intense and horrific : Moreau later recounted that Ferino 's troops performed " prodigies of valor " from daybreak to nightfall . When Nauendorf finished pushing the French from Kandern , and two hamlets beside it , and he sent a note with this information to Latour . As the battle finished , a ferocious storm unleashed hail and wind . So ended the first day of the battle during which Charles ' army had successfully ousted both French flanks from their positions . Overnight , Charles drew up his plans to attack the French center on the following morning . It promised to be a long and bloody second day . 
 = = = Withdrawal = = = 
 Moreau appreciated his untenable position , especially on his right where the bulk of Charles ' force stood ready to attack again in the morning . The Austrian army occupied a line which passed obliquely across the extremity of his right , and another line which passed along his left ; they both intersected in front of him , where the main force of Charles ' army blocked any movement forward . With luck , his troops might hold the Austrians off another day , but there were hazards : principally , the Austrians could break either wing , swing behind him and cut him off from the bridge at Hüningen , which was his only escape route back to France . Consequently , that night he withdrew his right wing to the heights of <unk> at 47 ° 43 ′ N 7 ° 37 ′ E , a position scarcely less impregnable than that which it had abandoned . With a strong rear guard provided by Abbatucci and Lariboisière , he abandoned his position the same night and retreated part of the 9 @.@ 7 miles ( 16 km ) to Hüningen . The right and left wings followed . By 3 November he had reached Haltingen and evacuated his troops over the bridge into France . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 With their backs to the river , Ferino and Moreau had to retreat across the Rhine into France , but retained control of the fortifications at Kehl and Hüningen and , more importantly , the tête @-@ du @-@ ponts of the star @-@ shaped fortresses where the bridges crossed the river . Moreau offered an armistice to Charles , which the archduke was inclined to accept . He wanted to secure the Rhine crossings and send troops to northern Italy to relieve Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser at besieged Mantua ; an armistice with Moreau would allow him to do that . However , his brother , Francis II , the Holy Roman Emperor , and the civilian military advisers of the Aulic Council categorically refused such an armistice , forcing Charles to order simultaneous sieges at Kehl and Hüningen . These tied his army to the Rhine for most of the winter . He moved north with the bulk of his force to invest Kehl , and instructed Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg to conduct the siege in the south by Basel . While the Austrians besieged these Rhine crossings , Moreau had sufficient surplus troops to send 14 demi @-@ brigades ( approximately 12 @,@ 000 troops ) into Italy to assist in the siege at Mantua . 
 = Skyfall ( song ) = 
 " Skyfall " is the theme song of the 2012 James Bond film of the same name , performed by British singer Adele . It was written by Adele and producer Paul Epworth and features orchestration by J. A. C. Redford . Film company Eon Productions invited the singer to work on the theme song in early 2011 , a task that Adele accepted after reading the film 's script . While composing the song , Adele and Epworth aimed to capture the mood and style of the other Bond themes , including dark and moody lyrics descriptive of the film 's plot . 
 " Skyfall " was released at 0 : 07 BST on 5 October 2012 as part of the Global James Bond Day , celebrating the 50th anniversary of the release of Dr. No , the first James Bond film . The song quickly went to the top of the iTunes chart , and reached number two at the UK Singles Chart and eight on the Billboard Hot 100 . Reviews were positive , with the song being compared to Shirley Bassey 's Bond themes , and " Skyfall " became the first Bond theme to win at the Golden Globes , the Brit Awards and the Academy Awards . It also won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media . During the 85th Academy Awards , Adele performed the song live for the first time . 
 = = Background and production = = 
 In early 2011 Sony Pictures President of Music , Lia Vollack , suggested to the James Bond film producers at Eon Productions that they ask Adele to record a theme song for their next Bond film , later revealed to be titled Skyfall . Vollack thought that Adele would be a good choice to ask to record a Bond theme song , because her music had a " soulful , haunting , evocative quality " , which Vollack considered would bring back the " classic Shirley Bassey feel " associated with several early Bond films . 
 Adele , who had just released her second album 21 , admitted that initially she was a " little hesitant " about agreeing to write a Bond theme song . On meeting with the Skyfall film crew , the singer had told Skyfall director Sam Mendes that she felt as though she was not the person that they were looking for because " my songs are personal , I write from the heart " . Mendes simply replied " just write a personal song " , telling her to use Carly Simon 's " Nobody Does It Better " from The Spy Who Loved Me as an inspiration . Adele left the meeting with the script of Skyfall and , upon reading it , decided that it was a " no @-@ brainer " as she " fell in love " with the film 's plot . Producer Paul Epworth , who had worked with Adele on 21 , was brought in to help her write the song . Adele stated that she enjoyed working to a brief and set of guidelines , even though it was something she had never done before . 
 Production of " Skyfall " , from the first contact with Adele to the song 's release , took 18 months to complete . Vollack stated that the reason for this was " fine @-@ tuning " the song , as Adele and Epworth wanted to ensure that they " were getting it right " . The first cut of the song was completed in October 2011 , as Adele had free time after cancelling the final concerts of her Adele Live tour due to vocal problems . During an interview at their post @-@ Academy Award for Best Original Song win in February 2013 , Adele revealed that the first draft of the song was written in 10 minutes . After Adele underwent throat microsurgery for vocal problems , she recorded a demo of the track and sent it to Mendes , who was doing the principal photography of Skyfall . The director in turn played the demo for film producer Barbara Broccoli and Bond actor Daniel Craig , both of whom " shed a tear " . Adele stated that the final cut of the song lasted two studio sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London . It features a 77 @-@ piece orchestra conducted by J. A. C. Redford . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Skyfall " is an orchestral pop song with a duration of four minutes and forty @-@ six seconds . Epworth stated that although " Skyfall " is an original composition , he and Adele had worked to capture " the James Bond feeling " of previous theme songs . The song intentionally references Monty Norman 's " James Bond Theme " after the first chorus . Norman said that the song had his seal of approval and that including the leitmotif he wrote for the Bond character was " a pretty sensible thing to do , if you want to feel the ' James Bond quality ' of the music " . Epworth said that while " Skyfall " was his first experience writing film music , he had been involved with the production of James Bond music before : while Epworth was a tape operator at AIR Studios , he recorded some film soundtracks including David Arnold 's Tomorrow Never Dies . 
 Epworth stated that the producers ' request was for " a dramatic ballad " , so he and Adele tried to " do something that was simultaneously dark and final , like a funeral , and to try and turn it into something that was not final . A sense of death and rebirth " . Epworth watched the first thirteen Bond films seeking the " musical code " of the songs , " whatever the modal structure or the chord that always seemed to unify those songs " and contributed to the mood and " that kind of ' 60s jazzy quality " . Epworth identified as an uniting factor " a minor ninth as the harmonic code ... the Bond songs , they have that elaboration to it " , and wrote what would become the instrumental part of " Skyfall " . He described it as " a bit of a ' Eureka ! ' moment " . 
 " Skyfall " was composed in the key of C minor using common time at 76 beats per minute ( Adagietto ) . Adele 's vocal range spans over one octave , from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5 , on the song . The lyrics closely follow the narrative of the film rather than focusing on romanticism . According to Epworth , the song is about " death and rebirth " , saying " It 's like , when the world ends and everything comes down around your ears , if you 've got each other 's back , you can conquer anything . From death to triumph , that was definitely something we set out to try and capture " . The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick described the lyrics as " slightly sinister " and containing references to a number of Bond tropes and motifs .

 The theme song , and the identity of its singer , was kept secret , but rumours of Adele 's involvement still emerged . Adele first mentioned recording a " special project " in September 2011 in an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show , leading to speculation in the media that she was recording a Bond theme . In an interview with NRJ in April 2012 , the singer stated that she intended released a new single by the end of the year ; however , it would not be preceding a new album . Further rumours about Adele 's involvement circulated in September 2012 , when she was reportedly seen at Abbey Road Studios where Thomas Newman was recording Skyfall 's musical score . The song 's title was originally rumoured to be " Let the Sky Fall " . In September 2012 OneRepublic vocalist Ryan Tedder posted a message on Twitter claiming he had heard the title track and that it was " the best James Bond theme in his lifetime " . Adele 's publicist , Paul Moss , mentioned the song on his Twitter feed ; both later deleted their messages . The artwork for the song was leaked online , but Adele 's involvement in the project was not officially confirmed until 1 October . " Skyfall " was released at 0 : 07 BST on 5 October 2012 as part of the " Global James Bond Day " , celebrating the 50th anniversary of the release of Dr. No , the first James Bond film . A 12 @-@ inch single featuring unofficial remixes of the song was sold in Germany to promote the song . 
 The song was not included in Skyfall : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack , marking the second time in the Bond series that the theme song was split from the soundtrack album , following " You Know My Name " from Casino Royale in 2006 . Wilson and Broccoli still asked composer Thomas Newman to include a reference to " Skyfall " in the film 's score , " so that it didn 't appear as a kind of ' one off ' at the top of the movie " . Newman opted to include an interpolation in the track " Komodo Dragon " , used in a scene where Bond enters a casino in Macau . According to Newman the scene had " a real moment of ' Bond ' swagger " , and the music fitted the scene accordingly . Epworth was visited by Newman for advice , and Redford , who was already doing the score 's orchestration , was requested to arrange " Komodo Dragon " ; Newman was unable to do the arrangement because he felt that his task " was already so huge and daunting " .

 Entertainment Weekly wrote that there is " finally " a great James Bond theme . The Huffington Post described the song as a " brassy and soulful tune [ that ] fits perfectly alongside the work of Shirley Bassey in the oeuvre of James Bond title tracks " . RedEye gave the song four out of four stars and declared that it " is a return to form , and if it doesn 't get you hyped for the movie , you 're not a Bond fan " . The Daily Record named " Skyfall " its ' Single of the Week ' and gave the song five stars out of five . PopCrush gave the song four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five and called it " wholly satisfying and worth the wait " . Idolator wrote that " during the song 's final third , Adele does , in fact , make the sky fall , in typical Adele fashion " . Consequence of Sound commented that " rousing instrumentation elevates the vocals to soaring heights " , while HitFix called the song a " majestic ballad " and a " classic James Bond theme " . Newsday was also very positive , writing that " Skyfall " is " unlike anything else she 's done in her young career . It 's self @-@ assured and grand , drawing inspiration from Dame Shirley Bassey , while adding her own powerful phrasing to make it her own . Adele 's style so far has been to downplay her massive voice with lyrics that are questioning and self @-@ deprecating . On ' Skyfall , ' though , it sounds like the diva point of view suits her , too " . 
 The Los Angeles Times complimented the song and said that the song " tells good things for this winter 's blockbuster @-@ to @-@ be . It 's not a reimagining or a musical departure , but simply a righting of the ship . The song is big , bold and seems to have a little spot @-@ o @-@ fun " . MTV was also positive , stating that " Adele 's lush song fits right in with classics by Shirley Bassey , Paul McCartney and Carly Simon " . The Wall Street Journal felt similarly , writing that the song " has sweep and drama , [ with ] orchestral support [ that ] gives it a classical timelessness that sets it apart from typical pop songs . Because it is a theme for a Bond film , after all , the song is also shot through with the threat of violence and death " . E ! Online wrote that Adele 's song was " a cross , and a good one at that , between the 1971 Bassey classic and a more @-@ focused version of Garbage 's ' The World Is Not Enough ' . " The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the song " instantly feels like a Bond theme , with the singer 's sultry voice set against a minor chord progression . Done in big , orchestral style , the mood – like the singer – is all 1960s throwback , back when Bond themes like ' Goldfinger ' were smooth , seductive and larger than life " . 
 Jim Farber of the New York @-@ based Daily News wrote in his review : " It suffers from a similarly meandering melody and ponderous progression . The grandeur of its arrangement easily upstages the tune " , but " even so , the luster of Adele 's tone , and the bravura arc of her vocal , makes it enjoyable enough . And , fifty years down the line , isn 't that all we really expect from a Bond product these days ? " Yahoo ! ' s Rob O 'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review , but felt that it was too soon to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs . Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary , describing the song as " classy " , but at the same time , " overly predictable " .

 = Alfred Dunhill = 
 Alfred Dunhill <unk> ( 30 September 1872 – 2 January 1959 ) was an English tobacconist and inventor . He is the progenitor of the Dunhill luxury goods company and the Dunhill branded tobacco products from British American Tobacco ( now two independently owned entities ) . 
 From 1893 Dunhill ran a company selling motoring accessories , and in 1902 opened a shop in Mayfair . He developed a pipe designed for motorists in 1904 . He opened a tobacconist 's shop in St James 's in 1907 , offering tailored tobacco blends . Shops were opened in New York and Paris in the 1920s . With his international ambitions , Dunhill helped to create the modern luxury goods market . He retired from business in 1929 , and married his mistress in 1945 , following the death of his wife . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Dunhill was born on 30 September 1872 at 2 Church Path , Hornsey , Middlesex . He was the second son of five children of Henry Dunhill ( 1842 – 1901 ) , a master blind @-@ maker , and his wife and cousin , Jane , née Styles ( 1843 – 1922 ) . His father occupied premises on Euston Road , manufacturing harnesses for horses . Alfred Dunhill was educated at a private school in Hampstead and by tutors until he was 15 , when he was apprenticed to his father 's business . 
 In 1893 , Dunhill inherited his father 's business and shortly afterwards began to supply accessories for motor cars under the name Dunhill 's <unk> ( a portmanteau of " motorist " and " priorities " ) . He married Alice Stapleton ( 1874 – 1945 ) on 15 June 1895 . In 1890 he established the Discount Motor Car Company to sell his accessories through mail order . In 1902 he opened his first shop in Conduit Street , Mayfair , selling clothing and accessories to chauffeurs and their employers . He entered the <unk> business in 1904 when he developed a " windshield pipe " to allow motorists to smoke while driving . 
 = = Tobacco business = = 
 In 1907 he opened a small tobacconist 's shop on Duke Street in the St James 's area . He offered tobacco blends tailored for the individual customer . In 1908 he introduced the first Dunhill cigarette . The shop rapidly prospered . His granddaughter Mary later described his flair as a salesman and a shopkeeper . 
 The business expanded , and by 1910 Dunhill had taken additional premises in Duke Street . In 1912 he was joined in the business by his youngest brother , Herbert , and his eldest son , Alfred , followed by his second son , Vernon , in 1913 . In 1912 Dunhill introduced the white spot trademark to its pipes . 
 The post @-@ war period witnessed both expansion and the commissioning of new products . The company always ensured its products were covered by patent and trade mark , a policy prosecuted with vigour from the outset . The early 1920s saw the wholesale and export side of the business move to Notting Hill Gate , close to the pipe and cigarette division located at Campden Hill Road . 
 In 1921 the firm received its first royal warrant , as tobacconist to Edward , Prince of Wales . Dunhill also supplied Winston Churchill and Siegfried Sassoon . The 1920s also saw the opening of shops in New York and Paris . Bloomberg Businessweek opined that Dunhill prefigured the modern luxury goods market with its international ambitions . In 1924 the company launched the Unique lighter , a product that Dunhill and his brother Herbert had much interest in developing , and was the world 's first lighter that could be operated with just one hand . 
 Also in 1924 , Dunhill published The Pipe Book , a monograph which detailed the history of the smoking pipe . In the New York Times review of the book , the anonymous author credited Dunhill with making pipe smoking " a gentlemanly diversion " . The book has rarely been out of print since its publication . Dunhill was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1925 . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Dunhill passed the chairmanship of his company to his son Alfred Henry in 1929 , taking retirement due to health reasons . He left his wife and moved to Worthing to join his long @-@ term mistress , Vera Mildred Wright ( 1902 – 1976 ) , who changed her name to his by deed poll . Dunhill married Wright on 28 March 1945 , shortly after the death of his wife . He died in a nursing home in Worthing on 2 January 1959 , and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium . He left gross assets of £ 74 @,@ 117 ( equivalent to £ 1 @,@ 555 @,@ 099 in 2015 ) . His wife survived him .

 = 2007 Monte Carlo Rally = 
 The 2007 Monte Carlo Rally ( formally known as the <unk> Rallye Automobile Monte @-@ Carlo ) was a rallying <unk> race held over four days between 18 January and 21 January 2007 , and operated out of Valence , Drôme , France . It was the first race of the 2007 World Rally Championship ( WRC ) season . Contested over fifteen stages at a length of 328 @.@ 54 kilometres ( 204 @.@ 15 miles ) , Sébastien Loeb won the race for the Citroën Total World Rally Team . Dani Sordo finished second in the other <unk> works car , with Marcus Grönholm finishing third in a Ford . 
 Loeb , driving an all new Citroën C4 WRC car which had been in development throughout 2006 , took control of the race from the outset , winning the two stages on the first day and four more stages over the following three days . His teammate Sordo kept the pressure on , winning three stages , but on Stage 6 , Loeb extended his lead from 6 @.@ 6 seconds to nearly 24 seconds , and from thereon became unattainable . Each stage on the first two Legs were won by either Loeb or Sordo , and it wasn 't until Saturday afternoon on the second run of the day 's stages , that other drivers could effectively challenge them . The last two days of the race consisted of a duel between Mikko Hirvonen , who drove a factory 2006 model Ford Focus RS WRC , and Chris Atkinson in a factory Subaru Impreza WRC 2006 . After Hirvonen completed Stage 2 in fourth place , Atkinson took the position on Stage 3 and held onto it throughout Friday and into Saturday morning 's stages . On Stage 12 on Saturday afternoon , Hirvonen retook fourth , Atkinson regained it on Stage 13 but then lost it to Hirvonen again following Stage 14 . Atkinson won the final stage on Sunday morning , and finished the race back in fourth position . 
 Controversially , the 2007 Monte Carlo Rally was no longer based in Monaco and localities nearby , where it had been held in recent years . The event only visited Monte Carlo with its final special stage , a short run on part of the Circuit de Monaco and the rest of the time was spent in and around Valence hundreds of kilometres north of Monaco in the Rhône @-@ Alpes region . Many of the locations had not been visited since the 1990s , such as the Vercors and Ardèche , and only one top level driver had competitively driven on the roads before . The 2007 event also marked the return of the nighttime stages . 
 Loeb 's win was his fourth at Monte Carlo and twenty @-@ ninth in WRC . It was the sixth time that he had achieved a podium position there , which brought his WRC podium finishes to forty @-@ eight . He earned ten points in the World Rally Championship for Drivers . Sordo was two points behind him , while Grönholm was in third position with six points . With Atkinson and Hirvonen in fourth and fifth place , Petter Solberg , Toni Gardemeister and Jan Kopecký were the other points finishers . In the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers , Citroën Total World Rally Team earned the maximum eighteen points for their 1 – 2 finish , BP Ford World Rally Team placed second , with ten points , with the Subaru World Rally Team placing third with eight points .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The 2007 Monte Carlo Rally was the first round of the 2007 World Rally Championship ( WRC ) season after taking a six @-@ week break since the last race of the 2006 season in Great Britain . It was held over four days from Thursday , 18 January to Sunday , 21 January 2007 . With pressure from the president of Fédération Française du Sport Automobile and being beset with criticism for running a chaotic route in the 2006 Monte Carlo Rally , Automobile Club de Monaco ( ACM ) , the rally organisers , chose to move 2007 's race away from Monte Carlo and the roads around Alpes @-@ Maritimes and other departments within the Provence @-@ Alpes @-@ Côte d 'Azur region . Instead , the rally HQ was set up in Valence , Drôme , almost 400 km ( 250 mi ) away from Monte Carlo , with most stages being held in Ardèche . While some stages were brand new to the rally , some places , such as Saint @-@ Jean @-@ en @-@ <unk> , <unk> , Saint @-@ Martial , Lalouvesc , Saint @-@ Bonnet @-@ le @-@ <unk> , Saint @-@ Barthélemy @-@ <unk> , and the Saint @-@ Pierreville – Antraigues @-@ sur @-@ <unk> route had played host to Monte Carlo Rally stages in the 1990s and earlier . Only Manfred Stohl , driving for OMV @-@ Kronos Citroën World Rally Team , was familiar with these roads , as he had competed on them in the late 1990s . 
 Although the 25 @,@ 000 spectators seemed pleased that the rally had returned to the region , the drivers , team bosses and Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ; WRC 's governing body ) were less enthusiastic . Over a total distance of 1 @,@ 185 @.@ 22 kilometres ( 736 @.@ 46 miles ) , the fifteen stages totalled 328 @.@ 54 competitive km ( 204 @.@ 15 mi ) , which was shorter than the FIA 's regulatory minimum of 360 km ( 220 mi ) for Special Stages . The drivers hoped that with the rally taking place on higher altitudes , wintery conditions and <unk> ( a freezing wind blowing from the north ) would produce ice and snow on the ground , making for a more exciting event ; however , except for some rain on Thursday evening it never came to fruition and the prevailing weather was clear and dry . Sébastien Loeb was unhappy with the weekend 's weather forecast . Following his reconnaissance run , he said , " With snow everywhere and walls on both sides of the road , like in the old days , some of these stages would have been brilliant . But because it 's dry , in some places that makes it less interesting because than the roads further south with all their corners . " The service park in Valence was also much smaller than what had been used in Monaco , so there were no Production World Rally Championship or Junior Rally Championship categories , and fewer entries of competitors . It was also badly located and poorly run , and WRC 's commercial director David Richards said that the service area was " like a car boot sale " . 
 After being absent from the WRC for the 2006 season to spend thirteen months concentrating on preparing their new Citroën C4 WRC vehicle , the Citroën Total World Rally Team returned in 2007 ready to début it in the Monte Carlo Rally . The Citroën Xsara WRC had dominated the championship in recent years , and despite its age it was still incredibly reliable and was only replaced because the Xsara model was no longer in production . The C4 's mechanical components , such as the engine , transmission , differentials and suspension were either very similar to , or came from , the Xsara , but the wheelbase and chassis were longer by 253 millimetres ( 10 @.@ 0 inches ) and 107 mm ( 4 @.@ 2 in ) , respectively , which meant that under WRC rules the C4 could be widened to 1 @,@ 800 mm ( 71 in ) . It was also higher than the Xsara , and the weight distribution had been fine @-@ tuned , including raising and moving back the front seats ( which had the negative effect of reducing the drivers ' visibility ) , and attaching the wing mirrors to the midpoint along the front doors . The C4 's test drivers reported that the car handled more stably . 
 Citroën was confident the C4 would be successful yet concerned as to whether it would beat the Ford Focus WRC 06 , which had won the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers title in 2006 for the BP @-@ Ford World Rally Team . The Focus , in addition had undergone its own developments during the winter break . The tarmac testing of the C4 showed it to be faster than the outgoing Xsara , but Loeb knew that that performance might not show itself in the race . " The car has been good in testing . But what about the rally ? " he asked . " I don 't know . " Marcus Grönholm , the Ford team 's number 1 driver , was wary , however . " It 's got thousands of k 's on the clock . It was running when the Focus WRC 06 was still on the board . " Meanwhile , the Subaru World Rally Team were waiting for the Subaru Impreza WRC 2007 to be ready for the 2007 Rally Mexico in March . The team knew that the 2006 version , which had performed poorly the previous season , would be no match for the Focus or C4 . Added to the fact that the cars were equipped with unfamiliar BF Goodrich tyres after Pirelli decided not to supply any teams in 2007 , and they were hoping that Petter Solberg and Chris Atkinson could just earn some points from the race . 
 Forty @-@ nine crews registered to compete in the rally , Of the top @-@ tier drivers entered , Jean @-@ Marie Cuoq was the only WRC rookie , and Chris Atkinson , Henning Solberg , and Matthew Wilson had driven at Monte Carlo only once before , all in 2006 . The starting order for Leg 1 was " Priority 1 " ( P1 ) and P2 WRC drivers in the order of the final classification of the 2006 season , followed by all other drivers as decided by the ACM . Loeb , the previous season 's champion , set off first , followed by Grönholm , then Mikko Hirvonen . Loeb and Grönholm were the favourites to win ; Loeb had won the Monte Carlo three times in a row between 2003 and 2005 , and Grönholm had won in 2006 . Nevertheless , there were worries that Loeb would not be physically fit enough to win . Four months earlier he had broken his left shoulder in a mountain @-@ biking accident , and there was a chance he might not even compete in the first part of the season . His physiotherapists and consultants told him that because of the operations he had had on his arm , he should definitely have sat out the Monte Carlo Rally . Loeb admitted that he was " really stressed " before the start , and wondered whether his arm would be okay . " It has been okay in testing but what about the long stages ? " he asked . His answer : " I don 't know . "

 Following a ten @-@ year absence of nighttime @-@ run stages , the first two Special Stages of the event were held on Thursday night . They were the first night stages scheduled in the rally since 1997 . Throughout the day it had rained , and although it had stopped before the race began , the roads were still very wet and slippery . In discussing the day 's weather , Grönholm said that he expected the stages that night to be difficult , and added , " I hope this time we can take the right tyres , we were always a little bit on the wrong side [ last year ] – it ’ s not easy , but I hope we will manage to get it right this time . " Earlier in the day , the crews had driven a shakedown stage in <unk> ; however , due to a large number of fans and spectators along the route the shakedown was stopped early , and some crews including Loeb and co @-@ driver Daniel Elena were forced to carry out last @-@ minute testing and necessary changes to their cars on the main roads back to Valence . Though forty @-@ nine crews registered in the rally , only forty @-@ seven actually competed . Privateers François Duval driving a Škoda Fabia WRC , and Angelo Villa in a Fiat Punto failed to start the event . 
 The first stage of the rally started at 19 : 16 Central European Time ( UTC + 1 ) on Thursday evening . The 28 @.@ 52 kilometres ( 17 @.@ 72 miles ) winding route led the crews between Saint @-@ Jean @-@ en @-@ <unk> and Col de <unk> . Before taking to the tarmac , Chris Atkinson , in a 2006 Impreza WRC for the Subaru <unk> , admitted to never driving a tarmac stage at night before , but said it would be interesting to see how everybody performed . His teammate Petter Solberg spoke of the challenges facing him : " [ In the dark ] everything gets a little bit more narrow and you always tend to be careful with how you turn in and keep the speed up in the corners , but obviously you have to listen to the pacenotes , that is absolutely crucial thing , 100 % . " Loeb , who was familiar with driving on nighttime stages in the French Rally Championship , said , " In the dark you have to drive like you can when you have only two passes on the recce , and then you also start with the fastest stage . I think there can be some big moments tonight . " Loeb and Elena took to the road first in their C4 , and despite the limited visibility from both his ride position and the unlit roads , he set a pace time of 13m <unk> His teammate Dani Sordo and co @-@ driver Marc Marti were able to keep up the pace , maxing out at 196 kilometres per hour ( 122 miles per hour ) at one point along the route , and finished in 14m <unk> for second place . Taking third place on the stage were the Ford crew of Grönholm and Timo <unk> , who finished after 14 m <unk> On Stage 2 , a 17 @.@ 88 km ( 11 @.@ 11 mi ) run from La Cime du Mas to Col de <unk> , Loeb held on to the lead , completing it in 9m <unk> Grönholm proved to be faster than Sordo on this stage , finishing with a time of 9m <unk> , <unk> faster than Sordo . At the end of Leg 1 and 46 km ( 29 mi ) , any worries about how well the new <unk> would perform had been forgotten . They had beaten all the competition by a wide margin . Loeb was almost 25 seconds ahead of his teammate , while Grönholm was 30 seconds adrift ; and Petter Solberg , over a minute behind the lead . 
 There were six stages in Leg 2 on Friday , totalling 150 @.@ 62 competitive km ( 93 @.@ 59 mi ) . Stage 3 was the first of these , starting at 08 : 19 CET in Saint @-@ Pierreville . The route was 46 @.@ 02 km ( 28 @.@ 60 mi ) long and finished in Antraigues . The previous leg 's provisional classification determined the starting order for Leg 2 , whereby the top 15 P1 and P2 drivers started in reverse order , followed by the remaining drivers in order of classification . Henning Solberg and Cato <unk> , driving a 2006 @-@ spec Focus RS WRC for the Stobart VK M @-@ Sport Ford Rally Team were the first crew to take to the still @-@ damp roads , and they set a time of <unk> <unk> Their teammates , Matthew Wilson and Michael Orr , completed the leg a minute quicker , at 31m <unk> With no snow and ice on the roads , Sordo , who proved to be very quick on the tarmac surfaces last season , was fastest on Stage 3 . He set a time of 29m <unk> , a wide margin ahead of Loeb 's and Grönholm 's second- and third @-@ placed times of 29m <unk> and 30m <unk> , respectively . Loeb was said to be " visibly shaken " from losing the stage to his less @-@ experienced teammate . " I lost 16 seconds , my tyres were too hard , " he said . " At the start they went cold and I wasn 't in a good rhythm . Before we reached some dry parts I wasn 't confident and I didn 't want to take any big risks this morning . " Most drivers had problems with their tyre selection on Stage 3 , including Petter Solberg and Hirvonen . Petter was still trying to get used to the new BF <unk> his car was outfitted with , but he found them too hard and said he could not find any feeling or grip with them . Hirvonen , however , felt his tyre compound was too soft , and was unimpressed with his time . Hirvonen completed the stage ninth , in 30m <unk> , but Petter 's time of 30m <unk> was even worse , putting him in 12th position . Petter 's Subaru teammate Atkinson had no problems with his tyres , though , and he finished fourth with a time of 30m <unk> The Mitsubishi Lancer WRC crew of Xavier Pons and Xavier Amigo had other troubles during this stage . The transmission failed and they had to retire from the rally . Their teammates Toni Gardemeister and Jakke <unk> set a good time on the stage when they finished in fifth place , as did OMV @-@ Kronos 's Manfred Stohl and Ilka Minor in sixth . 
 At the end of Stage 3 , the podium positions were unchanged , but the time difference between Loeb and Sordo had decreased to seven seconds , although the gap between first place and fourth was over a minute . Petter Solberg had dropped out of contention for points , in ninth place overall , eighth being taken by Jan Kopecký in a privately entered Škoda Fabia WRC . Before Stages 4 and 5 got underway , the crews had a chance to change their tyres to a set with a more suitable compound . A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for Remote Service Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ . For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled , re @-@ <unk> , and have any necessary maintenance carried out , as long as the parts and tools to do so ( except fuel and tyres ) were already in the vehicle . For Grönholm this was a major relief . On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic <unk> @-@ paddle <unk> on his steering wheel , which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually . The technicians were unsure why or how it had occurred and were hoping that their repairs would last until the car got back to Valence . Loeb won an uneventful Stage 4 , but only by one @-@ tenth of a second ahead of Sordo , and on Stage 5 Sordo was quicker than Loeb , after Loeb stalled on the start @-@ line and was unable to make up the lost seconds . At the midday break , Loeb was lamenting his lead over Sordo . " Now it 's a big battle between the two <unk> . The other cars for the moment are behind , so it 's good news for the team . It would be easier if Dani were bit further behind but I have to deal wit that , " he said . " I 'll try to keep position this afternoon , but it 's not easy . Dani is really fast . I only have a six @-@ second lead . " Grönholm was also complaining . " The only good thing here is to win this rally , but to drive here ; I don 't like it . " 
 Stage 6 was a rerun of the Saint @-@ Pierreville – Antraigues stage from the morning . The roads had dried out by the afternoon , but that did not stop some crews from having accidents along the route . Stohl spun out as he went through a corner , and crashed the front of his car into the stone wall of a house . He continued on , but the front bumper was damaged and hanging loose . " We lost the front brakes completely , " Stohl explained . " Absolutely no brakes . I was lucky to finish because I was nearly off sometimes . " Despite his difficulties , he managed to finish the stage in 29m <unk> which put him in 10th position for the stage , and 8th overall . The dry roads meant that all the drivers were able to complete the stage faster than they had been in the morning . At just 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) Loeb was already much faster than his time during Stage 3 , but on a narrow stretch of the route towards the Col de la <unk> he did not brake into a corner at the right time and skidded and collided with a fence . He was able to carry on driving , but co @-@ driver Elena 's door and sill were damaged . Despite the accident , he won the stage , and increased the overall gap between himself and Sordo from 6 @.@ 5 seconds to nearly 24 seconds . A repeat run of Stages 4 and 5 closed the day . Sordo won Stage 8 and Loeb took Stage 9 . But by the end of the Leg and 550 @.@ 02 km ( 341 @.@ 77 mi ) of driving , Loeb 's arm and shoulder were in great pain and his osteopath worked through the night to try to address the problems . 
 Leg 3 began early Saturday morning . Following Friday 's stages , Loeb was 25 seconds ahead of Sordo , and 1m 15s in front of Grönholm . Stage 9 was the first of the day , a 19 @.@ 67 km ( 12 @.@ 22 mi ) route between <unk> @-@ d <unk> and Lalouvesc held in darkness . Loeb , Sordo , and Grönholm once again finished first , second and third . Atkinson suffered a setback when he crashed his car and stalled it . It cost him a few seconds and he finished the stage ninth , behind Hirvonen , Jean @-@ Marie Cuoq , Gardemeister and Kopecký , but he retained his fourth place standing in the event 's classifications . The surprise result of Stage 10 was Atkinson 's . He broke Loeb 's and Sordo 's run and was the first fastest non @-@ Citroën driver of the rally , and set a time of 12m 42s . 
 Henning Solberg , meanwhile , went off the road and into a ditch as he entered one of the corners on the stage , and his brother Petter had a similar problem in the same corner , but his quick reactions were able to control the car so he just drove into the scrub and got back on track . Henning finished in seventeenth place , and Petter finished joint @-@ fifth with Cuoq on 12m <unk> Loeb ran his slowest time on this stage after he reduced speed and his tyres went cold . " I was a bit faster than Dani [ Sordo ] on the start of the stage , and then I saw my splits [ times between checkpoints ] and then I tried to slow down , " he explained . " We had hard tyres and when you slow down the tyres [ cool down ] and then you lose the grip more and more , and at the end it was really tricky and I had cold tyres , so I just tried to slow down . The end [ of the stage ] was really tricky so I didn 't want to take any risks . " Stage 11 was won by Hirvonen with a time of 11m <unk> Loeb was <unk> slower and finished second . Atkinson lost all the time he made up in Stage 10 by finishing in eighth place , 11 @.@ 4 seconds slower than Hirvonen . This reduced the gap between the two in the overall classifications to just 8 @.@ 9 seconds . Sordo , meanwhile , had his worst stage and finished in 10th position . 
 After the midday service , the next three stages were reruns of the morning 's . Hirvonen won Stage 12 and Atkinson had another slow run , which resulted in Hirvonen taking fourth place in the provisional classification by four @-@ tenths of a second . On Stage 13 , Atkinson retook his fourth @-@ placed position after winning the stage with a time of 12m <unk> , and beating Hirvonen by 7 @.@ 6 seconds . " Considering how ordinary I drove in the first one , I had to pull my finger out ! " said Atkinson . He regained his fourth @-@ place position just 7 @.@ 2 seconds ahead of Hirvonen . Loeb was slow again , 6 @.@ 7 seconds slower than his teammate , Sordo , which cut the time between them to 23 @.@ 2 seconds . " No problem , the car is going very well , " said Loeb . " One stage more to go and hopefully its okay . " 
 Stage 14 was the last in the mountains of <unk> , before travelling to Monte Carlo for the Super Special Stage . For most drivers it was going to be the last time to gain higher positions in the classifications . Loeb , although slow again , extended his lead in the standings to 31 @.@ 1 seconds , by finishing in fourth position with a time of 11m <unk> Sordo also had another bad stage . He finished the stage ninth @-@ fastest after 11m <unk> on the road . For Hirvonen , it was the last good chance to retake fourth position from Atkinson , which he did when he won the stage by setting the pace time of 11m <unk> Atkinson ran 8 seconds slower and finished second . It was also Jari @-@ Matti Latvala 's last chance to earn a points position . Kopecký had been in eighth position and set to score one point since the middle of the second Leg , but Latvala was just 5 @.@ 4 seconds behind him going into this stage . But Latvala pushed too hard and when he drove over some loose gravel he lost control and slid the car into the end of a stone wall . The impact caused damage to the car 's roll cage which forced him to retire from the rally and end his attempt to earn any points . 
 The final stage of the rally took place on Sunday morning . After conducting the entire race in France the organisers only paid lip service to the principality by holding a Super Special Stage there . It involved two laps of part of the Circuit de Monaco for a total distance of 2 @.@ 8 km ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) , with two cars on the road at the same time but starting at two different points along the track so that they did not interfere with each other . Because the Service Park was in Valence , repairs , adjustments , refuelling and tyre changes were carried out on Saturday night ahead of the drive down to the coast . The decision about which tyres to fit on the cars was taken out of the teams ' hands . ACM ordered that all the cars would drive on the snow tyres that the teams had been allocated , but had not been used because of the dry weather , a decision that was described as " absurd " because the cars ended up drifting through the corners . Loeb 's , Sordo 's and Grönholm 's lead times so far ahead of anyone else 's , so the interest in Stage 15 was on Hirvonen and Atkinson . Only eight @-@ tenths of a second made the difference between a fourth @-@ place position and five points , and fifth @-@ placed position and four points . Hirvonen , who was in fourth place , completed the stage in 1m <unk> , and admitted , " [ I made ] a few small mistakes , and that can be it . Nothing more I can do . We 'll see how Chris drives and hope for the best . " . Atkinson drove opposite Grönholm on the stage , with Hirvonen watching from the sidelines . To beat Hirvonen , he had to complete the stage in 1m <unk> He was one @-@ tenth of a second quicker than that , which won him the stage and fourth place in the rally .

 Loeb was delighted with his win at Monte Carlo , saying , " It 's a victory in Monte Carlo so that 's a great moment . I like to start the season like this , with ten points . That 's really important for me , the feeling is good . The car is really , really fast and my arm is much better , so everything is perfect for the moment . " Guy <unk> , the Team Principal at Citroën Total was also pleased with <unk> 's and Sordo 's results . He said afterwards , 
 It 's a really a fantastic start for Citroën , for the team , for the crews . It 's really fantastic , and for the chief , for sure ! This is the result of a huge team effort . To do this in the first event , every member of the Citroën Sport team had to come together in a common goal . I think it 's a wonderful reward for our pus to come back to the World Championship . It 's not often that a car making its competition début produces results like these : nine fastest times , eight on them 1 – 2s . And there aren 't many models that have dominated and scored a 1 – 2 finish in their first race , either . The Citroën C4 WRC has really made its presence felt on its international début . 
 The last time a car had finished in first and second @-@ place in its début rally was 20 years ago in the 1987 Monte Carlo Rally , when Miki <unk> and Juha Kankkunen came first and second in all @-@ new Lancia Delta HF <unk> . The Delta HF 4 × 4 also won two @-@ thirds of all the stages of that 1987 rally , just like the C4 did this time around . Lancia also won both the Group A and Group N categories in the race , while Citroën won the 4 @-@ wheel drive WRC category and came first in the 2 @-@ wheel drive Super 1600 category . 
 Grönholm was disappointed with his race , admitting that he thought he might be able to beat Sordo , if not Loeb . But after having gearbox and tyre problems on Leg 2 , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally 's conclusion . " We got it wrong on the tyre choice , which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week , " he explained . " We thought it would rain . Harder tyres would have made life easier for us . " BP @-@ Ford was also unhappy . Christian <unk> , the team 's Technical Director said , " Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing . Being behind Loeb is easier to understand , because I didn 't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara , and that car had a performance edge over us last year . " Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally . After Subaru switched to BF <unk> from Pirelli following the 2006 season , and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen , the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds . The <unk> had had their problems with the <unk> , too . To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them , but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the <unk> up to temperature and ended up running slower . He finished the rally in sixth place . His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though , and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally , finished in fourth place . " It 's been a massive battle , and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again , " he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen . Two drivers in non @-@ manufacturer cars , Gardemeister and Kopecký , finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points . 
 As a consequence of the final positions , Loeb started the season leading in the World Rally Championship for Drivers with ten points . Sordo was second with eight points , Grönholm was in third position with six points . In the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers , Stobart Ford had one point from Henning Solberg 's fourteenth @-@ placed position ( although Wilson finished the rally quicker , he was not nominated to earn points for the manufacturer ) . Stohl earned OMV @-@ Kronos Citroën two points . Subaru were in third place with eight points , BP @-@ Ford were two points clear of Subaru in second place , and Citroën Total <unk> was first , with eighteen points – ten from Loeb 's win and eight from Sordo .

 " Slow Fade " was written in the " light of the well publicised falls from grace of several high profile church leaders " . According to lead vocalist Mark Hall : " Nobody falls , it 's just a slow fade . It 's a series of minor compromises until you 're in a place you never thought you 'd be , doing things you never thought you 'd do and rationalising all of it " . He continued by saying that : " As believers , as men , if we 're not guarding our relationship with God , we 're going down . There 's too much going against us . If we 're not careful , we 're going to crash and burn " . 
 " Slow Fade " is a song with a length of four minutes and thirty @-@ eight seconds . According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com , " Slow Fade " is set in common time in the key of D major , with a tempo of 80 beats per minute .

 = Mersea Island = 
 Mersea Island IPA : [ m3 : <unk> ] is an island in Essex , England , in the Blackwater and Colne estuaries to the south @-@ east of Colchester . Its name comes from the Old English word <unk> , meaning " island of the pool " . The island is split into two main areas , West Mersea and East Mersea , and connected to the mainland by the Strood , a causeway that floods at high tide . 
 The island has been inhabited since pre @-@ Roman times . It was used as a holiday destination in Roman Britain for occupants of Camulodunum ( Colchester ) . Fishing has been a key industry on the island since then , particularly oysters , and along with tourism makes up a significant part of the island 's economy . The Church of St Peter & St Paul in West Mersea is thought to have existed since the 7th century , while the Church of St Edmund in East Mersea dates from around the 12th or 13th centuries . The island became popular with smugglers from the 16th to the 19th century . It became a focal point for troops in both world wars , and a number of observation posts can still be found on the island . Tourism remains popular , and there are a number of beach huts and holiday parks on the island . A week @-@ long festival of boat racing , Mersea Week , takes place every summer . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The island lies 9 miles ( 14 km ) south @-@ east of Colchester and 26 miles ( 42 km ) east of the county town , Chelmsford . It is the most easterly inhabited island in the United Kingdom and is one of 43 ( unbridged ) tidal islands which can be accessed on foot or by road from the British mainland . It is situated in the estuary area of the Blackwater and Colne rivers and has an area of around 7 square miles ( 18 km2 ) . It is formed by the <unk> Channel to the north and the Strood Channel to the west , which connect the Blackwater to the Colne . The much smaller Ray Island lies adjacent to the north . Most of the area immediately surrounding the island consists of saltmarsh and mudflats , and is an important sanctuary for wading and migratory birds . The island itself sits on a mix of London Clay , chalky boulder clay , sand and gravel . 
 Internally , the island is split between West Mersea , which is the main inhabited area containing the jetty and marina , and East Mersea , which is predominantly farmland and includes Cudmore Grove County Park to the east . There is also a small hamlet at Barrow Hill to the north of West Mersea . The land immediately facing the Blackwater is known as the Mersea flats , which is mostly beach that dries at low tide . The former Bradwell Power Station can be seen on the other side . West Mersea can be further divided into three areas . The Old City in the southwest of West Mersea serves the fishing and yachting industries and contains a number of listed buildings . The centre contains the church of St Peter & St Paul , while the beach and esplanade are to the south . 
 The name ' Mersea ' is derived from the Old English word <unk> meaning ' island of the pool ' . It is mentioned in the Domesday Book as <unk> . The Strood is derived from <unk> , meaning ' marshy land ' . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The main industries on Mersea are farming , fishing and servicing the leisure boating and yachting industry . Oysters have been harvested off the island since Roman times , and are shipped worldwide . The extensive history and association with the oyster trade attracts a significant number of tourists each year , though today the trade is predominantly with Pacific oysters that have been introduced to the area . The Essex oyster fishery is opened by the Mayor of Colchester every September . 
 The Company Shed restaurant on the west side of the island serves seafood fresh to order and has been praised for its quality by Jamie Oliver . Many small shops and ice cream businesses serve the tourism on Mersea 's seafront . The Two <unk> Cafe is sited on a former World War II pillbox near the beach . 
 There are six camping and <unk> sites on the island , which help contribute towards the island 's economy during the summer months . The largest is Cooper 's Beach , which caters to 3 @,@ 000 residents . 
 = = History = = 
 There is evidence of pre @-@ Roman settlement on Mersea in the form of " red hills " that are the remains of Celtic salt workings . A large Romano @-@ British round barrow near the Strood contained the remains of a cremated adult in a glass urn , within a lead casket , now in the local Mersea Museum . In 1730 , a large mosaic floor was found underneath the Church of St Peter & St Paul at West Mersea and in 1764 , Richard Gough discovered further evidence of Roman remains around the church . West Mersea was believed to be a holiday destination for Romans staying at Camulodunum ( Colchester ) . 
 Evidence has shown a number of fish traps exist around the island , which date from around the 7th century . The Anglo @-@ Saxons established a large fish weir at <unk> Fleet to the southwest of the island and built the church at West Mersea . It was damaged by Norse raiders in 894 and rebuilt afterwards . The west tower was added to the church around the 11th century , the south aisle in the 15th and various other rebuilds continued towards the end of the 18th century . 
 The Strood causeway was also built by the Saxons ; oak piles discovered in 1978 have been dated to between 684 and 702 using dendrochronology . By 950 , there was a Benedictine priory at West Mersea and land here was granted to the Abbey of St Ouen in France by Edward the Confessor in 1046 . The priory survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1542 . The Parish Church of St Edmund in East Mersea dates from around the 12th or 13th century , with extensions in the late 15th or 16th . The church and hall are surrounded by a moat that is thought to be the remains of a Danish refuge after their defeat by King Alfred at Farnham . 
 In the English Civil War , the Parliamentary Army built a blockhouse at East Mersea in 1648 , with the aim of blockading the River Colne during the Siege of Colchester . Some ruins of this blockhouse remain and are known as the Block House Stone , which is legally protected by English Heritage as a scheduled monument . Fishing grew in importance on the island during this time , with numerous fish weirs being installed . During the 16th and 17th centuries , Dutch and French settlers arrived on the island . Some locals supplemented their income from the oyster trade by smuggling , which remained popular until the mid @-@ 19th century . Smugglers favoured the <unk> Rose , immediately north of the Strood , where they would store contraband in the pond alongside the inn . In the early 19th century , the increased demand for oysters despite a limited supply from the Strood and <unk> Channel led traders to get oysters from other places and pass them off as native to the island . 
 By the end of the 19th century , the land around the island had been partially reclaimed , allowing easier access . A police officer for the island was appointed in 1844 and a school was opened in 1871 . The Reverend Sabine Baring Gould ( author of " Onward Christian Soldiers " and of " <unk> " , a novel set in Mersea ) was Rector of East Mersea from 1870 to 1881 . 
 In the First World War , 320 soldiers came from Mersea Island , of which 50 lost their lives . Troops were stationed at Mersea Island during the war . In 1916 , a Zeppelin crash landed at nearby Great <unk> to the northwest of the island . The survivors were stationed at Mersea before moving to prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps . In 2013 , the Mersea Island Tales Educational Trust obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to set up a First World War exhibition at Ivy Farm , which features a 1916 Sopwith Pup biplane and information about soldiers from Mersea who took part in the war . 
 In 1926 , West Mersea became a self @-@ governing urban district , which allowed it to set up a self @-@ contained water and sewer system . Unlike several other coastal resorts , the island did not immediately develop any holidaymaker facilities aside from the beach huts which now stretch along the Esplanade . 
 At the outbreak of World War II , the island became part of the front line for invasion and was heavily fortified . Along with other coastal resorts , the island drew in evacuees from London , though as the war progressed , these were moved to safer settlements further inland . 2000 troops were stationed on the island to guard against invasion . A battery of 4 @.@ 7 inch guns was installed along the beach along with a Battery Observation post and a number of searchlights and pillboxes . Several of these installations survived and can still be seen along the south coast of the island , one of which has been converted into a cafe . After the war , the island suffered from severe winter weather in 1947 which destroyed much of the oyster fishery , and from the flooding of 1953 , where numerous beach huts were swept out to sea . 
 In 1963 , a lifeboat service was launched following an initiative by " Diggle " Hayward who had approached the Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( RNLI ) about a lifeboat capability on Mersea . The lifeboat station in West Mersea now operates an Atlantic 85 class lifeboat , the RNLB Just George B @-@ 879 . 
 Since the 1960s , the population has increased considerably , with the population of West Mersea rising from 3 @,@ 140 in 1961 to 6 @,@ 925 in 2001 . Mersea Island has suffered less from the increased popularity of holidaying abroad when compared to nearby resorts such as Clacton and Southend , predominantly due to its isolated and rural atmosphere , and the continued popularity of sailing . In 2006 , more than a thousand locals signed a petition against the proposed opening of a Tesco Express store on the island , expressing concern that it would take trade away from local businesses . 
 On 4 June 2012 , as part of the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee celebrations , the island declared a mock independence from the UK for that day . Anyone travelling to the island across the Strood paid 50p for a " passport " , the proceeds of which went towards the war veteran charity Help for Heroes . 
 = = Education = = 
 Mersea Island School is a foundation primary school in West Mersea with 450 pupils aged 4 – 11 . The school has an additional nursery for 52 children aged 2 – 4 . The school was built by Horace Darken in 1871 @-@ 72 , with additional classrooms added in 1897 . 
 There are no secondary schools in the island . The nearest are Thomas Lord Audley School in Colchester and <unk> School in Tiptree . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The main access to the island is via a causeway known as the Strood , carrying the Mersea – Colchester road ( <unk> ) . The road is often covered at high tides and especially during spring tides . During the 1953 North Sea flood , the Strood was submerged under over 6 feet ( 2 m ) of water , cutting off access to the mainland . In 2012 , West Mersea Lifeboats complained to Essex County Council about the lack of adequate signage after 13 people had to be rescued from the Strood at high tide in less than 24 hours . A webcam provides a live view of access across the Strood , while a corresponding website lists upcoming high tides and the likelihood of obstructing the road . 
 There has never been a railway to Mersea Island . During the railway boom of the mid 19th century , goods were transported by boat and barge . In 1911 , local businessmen proposed a railway between Colchester and the island , which would have ended at a pier next to the Esplanade in the south , with an additional station in West Mersea on what is now East Road . The plans were abandoned due to the First World War . 
 A regular bus service links West and East Mersea to Colchester via the Strood and <unk> . A foot ferry runs from East Mersea to Point Clear and <unk> on the other side of the Colne estuary , including a scheduled service in the summer and a dial @-@ on @-@ demand service in the spring and autumn . 
 = = Culture = = 
 The island is used as a setting for several works of Margery Allingham , who spent childhood holidays on the island . These included her first novel , <unk> Dick ( published in 1923 when she was 19 ) and Mystery Mile ( though the plot is disguised as being in Suffolk ) . Baring @-@ Gould 's novel <unk> is set in Mersea . 
 The Mersea Week is a week @-@ long August festival of boat racing organised by the West Mersea Yacht Club and <unk> Sailing Club , established in 1973 . During the week , starting on Monday , there are races for many boat classes in the Blackwater Estuary , from Optimist dinghies to large yachts . The most celebrated event is the Round @-@ the @-@ Island race , where dinghies attempt to sail round the island in either direction , helped over the Strood by volunteers . On Saturday , there is a regatta at West Mersea , followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk . One of the popular events on Saturday is walking a greasy pole rigged over the side of the hosting Thames sailing barge . 
 The Mersea Island Food , Drink & Leisure Festival takes place in May in the Mersea Vineyard . It combines a food theatre showing various meals , particularly oysters , with local live music and storytelling . 
 The island is home to Mersea Island F.C. , who compete in the Essex and Suffolk Border Football League Division 1 . There is a youth football team , Oyster F.C. 
 = Group 12 element = 
 Group 12 , by modern IUPAC numbering , is a group of chemical elements in the periodic table . It includes zinc ( Zn ) , cadmium ( Cd ) and mercury ( Hg ) . The further inclusion of copernicium ( Cn ) in group 12 is supported by recent experiments on individual copernicium atoms . Group 12 is also known as the volatile metals , although this can also more generally refer to any metal ( which need not be in group 12 ) that has high volatility , such as polonium or flerovium . Formerly this group was named IIB ( pronounced as " group two B " , as the " II " is a Roman numeral ) by CAS and old IUPAC system . 
 The three group 12 elements that occur naturally are zinc , cadmium and mercury . They are all widely used in electric and electronic applications , as well as in various alloys . The first two members of the group share similar properties as they are solid metals under standard conditions . Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature . While zinc is very important in the biochemistry of living organisms , cadmium and mercury are both highly toxic . As copernicium does not occur in nature , it has to be synthesized in the laboratory . 
 = = Physical and atomic properties = = 
 Like other groups of the periodic table , the members of group 12 show patterns in its electron configuration , especially the outermost shells , which result in trends in their chemical behavior : 
 Group 12 elements are all soft , diamagnetic , divalent metals . They have the lowest melting points among all transition metals . Zinc is bluish @-@ white and lustrous , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . Zinc is also referred to in <unk> contexts as <unk> . Cadmium is soft , malleable , ductile , and with a bluish @-@ white color . Mercury is a liquid , heavy , silvery @-@ white metal . It is the only common liquid metal at ordinary temperatures , and as compared to other metals , it is a poor conductor of heat , but a fair conductor of electricity . 
 The table below is a summary of the key physical properties of the group 12 elements . Very little is known about copernicium , and none of its physical properties have been confirmed except for its boiling point ( tentative ) . 
 Zinc is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure . The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 ° C. Above 210 ° C , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating . Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . For a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 419 @.@ 5 ° C , 787 @.@ 1 F ) and boiling points ( 907 ° C ) . Cadmium is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds . Unlike other metals , cadmium is resistant to corrosion and as a result it is used as a protective layer when deposited on other metals . As a bulk metal , cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable ; however , in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes . Mercury has an exceptionally low melting temperature for a d @-@ block metal . A complete explanation of this fact requires a deep excursion into quantum physics , but it can be summarized as follows : mercury has a unique electronic configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s , 2s , 2p , 3s , 3p , 3d , 4s , 4p , 4d , 4f , 5s , 5p , 5d and 6s subshells . As such configuration strongly resists removal of an electron , mercury behaves similarly to noble gas elements , which form weak bonds and thus easily melting solids . The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell . An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus ( see lanthanide contraction ) . The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc , although both these metals still melt easily and , in addition , have unusually low boiling points . Gold has atoms with one less 6s electron than mercury . Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds . 
 Zinc , cadmium and mercury form a large range of alloys . Among the zinc containing ones , brass is an alloy of zinc and copper . Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium , antimony , bismuth , gold , iron , lead , mercury , silver , tin , magnesium , cobalt , nickel , tellurium and sodium . While neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic , their alloy <unk> 
 2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 K. Cadmium is used in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys , due to a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance . It is also found in some of the lowest @-@ melting alloys , such as Wood 's metal . Because it is a liquid , mercury dissolves other metals and the alloys that are formed are called amalgams . For example , such amalgams are known with gold , zinc , sodium , and many other metals . Because iron is an exception , iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury . Other metals that do not form amalgams with mercury include tantalum , tungsten and platinum . Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis , and is also used in high @-@ pressure sodium lamps . Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury @-@ aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact . Since the amalgam reacts with air to give aluminium oxide , small amounts of mercury corrode aluminium . For this reason , mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft . 
 = = Chemistry = = 
 Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group 12 . The chemistry of copernicium is not well established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with zinc , cadmium and mercury . 
 = = = Periodic trends = = = 
 All elements in this group are metals . The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction . So , the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2 , the alkaline earths , where metallic radius increases smoothly from top to bottom of the group . All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points , indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak , with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band . Thus , zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements , which is usually placed between gallium and germanium , though gallium participates in semi @-@ conductors such as gallium arsenide . 
 Zinc and cadmium are electropositive while mercury is not . As a result , zinc and cadmium metal are good reducing agents . The elements of group 12 have an oxidation state of + 2 in which the ions have the rather stable <unk> electronic configuration , with a full sub @-@ shell . However , mercury can easily be reduced to the + 1 oxidation state ; usually , as in the ion Hg2 + 
 2 , two mercury ( I ) ions come together to form a metal @-@ metal bond and a diamagnetic species . Cadmium can also form species such as [ <unk> ] 4 − in which the metal 's oxidation state is + 1 . Just as with mercury , the formation of a metal @-@ metal bond results in a diamagnetic compound in which there are no unpaired electrons ; thus , making the species very reactive . Zinc ( I ) is known only in the gas phase , in such compounds as linear <unk> , analogous to calomel . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 The elements in group 12 are usually considered to be d @-@ block elements , but not transition elements as the d @-@ shell is full . Some authors classify these elements as main @-@ group elements because the valence electrons are in <unk> orbitals . Nevertheless , they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table , which are almost universally considered to be transition elements . For example , zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal , copper . Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving @-@ Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper ( II ) , albeit with smaller stability constants . There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver ( II ) are rare and those that do exist are very strong oxidizing agents . Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is + 3 , which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold , though there are similarities between mercury ( I ) and gold ( I ) such as the formation of linear <unk> complexes , [ M ( CN ) 2 ] − . According to IUPAC 's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub @-@ shell , or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub @-@ shell , zinc and cadmium are not transition metals , while mercury is . This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than + 2 , in mercury ( IV ) fluoride . However , this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non @-@ equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury 's more typical chemistry , and Jensen has suggested that it would be better to regard mercury as not being a transition metal . 
 = = = Relationship with the alkaline earth metals = = = 
 Although group 12 lies in the d @-@ block of the modern 18 @-@ column periodic table , the d electrons of zinc , cadmium , and ( almost always ) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding . This behavior is similar to that of the main @-@ group elements , but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements ( copper , silver , and gold ) , which also have filled d @-@ subshells in their ground @-@ state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals . For example , the bonding in chromium ( II ) sulfide ( <unk> ) involves mainly the 3d electrons ; that in iron ( II ) sulfide ( FeS ) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons ; but that of zinc sulfide ( ZnS ) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons . Indeed , useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2 , beryllium and magnesium , and in earlier short @-@ form periodic table layouts , this relationship is illustrated more clearly . For instance , zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii , ionic radii , electronegativities , and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands , such as complex hydrides and amines . However , beryllium and magnesium are small atoms , unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements ( which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons ) , and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium ( similar to that of the alkali metals ) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury ( which is more similar to that of the p @-@ block main groups ) due to the d @-@ block and lanthanide contractions . It is also the d @-@ block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties . 
 = = = Compounds = = = 
 All three metal ions form many tetrahedral species , such as <unk> − 
 4 . Both zinc and cadmium can also form octahedral complexes such as the aqua ions [ M ( H2O ) 6 ] 2 + which are present in aqueous solutions of salts of these metals . Covalent character is achieved by using the s and possibly p orbitals . Mercury , however , rarely exceeds a coordination number of four . Coordination numbers of 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 and 8 are also known .

 Although copernicium is the heaviest known group 12 element , there has been some theoretical work regarding possible heavier group 12 elements . Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 162 , <unk> ( <unk> ) , under copernicium , relativistic Dirac @-@ Fock calculations predict that the next group 12 element after copernicium should actually be element 164 , unhexquadium ( Uhq ) , which is predicted to have an electron configuration of [ Uuo ] <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 8p1 / 22 . The 8s and 8p1 / 2 orbitals are predicted to be so strongly stabilized relativistically that they become core electrons and do not participate in chemical reactions , unlike the earlier group 12 elements where the s electrons behave as valence electrons . However , the 9s and <unk> / 2 levels are expected to be readily available for hybridization and bonding , so that unhexquadium should still behave chemically like a normal transition metal . Calculations predict that the 7d electrons of unhexquadium should participate very readily in chemical reactions , so that unhexquadium should be able to show stable + 6 and + 4 oxidation states in addition to the normal + 2 state in aqueous solutions with strong ligands . Unhexquadium should thus be able to form compounds like Uhq ( CO ) 4 , Uhq ( <unk> ) 4 ( both tetrahedral ) , and Uhq ( CN ) 2 − 
 2 ( linear ) , which is very different behavior from that of lead , which unhexquadium would be a heavier homologue of if not for relativistic effects . Nevertheless , the divalent state would be the main one in aqueous solution , and unhexquadium ( II ) should behave more similarly to lead than unhexquadium ( IV ) and unhexquadium ( VI ) . 
 Unhexquadium should be a soft metal like mercury , and metallic unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond covalently . It is also expected to be a soft Lewis acid and have <unk> softness parameter close to 4 eV . It should also have some similarities to ununoctium as well as to the other group 12 elements . Unhexquadium should be at most moderately reactive , having a first ionization energy that should be around 685 kJ / mol , comparable to that of molybdenum . Due to the lanthanide , actinide , and superactinide contractions , unhexquadium should have a metallic radius of only 158 pm , very close to that of the much lighter magnesium , despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474 u , about 19 @.@ 5 times as much as that of magnesium . This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46 g · cm − 3 , over twice that of osmium , currently the most dense element known , at 22 @.@ 61 g · cm − 3 ; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table , with only its neighbour <unk> ( element 163 ) being more dense ( at 47 g · cm − 3 ) . Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable , as the 8s and 8p1 / 2 electrons are very deeply buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding . Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds , most probably resulting in a high melting point . 
 Theoretical interest in the chemistry of unhexquadium is largely motivated by theoretical predictions that it , especially the isotope <unk> ( with 164 protons and 318 neutrons ) , would be at the center of a hypothetical second island of stability ( the first being centered around 306Ubb , with 122 protons and 184 neutrons ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The elements of group 12 have been found throughout history , being used since ancient times to being discovered in laboratories . The group itself has not acquired a trivial name , but it has been called group IIB in the past . 
 = = = Zinc = = = 
 Zinc has been found being used in impure forms in ancient times as well as in alloys such as brass that have been found to be over 2000 years old . Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of <unk> in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king <unk> and written about the year 1374 . The metal was also of use to alchemists . The name of the metal was first documented in the 16th century , and is probably derived from the German <unk> for the needle @-@ like appearance of metallic crystals . 
 The isolation of metallic zinc in the West may have been achieved independently by several people in the 17th century . German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal . Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass paved the way for the discovery of electrical batteries , galvanization and cathodic protection . In 1880 , Galvani 's friend , Alessandro Volta , invented the Voltaic pile . The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when carbonic anhydrase , an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood , was shown to have zinc in its active site . 
 = = = Cadmium = = = 
 In 1817 , cadmium was discovered in Germany as an impurity in zinc carbonate minerals ( calamine ) by Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann . It was named after the Latin cadmia for " calamine " , a cadmium @-@ bearing mixture of minerals , which was in turn named after the Greek mythological character , <unk> Cadmus , the founder of Thebes . Stromeyer eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reduction of the sulfide . 
 In 1927 , the International Conference on Weights and Measures redefined the meter in terms of a red cadmium spectral line ( 1 m = 1 @,@ 553 @,@ 164 @.@ 13 wavelengths ) . This definition has since been changed ( see krypton ) . At the same time , the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960 , when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange @-@ red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton @-@ 86 atom in vacuum . 
 = = = Mercury = = = 
 Mercury has been found in Egyptian tombs which have been dated back to 1500 BC , where mercury was used in cosmetics . It was also used by the ancient Chinese who believed it would improve and prolong health . By 500 BC mercury was used to make amalgams ( Medieval Latin <unk> , " alloy of mercury " ) with other metals . Alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter from which all metals were formed . They believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury . The purest of these was gold , and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base ( or impure ) metals into gold , which was the goal of many alchemists . 
 Hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury . It comes from hydrargyrum , a Latinized form of the Greek word <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is a compound word meaning " water @-@ silver " ( <unk> 
 = water , <unk> = 
 silver ) — since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver . The element was named after the Roman god Mercury , known for speed and mobility . It is associated with the planet Mercury ; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal . Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name . 
 = = = Copernicium = = = 
 The heaviest known group 12 element , copernicium , was first created on February 9 , 1996 , at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung ( GSI ) located in Darmstadt , Germany by Sigurd Hofmann , Victor Ninov et al . It was then officially named by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry after Nicolaus Copernicus on February 19 , 2010 , the 537th anniversary of Copernicus ' birth . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 Like in most other d @-@ block groups , the abundance in Earth 's crust of group 12 elements decreases with higher atomic number . Zinc is with 65 parts per million ( ppm ) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0 @.@ 1 ppm and mercury with 0 @.@ 08 ppm are orders of magnitude less abundant . Copernicium , as a synthetic element with a half @-@ life of a few minutes , may only be present in the laboratories where it was produced . 
 Group 12 metals are <unk> , meaning the elements have low affinities for oxides and prefer to bond with sulfides . <unk> formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth 's atmosphere . The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals . <unk> , which is a form of zinc sulfide , is the most heavily mined zinc @-@ containing ore because its concentrate contains 60 – 62 % zinc . No significant deposits of cadmium @-@ containing ores are known . <unk> ( CdS ) , the only cadmium mineral of importance , is nearly always associated with sphalerite ( ZnS ) . This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely . As a consequence , cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining , smelting , and refining sulfidic ores of zinc , and , to a lesser degree , lead and copper . One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia . Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth 's crust , because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass , mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element 's abundance in ordinary rock . The richest mercury ores contain up to 2 @.@ 5 % mercury by mass , and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0 @.@ 1 % mercury ( 12 @,@ 000 times average crustal abundance ) . It is found either as a native metal ( rare ) or in cinnabar ( HgS ) , <unk> , <unk> and other minerals , with cinnabar being the most common ore . 
 While mercury and zinc minerals are found in large enough quantities to be mined , cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered . Identified world zinc resources total about 1 @.@ 9 billion tonnes . Large deposits are in Australia , Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran . At the current rate of consumption , these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055 . About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002 , and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use . In 2005 , China was the top producer of mercury with almost two @-@ thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan . Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents . Because of the high toxicity of mercury , both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning . 
 = = Production = = 
 Zinc is the fourth most common metal in use , trailing only iron , aluminium , and copper with an annual production of about 10 million tonnes . Worldwide , 95 % of the zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits , in which sphalerite ( ZnS ) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper , lead and iron . Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy . Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate produced during processing to zinc oxide : For further processing two basic methods are used : <unk> or electrowinning . <unk> processing reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950 ° C ( 1 @,@ 740 ° F ) into the metal , which is distilled as zinc vapor . The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser . <unk> processing leaches zinc from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid : After this step electrolysis is used to produce zinc metal . 
 Cadmium is a common impurity in zinc ores , and it is most isolated during the production of zinc . Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1 @.@ 4 % of cadmium . Cadmium is isolated from the zinc produced from the flue dust by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted , or cadmium sulfate is precipitated out of the electrolysis solution . 
 The richest mercury ores contain up to 2 @.@ 5 % mercury by mass , and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0 @.@ 1 % mercury , with cinnabar ( HgS ) being the most common ore in the deposits . Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor . 
 Super @-@ heavy elements such as copernicium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions . Whereas most of the isotopes of copernicium can be synthesized directly this way , some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers . The first fusion reaction to produce copernicium was performed by GSI in 1996 , who reported the detection of two decay chains of copernicium @-@ 277 . 
 208 
 82Pb + 70 
 30Zn → 277

 In total , approximately 75 atoms of copernicium have been prepared using various nuclear reactions .

 Due to the physical similarities which they share , the group 12 elements can be found in many common situations . Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti @-@ corrosion ( galvanization ) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode . These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot @-@ dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal , or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts . Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act as an alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode . 
 In the US , zinc is used predominantly for galvanizing ( 55 % ) and for brass , bronze and other alloys ( 37 % ) . The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection ( CP ) . For example , cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe . Zinc acts as the anode ( negative terminus ) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline . Zinc is also used to <unk> protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion . Zinc is also used as an anode material for batteries such as in zinc – carbon batteries or zinc @-@ air battery / fuel cells . A widely used alloy which contains zinc is brass , in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3 % to 45 % zinc , depending upon the type of brass . Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance . These properties make it useful in communication equipment , hardware , musical instruments , and water valves . Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver , typewriter metal , soft and aluminium solder , and commercial bronze . Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper , aluminium , and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive , electrical , and hardware industries . These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . Roughly one quarter of all zinc output , in the United States ( 2009 ) , is consumed in the form of zinc compounds , a variety of which are used industrially . 
 Cadmium has many common industrial uses as it is a key component in battery production , is present in cadmium pigments , coatings , and is commonly used in electroplating . In 2009 , 86 % of cadmium was used in batteries , predominantly in rechargeable nickel @-@ cadmium batteries . The European Union banned the use of cadmium in electronics in 2004 with several exceptions but reduced the allowed content of cadmium in electronics to 0 @.@ 002 % . Cadmium electroplating , consuming 6 % of the global production , can be found in the aircraft industry due to the ability to resist corrosion when applied to steel components . 
 Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications . It is used in some thermometers , especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures . A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps , while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations , and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive <unk> alloy . Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine , although they are much less common today than they once were , now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood . It is still used as an ingredient in dental amalgams . In the late 20th century the largest use of mercury was in the mercury cell process ( also called the Castner @-@ Kellner process ) in the production of chlorine and caustic soda . 
 = = Biological role and toxicity = = 
 The group 12 elements have multiple effects on biological organisms as cadmium and mercury are toxic while zinc is required by most plants and animals in trace amounts . 
 Zinc is an essential trace element , necessary for plants , animals , and microorganisms . It is " typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms " after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes . There are 2 – 4 grams of zinc distributed throughout the human body , and it plays " ubiquitous biological roles " . A 2006 study estimated that about 10 % of human proteins ( 2800 ) potentially bind zinc , in addition to hundreds which transport and traffic zinc . In the U.S. , the Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) is 8 mg / day for women and 11 mg / day for men . Harmful excessive supplementation may be a problem and should probably not exceed 20 mg / day in healthy people , although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40 mg / day . 
 Mercury and cadmium are toxic and may cause environmental damage if they enter rivers or rain water . This may result in contaminated crops as well as the bioaccumulation of mercury in a food chain leading to an increase in illnesses caused by mercury and cadmium poisoning . 
 = Romford = 
 Romford is a large town in East London , England , and the administrative centre of the London Borough of Havering . It is located 14 @.@ 1 miles ( 22 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of Charing Cross and is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan . It was historically a market town in the county of Essex and formed the administrative centre of the liberty of Havering , until it was dissolved in 1892 . Good road links and the opening of the railway station in 1839 were key to the development of the town and the economic history of Romford is underpinned by a shift from agriculture to light industry and then to retail and commerce . As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century , Romford significantly expanded and increased in population , becoming a municipal borough in 1937 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965 . It now forms one of the largest commercial , retail , entertainment and leisure districts outside central London and has a developed night time economy . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Toponymy = = = 
 Romford is first recorded in 1177 as <unk> , which is formed from Old English ' <unk> ' and ' ford ' and means " the wide or spacious ford " . The naming of the River Rom is a local ' back @-@ formation ' from the name of the town ; and the river is elsewhere known as the Beam . The ford most likely existed on the main London to Colchester road where it crossed that river . 
 The original site of the town was to the south , in an area still known as Oldchurch . It was moved northwards to the present site in the later medieval period to avoid the frequent flooding of the River Rom . The first building on the new site was the parish church of Saint Edward the Confessor . 
 = = = Economic development = = = 
 The town developed in the Middle Ages on the main road to London and the regionally significant Romford Market was established in 1247 . The early history of Romford and the immediate area is agricultural and it is recorded as being the location of a number of mills used to grind corn . The area was a focus of the leather industry from the 15th to the early 19th centuries and there is record of a wide range of industries such as cloth making , weaving , charcoal burning , metal working and brewing . Communications played an important part in its development ; the main road to London was maintained by the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust from 1721 and Romford became a coaching town in the 18th century . Several failed attempts were made in the early 19th century to connect the town to the Thames via a Romford Canal . Initially intended to transport agricultural products to London and later intended to serve growing industrial sites in Romford , only two miles of canal were constructed and the canal company were unable to reach the town . 
 The development of the town was accelerated by the opening of the railway station in 1839 which stimulated the local economy and was key to the development of the Star Brewery . Initially Eastern Counties Railway services operated between Mile End and Romford , with extensions to Brentwood and to Shoreditch in 1840 . A second station was opened on South Street in 1892 by the London , Tilbury and Southend Railway on the line to Upminster and Grays , giving Romford a rail connection to Tilbury Docks . The two stations were combined into one in 1934 . Light industry slowly developed , reaching a peak in the 1970s with a number of factories on the edge of town , such as the <unk> Vickers office machinery company , <unk> manufacturers of wireless components , May 's Sheet Metal Works and brush manufacturers <unk> . Suburban expansion increased the population and reinforced Romford 's position as a significant regional town centre . The Liberty Shopping Centre was constructed in the 1960s , and has been modernised and supplemented with further shopping centres throughout the town , including The Mall , opened in 1990 ( as ' Liberty 2 ' ) ; and The Brewery , opened in 2000 on the site of the old Star Brewery . 
 = = = Local government = = = 
 Romford formed a chapelry in the large ancient parish of Hornchurch in the Becontree hundred of Essex ; as well as the town it included the wards of Collier Row , Harold Wood , and Noak Hill . Through ancient custom the area enjoyed special status and a charter in 1465 removed the parish from the Becontree hundred and the county of Essex and it instead formed the independent liberty of Havering . Over time the vestry of Romford chapelry absorbed the local powers that would usually be held by the parish authorities and in 1849 Romford became a separate parish within the liberty . Improvement commissioners were set up in 1819 for paving , lighting , watching , and cleansing of the marketplace and main streets . As the town grew this arrangement became ineffective at controlling sanitation and in 1851 a local board of health was set up for the parish ; although its area was reduced in 1855 to cover only the town ward . The remainder of the parish became part of the Romford rural sanitary district in 1875 . These changes and the introduction of the Romford Poor Law Union in 1836 eroded the powers of the liberty and it was finally abolished in 1892 and reincorporated into Essex . 
 The Local Government Act 1894 reformed local government and created the Romford Urban District and Romford Rural District to replace the local board and sanitary district ; and the Romford parish was split into Romford Urban and Romford Rural along the lines of the urban district . In 1900 the parish was recombined and the urban district expanded to cover all of the former area of the historic chapelry , except for Noak Hill which remained in the rural district and had become a parish in its own right in 1895 . The enlarged urban district formed part of the London Traffic Area from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933 . The suburban expansion of London caused an increase in population during the 1930s and the urban district was expanded further in 1934 , taking in the parishes of Havering @-@ atte @-@ Bower and Noak Hill . It was incorporated as the Municipal Borough of Romford in 1937 . In 1965 the municipal borough was abolished and its former area was combined with that of Hornchurch Urban District ; it was again removed from Essex and since then has formed the northern part of the London Borough of Havering in Greater London . 
 = = = Suburban expansion = = = 
 There was early expansion in the 1840s in the area now occupied by the Waterloo estate , and then known as New Romford , where 200 cottages were built . To the east of the market place from 1850 middle class suburban housing was constructed with a much larger area of 200 acres ( 81 ha ) built @-@ over to the south of the railway from 1851 . Through a gradual process of selling off former manors , houses were built radiating from the town in all directions for about a mile . More significant growth occurred between 1910 and 1911 with the construction of Gidea Park Garden Suburb , which included Raphael Park and Gidea Park railway station . Large sections of land to the north of the town at Collier Row were developed in the interwar period and after World War II , the London County Council built the Harold Hill estate to the north east from 1948 to 1958 . 
 The right to supply electricity to the town was secured by the County of London Electricity Supply Company in 1913 . Initially power was generated within the Star Brewery site , with the supply switching to Barking Power Station in 1925 . Gas supply began in 1825 with gas works of 25 acres ( 10 ha ) constructed by 1938 . Following the Telegraph Act 1899 Romford became part of the Post Office London telephone area and the Romford exchange was recorded as having 240 subscribers in 1916 . The town water supply initially came from the Havering Well , and 1859 a new public well and pump was built at the east end of the market . The South Essex Waterworks Company started installing mains water supply in 1863 and had offices in South Street . By 1905 its supply was serving Ilford , Collier Row , Ardleigh Green , Brentwood , and Hornchurch . Sewage works were installed by the local board at Oldchurch in 1862 , with further works built in Hornchurch in 1869 .
