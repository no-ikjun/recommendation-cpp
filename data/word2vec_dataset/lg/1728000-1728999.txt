 Caris Coleman LeVert ( born August 25 , 1994 ) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines . As a freshman for the 2012 – 13 team , he nearly redshirted but earned a key role off the bench as the team went on to reach the championship game in the 2013 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . As a sophomore for the 2013 – 14 team , he became a regular starter and was selected as a second team 2013 – 14 All @-@ Big Ten player for the outright Big Ten regular season champions . His junior and senior seasons where interrupted by injury . LeVert is related to Eddie Levert , Gerald Levert and Sean Levert .

 LeVert grew up in Northeast Columbus but moved to nearby Pickerington in second grade . As a high school senior , he led Pickerington High School Central to a 26 – 2 record and the 2012 OHSAA Division I state championship . LeVert was a 2012 Associated Press All @-@ Ohio Second Team high school basketball player and the 2012 Columbus Dispatch Metro Player of the Year for Pickerington High School Central . He was not heavily recruited in high school and his only official visit was to Alabama State . He committed to play basketball for John Groce and the Ohio Bobcats men 's basketball program in November 2011 . Meanwhile , when future teammates Mitch McGary and Stauskas joined Glenn Robinson III by committing to Michigan in November 2011 , Michigan became the fifth best recruiting class in the country . 
 When Groce got hired by Illinois Fighting Illini men 's basketball in March 2012 , LeVert got lost in the shuffle and decided to commit to Michigan . Ironically , Groce 's 2011 – 12 Ohio Bobcats ' upset of the 2011 – 12 Michigan team in the 2012 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament was probably the reason that Groce was hired by Illinois and LeVert withdrew his National Letter of Intent to play for Ohio .

 = Nativity scene = 
 A nativity scene or crèche ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; also known as a manger scene , or crib , in Italian presepio or presepe ) is the special exhibition , particularly during the Christmas season , of art objects representing the scene of the birth of Jesus . While the term " nativity scene " may be used of any representation of the very common subject of the Nativity of Jesus in art , it has a more specialized sense referring to seasonal displays , either using model figures in a setting or enactments called " living nativity scenes " in which real humans and animals participate . Nativity scenes exhibit figures representing the infant Jesus , his mother Mary , and Joseph . Other characters from the nativity story such as shepherds and sheep , and angels may be displayed near the manger in a barn ( or cave ) intended to accommodate farm animals , as described in the gospels of Luke . A donkey and an ox are typically depicted in the scene , as well as the Magi and camels belonging to the Magi described in the Matthew . Several cultures add other characters and objects that may be Biblical or not . 
 Saint Francis of Assisi is credited with creating the first live nativity scene in 1223 ( a " living " one ) intending thereby to cultivate the worship of Christ , having been inspired by his recent visit to the Holy Land where he had been shown Jesus 's traditional birthplace . The scene 's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes . 
 Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world and are displayed during the Christmas season in churches , homes , shopping malls , and other venues , and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings . In the United States , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh annually display Neapolitan Baroque nativity scenes , both of which originated from the collection of Eugenio <unk> . 
 Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy . In the United States , nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges . 
 = = Birth of Jesus = = 
 A nativity scene takes its inspiration from the accounts of the birth of Jesus in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke . Luke 's narrative describes an angel announcing the birth of Jesus to shepherds who then visit the humble site where Jesus is found lying in a manger , a trough for cattle feed . ( Luke 2 : 8 @-@ 20 ) Matthew 's narrative tells of " wise men " ( <unk> <unk> ) who follow a star to the house where Jesus dwelt , and indicates that the Magi found Jesus some time later , less than two years after his birth , rather than on the exact day . ( <unk> : 1 @-@ 23 ) Matthew 's account does not mention the angels and shepherds , while Luke 's narrative is silent on the Magi and the star . The Magi and the angels are often displayed in a nativity scene with the Holy Family and the shepherds although there is no scriptural basis for their presence . ( Luke 2 : 7 ; 2 : 12 ; 2 : 17 ) 
 = = Origins and early history = = 
 St. Francis of Assisi is credited with creating the first nativity scene in 1223 at Greccio , central Italy , in an attempt to place the emphasis of Christmas upon the worship of Christ rather than upon secular materialism and gift giving . The nativity scene created by St. Francis is described by St Bonaventure in his Life of Saint Francis of Assisi written around 1260 . Staged in a cave near Greccio , St. Francis ' nativity scene was a living one with humans and animals cast in the Biblical roles . Pope Honorius III gave his blessing to the exhibit . Such pantomimes became hugely popular and spread throughout Christendom . Within a hundred years every church in Italy was expected to have a nativity scene at Christmastime . Eventually , statues replaced human and animal participants , and static scenes grew to elaborate affairs with richly robed figurines placed in intricate landscape settings . Charles III , King of the Two Sicilies , collected such elaborate scenes , and his enthusiasm encouraged others to do the same . 
 The scene 's popularity inspired much imitation in Catholic countries , and in the Early modern period sculpted cribs were set up in Catholic churches and homes , often exported from Italy . These elaborate scenes reached their artistic apogee in Papal state , Emilia , Kingdom of Naples , Genoa that had an important tradition , notably those of Anton Maria <unk> . By the end of the 19th century nativity scenes became popular beyond Catholic settings , and many versions of various sizes and in various materials such as terracotta , paper , wood , wax and ivory were marketed , often with a backdrop setting in the stable . 
 Different traditions of nativity scenes emerged in different countries . Hand @-@ painted <unk> are popular in Provence . In southern Germany , Austria and Trentino @-@ Alto Adige the figurines are <unk> in wood . Colorful <unk> are typical in Poland . 
 A tradition in England , involved baking a mince pie in the shape of a manger to hold the Christ child until dinnertime when the pie was eaten . When the Puritans banned Christmas celebrations in the 17th century , they also passed specific legislation to outlaw such pies , calling them " <unk> in crust " . 
 Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world and are displayed during the Christmas season in churches , homes , shopping malls , and other venues , and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings . The Vatican has displayed a scene in St. Peter 's Square near its Christmas tree since 1982 and the Pope has for many years blessed the <unk> of children assembled in St. Peter 's Square for a special ceremony . In the United States , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City annually displays a Neapolitan Baroque nativity scene before a 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) blue spruce . 
 Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy . A life @-@ sized scene in the United Kingdom featuring waxworks celebrities provoked outrage in 2004 , and , in Spain , a city council forbade the exhibition of a traditional toilet humor character in a public nativity scene . People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) indicates that animals in living displays lack proper care and suffer abuse . In the United States , nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges , and the <unk> theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace .

 = = = Static nativity scenes = = = 
 A static nativity scene may be erected indoors or outdoors during the Christmas season , and is composed of figurines depicting the infant Jesus resting in a manger , Mary , and Joseph . Other figures in the scene may include angels , shepherds , and various animals . The figures may be made of any material , and arranged in a stable or grotto . The Magi may also appear , and are sometimes not placed in the scene until the week following Christmas to account for their travel time to Bethlehem . While most home nativity scenes are packed away at Christmas or shortly thereafter , nativity scenes in churches usually remain on display until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord . 
 The nativity scene may not accurately reflect gospel events . With no basis in the gospels , for example , the shepherds , the Magi , and the ox and ass may be displayed together at the manger . Some traditions bring other scriptural characters to the nativity scene such as Adam and Eve and the serpent , Noah and his animals , the twelve sons of Jacob , the twelve prophets and the twelve apostles . Mundane activities such as Mary washing diapers in the River Jordan , or a dove descending on the newborn infant may be depicted . The art form can be traced back to eighteenth @-@ century Naples , Italy . Neapolitan nativity scenes do not represent Palestine at the time of Jesus but the life of the Naples of 1700 , during the Bourbon period . Families competed with each other to produce the most elegant and elaborate scenes and so , next to the Child Jesus , to the Holy Family and the shepherds , were placed ladies and gentlemen of the nobility , representatives of the bourgeoisie of the time , vendors with their banks and miniatures of cheese , bread , sheep , pigs , ducks or grape , and typical figures of the time like gypsy predicting the future , people playing cards , housewives doing shopping , dogs , cats and chickens . 
 Regional variants on the standard nativity scene are many . The putz of Pennsylvania Dutch Americans evolved into elaborate decorative Christmas villages in the twentieth century . In Colombia , the <unk> may feature a town and its surrounding countryside with shepherds and animals . Mary and Joseph are often depicted as rural <unk> people with Mary clad in a countrywoman 's shawl and fedora hat , and Joseph garbed in a poncho . The infant Jesus is depicted as European with Italianate features . Visitors bringing gifts to the Christ child are depicted as Colombian natives . After World War I , large , lighted manger scenes in churches and public buildings grew in popularity , and , by the 1950s , many companies were selling lawn ornaments of non @-@ fading , long @-@ lasting , weather resistant materials telling the nativity story . 
 = = = Living nativity scenes = = = 
 <unk> similar to the scene staged by St. Francis at Greccio became an annual event throughout Christendom . Abuses and exaggerations in the presentation of mystery plays during the Middle Ages , however , forced the church to prohibit performances during the 15th century . The plays survived outside church walls , however , and three hundred years after the prohibition , German immigrants brought simple forms of the nativity play to America . Some features of the dramas became part of both Catholic and Protestant Christmas services with children often taking the parts of characters in the nativity story . Nativity plays and pageants , culminating in living nativity scenes , eventually entered public schools . Such exhibitions have been challenged on the grounds of separation of church and state . 
 In some countries , the nativity scene took to the streets with human performers costumed as Joseph and Mary traveling from house to house seeking shelter and being told by the houses ' occupants to move on . The couple 's journey culminated in an outdoor tableau at a designated place with the shepherds and the Magi then traveling the streets in parade fashion looking for the Christ child . 
 Living nativity scenes are not without their problems . In 2008 , for example , vandals destroyed all eight scenes and backdrops at Mount Carmel Christian Church ’ s drive @-@ through living nativity scene in Georgia . About 120 of the church ’ s 500 members were involved in the construction of the scenes or playing roles in the production . The damage was estimated at more than US $ 2 @,@ 000 . Additionally , the use of real animals in living nativity scenes has provoked complaint . 
 In southern Italy living nativity scenes ( called presepe vivente in Italian ) , are extremely popular , and are rather elaborate affairs , which feature the classic nativity scene as well as a mock rural 19th @-@ century village , complete with artisans in traditional costumes working at their particular trades . These attract many visitors and have been televised by Italy 's national station RAI . In 2010 , the old city of Matera in Basilicata hosted the world 's largest living nativity scene of the time , which was performed in the historic center Sassi . 
 = = = Animals in nativity scenes = = = 
 A donkey ( or ass ) and an ox typically appear in nativity scenes . Besides the necessity of animals for a manger , this is an allusion to Isaiah : " the ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master 's crib ; but Israel doth not know , my people doth not consider " Isaiah 1 : 3 . The Gospels do not mention an ox and donkey Another source for the tradition may be the <unk> text , the Gospel of Pseudo @-@ Matthew of the 7th century . ( The translation in this text of Habakkuk 3 : 2 is not taken from the Septuagint . ) : 
 " And on the third day after the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ , Mary went out of the cave , and , entering a stable , placed the child in a manger , and an ox and an ass adored him . Then was fulfilled that which was said by the prophet Isaiah , " The ox knows his owner , and the ass his master 's crib . " Therefore , the animals , the ox and the ass , with him in their midst incessantly adored him . Then was fulfilled that which was said by Habakkuk the prophet , saying , " Between two animals you are made manifest . " 
 The ox traditionally represents patience , the nation of Israel , and Old Testament sacrificial worship while the ass represents humility , readiness to serve , and the Gentiles . 
 The ox and the ass , as well as other animals , became a part of nativity scene tradition . In a 1415 , Corpus Christi celebration , the Ordo <unk> notes that Jesus was lying between an ox and an ass . Other animals introduced to nativity scenes include elephants and camels . 
 By the 1970s , churches and community organizations increasingly included animals in nativity pageants . Since then , automobile @-@ accessible " drive @-@ through " scenes with sheep and donkeys have become popular .

 = = = At the Vatican = = = 
 In 1982 , Pope John Paul II inaugurated the annual tradition of placing a nativity scene on display in the Vatican City in the Piazza San Pietro before the Christmas Tree . 
 In 2006 , the nativity scene featured seventeen new figures of spruce on loan to the Vatican from sculptors and wood sawyers of the town of Tesero , Italy in the Italian Alps . The figures included peasants , a flutist , a bagpipe player and a shepherd named <unk> . Twelve nativity scenes created before 1800 from Tesero were put on display in the Vatican audience hall . 
 The Vatican nativity scene for 2007 placed the birth of Jesus in Joseph 's house , based upon an interpretation of the Gospel of Matthew . Mary was shown with the newborn infant Jesus in a room in Joseph 's house . To the left of the room was Joseph 's workshop while to the right was a busy inn — a comment on materialism versus spirituality . The Vatican 's written description of the diorama said , " The scene for this year 's Nativity recalls the painting style of the Flemish School of the 1500s . " The scene was unveiled on December 24 and remained in place until February 2 , 2008 for The Feast of the Presentation of the Lord . Ten new figures were exhibited with seven on loan from the town of Tesero and three — a baker , a woman , and a child — donated to the Vatican . The decision for the atypical setting was believed to be part of a crackdown on fanciful scenes erected in various cities around Italy . In Naples , Italy , for example , Elvis Presley and Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi , were depicted among the shepherds and angels worshipping at the manger . 
 In 2008 , the province of Trento , Italy provided sculpted wooden figures and animals as well as utensils to create depictions of daily life . The scene featured seventeen figures with nine depicting the Holy Family , the Magi , and the shepherds . The nine figures were originally donated by Saint Vincent <unk> for the nativity at Rome 's Church of Sant 'Andrea della Valle in 1842 and eventually found their way to the Vatican . They are dressed anew each year for the scene . The 2008 scene was set in Bethlehem with a fountain and a hearth representing regeneration and light . The same year , the Paul VI Audience Hall exhibited a nativity designed by Mexican artists . 
 Since 1968 , the Pope has officiated at a special ceremony in St. Peter 's Square on <unk> Sunday that involves blessing hundreds of <unk> and Babies Jesus for the children of Rome . In 1978 , 50 @,@ 000 schoolchildren attended the ceremony .

 The Czech Republic , and the cultures represented in the lands of former Bohemia and Czechoslovakia have a long tradition regarding <unk> , crèches . The tradition of home Nativity scenes is often traced to the 1782 ban of church and institutional crèches by emperor Joseph II , officially responding to public disturbances and the resulting " loss of dignity " of such displays .

She remarked , " Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month , and I was only there for five months , I begged because I said I was an expert potter — <unk> actually — and could I please make the entire nativity scene . " She supplemented her nativity figurines on the show with tiny artificial palm trees imported from Germany . 
 Perhaps the best known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque <unk> displayed annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . Its backdrop is a 1763 choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty @-@ foot blue spruce decorated with a host of 18th @-@ century angels . The nativity figures are placed at the tree 's base . The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964 , and the choir screen was the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956 . Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio <unk> .

 Christmas is celebrated by Australians in a number of ways . Due to its multiculturalism and diversity , the immigrants have influenced the way Christmas is celebrated around the country . In Australia , it ’ s summer season and is very hot during Christmas time . 
 During the Christmas time , locals and visitors visit places around their towns and suburbs to view the outdoor and indoor displays . All over the towns , the places are lit with colorful and modern spectacular lighting displays . The displays of nativity scenes with Aussie featured native animals like kangaroos and koalas are also evident . 
 In Melbourne , a traditional and authentic Nativity Scene is becoming very popular at St. Elizabeth ’ s Parish , Dandenong North . This annual Australian Nativity Scene creator and artist Wilson Fernandez has been building and creating the traditional nativity scenes since 2004 at St. Elizabeth ’ s Parish . 
 To mark this special event , Most Reverend Denis Hart Archbishop of Melbourne celebrated the Vigil Mass and blessed the Nativity Scene on Saturday , 14 December 2013 .

 Nativity scenes have been involved in controversies and lawsuits . 
 In 1969 , the American Civil Liberties Union ( representing three clergymen , an atheist , and a leader of the American Ethical Society ) , tried to block the construction of a nativity scene on the Ellipse in Washington , D.C. When the ACLU claimed the government sponsorship of a distinctly Christian symbol violated separation of church and state , the sponsors of the fifty @-@ year @-@ old Christmas celebration , Pageant of Peace , who had an exclusive permit from the Interior Department for all events on the Ellipse , responded that the nativity scene was a reminder of America 's spiritual heritage . The United States Court of Appeals ruled on December 12 , 1969 , that the crèche be allowed that year . The case continued until September 26 , 1973 , when the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and found the involvement of the Interior Department and the National Park Service in the Pageant of Peace amounted to government support for religion . The court opined that the nativity scene should be dropped from the pageant or the government end its participation in the event in order to avoid " excessive entanglements " between government and religion . In 1973 , the nativity scene vanished . 
 In 1985 , the United States Supreme Court ruled in ACLU v. Scarsdale , New York that nativity scenes on public lands violate separation of church and state statutes unless they comply with " The Reindeer Rule " — a regulation calling for equal opportunity for non @-@ religious symbols , such as reindeer . This principle was further clarified in 1989 , when the Supreme Court in County of Allegheny v. ACLU ruled that a crèche placed on the grand staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh , PA violated the Establishment Clause , because the " principal or primary effect " of the display was to advance religion . 
 In 1994 , at Christmas , the Park Board of San Jose , California , removed a statue of the infant Jesus from Plaza de Cesar Chavez Park and replaced it with a statue of the plumed Aztec god , Quetzalcoatl , commissioned with US $ 500 @,@ 000 of public funds . In response , protestors staged a living nativity scene in the park . 
 In 2006 , a lawsuit by the Alliance Defense Fund , a conservative Christian group in the United States , was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene . Because of the lawsuit , the decision was made to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol , in Olympia , as long as other symbols of the season were included . 
 In 2013 , Gov. Rick Perry signed into Texas law the Merry Christmas bill which would allow school districts in Texas to display nativity scenes .

 In the United States , nativity figurines are sometimes stolen from outdoor public and private displays during the Christmas season in an act that is generally called Baby Jesus theft . The thefts are usually pranks with figurines recovered within a few hours or days of their disappearances . Some have been damaged beyond repair or defaced with profanity , antisemitic epithets , or Satanic symbols . It is unclear if Baby Jesus theft is on the rise as United States federal law enforcement officials do not track such theft . Some communities protect outdoor nativity scenes with surveillance cameras or GPS devices concealed within the figurines .

 = Indefatigable @-@ class battlecruiser = 
 The Indefatigable class were the second class built of British battlecruisers which served in the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy during World War I. The design represented a modest reworking of the preceding Invincible class , featuring increased endurance and an improved cross @-@ deck arc of fire for their midships wing turrets achieved by a lengthening of the hull . Like its predecessor , the design resembled the contemporary dreadnought of the Royal Navy , but sacrificed armour protection and one turret from the main battery for a 4 @-@ knot ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) speed advantage . 
 Originally Indefatigable was the only ship of the class , but Australia and New Zealand were later built as part of a scheme to improve the defense of the Dominions by having each Dominion purchase a ' fleet unit ' of one battlecruiser , three light cruisers and six destroyers . Only Australia fully acceded to the idea , forming the Royal Australian Navy , but New Zealand agreed to fund one battlecruiser . A modified Indefatigable design was chosen rather than the Lion @-@ class battlecruiser then building for the Royal Navy . 
 They spent most of the war patrolling the North Sea , and participated in most of the battles there , although only New Zealand was in the United Kingdom when the war began . Indefatigable was in the Mediterranean where she pursued the German warships Goeben and Breslau as they fled towards Turkey and Australia was flagship of the Royal Australian Navy in Australian waters where she helped to secure the German Pacific colonies and searched , unsuccessfully , for the German East Asia Squadron before sailing for the United Kingdom in December 1914 . New Zealand participated in a number of the early actions in the North Sea including the Battle of Heligoland Bight and the inconclusive Scarborough Raid . Australia was still under repair after a collision with New Zealand before the Battle of Jutland so only Indefatigable and New Zealand were present where the former was destroyed by a magazine explosion . Both Australia and New Zealand spent much uneventful time at sea after Jutland waiting for the next appearance of the High Seas Fleet , but that had been forbidden by the Kaiser . New Zealand conducted Admiral Jellicoe on his tour of India and the Dominions after the war while Australia returned home where she again became the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy . New Zealand was sold for scrap in 1922 while Australia only lasted two years more before being scuttled to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 = = Background = = 
 Indefatigable was the successor to the Invincible @-@ class battlecruisers . A number of options for large cruisers were considered for the 1906 Naval Programme , including the X4 design of 22 @,@ 500 long tons ( 22 @,@ 861 t ) with 11 @-@ inch ( 280 mm ) armour and 25 @-@ knot ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) speed , but in the end this programme consisted only of three ships of the Dreadnought type . A number of options were considered for the 1907 – 08 programme , ranging from 18 @,@ 100 long tons ( 18 @,@ 390 t ) to 21 @,@ 400 long tons ( 21 @,@ 743 t ) , but in the end battleships were again favoured and no battlecruisers were ordered until the subsequent programme year . 
 At the time the final design of Indefatigable was approved , the Admiralty was already moving on , Fisher writing in September 1908 " I 've got Sir Philip Watts into a new Indomitable that will make your mouth water when you see it " , a design that was to eventually emerge as HMS Lion . In August 1909 the self @-@ governing dominions met at the 1909 Imperial Conference , and in discussion of Imperial defense , the Admiralty proposed the creation of indigenous fleet units , each to consist of one Invincible @-@ class battlecruiser , three light cruisers of the Bristol class , and six destroyers . These were to be based in Australia , New Zealand , Canada and South Africa in attempt to secure the naval defence of the Dominions while the Royal Navy concentrated in home waters to meet the German threat . While the scheme was rejected by Canada and South Africa , Australia and New Zealand subscribed , each ordering a modified version of the Indefatigable , rather than the originally proposed Invincible class . Australia became a ship of the newly formed Royal Australian Navy , while New Zealand was retained in European waters as a wholly RN unit . Eventually , only one fleet unit was formed , the Australian squadron in 1913 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Indefatigable was ordered as the lone battlecruiser of the 1908 – 9 programme . Her outline design was prepared in March 1908 , and the final design was approved in November 1908 . This design was essentially an enlarged Invincible with revised arrangements of protection and main armament . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Indefatigables were slightly larger than their predecessors of the Invincible class . They had an overall length of 590 ft ( 179 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 80 ft ( 24 @.@ 4 m ) , and a draught of 29 ft 9 in ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load . They displaced 18 @,@ 500 long tons ( 18 @,@ 800 t ) at load and 22 @,@ 130 long tons ( 22 @,@ 490 t ) at deep load , over 1 @,@ 500 long tons ( 1 @,@ 524 t ) more than the earlier ships . They had a metacentric height of 4 @.@ 78 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) at deep load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Each paired set of Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines was housed in a separate engine @-@ room and drove two shafts . The wing shaft was coupled to the high @-@ pressure ahead and astern turbines and the low @-@ pressure turbines to the inner shafts . Each wing shaft drove a propeller 10 feet 10 inches ( 3 @.@ 30 m ) in diameter and the propellers on the inner shafts were 10 feet 3 inches ( 3 @.@ 12 m ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by thirty @-@ one Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers in five boiler rooms . Indefatigable 's turbines were designed to produce a total of 43 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 32 @,@ 065 kW ) , but reached over 55 @,@ 000 shp ( 41 @,@ 013 kW ) on forced draught during trials in 1911 . The turbines of Australia and New Zealand were slightly more powerful at 44 @,@ 000 shp ( 32 @,@ 811 kW ) . They were designed for 25 @.@ 8 knots ( 47 @.@ 8 km / h ; 29 @.@ 7 mph ) , but all three bettered 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) during trials . 
 The ships carried approximately 3 @,@ 200 long tons ( 3 @,@ 251 t ) of coal , and an additional 850 long tons ( 864 t ) of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , the ships could steam for 3 @,@ 330 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 170 km ; 3 @,@ 830 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Each ship carried eight BL 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) Mk X guns in four BVIII * twin turrets . Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline , identified as ' A ' and ' X ' respectively . Two wing turrets were mounted amidships en echelon between the funnels , identified as ' P ' and ' Q ' . ' P ' turret was mounted on the port side and normally faced forward , ' Q ' turret was mounted on the starboard side and normally faced aft ( rearwards ) . ' P ' and ' Q ' turrets were staggered — ' P ' was forward of ' Q ' , enabling ' P ' to fire in a 70 ° arc to the starboard side and ' Q ' to likewise fire towards the port side . These were the same guns as those mounted in Dreadnought , the Lord Nelson class and Bellerophon class . 
 The guns could initially be depressed to − 3 ° and elevated to 13 @.@ 5 ° , although the turrets were modified to allow 16 ° of elevation during World War I. They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 390 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 725 ft / s ( 831 m / s ) ; at 13 @.@ 5 ° , this provided a maximum range of 16 @,@ 450 m ( 17 @,@ 990 yd ) with armour @-@ piercing ( AP ) 2 crh shells . At 16 ° elevation , the range was extended to 20 @,@ 435 yd ( 18 @,@ 686 m ) using the more aerodynamic , but slightly heavier 4 crh AP shells . The rate of fire of these guns was 1 – 2 rounds per minute . The ships carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun . 
 The secondary armament consisted of sixteen 4 in ( 102 mm ) BL Mk VII guns positioned in the superstructure . All of the guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during refits in 1914 and 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action , although two guns were removed at the same time . The guns on their PII * mounts had a maximum depression of 7 ° and a maximum elevation of 15 ° . They fired 31 @-@ pound ( 14 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 864 ft / s ( 873 m / s ) ; this gave a maximum range of 11 @,@ 600 yd ( 10 @,@ 600 m ) . Their rate of fire was 6 – 8 rounds per minute . They were provided with 100 rounds per gun . 
 An additional 4 @-@ inch gun was fitted in the surviving ships during 1917 as an anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) gun . It was mounted on a Mark II high @-@ angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60 ° . It had a reduced propellant charge with a muzzle velocity of only 2 @,@ 864 ft / s ( 873 m / s ) . Earlier anti @-@ aircraft guns included a single QF 3 @-@ inch ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) 20 cwt AA gun on a high @-@ angle Mark II mount that was added during refits in 1914 – 15 . This had a maximum depression of 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 90 ° . It fired a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ( 760 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 12 – 14 rounds per minute . They had a maximum effective ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 ft ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) . It was provided with 500 rounds . New Zealand carried a single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss AA gun on a HA MkIc mounting from October 1914 to the end of 1915 . This had a maximum depression of 8 ° and a maximum elevation of 60 ° . It fired a 6 @-@ pound ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 765 ft / s ( 538 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute . It had a maximum ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 050 m ) , but an effective range of only 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 097 m ) . 
 They mounted two 17 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 450 @-@ mm ) submerged torpedo tubes , one on each side aft of ' X ' barbette , for which twelve torpedoes were carried . 
 = = = Fire control = = = 
 The spotting tops , a modern equivalent of the sailing ship 's fighting top , at the head of the tripod fore and main masts controlled the fire of the Indefatigable 's main guns . Data from a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) Barr and Stroud rangefinder was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the Transmitting Station ( TS ) located beneath each spotting top where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns . The target 's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target . Each gun turret had its own transmission equipment and the turrets , Transmitting Stations , and spotting tops could be connected in almost any combination . Firing trials against Hero in 1907 revealed this system 's vulnerability to gunfire as the spotting top was hit twice and a large splinter severed the voice pipe and all wiring running along the mast . To guard against this possibility ' A ' turret of Indefatigable was fitted with a 9 @-@ foot rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof and it was equipped to control the entire main armament during a refit between 1911 and 1914 . 
 Australia and New Zealand were built with a different arrangement . The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected , had an improved field of vision and direct access to the primary conning position . The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged . Their ' A ' turrets were built with the improvements listed above . 
 Fire control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I and the development of the Dreyer Fire Control Table was one such advance . It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version , the Mk I , was fitted to the Indefatigables during refits in 1915 – 16 . The more important development was the director firing system . This consisted of a fire @-@ control director mounted high in the ship which electrically transmitted training and elevation angles to the gun turrets via pointers , which the turret crewmen had only to follow . The director layer 's trigger fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells . A gun within the ' Y ' turret was also equipped with transmitters so that , as a backup , it could function as a " directing gun " , but there was no provision for the gun battery to be split between the main director and this directing gun . The Indefatigables received their director equipment between mid @-@ 1915 and May 1916 . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 In some ways the armour protection given to the Indefatigables was weaker than that of their predecessors as the armour was reduced in thickness in a number of places , but it was spread out to a greater extent . The main belt ran from stem to stern ; it was 6 inches ( 152 mm ) thick for the middle 298 feet ( 91 m ) of the ship , but was reduced to 4 inches ( 102 mm ) abreast the end 12 @-@ inch gun barbettes and magazines and thinned still further to 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) at the ends of the ship . A 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) bulkhead met the barbette of X turret while the forward bulkhead was 3 – 4 inches ( 76 – 102 mm ) in thickness . The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by 7 in ( 178 mm ) of armour , except for the turret roofs which used 3 in ( 76 mm ) of Krupp non @-@ cemented armour ( KNC ) . The supporting beams for the turret roofs were reinforced over those of the Invincibles based on lessons learned in firing trials conducted during 1907 . The thickness of the main deck was generally 1 in ( 25 mm ) of nickel steel , but increased to 2 inches ( 51 mm ) around the base of the barbettes . The lower deck armour of nickel steel was 1 @.@ 5 in ( 38 mm ) on the flat and 2 inches thick on the slope , but increased to two inches at the ship 's ends . The sides of the forward conning tower were 10 in ( 254 mm ) thick while the spotting tower had four inches . The roof and floor of both towers were KNC armour 3 inches thick while the conning tower 's communication tube was four inches of KNC . The torpedo director tower 1 inch of nickel steel all around . Nickel steel torpedo bulkheads of 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms . The funnel uptakes were protected with 1 @.@ 5 inches of nickel steel on the sides and 1 inch on the ends . Krupp cemented armour was used throughout , unless otherwise mentioned . 
 Australia and New Zealand were built with a different arrangement . The waterline belt did not extend to the ends , but terminated 60 feet ( 18 @.@ 3 m ) short of the bow and 55 feet ( 16 @.@ 8 m ) short of the stern . The sections abreast the barbettes were thickened to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) and the sections at each end were increased to four inches . The main deck armour was increased to 2 @.@ 5 inches around the barbettes and was extended 55 feet past the rear barbette . The lower deck armour was decreased from 1 @.@ 5 – 2 inches to one inch , both on the flat and slope , except at the ends where it was thickened to 2 @.@ 5 inches . After Jutland one inch of armour was added to the magazine crowns and the turret roofs with a total weight of 110 long tons ( 112 t )

 Indefatigable was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet upon her commissioning in 1911 . She was transferred to the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean Fleet in December 1913 . New Zealand was only briefly assigned to the Home Fleet before she sailed for New Zealand in February 1912 . She returned to Portsmouth the following December and was assigned again to the Home Fleet . She made a number of port visits to France and Russia before the war began . Australia set sail for Australia almost immediately after she was commissioned in June 1913 to assume her duties as the first flagship of the Royal Australian Navy . 
 = = = Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau = = = 
 Indefatigable , accompanied by Indomitable , under the command of Admiral Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne , encountered the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau on the morning of 4 August 1914 headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville , but Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina to recoal . All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers , but Goeben and Breslau were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th . By this time war had been declared , after the German invasion of Belgium , but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a six @-@ mile ( 10 km ) limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the Strait of Messina where they could observe the port directly . Milne therefore stationed Inflexible and Indefatigable at the northern exit of the Straits of Messina , still expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports ; he stationed the light cruiser Gloucester at the southern exit and sent Indomitable to recoal at Bizerte , where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean . 
 The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east , towards Constantinople , trailed by Gloucester . Milne , still expecting Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon to turn west , kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August , when he set sail for Cape Matapan , where Goeben had been spotted eight hours earlier , at a leisurely 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) . At 2 : 30 p.m. he received an incorrect signal from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria — war would not be declared until 12 August and the order was countermanded four hours later , but Milne followed his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian breakout attempt , rather than seek Goeben . Finally on 9 August Milne was given clear orders to " chase Goeben which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north @-@ east . " Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles , and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean , unaware that the Goeben did not intend to come out . 
 On 3 November 1914 , Churchill ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia . The attack was carried out by Indomitable and Indefatigable , as well as the French pre @-@ dreadnought battleships Suffren and Vérité . The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response . The results were deceptively encouraging . In a twenty @-@ minute bombardment , a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula , displacing ( but not destroying ) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers . The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences , and they set about expanding the mine field . This attack actually took place before a formal declaration of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire which did not happen until 6 November . Indefatigable was remained in the Mediterranean until she was relieved by Inflexible on 24 January 1915 and proceeded to Malta to refit . Having completed her refit she sailed to England on 14 February where she joined the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) upon her arrival . 
 = = = Australia in the Pacific = = = 
 Following the declaration of war , Australia was assigned to find the German East Asia Squadron , the only Central Powers naval force of note in the Pacific . During this hunt , she was attached to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force and provided support during the Force 's invasion of Rabaul , in case the German squadron was present . The squadron 's commander , Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee , was wary of Australia , which he described as being superior to his squadron . 
 Following von Spee 's withdrawal from the Pacific , Australia was belatedly ordered on 8 November 1914 to join with several Japanese cruisers off Mexico to resume the hunt for the German cruisers . By this time , the German squadron had made its way to the South Atlantic , and in early December was destroyed by a British squadron in the Battle of the Falkland Islands . Australia was sent to join the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron at Rosyth , Scotland , and was made flagship of the squadron after a short refit . 
 = = = Battle of Heligoland Bight = = = 
 New Zealand 's first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight operation on 28 August 1914 . Beatty 's ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks . They turned south at full speed at 11 : 35 AM when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade estuary . The brand @-@ new light cruiser Arethusa had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the light cruisers Strassburg and Cöln when Beatty 's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12 : 37 PM . Strassburg was able to duck into the mists and evade fire , but Cöln remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron . But Beatty was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser Ariadne directly to his front . He turned in pursuit , but reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at a range under 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) . At 1 : 10 PM Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire . Shortly after turning north , Beatty 's main body encountered the crippled Cöln and she was sunk by two salvos from Lion .

 The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail . An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November had been partially successful , but a larger @-@ scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards . The fast battlecruisers would actually conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid . But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey , although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well . Admiral Beatty 's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron , now reduced to four ships , including New Zealand , as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts , was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank . 
 Admiral Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns , but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 5 : 15 and fought an inconclusive action with them . Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender , commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron , had received a signal at 5 : 40 that Lynx was engaging enemy destroyers although Beatty had not . The destroyer Shark spotted the German armoured cruiser Roon and her escorts at about 7 : 00 , but could not transmit the message until 7 : 25 . Admiral Warrender received the signal , as did New Zealand , but Beatty did not , despite the fact that New Zealand had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty . Warrender attempted to pass on Shark 's message to Beatty at 7 : 36 , but did not manage to make contact until 7 : 55 . Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched New Zealand to search for Roon . She was being overhauled by New Zealand when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 9 : 00 . Beatty ordered New Zealand to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough . 
 The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank ; Beatty 's ships passed to the north while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast . This left a 15 nautical miles ( 28 km ) gap between them through which the German light forces began to move . At 12 : 25 , the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper . Southampton spotted the light cruiser Stralsund and signalled a report to Beatty . At 12 : 30 Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships . Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper 's ships , however , those were some 50 km ( 31 mi ) behind . The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron , which had been screening for Beatty 's ships , detached to pursue the German cruisers , but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions . This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape , and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers . The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape .

 On 23 January 1915 , a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements . But the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty , which included New Zealand . Contact was initiated at 7 : 20 AM on the 24th when the British light cruiser Arethusa spotted the German light cruiser SMS Kolberg . By 7 : 35 the Germans had spotted Beatty 's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at 20 knots ( 23 mph ; 37 km / h ) , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increased speed to Blücher 's maximum speed of 23 knots ( 26 mph ; 43 km / h ) if they were British battlecruisers . 
 Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape . New Zealand and Indomitable were the slowest of Beatty 's ships and gradually fell behind the newer and faster battlecruisers , but New Zealand was able to open fire on Blücher by 9 : 35 . She continued to engage Blücher after the other , faster , battlecruisers had switched targets to the German battlecruisers . After about an hour New Zealand had knocked out Blücher 's forward turret and Indomitable began to fire on her as well at 10 : 31 . Two 12 @-@ inch shells pierced her armoured deck and exploded in an ammunition room at 10 : 35 . This started a fire amidships that destroyed her two port 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) turrets and the concussion damaged her engines so that her speed had dropped to 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) and her steering gear jammed . At 10 : 48 Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her . But due to a combination of a mistake by Beatty 's flag lieutenant in signalling and heavy damage to Beatty 's flagship Lion , which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards so that Beatty could not communicate with his ships that caused the rest of the battlecruisers , temporarily under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Gordon Moore in New Zealand , to believe that that signal applied to them . So they turned away from Hipper 's main body and engaged Blücher . New Zealand fired 147 shells at Blücher before she capsized and sank at 12 : 07 PM after being torpedoed .

 On 31 May 1916 the 2nd BCS consisted of New Zealand ( Flagship of Rear Admiral William Christopher Pakenham ) and Indefatigable as Australia was still under repair following her collision with New Zealand on 22 April . It was assigned to Admiral Beatty 's Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea . The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea . Hipper 's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3 : 20 , but Beatty 's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 2 : 30 . Almost immediately afterwards , at 3 : 32 , he ordered a course change to east south @-@ east to position himself astride the German 's line of retreat and called his ships ' crews to action stations . He also ordered the 2nd BCS , which had been leading , to fall in astern of the 1st BCS . Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard , away from the British , to assume a south @-@ easterly course , and reduced speed to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up . With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet , then about 60 miles ( 97 km ) behind him . Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still far too north to cut off Hipper . 
 This began what was to be called the ' Run to the South ' as Beatty changed course to steer east south @-@ east at 3 : 45 , paralleling Hipper 's course , now that the range closed to under 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) . The Germans opened fire first at 3 : 48 , followed almost immediately afterwards by the British . The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships , Lion and Princess Royal had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire . The British formation was echeloned to the right with Indefatigable in the rear and the furthest to the west , and New Zealand ahead of her and slightly further east . The German fire was accurate from the beginning , but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze . Indefatigable aimed at Von der Tann while New Zealand aimed at Moltke while remaining unengaged herself . By 3 : 54 the range was down to 12 @,@ 900 yards ( 11 @,@ 800 m ) and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 3 : 57 . Around 4 : 00 Indefatigable was hit by two or three shells from Von der Tann around the rear turret and almost immediately fell off to starboard and was down by the stern and listing to port . She was hit twice more on the next volley , once on forecastle and on the forward turret , and blew up at about 4 : 03 when her magazines exploded . The most likely cause of her loss was a low @-@ order explosion in ' X ' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the control shafts between the steering engines and the steering gear , followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley . Von der Tann only fired 52 28 cm ( 11 in ) shells at Indefatigable before she exploded , taking 1017 men with her . Only two survivors were rescued by the German torpedo boat <unk> . 
 After Indefatigable 's loss New Zealand shifted her fire to Von der Tann in accordance with Beatty 's standing instructions . The range had grown too far for accurate shooting so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 4 : 12 and 4 : 15 . By this time the 5th Battle Squadron of four Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships had close up and was engaging Von der Tann and Moltke . At 4 : 23 a 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 340 mm ) shell from Tiger hit near Von der Tann 's rear turret and started a fire among the practice targets stowed there that completely enveloped the ship and caused New Zealand to shift fire to Moltke . At 4 : 30 the light cruiser Southampton , scouting in front of Beatty 's ships , spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed . Three minutes later she sighted the topmasts of Vice @-@ Admiral Reinhard Scheer 's battleships , but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes . Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen @-@ point turn to starboard in succession . New Zealand , last ship in the fleet , turned prematurely to stay outside the range of the oncoming battleships . During the entire ' Run to the South ' she was hit only once , in ' Y ' turret by a 28 cm shell with little effect . 
 New Zealand was engaged by the battleship Prinzregent Luitpold beginning at 5 : 08 during what came to be called the ' Run to the North ' , but she was not hit , although she was straddled several times . Beatty 's ships maintained full speed to try and put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range . They turned north and then northeast to try and rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet . At 5 : 40 they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers . The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5 : 47 . Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it , but he mistimed his <unk> and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east , further away from the Germans . By 6 : 35 Beatty was following Indomitable and Inflexible of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east @-@ southeast , leading the Grand Fleet , and continuing to engage Hipper 's battlecruisers to their southwest . A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180 ° starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze . Twenty minutes later Scheer ordered another 180 ° turn which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet , which had altered course itself to the south . This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer 's T and they badly damaged his leading ships . Scheer ordered yet another 180 ° turn at 7 : 13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap in which he had sent them . 
 This was successful and the British lost sight of the Germans until 8 : 05 when Castor spotted smoke bearing west @-@ northwest . Ten minutes later she 'd closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and engaged them . Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only 8 @,@ 500 yards ( 7 @,@ 800 m ) away . Inflexible opened fire at 8 : 20 , followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty 's battlecruisers . New Zealand and Indomitable concentrated their fire on Seydlitz and hit her five times before she turned west to disengage . Shortly after 8 : 30 the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve 's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them . The Germans only were able to fire a few rounds at them due to the poor visibility and turned away to the west . The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 8 : 40 . After this Beatty changed course to south @-@ southeast and maintained that course , ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet , until 2 : 55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course .

 Australia rejoined the 2nd BCS on 9 June 1916 as the squadron flagship , but there was little significant naval activity for the Indefatigables , other than routine patrolling , thanks to the Kaiser 's order that his ships should not be allowed to go to sea unless assured of victory . Australia collided with Repulse on 12 December 1917 and was under repair through the following month . She was present at the internment of the High Seas fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 . New Zealand was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919 for Admiral Jellicoe 's year @-@ long tour of India and the Dominions and she was paid off upon her return on 15 March 1920 into reserve . She was sold for scrap on 19 December 1922 . Australia sailed for Australia on 23 April 1921 and became flagship of the Royal Australian Navy upon her arrival . Pursuant to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty she was scuttled east of Sydney on 12 April 1924 . 
 = Erik Chisholm = 
 Erik William Chisholm ( 4 January 1904 – 8 June 1965 ) was a Scottish composer , pianist , organist and conductor often known as " Scotland 's forgotten composer " . According to his biographer , Chisholm " was the first composer to absorb Celtic idioms into his music in form as well as content , his achievement paralleling that of Bartók in its depth of understanding and its daring " , which led to his nickname of " <unk> " . He was also a founder of the Celtic Ballet and , together with Margaret Morris , created the first full @-@ length Scottish ballet , The Forsaken Mermaid . He was also the dean and director of the South African College of Music at the University of Cape Town for 19 years . Chisholm founded the South African College of Music opera company in Cape Town and was a vital force in bringing new operas to Scotland , England and South Africa . By the time of his death in 1965 , he had composed over a hundred works . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Erik Chisholm was the son of John Chisholm , master house painter , and his wife , Elizabeth <unk> Macleod . He left Queen 's Park School at the early age of 13 due to ill @-@ health but showed a talent for music composition and some of his pieces were published during his childhood . He had piano lessons with Philip Halstead at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama , and later studied the organ under Herbert Walton , the organist at Glasgow Cathedral . By the time he was 12 he was giving organ recitals including an important one in Kingston upon Hull . The pianist Leff <unk> then became his principal teacher and mentor . In 1927 he travelled to Nova Scotia , Canada , where he was appointed the organist and choirmaster at the Westminster Presbyterian Church , New Glasgow , and director of music at Pictou Academy . 
 A year later he returned to Scotland and became the organist at Barony Church ; however , as he had no School Leaving Certificate , he could not study at a university . Due to the influence of his future wife , Diana Brodie , he approached several influential music friends for letters of support for an exemption to enter university . In 1928 , he was accepted to study music at the University of Edinburgh , under his friend and mentor , the renowned musicologist Sir Donald Tovey . Chisholm graduated with a Bachelor of Music in 1931 and a Doctor of Music in 1934 . While at university , he had formed the Scottish Ballet Society in 1928 and the Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music in 1929 with fellow composers Francis George Scott and Pat Shannon . In 1930 to 1934 he also worked as a music critic for the Glasgow Weekly Herald and the Scottish Daily Express . 
 = = Scottish career and World War II = = 
 After his education , Chisholm 's work was described as " daring and original " , according to Sir Hugh Roberton , while also displaying a strong Scottish character in works such as his Piano Concerto No. 1 , subtitled Pibroch ( 1930 ) , the <unk> Suite for Orchestra ( 1933 ) and the Sonata An <unk> Dearg ( 1939 ) . In 1933 he was the soloist at the première of his Pibroch Concerto in Amsterdam . He also played the Scottish premieres of Bartók 's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Rachmaninoff 's Piano Concerto No. 3 . From 1930 he was the musical director of the Glasgow Grand Opera Society which performed in the city 's Theatre Royal , conducting the British premières of Mozart 's Idomeneo in 1934 and Berlioz 's Les Troyens and Béatrice et Bénédict in 1935 and 1936 , respectively . He was also the founding conductor of both the Barony Opera Society , the Scottish Ballet Society , the Professional Organists ' Association , and in 1938 he was appointed music director of the Celtic Ballet . As director he composed four works in collaboration with Margaret Morris , the most famous being The Forsaken Mermaid ; the first full @-@ length Scottish ballet . Chisholm had many friends in the music world , including composers like Bartók , Hindemith , Delius , Bax , Medtner , Szymanowski , Ireland and Bush , and invited many of them to Scotland to perform their works . 
 At the outbreak of World War II , Chisholm , a conscientious objector , was declared unfit for military service on the basis of poor eyesight and a crooked arm . During the war he conducted performances with the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1940 , and later joined the Entertainments National Service Association as a colonel touring Italy with the Anglo @-@ Polish Ballet in 1943 and served as musical director to the South East Asia Command between 1943 and 1945 . He first formed a multi @-@ racial orchestra in India , however after arguments with his superior , Col. Jack Hawkins , he was removed to Singapore . Here in 1945 he founded the Singapore Symphony Orchestra . Many of the musicians were ex @-@ prisoners of War , and from them Chisholm recruited Szymon Goldberg as leader . Goldberg had successfully hidden his Stradivarius violin up a chimney in the prison camp for three and a half years . Chisholm created a truly cosmopolitan orchestra of fifteen nationalities from East and West , which gave 50 concerts in Malaya within six months . After returning to Scotland , Chisholm married his second wife , Lillias , the daughter of Scottish composer Francis George Scott . In 1946 he was appointed professor of music at the University of Cape Town and director of the South African College of Music . 
 = = South African career = = 
 Chisholm 's obituary in The Edinburgh Tatler recalled that " the three highlights of his life were in hearing at age seven Beethoven 's Moonlight Sonata played by Frederic Lamond on a piano roll ; becoming acquainted with the music of India and lastly being offered the chair of music at Cape Town University in 1947 . " 
 That year , Chisholm revived the South African College of Music where he eventually would teach composer <unk> <unk> and singer Désirée Talbot . Using Edinburgh University as his model , Chisholm appointed new staff , extended the number of courses , and introduced new degrees and diplomas . In order to encourage budding South African musicians he founded the South African National Music Press in 1948 . With the assistance of the Italian baritone Gregorio <unk> , Chisholm also established the college 's opera company in 1951 and opera school in 1954 . In addition , Chisholm founded the South African section of the International Society for Contemporary Music ( <unk> ) in 1948 , assisted in the founding of the <unk> Open @-@ Air Theatre on 1 December 1950 , and pursued an international conducting career . 
 The South African College of Music 's opera company became a national success and toured Zambia and the United Kingdom . In the winter of 1956 , Chisholm 's ambitious festival of South African Music and Musicians achieved popular success in London with a programme of Wigmore Hall concerts and the London première at the Rudolf Steiner Theatre of Bartók 's opera Bluebeard 's Castle . The company also performed Menotti 's The Consul as well as Chisholm 's own opera The Inland Woman , based on a drama by Irish author Mary Lavin . In 1952 Szymon Goldberg premièred his violin concerto at the Van Riebeeck Music Festival in Cape Town . His opera trilogy Murder in Three Keys enjoyed a six @-@ week season in New York in 1954 , and two years later he was invited to Moscow to conduct the Moscow State Orchestra in his second piano concerto The Hindustani . In 1961 , his company premièred South African composer John Joubert 's first opera , Silas <unk> . 
 Chisholm did not support the South African policy of apartheid and had socialist leanings . Chisholm convinced Ronald Stevenson , a fellow Scot , to perform at the University of Cape Town . During a performance of Stevenson 's Passacaglia , the programme made references to Lenin 's slogan of peace , bread and land and also in salute of the " emergent Africa " . The following day , South African police searched Chisholm 's study in a failed attempt to link him with working for the USSR . 
 = = Later years and legacy = = 
 Sir Arnold Bax called Erik Chisholm " the most progressive composer that Scotland has ever produced . " After 19 years at the South African College of Music , Dr. Chisholm composed an additional twelve operas drawing inspiration from " sources as varied as Hindustan , the Outer Hebrides , the neo @-@ classical and baroque , pibroch , astrology and literature " . 
 Chisholm died of a heart attack at age 61 and left all his music to the University of Cape Town . Although he composed over 100 works , only 17 were published , of which 14 were issued in printed score . As Scottish composers are few and the quality of his music is often good , his apologists have argued that his works should be heard more regularly . His style was called varied , eclectic , and challenging , but his music was also known to be harsh and often unattractive to audiences . Even so , a number of his works , including his pieces for piano and voice , have been revived and recorded . 
 He had a lifelong interest in Scottish music and published a collection of Celtic folk @-@ songs in 1964 . He was also interested in Czech music , and completed his book The Operas of Leoš Janáček shortly before his death . His services to Czech music were formally recognized in 1956 , when he became one of the few non @-@ Czech musicians to be awarded the Dvořák medal . The Manuscripts and Archives Library at the University of Cape Town holds the Chisholm collection of papers and manuscripts ; his published scores are in the College of Music library and many copies have now been sent to the Scottish Music Information Centre in Glasgow . In his memory , the South African College of Music offers a memorial scholarship in his name and the Scottish International Piano Competition hosts the Erik Chisholm Memorial Prize . 
 The biography of Erik Chisholm , written by John Purser with the foreword by Sir Charles Mackerras , Chasing A Restless Muse : Erik Chisholm , Scottish Modernist ( 1904 – 1965 ) , was published on 19 June 2009 . An official launch was held at the Conservatoire of Music , Birmingham City University on 22 October 2009 which was attended by his widow , his daughter Morag , two of his granddaughters and great @-@ grandsons . His widow , Lillias , married the clarinettist John Forbes . Many of his works have been released on CD , performed by pianist Murray McLachlan . 
 = = Works = = 
 Erik Chisholm wrote well over 100 works , including 35 orchestral works , 7 concertante works ( including a violin concerto and two piano concertos ) , 7 works for orchestra and voice or chorus , 54 piano works , 3 organ works , 43 songs , 8 choral part @-@ songs , 7 ballets , and 9 operas including one on Robert Burns . He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart . He arranged a string orchestra version of the Symphony for Solo Piano , Op. 39 Nos. 4 – 7 by Charles @-@ Valentin Alkan , a composer still largely unknown at that time , the original of which has been said to surpass even the Transcendental Études of Franz Liszt in scale and difficulty . 
 Pianist Murray McLachlan divided Chisholm 's works into four periods : the Early Period , the " Scottish " Period , the Neoclassical Period and the " Hindustani " Period . The " Early Period " is extremely large , beginning with teenage efforts including a Sonatina in G minor , written at 18 , and clearly showing something of the influence of John Blackwood McEwen . 
 The " Scottish " Period began in the early 1930s where all his works were tinged with a remarkable Scottish nationalistic colouring , indicating most persuasively the ambitions of the composer like contemporary Béla Bartók , to nourish his style on the music of his ancestors and countrymen . Chisholm 's Sonatine Ecossaise , 4 Elegies , Scottish Airs , and Piano Concerto no . 1 " <unk> " display a style of percussive bite and energy which made much use of dissonances , note clusters and pounding rhythms in the " Bartók manner " along with material derived from Scottish Folksong and rhythmic dance figurations . His style is so similar that Chisholm 's critics have repeatedly referred to Chisholm as " <unk> " . 
 Chisholm 's Neoclassical Period refers to several of his works which were inspired by ancient and obscure motifs from the pre @-@ Classical era . His Sonatina no . 3 , evidently based on several <unk> motifs originally written by <unk> , fuses <unk> harmonies and gentle dissonances in quintessentially pianistic textures . 
 His " Hindustani " Period reflects Chisholm 's love of the East , the occult and his friendship with Sorabji . Important examples of this period are his 2nd " Hindustani " Piano Concerto and the Six Nocturnes , Night Song of the Bards . These compositions display luscious textures , transcendental technical demands and intensity that are comparable to other piano works by Busoni , Szymanowski , Medtner , and Sorabji . 
 Chisholm 's two piano concertos have been recorded by Danny Driver .

 From Autumn to Ashes is a post @-@ hardcore band that formed on Long Island in 2000 . While the band had gone through many line @-@ up changes , the members include Francis Mark ( lead vocals , drums ) , Scott Gross ( guitars ) , Benjamin Perri ( lead vocals ) , Brian Deneeve ( guitars , backing vocals ) , Stephen Salvio ( guitars ) , Josh Newton ( bass guitar ) , Mike Pilato ( bass guitar , backing vocals ) , Rob Lauritsen ( guitars ) , Jonathan Cox ( guitars ) and Jeff Gretz ( drums , backing vocals ) , 
 Described as " melody and lushness meets brutality , " the band released their debut full @-@ length album Too Bad You 're Beautiful in 2001 . The album featured former band member Benjamin Perri on harsh vocals , with Mark providing the clean vocals and acted as drummer . 2003 saw the release of The Fiction We Live and 2005 , the release of Abandon Your Friends , the last From Autumn to Ashes album with Perri and Mark in their respective roles . After Perri 's departure shortly after Abandon Your Friends , Mark became lead vocalist and in 2007 , the band released Holding a Wolf by the Ears . On June 9 , 2008 the band announced that they had gone on " indefinite hiatus . " They insisted that the decision was amicable and the band had simply reached its natural conclusion .

 From Autumn to Ashes formed on Long Island in 2000 with Francis Mark ( drums , vocals ) , Steve Salvio ( guitar ) and Benjamin Perri ( vocals ) — Perri provided screaming vocals , while Mark sung clean vocals . Commenting on the name of their band , Scott Gross ( guitar ) said , " you are absolutely not going to get the right answer on this one because that would pretty much end the band " and that " no one is going to know the reason and we are going to keep it that way . " The term " Autumn " refers to both the season and a fictional character the band created . Mark and Gross planned to use the character in a book . For the first few months as a touring band , From Autumn to Ashes claimed to have sold half of their equipment , a car , and spent between $ 3 @,@ 000 and $ 4 @,@ 000 making demos and hand distributing them . 
 To find a record label , the band says " we pretty much just sent packages to every record label , a shit load of phone calls harassing people . " In 2001 , From Autumn to Ashes performed in Long Island with Ferret Music bands <unk> and Martyr AD , where the founder of Ferret Music , Carl Severson , attended . The following day , Severson contacted the group and they were soon signed in 2001 . The band 's debut full @-@ length album , Too Bad You 're Beautiful , was released on August 14 , 2001 . Too Bad You 're Beautiful , which was written entirety about a relationship Perri had , sold over 100 @,@ 000 records in the United States , and thus , From Autumn to Ashes became the highest selling band on Ferret Records . It had also featured vocals on the song " Short Stories With Tragic Endings " from Melanie Wills of the band One True Thing . A reviewer on Punk News stated the album had the ability to " put you to sleep like a baby 's lullaby , then smash you awake with the most gut wrenching , floor pounding hardcore this side of the Mississippi freakin ' river . " In 2000 under the music label Tribunal , the band released the Sin , Sorrow and Sadness EP on March 5 , and later took part in the Warped Tour during the summer months . In 2002 the band employed a live drummer for a number of songs so that Mark could focus on songs that he did more vocals in . 
 = = = The Fiction We Live ( 2003 – 2004 ) = = = 
 In 2003 , following speculation as to which label From Autumn to Ashes would release their next record , the band signed to Vagrant Records and enlisted Garth " <unk> " Richardson as producer . After performing on the 2003 Warped Tour , they released their second full @-@ length album , The Fiction We Live on September 9 , 2003 , which again featured vocals from Melanie Wills on the song " Autumn 's Monologue " . The album was described as more melodic in sound than Too Bad You 're Beautiful , which had a more " hardcore sound . " Perri explained that The Fiction We Live 's songs had more structure than their debut release , and was the result of the band 's time together . Aubin Paul of Punk News viewed the release as a growth from Too Bad You 're Beautiful , writing that " like their previous [ album ] , [ this one ] contains its share of PSAT words , and overtly maudlin pseudo @-@ poetry , but it 's still a big improvement " . The move to a larger label and slightly more commercialized sound allowed the band to find more mainstream success , producing three singles , " The After Dinner Payback " , " Lilacs & Lolita " and " <unk> Smile " . The song " The After Dinner Payback " also appeared on the soundtrack for the horror film Freddy vs. Jason . For the following months , the group toured the country , also playing on the 2004 Warped Tour , during which time Josh Newton ( bass ) joined , as Pilato left along with Gross .

 On March 8 , 2005 , a re @-@ release of Too Bad You 're Beautiful was issued , featuring the songs from the Sin , Sorrow , and Sadness EP . Under direction of producer Richardson , From Autumn to Ashes ' third full length album , Abandon Your Friends , was released on August 30 , 2005 . The album stemmed from the idea that " [ abandoning your friends is ] kind of ... what we do . I mean , in the sense of how life goes on when we go away [ on tours ] . " Abandon Your Friends met with speculation about the band 's internal conflicts surrounding a potential break up . Perri had not been much involved in the process of creating the album and did not attend practice sessions , despite stating in interviews that the album was " a full on collaborative effort " and " We just all had a say in what we were writing . " It was revealed in 2007 , in interviews , and when Mark posted in the band 's Myspace blog that he had ghostwritten Perri 's lyrics in a matter of days . The band had made a further move away from the melodic sound of their past albums , and had been a point where the band shifted more focus to Mark 's vocals . CMJ reviewer Tracey John explained that the album " continues to unabashedly straddle both ends of the hardcore / emo spectrum " , however , the band " doesn 't show much of a progression from 2003 's The Fiction We Live . " The album generally garnered reviews in which it was noted that , as a reviewer at Punk News explained that if you 're a " fan of From Autumn to Ashes , you 'll be disappointed . " Others disagreed , like UK magazine Kerrang ! who gave the album a 5 out of 5 review and called it a metal masterpiece . This album would also go on to sell over 100 @,@ 000 copies . Abandon Your Friends produced one single , " Where Do You Draw The Line ? " with an accompanying music video . Unhappy with <unk> politics , guitarist Jonathan Cox quit the band .

 After taking a five @-@ month hiatus at the beginning of 2006 , From Autumn to Ashes returned and played the length of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour , adding Rob Lauritsen in place of Cox . In September 2006 , the band rented practice space and began writing material for what would become Holding a Wolf by the Ears . Brian <unk> was chosen as producer because he had previously worked with Mark and Newton on their side project Biology 's album , and the members opted for this release to have a less refined feel than the last albums . As From Autumn to Ashes prepared to begin studio recording for the album , Mark noted that Perri " never came out to any of the practices and he had no involvement . But that was also the way it was when we wrote Abandon Your Friends . " Perri had then declared that he would no longer be a part of the band . As Mark explains , " I thought there was a more considerate way he could have gone about leaving the band " , but it was ultimately " cool of him to recognize that he just didn 't have the passion for the band anymore . " Deciding to move on without Perri as a member , Mark then became lead vocalist , providing both clean and screaming vocals in addition to his already recorded drums . Mark , as the band 's lyricist explained that he " work [ ed ] very hard and writing and revising very personal lyrics " and found that a part of him did not want to hand over the lyrics to another to sing , however , with Perri 's departure and when Mark began recording vocal tracks , " It immediately seemed like that ’ s the way things had been all along " . Mark stated the bulk of the album 's lyrics had been " just about living " and " the idea that extremes are dangerous . " Recorded in about a month 's time , Holding a Wolf by the Ears was named for the quotation by Thomas Jefferson , " But as it is , we have the wolf by the ear , and we can neither hold him , nor safely let him go . Justice is in one scale , and self @-@ preservation in the other . " Reviewer Drew Beringer of Absolute Punk had praised the change in the band 's line up , stating that " Mark is three times the front man Perri was " , and gave " passion that had been severely lacking while Perri was in the band . " 
 In early 2007 , the band began auditioning drummers to take Mark 's place in the upcoming tours . Initially looking for a temporary member , From Autumn to Ashes would remain a quartet if they did not get along with the drummer . However , Jeff Gretz was officially added to the line @-@ up and in March 2007 , two weeks before From Autumn to Ashes began touring . The These Speakers Don 't Always Tell the Truth EP was released on March 13 , 2007 featuring songs from the forthcoming album and a previously unreleased track . Holding a Wolf By the Ears was released on April 9 , 2007 as the last album for the band 's contract to Vagrant Records , and according to Mark , is " heavier than anything we 've ever done " and the " closest we 've come to capturing how I think this band should sound . " Reviewer Corey Apar of Allmusic noted that the band " sounds stronger than it has in awhile [ sic ] " . Music videos for " Pioneers " and " Deth Kult Social Club " were filmed , the former based on The Lottery , a short story by Shirley Jackson , and the latter , a live video shot on Long Island as the end of February 2007 . " Pioneers " was released as the first single from the album . In September 2007 , Newton left the band and From Autumn to Ashes was joined by original bassist Pilato to take on Newton 's place . 
 = = = Live at Looney Tunes and indefinite hiatus ( 2008 – 2014 ) = = = 
 In January 2008 the band performed at the Looney Tunes store in New York . A recording of this show was released on Vagrant records on June 17 , 2008 . This album was From Autumn to Ashes ' final release . A week before the live album came out , the band announced they were going to take an " indefinite hiatus . " Lead singer Francis Mark commented on the break : 
 " At this point I feel that we have accomplished everything we could have hoped for with FATA . It doesn 't feel much like a break up . Just feels like the end . It 's complete . I would say that we are going on indefinite hiatus because the term breakup suggests a more negative circumstance . There have been no quarrels between band members . It is also not a question of fan support because we are lucky to have some of the most loyal and impassioned friends a band could ask for . Thank you again for the overwhelming support of our last album . " 
 Mark and Lauritsen started the band Warship , which released one album and announced its break @-@ up on their Myspace page December 30 , 2009 . Soon after , Mark formed the band Tidal Arms with friends Tom Tierney and Patrick Southern . Deneeve and Emanuel singer Matthew Breen came together to create the band Summer Law , which was disbanded after several months so that Deneeve could focus on attending culinary academy in hopes of becoming a Master Pastry Chef . Gretz announced his return to drumming for the band Zao , and is a member of Emanuel and the Fear . 
 In the meanwhile Brian Deneeve joined the UK boyband The Wanted as one of the guitarists for their backing band . Later he formed a new band called Get Involved which consists of Tucker Rule ( Thursday ) , Derrick <unk> , Todd Weinstock ( Glassjaw ) and Marcus Russell Price . 
 = = = Reunion ( 2014 – present ) = = = 
 The band 's Twitter account tweeted for the first time on October 13 , 2014 . All the tweet contained was a picture of the band 's debut album Too Bad You 're Beautiful . No information can be found on why they did this or what it means . 
 Later on November 4 , 2014 , they posted a lyric line from the song " Kansas City 90210 " which contains " " If I wanted to make a comeback would kids receive me ? Unemployment , I 've been ruined by young hands clapping . " which supports the speculation of the band 's possible reunion . 
 On November 26 , 2014 it was announced the band would be reuniting at Amnesia Rockfest in June 2015 . More shows will be announced soon . 
 On July 7 , 2015 , vocalist Francis Mark was charged in Michigan with maintaining a drug house . In a public statement , Mark addressed the charge , saying : 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 The band 's styles included emo , screamo , post @-@ hardcore , and metalcore . 
 For his stylistic influences for playing drums , Mark references Stewart Copeland of The Police who he " always thought ... had a really good style " , Neil Peart of Rush , John Bonham of Led Zeppelin , and Keith Moon of The Who . Following the release of The Fiction We Live , then screaming vocalist Perri explained that the lyrics he was writing for the forthcoming album ( Abandon Your Friends ) would feature lyrics that were inspired by Billy Joel , stating that they were " <unk> " because " they ’ re more straightforward , not what I ’ m thinking , what I ’ m feeling , instead of poetry and shit " . However , it is unclear whether the lyrics were used on the album , as was revealed by Mark in 2007 , that Perri had not contributed to Abandon Your Friends and it was Mark who had ghostwritten the lyrics . 
 From Autumn to Ashes also combines genres as Mark has said , The combinations of genres allows them to tour with a variety of bands with different styles . They are able to " go on tour with Taking Back Sunday one month and go on tour with Shadows Fall the next month . "

 = The Ritz Hotel , London = 
 The Ritz , London is a Grade II listed 5 @-@ star hotel located in Piccadilly in London , England . A symbol of high society and luxury , the hotel is one of the world 's most prestigious and best known hotels . It is a member of the international consortium , The Leading Hotels of the World . 
 The hotel was opened by Swiss hotelier César Ritz in May 1906 , eight years after he established the Hôtel Ritz Paris . After a weak beginning , the hotel began to gain popularity towards the end of World War I , and became popular with politicians , socialites , writers and actors of the day in particular . David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at the Ritz during the latter half of the war , and it was at the Ritz that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey . Noël Coward was a notable diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s . 
 Owned by the Bracewell @-@ Smith family for a period until 1976 , The Ellerman Group of Companies purchased the hotel for £ 80 million from Trafalgar House in October 1995 . They spent eight years and £ 40 million restoring it to its former grandeur . In 2002 , it became the first hotel to receive a Royal warrant from HRH the Prince of Wales for its banquet and catering services . 
 The exterior is both structurally and visually Franco @-@ American in style with little trace of English architecture , and is heavily influenced by the architectural traditions of Paris . The facade on the Piccadilly side is roughly 231 feet ( 70 m ) , 115 feet ( 35 m ) on the Arlington Street side , and 87 feet ( 27 m ) on the Green Park side . At the corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions , the emblem of the hotel . The Ritz has 111 rooms and 23 suites . 
 The Ritz Club , owned by London Clubs since 1998 , is a casino in the basement of the hotel , occupying the space which was formerly the Ritz Bar and Grill . It offers roulette , black jack , baccarat , and poker , as well as some slot machines . 
 The interior was designed mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style , which is consistent throughout . Author Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground @-@ floor rooms as " one of the all @-@ time masterpieces of hotel architecture " and compares it to a royal palace with its " grand vistas , lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers " . 
 The Ritz 's most widely known facility is the Palm Court , which hosts the famous " Tea at the Ritz " . It is an opulently decorated cream @-@ colored Louis XVI setting , with panelled mirrors in gilt bronze frames . The hotel has six private dining rooms , the Marie Antoinette Suite , with its <unk> , and the rooms within the Grade II * listed William Kent House . The Rivoli Bar , built in the Art Deco style , was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy , to resemble the bar on the Orient Express .

 = = = Construction and early history = = = 
 Swiss hotelier César Ritz , the former manager of the Savoy Hotel , opened the hotel on 24 May 1906 . It was built on the site which had been the Old White Horse Cellar , which by 1805 was one of the best known coaching inns in England . The financial backers of the Ritz felt that they had secured one of the prime sites in London for their project . They began negotiations in 1901 , and completed the transactions for the simultaneous purchase of the leasehold for the Walsingham House Hotel and the adjacent freehold estate of the Bath Hotel for £ 250 @,@ 000 in 1902 . Demolition of both of the hotels began in 1904 . 
 The building is neoclassical in the Louis XVI manner , built during the Belle Époque to resemble a stylish Parisian block of flats , over arcades that consciously evoked the Rue de Rivoli . Its architects were Charles Mewès , who had previously designed Ritz 's Hôtel Ritz Paris , and Arthur Davis , with engineering collaboration by the Swedish engineer Sven Bylander . It was one of the earliest substantial steel frame structures in London , the Savoy Hotel extension of 1903 @-@ 04 being the first in the capital . Many of the materials used in the construction of the hotel were US @-@ made . The initial fees for suites ranged from 1 1 / 2 guineas to 3 1 / 2 guineas . 
 After opening , a long @-@ running feud between the hotel and Lord Wimbourne , a steel magnate who lived next door at Wimbourne House , lasted for years in a dispute over land . A number of locals were also concerned about the building and the impact it would have on their health . 
 While the Ritz was still under construction , a series of events highlighted the need for another luxury hotel in London . A 3 June 1905 Daily Mail news story reported it was both Derby Week and the height of the tourist season , making hotel accommodation almost impossible to find . The Savoy had to refuse reservations , while Buckingham Palace turned offices into makeshift hotel rooms for visitors . An estimated 2 @,@ 500 more persons needing rooms were expected shortly with the coming visit of the King of Spain . 
 Though the opening of the Savoy had brought about a marked change in how hotels provided services to its guests , Ritz was determined that his London hotel would surpass its competitor in their delivery . The Ritz installed two large lead @-@ lined tanks on its roof to provide a steady stream of hot and cold water . The hotel 's bathrooms were all spacious with each having its own heated towel bar . Every bedroom in the hotel was provided with its own working fireplace . 
 Ritz shunned free @-@ standing wardrobes due to his fear of dust settling on them ; instead he built cupboards into the rooms with doors matching the panelling . Ritz 's ideas of cleanliness and hygiene prompted him to originally have all bedrooms painted in white and all beds made of brass , not wood , for the same reasons . Anything new or potentially useful was available to the guests of the Ritz . 
 César Ritz 's health had declined after his 1902 collapse at the Carlton , but he was feeling well enough to assume an active role in the plans for the hotel 's opening dinner on 24 May 1906 . Unlike the opening of the Paris Ritz , which had catered to society , most of those invited to the Ritz , London opening were members of the national and international press . Major British newspapers such as the Daily Mail , the Daily Mirror and The Daily Telegraph were invited to the dinner along with newspapers which included the Berliner Tageblatt , The Sydney Morning Herald and The New York Times . Ritz 's guest list also included the engineer and architects of the structure along with key staff members of the new hotel and their wives . 
 The hotel was not immensely profitable in its opening years ; smaller than many of the new hotels springing up in that period , it was not fashionable initially , and was resented by many of the London elite who considered it vulgar . It took £ <unk> in 1908 , over a thousand pounds less than the previous year , and the hotel lost over £ 50 @,@ 000 between 15 May 1906 and 31 July 1908 , which led to the replacement of Elles with manager with Theodore <unk> and appointment of Charles Van <unk> as manager of the restaurant . 
 The hotel also suffered a blow upon the death of King Edward in 1910 , when 38 planned dinners and functions were cancelled , but began to prosper the following year , made fashionable by the Prince of Wales who regularly dined here . King Edward was particularly fond of the cakes made at the Ritz . The hotel would regularly send him a supply , but this was kept in confidence as the King 's chef may not have wanted it known that food he did not prepare was served at Buckingham Palace . Ritz retained control of much of the hotel 's operation for many years . He hired world @-@ famous chef Auguste Escoffier to provide cuisine to match the opulence of the hotel 's decorations ; he placed a special bell in the entryway by which the doorman could notify the staff of the impending arrival of royalty . By 1929 the hotel was still being praised for its architecture ; Professor Charles Reilly wrote about the Ritz in Building magazine in 1929 , calling it the " finest modern structure " in the street , with " an elegance of general form " . 
 = = = High society = = = 
 On 4 August 1914 , Lady Diana 's future husband , Duff Cooper , then a Foreign Office official , dined at the Ritz with the Earl of Essex and his American wife , Adele Capell ( née Grant ) and Patrick Shaw @-@ Stewart , and later that day announced that World War I had broken out to the party . Before the war began , the German and Austrian embassies both retained tables at the Ritz Restaurant . The hotel suffered during the war , and lost nearly £ 50 @,@ 000 in 1915 alone ; the ballroom was usually empty and lights went out by 10pm , but rooms were still in demand and the hoteliers believed it to be worth keeping open . <unk> such as Lady Cynthia Asquith , daughter @-@ in @-@ law of H. H. Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood were documented in her diaries to have dined at the Ritz in the spring of 1916 . The following year , she held a lavish dinner party with the likes of Osbert Sitwell , Gilbert Russell and Maud <unk> and Clare Tennant . 
 In September 1917 , a shell exploded in Green Park in close proximity to the Ritz , and according to Lord Ivor Churchill it broke all of the windows to adjacent Wimbourne House . David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at the Ritz during the latter half of the war , organised by Sir Basil Zaharoff , and it was at the Ritz that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey . The Duke of Marlborough recorded dining at the Ritz ; " I lunched at the Ritz . The whole social world goes there , prices being cheap . All women there from M. Paget to the latest tart . " 
 When asked to summarise hotels in London in the early 1920s , Barbara Cartland remarked that " The Ritz stood for stuffiness and standards , the Carlton was for businessman , the Savoy was rather fast , some other ones were frankly scandalous , and the Berkeley , where you could dance all night for ten shillings , was for the young " . In 1921 , <unk> , the manager of the Ritz , died , and was replaced with J.S. Walters . Walter was a " tireless salesman " in promoting the hotel , especially in mainland Europe , and flaunted the hotel in the Tatler at a time when it was unpopular to do so . Louis Mountbatten , 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma frequented the Ritz from his time as a Sub @-@ Lieutenant onwards , and when his friend Charlie Chaplin arrived in London in September 1921 after a nine @-@ year absence , great crowds gathered at Waterloo station and Chaplin had to be ushered to the hotel by some 40 policemen . He stayed in the first @-@ floor Regal Suite and was photographed throwing carnations to his fans from the Arlington Street balcony . 
 The Ritz became popular with film stars and executives when staying in London , although the hotel has kept most of the names of many of its luminaries a secret in its records . Douglas Fairbanks was known though to frequent the Ritz in the 1920s , and director Alexander Korda 's talent scout held a table at the Ritz in the 1930s . Noël Coward , also a regular diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s , met with Michael Arlen in the restaurant in 1924 to discuss the urgent problem of generating the funding for his new play , The Vortex . Arlen gave Coward a cheque for $ 250 without question , and The Vortex would go on to be his first major success . Coward 's song , " Children of the Ritz " , which featured in the 1932 revue Words and Music was penned while Coward was lunching in the Ritz with Beverley Nichols . Numerous authors began to meet at the Ritz during the same period , and it began to creep into literature itself . In Michael Arlen 's 1922 novel Piracy , the hotel was described as a " very stout and solid building in the manner of the old Bastille , originally conceived no doubt with a fearful eye on class prejudice " , and R. Firbank had a running gag in his novels about there being " fleas in the Ritz " . Later , the hotel appears in Anthony Powell 's A Dance to the Music of Time . The narrator Nicholas Jenkins meets poet Mark Members at the Ritz , and the golden nymph in the Palm Court of the hotel is mentioned . 
 " It had a special atmosphere about it and the Palm Court was always filled before luncheon with ' society beauties ' , debutantes and their boyfriends , and famous actors and actresses — though the latter seldom seemed to actually lunch there . <unk> American ladies used to parade up and down the corridor awaiting their guests , The Ritz was more like a club than a hotel ; you were bound to see your friends there . To ' meet at the Ritz ' was the obvious choice . It had the combination of elegance and <unk> . The Ritz had an essentially happy atmosphere which radiated from the staff . All the waiters knew everybody and became personal friends . The Ritz in those days had a courtesy and elegance unlike any other hotels ; it was thought of as ' home ' in a sense that never applied to anywhere else " . — Sir Michael Duff , 3rd Baronet on life at the Ritz as a young man in the 1930s . 
 William Brownlow , 3rd Baron Lurgan , who succeeded Harry Higgins as chairman of the Ritz upon his death in 1928 , was especially keen on attracting American guests to the hotel . He was a close friend of the Earl of <unk> and his American wife Catherine Wendell , and at times the couple were freely given the entire second floor of the hotel to accommodate guests . Upon the death of Lord Lurgan in 1937 , <unk> was told that he had to begin paying for his staying at the hotel , but was given a " slight reduction for old time 's sake " . Carnarvon later remarked : " The Ritz has been my London home for over fifty years . I 'm very fond of the place . Nobody knows it better " . In 1931 , the Aga Khan was involved with organising the Round Table Conference at the hotel , which was attended by Mahatma Gandhi and many others . On one occasion Khan took over the Palm Court to hold a meeting with his followers . 
 In the 1930s , <unk> became the restaurant manager of the Ritz , a " popular and much @-@ mimicked character " according to Montgomery @-@ Massingberd and Watkin . The future Edward VIII and his associates were often seen at the Ritz in the 1930s . In 1932 the Evening Standard observed the Prince performing on the dance floor : " The Prince of Wales never misses an opportunity to raise the stand of his dancing ... He danced three <unk> each of which lasted about thirty @-@ five minutes ! " In 1934 , Edward 's brother , the Duke of Kent , married Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark at the Ritz and scaffolding was put up in the garden for the celebration . The Queen Mother would also attend private parties at the Ritz during this period , as did King Boris of Bulgaria and Queen Marie of Romania . At one point , the Ritz hosted four reigning monarchs simultaneously : King Boris , King Farouk of Egypt , Spain 's King Alfonso and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands . After the romance of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson became public knowledge , both parties could be found at separate tables near the restaurant 's door , in case a speedy exit was necessary . 
 The Ritz suffered from the effects of the General Strike of 1926 , subsequently seeing competition from the likes of the Dorchester Hotel and Grosvenor House . The Great Depression brought a sharp decline in business to the hotel , and in the summer of 1931 staff wages were reduced — the chefs , kitchen workers and the directors had a 25 % cut in their wages . To increase earnings , in 1935 Fred Cavendish @-@ Bentinck recommended that the hotel commence putting on a Cabaret show . Advertised in the Evening Standard , the programme was an immediate success . In January 1936 , Austrian comedian Vic Oliver was one of the entertainers hired to perform at the hotel for two weeks , and Cyril Fletcher appeared in the show for a month the following year . The BBC began broadcasting live performances from the restaurant of the hotel , with pianist Billy Milton and others . It was through the show that the Irving Berlin song " Puttin ' On the Ritz " grew in popularity , performed by Joe Kaye 's Dance Band . In 1937 , James Stephens shortly succeeded Lurgan as director of the Ritz before being replaced by Hans <unk> von <unk> , who had been on the board of the Ritz Hotel Development Company from 1910 and was also the chairman of the Paris Ritz .

 During World War II , the Ritz became integral to political and social life among the elite , and a number of eminent royals , aristocrats and politicians moved into the hotel . Camilla Russell , the wife of writer Christopher Sykes , stated that the Ritz " enjoyed a tremendous vogue during the war and was , even more than ever , much used as a meeting place " , and at night was " crowded yet somehow safe " . Angela , Countess of Antrim , <unk> 's sister , remarked that the Ritz was the ideal meeting place for " gathering news of husbands at the wars " . Emerald Cunard took up residence in the Ritz for a period , but later moved to the Dorchester . In the summer of 1940 , the Albanian royal family , including King Zog I , Queen Geraldine , Crown Prince Leka , the King 's six sisters , two nieces , three nephews and others moved into the hotel and were given their own floor , escorted by Chamberlain , the Albanian diplomats from Paris , and numerous bodyguards . Zog brought the royal gold and jewels with him , which were kept in the storeroom of the Ritz before being deposited in the Bank of England . 
 Due to Zog 's concerns about safety during air raids , the ladies ' cloakroom was converted into a private shelter for the Albanians . Following an air raid , when a bomb fell between the Ritz and the Berkeley in Piccadilly , shattering glass in the Ritz , most of the Albanian royal family moved to Chelsea , but Zog remained until the spring of 1941 until he was offered Lord <unk> 's house in Buckinghamshire . In total , the Ritz was damaged nine times during bombing raids , and the Restaurant had to be closed twice . 
 On one occasion during a royal broadcast from the Ritz to the United States , Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands , Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg , King Haakon of Norway and King Christian of Denmark were all staying at the Ritz at the same time . Edvard Beneš would entertain guests at a private luncheon at the hotel several times a week during the war years . In 1942 , Winston Churchill , Dwight Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle met in the Marie Antoinette suite of the hotel to discuss operations , Brendan Bracken , who served as an observer and mouthpiece on political society in London , and Anglo @-@ American politician Ronald Tree spent much time at the Ritz , and Tree lived there during the winter of 1940 . Laura Long , who would later become Laura Spencer @-@ Churchill , Duchess of Marlborough , the second wife of John Spencer @-@ Churchill , 10th Duke of Marlborough , the architectural writer James Lees @-@ Milne , Harold Acton and writer Norman Douglas were regular diners at the Ritz during wartime . 
 According to Alastair Forbes and Felix Hope @-@ Nicholson , during World War II , the basement bar at the Ritz was reserved for gay and lesbian guests , while the one upstairs was for heterosexual guests . Hope Nicholson described it as " notoriously queer " , and stated that " the Ritz bar became too chic , too popular and above all , too queer for the authorities " . Evan Morgan , 2nd Viscount Tredegar , MP Harold Nicolson , Brian Howard , and Pauline Tennant were all regulars at the basement bar .

 The hotel was owned for some thirty years by the Bracewell @-@ Smith family , who also had significant stakes in the nearby Park Lane Hotel . Although the family were quick to earn a profit from the hotel , there was a turbulent period in the years after World War II , with a workers strike in 1946 , and the restaurant attracting significant criticism in its quality of cuisine . On one occasion , a group of patrons of the Ritz , known as the " Friends of the Ritz " , met with Sir Bracewell Smith in Park Lane Hotel to complain about the standards ; Smith himself dined at the Ritz and informed them that it was quite satisfactory . 
 Several suicides also darkened the reputation of the Ritz in the postwar years , including that of horse trainer Peter Beatty from the sixth floor window in October 1949 , and that of French gangster Baron Pierre de <unk> , who strangled love interest Eileen Hill to death in his second floor room in March 1953 when she refused to marry him , before killing himself by stuffing a silk sock down his throat . 
 Nonetheless the Ritz continued to be a social hub for the aristocracy and attract the world 's elite in the 1950s . It was very popular with the wealthy family of Agar Khan , and oil magnate J. Paul Getty , reputedly the richest man in the world at the time , lived at the Ritz after the war . On one occasion a photographer working for Time and Life magazines staged an incident outside the hotel by arranging for the <unk> to pour coppers onto the pavement as Getty emerged from the hotel and photographed just as he went to pick them up . Shell Oil heiress Olga <unk> lived at hotel for several years , and in one altercation with her lover she threw his trousers out of the window . In 1956 she tired of the high life and spent a period working on Albert Schweitzer 's leper colony in French Equatorial Africa . Film stars Rita Hayworth and Tallulah Bankhead were regular guests at the hotel ; Hayworth was married to Prince Aly Khan between 1949 and 1953 . Another notable resident of the Ritz during this period was Nubar Gulbenkian , an " expansive extrovert " who kept a permanent suite at the Ritz and made exorbitant demands for luxuries and foods , even if out of season . 
 In January 1959 , Patrice Lumumba , the Prime Minister of Congo , stayed at the hotel and met with Sir Edward <unk> , the Ghanaian High Commissioner in London and others in the restaurant . The event was picketed by <unk> , who in concern with human rights issues in Congo at the time , demonstrated outside of the hotel , displaying banners such as " <unk> OF <unk> – GO HOME " and issuing racial epithets . <unk> was attacked as he left the hotel , although it has been speculated that he was mistaken for Lumumba . 
 George Criticos served as head porter of the Ritz for 45 years , retiring in 1960 for health reasons ; he had been recommended for a job at the Ritz by Sir Basil Zaharoff . In his 1959 book , George of the Ritz , Criticos remembered some of the notable people and events during his years of service . Criticos once acted as an agent to the Aga Kahn at the racetrack , having been given US $ 45 @,@ 000 by the monarch to place bets in his name . He was also asked to take the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Prince Aly Khan on a month long tour of the United States to help the young man forget a failed romance . When Criticos saw an unshaven man in coveralls entering the hotel , he called out to the man to stop him . When the man turned to face Criticos , he recognised him as King Boris of Bulgaria , who was a railroad buff and was returning from driving a special train . 
 = = = Later history = = = 
 The social scene changed dramatically in London in the 1960s , with Beatlemania and the sexual revolution , and British aristocracy in the capital was not what it had been . By this time the general impeccable standards of the Ritz had fallen . Peregrine Worsthorne noted the change : " Precisely that it was not all <unk> , in the sense of being conspicuously luxurious ... the glitter had long since faded and <unk> set in . The place was usually empty , kept alive by memories of former glories and a clientele who preferred nostalgia to comfort " . Yet celebrities often held parties at the hotel , and the Rolling Stones were guests for many years . British Prime Ministers Harold Wilson , Edward Heath and Harold MacMillan often lunched at the Ritz ; Heath would always reserve table 29 in the restaurant . 
 In the 1970s , the hotel fell into a turbulent period . Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern , and bomb scares were not uncommon . The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell @-@ Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £ <unk> At the time of the sale , the hotel 's occupancy rate was just 45 percent ; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times . In 1984 , the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s . Because of demand , the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only , as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table . Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel . Proper attire for tea is a must ; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie . 
 The Barclay twins of The Ellerman Group of Companies purchased the hotel for £ 80 million from Trafalgar House , in October 1995 , through their company Ellerman Investments . They spent eight years and £ 40 million restoring it to its former grandeur . Two years after the death of Princess Diana , the Prince and Camilla Parker @-@ Bowles made their first public appearance together at the Ritz , as they left a birthday party for Parker @-@ Bowles ' sister . The couple returned to the hotel in November 2002 for the Prince 's birthday party attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh . In 2002 , the Ritz became the first hotel to receive the Royal Warrant from his Royal Highness The Prince of Wales for banqueting and catering services . 
 The Ritz acquired the adjoining Wimbourne House in 2005 . On 27 January 2007 , around 300 people were evacuated to the nearby May Fair Hotel following a fire alarm in the hotel . No one was hurt in the blaze , which started in the basement casino kitchen 's extraction vents . The Ritz casino only suffered " minor damage " . Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was convalescing at the Ritz when she died following a stroke on 8 April 2013 . 
 There has been criticism because the Ritz has not paid any corporation tax since being taken over by the Barclay twins . The accounts indicate that the profitable hotel uses a series of tax reliefs to reduce its corporation tax to zero . Sir David 's son , Aidan has stated that the company abides by UK law . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Authors Montgomery @-@ Massingberd and Watkin describe the Ritz as " the product of one of those near miraculous convergences of civilised patron and architects and craftsmen of genius working together in complete harmony both with each other and with the social and architectural fashions of the day . The building has been regarded as a masterpiece from the day it was finished ... " Both of the architects , Charles Mewès and Arthur J. Davis , were educated at the prestigious École des Beaux @-@ Arts in Paris , and the education which they received is clear in the design of the buildings , particularly the Renaissance influence , delivering " an authentic fabric of traditional French classicism " . Mewès had previously designed the Hotel Ritz of Paris for Cesar in 1897 @-@ 8 , after which he met Arthur Davis , and began working together preparing designs for the Grand Petit Palais in the Paris Exhibition of 1900 . Both architects worked on the plans for the London Ritz in 1904 @-@ 5 . 
 According to Montgomery @-@ Massingberd and Watkin the exterior is both structurally and visually Franco @-@ American in influence with little trace of English architecture . For them the exterior " represents an evocative confluence of various Parisian architectural traditions " ; the Piccadilly arcade echoes the arcaded ground floor in the Place <unk> and the Rue de Rivoli , the steep <unk> skyline on the Green Park facade echoes Hector Lefuel 's work on the Pavillon de Flore of the Louvre , while the tall windows and wall panels of the facades resemble those of Mewès 's earlier work on a smaller building made as a home for Jules Ferry on Rue Bayard . 
 Excavation for the hotel began by contractors Waring White Building Co . Ltd in June 1904 , and it was completed by 1 October 1905 , and opened the following May . The building progress was documented each month by The Builder 's Journal and Architectural Engineer , and in one edition noted the difficulties of some of the aspects of construction such as hoisting 20 @-@ ton 39 feet ( 12 m ) steel joists in a narrow building site . The Architect and Contract Reporter noted that the limited space did not allow for the storage of materials on site . All mortar had to be mixed in the basement and the stone was dressed " on a platform with a watertight roof over the footway " . The red @-@ brick foundations of the earlier Walsingham House had to be blasted away to facilitate the foundations of the steel structure in concrete . 
 The total estimated cost was £ 345 @,@ 227 . 8s . 1d . , with £ 102 @,@ 000 going to Messrs Waring and Gillow , £ 49 @,@ 000 to French decorators and over £ 15 @,@ 000 to the English decorators . John P. Bishop and the Swedish @-@ born Sven Bylander were consultant engineers during the building phase . 
 The facade on the Piccadilly side is roughly 231 feet ( 70 m ) , 115 feet ( 35 m ) on the Arlington Street side , and 87 feet ( 27 m ) on the Green Park side . The irregularity of the site presented initial problems for the builders . Davis dealt with this by " brilliant perspective effects " according to Binney , using curving walls to " cleverly conceal the rapidly diminishing space at the back of the hotel " . The purpose of the arcaded front was to provide more space for the bedrooms above . Expensive Norwegian granite is the material on ground floor , with Portland stone above it . 
 The steel frame of the building was made in Germany and is based on a model made in the early 1880s in Chicago to increase fire resistance . It was erected by Messrs Potts & Co. of Oxford Street . Fireproofing of the walls were conducted by the Columbian Fireproofing Company Ltd. of Pittsburgh and London , with steel @-@ ribbed bars allowing for ventilation , while remaining sound proof and free from vibration . The internal walls consist of " hollow , porous , terra @-@ cotta blocks " covered with plaster , and the hotel 's flooring was also made fireproof . At the corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions , the emblem of the hotel . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The hotel was designed mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style , which is consistent throughout , giving the hotel its " special atmosphere of perfect appropriateness and elegant restraint " . Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground @-@ floor rooms as " one of the all @-@ time masterpieces of hotel architecture " and compares it to a royal palace with its " grand vistas , lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers " . Waring & Gallow were responsible for many of the fine design work of the interiors The ground floor plan dated to 1906 illustrated a large main restaurant overlooking the terrace and garden , a large central Grand Gallery and Winter Garden , a circular vestibule beyond the reception room , the Marie Antoinette Suite near the restaurant , and numerous shops . The Grill Room had its own entrance on the right side of the entrance doors on Piccadilly , with a staircase leading down . The Grill Room was on the eastern side , and the Banqueting Hall lay at the western end , beneath the restaurant . Today this is home to the Ritz Club . A wide vaulted corridor , the Long Gallery , runs from the Arlington Street entrance on the east side to the restaurant on the west side , with finely woven <unk> carpets . Along it are several intricate horseshoe archways . A triangular @-@ shaped staircase features in the building 's southwest corner . The curving main staircase was built to allow women to make a " dramatic entrance and show off their gowns to best effect " . 
 = = = = The Palm Court = = = = 
 The Ritz 's most widely known facility is the Palm Court , an opulently decorated cream @-@ coloured Louis XVI setting . It is decorated with lavish furnishings , including gilded Louis XVI armchairs with oval backs , which the architects had designed based on research into French neo @-@ classical furniture design of the 1760s and 1770s , which were made by Waring and Gillow . The room , with its , " panelled mirrors of bevelled glass in gilt bronze frames and " high coving ornamented with gilded trellis @-@ work " , according to Montgomery @-@ Massingberd and Watkin " epitomizes the elegantly frivolous comfort of Edwardian high life " . 
 There were originally large windows at either end of the court , then known as the Winter Garden , and were replaced with twenty panels of mirrors after 1972 . The fountain of the court , known as " La Source " , is made of <unk> marble and is extravagantly sculpted . A nymph , gold in colour , is featured in a lair . A wrought @-@ iron and glass roof of the Palm Court contains two gilded wrought @-@ iron lanterns , and the ceiling contains lion skin motifs . The room is done in soft apricot and has remained so since 1906 . César Ritz chose the colour to flatter the complexions of women after weeks of experimentation with various hues . 
 The Palm Court is the setting for the world @-@ famous institution that is " Tea at the Ritz " , once frequented by King Edward VII , Sir Winston Churchill , Noël Edmonds , Judy Garland , Evelyn Waugh and Queen Elizabeth , the Queen Mother . It acquired its reputation as " the place for tea " in London after World War I. In the 1920s a small orchestra would play regularly on the court ; film producer John Sutro for instance recalled that Hermione Baddeley once requested the violinist to " play something hot " . Between the Winter Garden and the central Grand Gallery is a screen featuring two Ionic columns . 
 = = = = Dining = = = = 
 The hotel has six private dining rooms , the Marie Antoinette Suite , with its <unk> , and the rooms within the Grade II * listed William Kent House . Marcus Binney states that the restaurant is " not only one of the most beautiful interiors in London , it can be claimed as the most beautiful restaurant in the world " . 
 César Ritz once commented that the room was so heavily designed in bronze that it was fortunate that the hotel was built from steel , or the " walls would collapse with the weight of all that bronze " . Flanking the entrance to the main restaurant are two life @-@ sized figures set in " bronze vert after <unk> , holding gilded bronze <unk> with six lights each , mounted on pedestals of polished <unk> marble ornamented with bronze " . The restaurant and adjacent guest room were designed by P. H. Remon and Sons of Paris . The ceiling is a described by Montgomery @-@ Massingberd and Watkin as a " painted trompe @-@ l 'oeil ceiling on which pinkish clouds drift across the blue sky encircled by a garlanded balustrade " . Bronze chandeliers are also a feature , influenced by an 18th @-@ century Augustin de Saint @-@ Aubin engraving known as Le Bal Pare et Masque , and Le Festin by Moreau le Jeune , which was given by the City of Paris to the King and Queen on 21 January 1782 . 
 On the northern end against the Piccadilly arcade are floor @-@ to @-@ ceiling mirrors , divided into panes , which give the room a spacious effect , especially when the lights are on all day during the winter . At the south end of the restaurant is a watercolour by Davis and gilded figures known as " The Thames and the Ocean " , with a buffet made from Norwegian pink marble below it , believed to be inspired by Louis Seize 's " Buffet of Mansart " . 
 During the 1977 major renovation of the hotel , the scaffolding used in the project was hidden by a clean cloth during mealtimes in the Louis XVI restaurant so as not to upset diners with a possibly disturbing sight . During the renovation , the columns in the hotel 's lobbies were stripped of many coats of cream @-@ coloured paint to display their original pink marble . Most of the work done in the renovation was done to restore and clean while keeping the original 1906 colour scheme . Much of the furniture from the original opening was still in use ; new items were faithful copies styled after the originals . The hotel retained its <unk> call buttons for maid , waiter , valet and servant , refusing to make its patrons dial a telephone for services . 
 From its inception , the kitchen was run mainly by French chefs , and it had a specialist in Russian soups and Viennese pastry ; it cakes became so famous that King Edward made regular orders from Buckingham Palace . M. Malley , who had been saucier at the Paris Ritz was appointed Chef des Cuisines , and invented dishes such as <unk> Marquise de <unk> ( Salmon with a crayfish mousse ) , <unk> de Sole Romanoff ( served with mussels , small slices of apple and artichokes ) , and Poulet en <unk> ( chicken accompanied by a curry @-@ flavoured pinkish mousse ) at the hotel . The Ritz is renowned for its supreme catering service , as well as using its fine rooms for conferencing between executives and directors of multi @-@ national firms . A table at the restaurant still needs to be booked weeks in advance . The Rivoli Bar , built in the Art Deco style , was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy , to look like a bar on the Orient Express . The lounge was decorated by Marcel Boulanger in the Louis <unk> style , the <unk> was by <unk> and Morant , who were influenced by the Palladian design of Cumberland House in Brettingham , and other rooms were decorated with clear William Chambers and Robert Adam influences . Meals can be served on Nanking china in the Trafalgar Suite . The banquet and catering services received a Royal warrant from HRH the Prince of Wales in 2005 . 
 = = = = Marie Antoinette Suite = = = = 
 The Marie Antoinette Suite is accessed from the main restaurant . According to Marcus Binney " the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze , even the egg @-@ and @-@ dart in the boldly modelled cornice " . Floral motifs are a common feature of the room , given the namesake , Marie Antoinette , and represents the flowers at one of her feasts . Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers , with " flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes " . In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer , with " drum @-@ shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt @-@ bronze flowers and ribbons " . The ventilation grilles , of considerable size , are decorated in bronzed lattice . On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres , with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out . The lights , according to Binney , are hung on " cords from ribbons tied in bows , entwined at intervals with flowers , descending to a cluster of tassels " . The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames , with inner and outer mouldings , in contrast to the window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by " clusters of reeds , with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding " , according to Binney . 
 = = = = Rooms and suites = = = = 
 As of 2015 , The Ritz London has 134 guestrooms , of which 111 are bedrooms and 23 are suites . The main bedrooms are divided into three principal categories : Superior Queen / King / Twin , Executive King / Twin and Deluxe King / Twin . The Superior Queen and King rooms are 215 square feet ( 20 @.@ 0 m2 ) and 260 square feet ( 24 m2 ) in size respectively , while the Executive and Deluxe king rooms are 320 square feet ( 30 m2 ) and 385 square feet ( 35 @.@ 8 m2 ) The suites are divided into the categories : Junior Suite , Superior Suite , Executive Suite , Deluxe Suite , the Trafalgar Suite and the Berkeley Suite , and also include the signature suites the Royal Suite and the Prince of Wales Suite , each with their own unique style . The Executive Suites typically face south , and are 320 square feet ( 30 m2 ) in size , with a small lounge area and antique furniture . The Junior Suites , with " fireplaces , gilded mouldings and antique furniture " are above Piccadilly , and are 495 square feet ( 46 @.@ 0 m2 ) in size , while the 3 @-@ 5 bedroom suites range in size from 1 @,@ 990 square feet ( 185 m2 ) to 2 @,@ 802 square feet ( 260 @.@ 3 m2 ) .

It also accommodates three of the Ritz ' top suites : The Arlington Suite , the Royal Suite as well as the Prince of Wales Suite . Several of the rooms have Louis XVI chimneypieces . The Grade II building was carefully restored and given a modern touch with period <unk> concealing things like flat screen televisions . The restoration won a Royal Institute of British Architects national gold medal in 2007 . 
 = = = The Ritz Club = = = 
 The Ritz Club is a casino in the basement of the hotel , occupying the space which was formerly the Ritz Bar and Grill . In the original structure , this was where the Ritz ballroom was located . A May 1906 edition of Truth magazine described the basement with the Grill Room and Banqueting Hall as palatial , ivory @-@ white in decor , with " mirrors on all the walls reflecting an endless intersection of arched ceilings " . The rooms were used for dinners , balls and theatrical shows , with a stage at the south end of the Banqueting Hall . By the mid 1920s the Grill Room had been relocated into the Banqueting Hall , and furnished with circular tables with oval back wicker chairs . One 1926 brochure stated that it was the scene of " some of the finest private and public balls ever given in London " . 
 During World War II it became known as the nightclub La <unk> . The interior of the club was made to simulate a combat dugout complete with sandbags . The club 's chandeliers were made out of various types of empty liquor bottles with candles in their necks for light . The dance floor was crowded during wartime , but it later declined in popularity . Laurie Ross was in charge of the Ritz Bar and Grill for many years . The bar , known to its regulars as " Laurie 's Bar " , closed when Ross retired in 1976 . By the 1970s the basement rooms were closed to the public . 
 In 1977 , Trafalgar House agreed to lease the basement to Mecca Sportsman and Pleasurama , and the Ritz Club was opened the following year , under separate management from the hotel . The basement was restored in the hotel 's Louis XVI style of 1906 , and the decorations included 6 @,@ 000 sheets of gold leaf . Gold leaf was not spared on moldings , cupids and garlands and a blue sky with fluffy clouds painted on the ceiling above the gaming tables . The restoration consisted of repainting , cleaning and recovering all in the original color scheme . Furniture was restored to its original state and replicas replaced what could not be restored . Stephen <unk> was appointed Head Chef , after being recruited from the exclusive club and restaurant Annabel ’ s . When it opened , the Ritz Club was open to members and hotel guests only . However , unlike most casinos , it charges a fee to enter . The games are considered " high stakes " in that the minimum bet is usually very high . They offer roulette , black jack , baccarat , and poker , as well as some slot machines . 
 In 1998 , the club was purchased by London Clubs , who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James 's Street to the basement of the Ritz . A new company was formed in June 1998 , the Ritz Hotel Casino Ltd . , which was granted legal permission to open a casino . After very quick refurbishment , it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership , although members are permitted to invite a guest . As of 2006 the Ritz Club was divided into four main areas — the restaurant , bar , lounge and the private gaming room , situated in the former Banqueting Hall . In July 2014 , London High Court heard a case against the club , in which Nora Al @-@ Daher claimed she was ' taken advantage ' of and asked for £ 2 million in losses .

 Evelyn Waugh 's 1942 novel Work Suspended features a scene at the Ritz in which the narrator falls in love with a friend 's wife during a luncheon . Alan Bennett 's allegorical play , Forty Years On was later set in the basement of the Ritz during the war . In the universe of the book Good Omens , two primary characters , the angel <unk> and the demon Crowley , often frequent the Ritz . The hotel is mentioned in the song " A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square " as well as in Queen 's " Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy " . Large portions of the 1999 romantic comedy Notting Hill were filmed in and around the hotel . 
 = Maneater ( Nelly Furtado song ) = 
 " Maneater " is a song by Canadian singer Nelly Furtado from her third studio album Loose ( 2006 ) . The song was written by Furtado , Tim " Timbaland " Mosley , Nate " Danja " Hills , and Jim Beanz , and released to mainstream radio in the United States in September 2006 . The song 's musical style and production were inspired by pop arrangements from the 1980s by bands such as Eurythmics and Hall & Oates . Furtado stated that Hall & Oates ' song of the same name was an influence during the writing and recording of the song . 
 The song received positive reviews from music critics , most of them comparing the song to Madonna and Depeche Mode songs from the 1980s . Outside North America , " Maneater " became one of Furtado 's most popular singles , topping the charts in the United Kingdom and peaking within the top ten of the charts across much of Europe and Australia . It became a club hit in North America but was less commercially successful than the lead single " Promiscuous " . 
 The accompanying music video was filmed by American director Anthony Mandler in Los Angeles . The video premiered on Yahoo ! Music on 6 September , and was given a " First Look " on MTV 's Total Request Live on 8 September . The song was included on the setlist for Furtado 's third tour Get Loose Tour .

 " Maneater " was one of the first songs Furtado and Timbaland worked on in the Hit Factory Criteria recording studios in Miami , Florida . She has described the song as an analogy of how she incorporated the " creative energy " of Timbaland and his production crew into Loose . When making the album , Furtado and Timbaland were influenced by the work of musicians from the 1980s such as Talking Heads , Blondie , Madonna , The Police and Eurythmics . " Eurythmics had this spooky , keyboard @-@ driven pop sound " , Furtado said . Final production of the track was delayed after a speaker caught fire in the studio control room . 
 Furtado has characterized " Maneater " as " a ' couture pop ' song " , explaining that it is " in your face and very fashionable , stylistic and of @-@ the @-@ moment . " In an interview with MTV News , she compared it favorably to eating too much cheesecake : " It 's got a crazy loud beat , and the vocals are bitchy and loud . A lot of people say it sounds like Peaches , because of the delivery , the spooky vocals . " According to Furtado , the song is related to how people become " hot on themselves " when dancing in their underwear in front of a mirror . " [ It ] truly has a life of its own ; it makes you move " , she said . Media sources compared it to the 1982 Hall & Oates single " Maneater " , which Furtado has cited as an influence on the song . 
 Furtado recorded a remix of " Maneater " with rapper Lil Wayne , which was featured in a Timbaland 's compilation album Remix & Soundtrack Collection . The instrumental of this version was also used during many television performances of " Maneater " . In Australia , the CD was released in two formats , although one version ( the international single ) had an extremely limited run and was not widely available . The Australia @-@ exclusive " Maneater " CD single includes a cover of Gnarls Barkley 's " Crazy " recorded on BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge program , on which " Maneater " was covered three times , by pop punk band Panic at the Disco , dance music duo Basement Jaxx and rock band Boy Kill Boy , whose cover was released on the album Radio 1 's Live Lounge .

 " Maneater " has earned acclaim from music critics . Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone stated that while not a Hall & Oates cover , the song " bumps hard enough to qualify as a sequel , and that 's high praise indeed . " Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited " Maneater " as a highlight of Furtado 's makeover , but believed that no matter how much Furtado sings about sex , she does not sound sexy and does not " generate much carnal heat . " 
 About.com 's Bill Lamb gave the song 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars , praising the " powerful thumping beat and insanely catchy chorus " , but considering the song repetitive and more suitable for the dance floor than radio stations . IGN 's review considered it too similar to British singer M.I.A. : " the blatant attempt to capitalize on [ M.I.A. ] that ultimately causes the track to crumble .

 = = Music video = = 
 The official music video was directed by Anthony Mandler . The video features former So You Think You Can Dance contestant <unk> McGee as a dancer . Furtado had to schedule extra practicing sessions for her own dancing in the video . 
 The video does not have a substantial plot and , per Furtado 's request , focuses on simultaneously celebrating and parodying the " maneater cliché " . It begins with Furtado searching for her runaway Great Dane , Toby , at night in a seemingly deserted industrial district of an unnamed city . She follows the dog to the basement of a dark , dilapidated building , where she encounters a silent crowd of people in the middle of what MTV News described as a " Fight Club @-@ esque party " . Furtado positions herself in the middle of the crowd and , as the initial beat of the song emerges , begins to dance with " a sense of abandon " , according to Furtado . This serves as the catalyst for a dance party that continues as the song plays . Towards the end of the video , Furtado moves to the roof of the building and dances in front of the rising sun . In the end she leaves the party at dawn , finding her dog sitting at the <unk> near the exit . " I like to walk on the dangerous side of life " , Furtado said of the filming of the video . 
 In the U.S. , the video premiered on Yahoo ! Music on 6 September and was given a " First Look " on MTV 's Total Request Live on 8 September . It debuted on the show 's top ten video countdown on 11 September and peaked at number nine , remaining on the countdown for three consecutive days . The video entered the MuchMusic Countdown in Canada in the week ending 22 September , and it peaked at number one in the week ending 8 December . At the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards , Furtado was nominated in the category of Female Artist of the Year for " Maneater " and " Say It Right " .

 = County Road 510 ( Marquette County , Michigan ) = 
 County Road 510 ( CR 510 , Co . Rd . 510 ) is a primary county road in Marquette County , Michigan , that connects Marquette with the community of Big Bay . The road runs through rural forests as a paved and dirt road in northern Marquette County . It crosses the Dead River near the Hoist and McClure dams and runs for 26 @.@ 103 miles ( 42 @.@ 009 km ) before terminating at an intersection with CR 550 south of Big Bay . 
 The road was originally part of the State Trunkline Highway System as M @-@ 35 . In 1919 , the highway was to run through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette County . A bridge was moved from rural Pennsylvania in 1921 to carry the road over the Dead River . The Huron Mountain Club opposed the highway , and with the aid of Henry Ford , the road 's construction was stopped during the 1920s , leaving a gap in the routing through the mountains . In 1939 , the state transferred control of M @-@ 35 to local authorities , and the Marquette County Road Commission ( MCRC ) designated it CR 510 . Since that time , the bridge over the Dead River has survived a flood in 2003 , and it was bypassed in 2010 by a new section of road with another bridge over the river . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Starting at an intersection with CR 502 ( Midway Drive ) in Negaunee Township , CR 510 runs northwesterly through the forest as paved road toward the Dead River . The road curves westward near the McClure Storage Basin , a reservoir formed by the McClure Dam on the river . CR 510 follows the course of the basin on cliffs above it and then turns northward to cross the river . The bridge crosses the river 100 feet ( 30 m ) above the water on a bridge opened in late 2010 . North of the river , the road turns westerly again to approach the northern shore of the Hoist Basin , which is another reservoir on the river . The roadway continues northwesterly as a dirt and gravel road through rural northern Marquette County . The landscape is all woods with some small lakes . The road meanders through the landscape , intersecting several secondary county roads and logging trails . In Powell Township , CR 510 intersects the eastern end of Co . Rd . AAA , the Triple A Road , which connects westerly across the county line on the Yellow Dog Plains . North of this intersection , the county road turns to the east at the intersection with Blind 35 . About three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) after this intersection , CR 510 terminates at its intersection with CR 550 south of Big Bay .

 = = = Background = = = 
 In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) designated a scenic shoreline trunkline to run north from Negaunee to Skanee and L 'Anse by way of Big Bay . The highway would continue from the L 'Anse and Baraga area to eventually end at Ontonagon at an intersection with M @-@ 64 . Local Upper Peninsula historian Fred Rydholm summarized the routing planned in 1925 as extending " ... in a northwesterly direction , across the Dead River , over the Panorama Hills , then west past the Elm Creek swamp , along the south side of Burnt Mountain , across the Cedar Creek , the Cliff Stream and out past Cliff Lake to Skanee and L 'Anse " . This highway was designated as an extension of M @-@ 35 , which ended in downtown Negaunee . Work was completed on a significant portion of the route in Marquette County by 1926 . M @-@ 35 was routed east along M @-@ 15 toward Marquette before turning north @-@ northwesterly toward Big Bay . This section of roadway follows the modern CR 510 in Marquette County . Similar work was completed in Baraga County connecting L 'Anse and Skanee by 1932 . 
 Construction on the two ends left the center portion through the Huron Mountains unfinished and shown on state maps as a dashed line marked " impassable " . The section not included in CR 510 , with guard rails and cement culverts has been called " Blind 35 " since . 
 One of the first tasks for the MSHD was bridging the Dead River in Negaunee Township , three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of US 41 . The state solved the problem by buying a bridge in Pennsylvania , where bridges of this design were more common . MDOT describes the bridge as : 
 ... a rare Pennsylvania through truss highway bridge , particularly because of the length [ 271 feet ( 83 m ) ] of this single span . It was purchased by the State Highway Department in 1919 , moved from an unspecified Allegheny River site , probably considerably upstream from Pittsburgh , and then erected on this site in 1921 . 
 The structure has been known as the Steel Bridge to local residents since it was reassembled over the Dead River . 
 = = = Henry Ford = = = 
 Records of the Huron Mountain Club , an exclusive private organization with large land holdings in northern Michigan , show that Henry Ford visited the Upper Peninsula many times , including at least once with Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison on Ford 's yacht , Sialia . Many of these trips involved research to keep his operations supplied . His UP land provided wood for the manufacture of Ford automobiles such as the Model T , which required 250 board feet ( 0 @.@ 59 m3 ) of lumber per car . Ford , who was considering becoming the " owner – producer – handler " of the resources he needed , invested in sawmills in Alberta and Kingsford . He also bought the entire town of <unk> , along the shores of the Keweenaw Bay . The town belonged to Dan Hebard , who also sold Ford a sawmill , tugboats , a 14 @-@ room bungalow , and land near the Huron Mountain Club . Hebard retired to spend his summers at a cabin on the Pine River on land belonging to the Club . 
 Ford built a hydroelectric dam along the Menominee River to supply power to the Kingsford mill , bought the Imperial Mine , and opened the Blueberry Mine near Ishpeming to supply iron ore . The Ford Railroad was constructed between L 'Anse and the Cliff River for his logging operations on 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 100 @,@ 000 ha ) of timberland purchased in 1922 . He often visited the Upper Peninsula on business , but as early as 1917 , the year he ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate , he sought entry into the Huron Mountain Club . Since the club limited its membership , Ford worked to improve his chances . His admission would ultimately come when M @-@ 35 construction was halted in the Huron Mountains . 
 Hunters , campers , hikers , fishermen and some landowners opposed highway construction near the Huron Mountains . Rydholm said , " ... there seemed to be no groundswell of sentiment in favor of it , but it looked as the though the die was cast and nothing could be done to stop it " . The Huron Mountain Club members opposed the highway because it would open vast reaches of the back country and might harm the wilderness . Highway construction would also open the possibility of a resort hotel . William C. Weber , a real estate developer from Detroit , owned property along Mountain Lake , in northern Marquette County . A Michigan attorney general 's opinion provided a way for blocking the road if two @-@ thirds of the property over which the road would pass was owned by people opposed to the project . The proposed highway was to cross two 40 @-@ acre ( 16 ha ) parcels of Huron Mountain Club property , but that was not enough to halt construction . 
 In 1926 , Hebard was elected the new president at the Huron Mountain Club and changed its rules for admission . Before the changes , all existing members voted on new admissions , and four " no " votes meant rejection . After Hebard 's changes , only club directors could vote , and only one " no " was needed to block election . In 1927 , the road grading for M @-@ 35 had reached the Salmon Trout River . That same year , Ford bought more land near Mountain Lake . This property encompassed more than the requisite two @-@ thirds necessary to stop construction of the road . In 1928 , the road was moved to connect with the Big Bay Road ( CR 550 ) , leaving the stub of " Blind 35 " behind . According to club records , " by 1929 , M @-@ 35 was dead in its tracks and Henry Ford was a member " . To commemorate his membership , Ford built a white pine log cabin on club property that cost between $ 80 @,@ 000 and $ 100 @,@ 000 in 1929 ( equivalent to $ 5 @.@ 2 million to $ 6 @.@ 5 million in 2015 ) . 
 = = = After Ford = = = 
 In 1939 , M @-@ 35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L 'Anse was officially canceled as a state trunkline highway . Constructed portions were turned over to local control , becoming CR 510 in Marquette County . 
 The Steel Bridge is still in place over the Dead River and previously carried CR 510 as the successor to M @-@ 35 in northern Marquette County . It survived a May 15 , 2003 , flood caused by the breaching of the Silver Lake Dam . The Marquette County Road Commission had announced plans in 2006 to bypass the structure with a modern replacement , leaving the existing bridge as a footpath or bike path . Construction on the bypass road and replacement bridge began in October 2007 . The concrete work for the replacement span was started in late 2009 , with an original projected completion date of November 1 , 2010 . The new crossing is 100 feet ( 30 m ) above river level compared to the 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) for the 1921 span . The total budget for bridge construction was $ 4 @.@ 5 million and an additional $ 1 @.@ 7 million for the approach work , with an 80 @-@ percent federal , 15 @-@ percent state and 5 @-@ percent county funding split . The new bridge opened to traffic in September 2010 , diverting traffic from the Steel Bridge . Completion of the new span came after about a decade of planning .

 = Blue Picardy Spaniel = 
 The Blue Picardy Spaniel ( or <unk> Bleu de Picardie ) is a breed of Spaniel originating in France , from the area around the mouth of the River Somme , around the start of the 20th century . It is descended from Picardy Spaniels and English Setters , and is described as a quiet breed that requires much exercise due to its stamina . It is especially good with children . Similar to the Picardy Spaniel , it has a distinctive coloured coat . Recognised by only a handful of kennel associations , the breed is predominantly known in France and Canada . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = Appearance = = = 
 A Blue Picardy Spaniel on average is around 22 – 24 inches ( 56 – 61 cm ) high at the withers and weighs 43 – 45 pounds ( 20 – 20 kg ) . Its coat is speckled grey black forming a bluish shade , with some black patches . The coat is flat or a little wavy with feathering on the ears , legs , underside and tail . It has long legs with some setter characteristics . 
 It has a long broad nose and muzzle , with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around the tip of the muzzle . Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows . Both the forequarters and the hindquarters are well muscled . Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight . 
 The breed has many similarities with the Picardy Spaniel due to the two breeds ' recent history . The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer , as well as the obvious difference in coat color . The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat , which was brought into the breed by the introduction of English Setter blood . Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards . In addition , the Blue Picardy is a little faster , and has a slightly finer nose . 
 = = = Temperament = = = 
 It is a versatile hunting dog , used for its ability to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions . It is not specialised to any one type of terrain , and tends to score well in field trials . The Blue Picardy is considered to be a quiet breed , but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina . It loves to play , and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship . It is especially good with children . 
 = = Health = = 
 The breed has no known genetic health issues . Blue Picardy Spaniels can be prone to ear infections , which are common among dogs with pendulous ears , including Basset Hounds and other breeds of Spaniel . It has an average life expectancy of thirteen years . 
 = = History = = 
 The first French Spaniel is speculated to have appeared following the Crusades of the 11th century , and it was these breeds of dogs that were described in Gaston III of Foix @-@ Béarn 's 14th @-@ century work Livre de Chasse . Following the French Revolution the commoners in France were allowed to raise and keep their own hunting dogs . This in turn meant that the pre @-@ existing French Spaniel split into several types specific to their own regions , which were classified according to physical appearance and hunting abilities . 
 At the turn of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was considered a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl . Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom , British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area , near the mouth of the Somme . This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel . 
 While the first black , blue @-@ grey Spaniel was recorded in 1875 , it was not until 1904 when the Picardy Spaniel was first shown . This Spaniel was officially classified as a French Spaniel , and was shown at the Paris Canine Exposition . When the Picard Spaniel and Blue Picardy Spaniel Club was formed in 1907 the two different breeds of Picardy Spaniel were categorised . 
 In France , the Blue Picardy was recognised as a separate breed in 1938 , and there are about 1000 puppies born in France each year . The first person to import the Blue Picardy Spaniel into Canada was Ronald Meunier of Saint @-@ Julien , Quebec , around 1987 , and the breed was then recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club effective 1 June 1995 . The breed is recognised by the American Rare Breed Association , which uses the same standard as the Fédération Cynologique Internationale . 
 = Manhunt ( video game ) = 
 Manhunt is a stealth @-@ based survival horror video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games . It was originally released for the PlayStation 2 on November 18 , 2003 , and for Microsoft Windows and Xbox on April 20 , 2004 . The game was also re @-@ released through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in 2013 and 2016 , respectively . Players control James Earl Cash ( voiced by Stephen <unk> ) , a death row prisoner forced to participate in a series of snuff films for an underground director , former film producer Lionel Starkweather ( Brian Cox ) . 
 The game received positive reviews by critics , with particular praise directed at its dark tone and violent nature . The game also received great controversy , due to the level of graphic violence in the game . It was banned in several countries , and implicated in a murder by the UK media , although this implication was later rejected by the police and courts . The game won several accolades , and spawned the sequel Manhunt 2 in 2007 . As of March 2008 , the series has collectively sold 1 @.@ 7 million copies . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Manhunt is a stealth @-@ based psychological horror game played from a third @-@ person perspective . The game consists of twenty levels , called " scenes " , as well as four unlockable bonus scenes . Players survive the scenes by dispatching enemy gang members , occasionally with firearms , but primarily by stealthily executing them . At the end of each scene , players are graded based on their performance , and awarded one to five stars . Unlockable content becomes available only when the player achieves three or more stars on a certain number of levels . On normal difficulty ( called " Fetish " ) , players can earn only four stars ; one is awarded for completing the scene under a certain amount of time , and one to three stars are awarded based on the brutality of the executions carried out during the scene . On hard difficulty ( called " Hardcore " ) , players are graded out of five stars ; one for speed , one to three for brutality and one for simply completing the scene . To gain the maximum number of stars , a set number of brutal executions must be carried out over the course of each scene ; face @-@ to @-@ face fighting does not award stars . 
 In order to carry out executions , players must approach a hunter from behind , undetected . To facilitate this , each scene is full of " dark spots " ( shadows where the player can hide ) . Enemies cannot see into the shadows ( unless they see the player actually entering the area ) . A standard technique in the game is to hide in the shadows and tap a wall to attract the attention of a nearby hunter . When the hunter has examined the area and is moving away , players can emerge from the shadows behind them , and execute them . The game has three levels of execution , with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last : " hasty " executions are quick and not very bloody , " violent " are considerably more gory , and " gruesome " are over @-@ the @-@ top blood @-@ soaked murders . Players are entirely in control of which level they use ; once players have locked onto an enemy , the lock @-@ on reticule changes color over time to indicate the three levels : white , yellow and red . 
 Over the course of the game , players can use a wide variety of weapons , including plastic bags , baseball bats , crowbars and a variety of bladed items . Later in the game , firearms become available ( which cannot be used for executions ) . Should players take damage , their health depletes ; health can be restored through the use of painkillers , which are available throughout each scene . Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint , but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary . Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2 's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game . When such a device is connected , players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in @-@ game enemies . This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game , as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 2003 in <unk> City , the story opens with a news anchor ( Kate Miller ) reporting on James Earl Cash ( Stephen <unk> ) , a death row prisoner recently executed by a lethal injection . In reality however , Cash awakens to hear a voice coming from an earpiece , revealing his lethal injection was only a sedative . The voice , who refers to himself as " The Director " , promises Cash his freedom , but only if Cash follows his instructions . He must move through an abandoned section of the city being patrolled by a gang called " The Hoods " , murdering them as he goes , all being filmed by CCTV . Cash successfully dispatches the Hoods , but despite the Director 's promise of freedom , he is beaten and thrown into the back of a van by a group of private security experts called " The Cerberus " . 
 Cash is then told by the Director that he reneged on their original deal and that he has more to do before the night is out . Cash is subsequently taken to various locations around the city and forced to face off against a series of increasingly dangerous gangs . First , he is pitted against a group of white nationalists and Neo @-@ Nazis in a scrap yard . Then , he faces a gang of a former military turned mercenaries called " The Wardogs " in an abandoned zoo . Here Cash has to save members of his own family who have been kidnapped by the Wardogs and are being used as bait to lure him out . Following this , he fights a gang of Satanic Latino occultists and perverted pedophiles called " The <unk> " in a derelict shopping center . 
 During this conflict , Cash discovers that the Director had his family killed despite his promise to let them go . After watching their deaths on a TV set up for him by the Director , Cash vows revenge as the Director coldly tells him " I 'm all the family you need , now . " After again facing the <unk> in a graveyard and abandoned factory , Cash is forced to face off , in what is supposed to be the final scene of the film , against a gang of schizophrenic , sociopaths called " The <unk> " who have taken over an insane asylum . Here , Cash unexpectedly survives , killing the <unk> ( including their leader dressed in a rabbit costume ) and escaping the asylum after killing several Cerberus . As such , the Director deploys the remaining Wardogs , led by the vicious Ramirez ( Chris McKinney ) , to hunt Cash down and kill him ; from this point on , the Director no longer communicates to Cash . 
 As Cash escapes the asylum and enters an abandoned apartment complex , he is caught by Ramirez and the Wardogs , who decide to play a little game of cat and mouse ; Cash manages to kill the gang and Ramirez before backup arrives . Upon fleeing the area , the journalist reporting on Cash suddenly arrives in her car and rescues him . She explains that the Director is actually Lionel Starkweather , a former film producer from Los Santos , who was popular in the 90s , but was forced to leave the industry due to a " scandal . " The reporter has been putting together evidence about Starkweather 's snuff movies for months , and now she has enough to expose him . First , however , she needs to retrieve some of this evidence from her apartment . Meanwhile , Starkweather orders the chief of the <unk> City Police Department , Gary Schaffer , to bring both Cash and the journalist to him , blackmailing him that he will expose his corruption to the Liberty City Supreme Court if he does not comply . 
 Protecting her from the police , Cash takes the journalist safely to her apartment , and from there , heads off to deal with Starkweather personally . Killing off several police officers , Cash then evades the SWAT teams , before making his way through a train yard , only to be cornered by more police and SWAT . They begin to beat him , and just as they 're about to execute him , they are suddenly ambushed and killed by the Cerberus , who recapture Cash and bring him to Starkweather 's mansion . There , they are about to kill Cash , but Piggsy - a mentally disturbed , chainsaw @-@ wielding psychopath , who wears a pig 's head as a mask and was normally kept chained up in Starkweather 's attic - breaks free . This distraction allows Cash to work his way through the garden and mansion , killing members of the Cerberus along the way . He finally reaches the upper levels of the mansion , where he and Piggsy stalk one another . Cash triumphs after luring Piggsy onto a grate that collapses under his weight . After using Piggsy 's chainsaw to hack his way through the last of the Cerberus , Cash finally confronts Starkweather in his office . Upon disemboweling him with the chainsaw , Starkweather pleads with Cash to spare him by saying " Cash , I made you ! " , but Cash thrusts the chainsaw into his face , killing and impaling him . 
 Later , the media and the police arrive at the mansion , with the journalist exposing Starkweather 's snuff ring and police complicity , and Schaffer is arrested for corruption and brought on trial in Liberty City for his actions . Cash , however , is nowhere to be found .

 Rockstar North began development of Manhunt in the mid @-@ early nineties , building the game with the RenderWare engine that had been used for the Grand Theft Auto titles . In September 2003 , GamesMaster published a preview of Manhunt , commenting " [ Rockstar North has ] scraped its imagination to further twist the way games are made in the future and delivers a chiseled , no @-@ apologies assault on gaming standards . [ ... ] it possesses a warped subtlety that questions game reality ... It creates a barren , harsh , violent experience and then punctures it with something trippy and darkly comic ... " 
 Many more news outlets , including magazines and websites such as GameSpy , GameSpot and IGN , all previewed Manhunt from late 2003 to early 2004 , when the game was released on Microsoft Windows and Xbox . Rockstar also released exclusive merchandise , limited editions and pre @-@ order bonuses such as official soundtracks , a Piggsy figure , and a handheld voice changer . During the release of the first game , a former Rockstar employee admitted that the game almost caused a mutiny in the company , saying that the team had " already weathered plenty of controversy over GTA III and Vice City — we were no strangers to it — but Manhunt felt different . With GTA , we always had the excuse that the gameplay was untethered — you never had to hurt anybody that wasn 't a " bad guy " in one of the missions . You could play completely ethically if you wanted , and the game was parody anyway , so lighten up " . The game became available through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on May 14 , 2013 , and for the PlayStation 4 on March 22 , 2016 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Manhunt received generally favorable reviews . Metacritic calculated an average score of 76 / 100 based on 47 reviews for the PlayStation 2 version , 75 / 100 based on 28 reviews for the Windows version , and 74 / 100 based on 37 reviews for the Xbox version . As of March 26 , 2008 , the Manhunt series has sold 1 @.@ 7 million copies worldwide . At the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards , the game was nominated for " Console Action Adventure Game of the Year " . In 2010 , it was included in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die , and listed at # 85 in IGN 's " Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games " . 
 The game 's dark nihilistic tone and violent nature was singled out by many critics as representing something unique in the world of video gaming . GameSpot concluded that , " like it or not , the game pushes the envelope of video game violence and shows you countless scenes of wholly uncensored , heavily stylized carnage . " Game Informer praised the game 's audacity and competent technical capabilities , stating " it 's a frightening premise that places gamers in a psychological impasse . The crimes that you commit are unspeakable , yet the gameplay that leads to these horrendous acts is so polished and fierce that it 's thrilling . " IGN complimented the game 's overall challenge , calling it a " solid , deep experience for seasoned gamers pining for some hardcore , challenging games . " <unk> listed the game at # 6 in its " Top 10 Rockstar Games " , calling it the publisher 's " most controversial game to date " while adding that " if you ’ ve got the stomach for it , the tense stealth experience is really exhilarating from start to finish . " 
 The Chicago Tribune was especially complimentary of the game , arguing that it marked a significant moment in video gaming history ; 
 Manhunt is easily the most violent game ever made . It will likely be dismissed by many as a disgusting murder simulator with no reason to exist . But Manhunt also is the Clockwork Orange of video games , holding your eyes open so as to not miss a single splatter -- asking you , is this really what you enjoy watching ? Had Manhunt been poorly made , using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick , the game would have been shameful and exploitative . What elevates it to a grotesque , chilling work of art is both presentation and game play . Manhunt is solid as a game ; it 's engaging to use stealth as you creep through the streets of this wicked city , using your smarts to avoid death , while dishing out much of your own . It 's Ubisoft 's Splinter Cell meets the cult Faces of Death videos [ ... ] If Manhunt succeeds at retail , it will say more about America 's fascination with violence than any political discourse or social debate . That makes Manhunt the most important video game of the last five years . 
 The game received some criticism . Certain gameplay elements , such as the shooting mechanics , were called " frustrating " by Eurogamer , who claimed that " more than half the time the targeting reticule refuses to acknowledge an oncoming enemy until they 're virtually in front of you . " GameSpot concurred , noting that the " AI is much worse in the more action @-@ oriented levels . " 1UP.com said that one quickly became " tired of [ the ] violence [ ... ] AI quirks [ and ] repetitive level design . " 
 = = Controversy = = 
 The controversy surrounding the game stems primarily from the graphic manner in which the player executes enemies . In 2007 , former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game 's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence ; " there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game " . Williams explained that the game " just made us all feel icky . It was all about the violence , and it was realistic violence . We all knew there was no way we could explain away that game . There was no way to rationalize it . We were crossing a line . " 
 The violence in the game drew the attention of U.S. Representative Joe Baca , who was the sponsor of a legislation to fine those who sell adult @-@ themed games to players younger than 17 . Baca said of Manhunt , " it 's telling kids how to kill someone , and it uses vicious , sadistic and cruel methods to kill . " The media was also drawn into the debate . For example , The Globe and Mail wrote " Manhunt is a venal disconnect for the genre . There 's no challenge , just assembly @-@ line , ritualistic slaughter . It 's less a video game and more a weapon of personal destruction . This is about stacking bodies . Perhaps the scariest fact of all : Manhunt is so user @-@ friendly that any sharp 12 @-@ year @-@ old could navigate through the entire game in one sitting . " 
 Toronto Star writer Ben Rayner , however , praised the relevance of the game , defending its violence and graphic nature as very much a product of its time , and condemning calls to have it banned ; 
 As entertainment and cultural artifact , Manhunt is totally disturbing . But so is the evening news , the " I 'll eat anything for money " lunacy of Fear Factor and the unfettered , misanthropic gunplay of Bad Boys II , so I will defend until my last breath Rockstar 's right to sell this stuff to me and anyone else who wants it . Do I think games such as these could have dire psychological consequences , particularly for young people ? As always , I remain agnostic on the matter . Who knows , really ? The debate will never be resolved . The American military obviously thinks there 's something there : The troubling new TV ad campaign for the U.S. reserves lures potential young soldiers with tales of adventure accompanied by blatant , video @-@ game @-@ styled animation . And , curiously , no one has complained about or tried to ban SOCOM : U.S. Navy SEALs , in which stealth and killing figure even more heavily than in Manhunt .

 The controversy surrounding Manhunt reached a peak on July 28 , 2004 , when the game was linked to the murder of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Stefan Pakeerah by his 17 @-@ year @-@ old friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire , England . Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc 's bedroom , which police had seized as evidence , and Giselle Pakeerah , the victim 's mother , stated " I think that I heard some of Warren 's friends say that he was obsessed by this game . To quote from the website that promotes it , it calls it a psychological experience , not a game , and it encourages brutal killing . If he was obsessed by it , it could well be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy . " Stefan 's father , Patrick , added " they were playing a game called Manhunt . The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out , killing people using weapons like hammers and knives . There is some connection between the game and what he has done . " Patrick continued " The object of Manhunt is not just to go out and kill people . It 's a point @-@ scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is . That explains why Stefan 's murder was as horrific as it was . If these games influence kids to go out and kill , then we do not want them in the shops . " A spokesman for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers ' Association ( <unk> ) responded to the accusations by stating " We sympathize enormously with the family and parents of Stefan Pakeerah . However , we reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of the video game Manhunt . The game in question is classified 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore should not be in the possession of a juvenile . Simply being in someone 's possession does not and should not lead to the conclusion that a game is responsible for these tragic events . " 
 During the subsequent media coverage , the game was removed from shelves by some vendors , including both UK and international branches of Game and Dixons . Rockstar responded to this move by stating , " we have always appreciated Dixons as a retail partner , and we fully respect their actions . We are naturally very surprised and disappointed that any retailer would choose to pull any game [ ... ] We reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of Manhunt . " Rockstar also reiterated that the game was intended for adults only ; " Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences , and [ it ] markets its games responsibly , targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older . " As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely , there was a " significantly increased " demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites . Giselle Pakeerah responded to this by saying " it doesn 't really come as surprise , they say no publicity is bad publicity . But I must say I 'm saddened and disappointed . The content of this game is contemptible . It 's a societal hazard and my concern is to get it off the shelves as there 's enough violence in society already . " 
 Shortly after the murder , later @-@ disbarred American attorney Jack Thompson , who has campaigned against violence in video games , claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released , warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings ; " I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody . We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games . This is not an isolated incident . These types of games are basically murder simulators . There are people being killed over here almost on a daily basis " . Soon thereafter , the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for £ 50 million in a wrongful death claim . 
 However , on the same day that Thompson was hired , the police officially denied any link between the game and the murder , citing drug @-@ related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah 's bedroom , not Leblanc 's , as originally reported in the media . According to a spokesperson for Leicestershire Constabulary , " the video game was not found in Warren LeBlanc 's room , it was found in Stefan Pakeerah 's room . Leicestershire Constabulary stands by its response that police investigations did not uncover any connections to the video game , the motive for the incident was robbery . " The presiding judge also placed sole responsibility with Leblanc in his summing up , after sentencing him to life . The <unk> ' case against Sony and Rockstar was dropped soon thereafter . 
 Three years later , in the build @-@ up to the release of Manhunt 2 , the controversy re @-@ ignited . Two days after announcing the game , which was set for release in July , Take @-@ Two Interactive ( Rockstar 's parent company ) issued a statement which read , in part : " We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence , certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004 . The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened . At sentencing the Judge , defense , prosecution and Leicester police all emphasized that Manhunt played no part in the case . " Later that day , however , Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah condemned the decision to release a sequel , and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son 's murder . Upon the announcement of the sequel , Patrick stated " I 'm very disappointed . This is rubbing salt into the wounds in the month we will be marking the anniversary of Stefan 's death . I 'm very surprised they are doing this after all that has happened and all the publicity . " Giselle added " It is an insult to my son 's memory that they have announced this game in the month we will be marking this anniversary . These game moguls are making a lot of money out of games which are morally indecent . Why do they have to pump more violence into society ? " Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the <unk> , claiming he was " astonished " that Rockstar were making a sequel ; " It is contempt for those who are trying very hard to ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games . " 
 Several weeks later , Jack Thompson vowed to have Manhunt 2 banned , claiming that the police were incorrect in asserting the game had belonged to Pakeerah , and that Take @-@ Two were lying about the incident : 
 [ I ] have been asked by individuals in the United Kingdom to help stop the distribution of Take @-@ Two / Rockstar 's <unk> video game Manhunt 2 in that country due out this summer . The game will feature stealth murder and torture . The last version allowed suffocation of victims with plastic bags . The original Manhunt was responsible for the bludgeoning death of a British youth by his friend who obsessively played the game . The killer used a hammer just as in the game he played . Take @-@ Two / Rockstar , anticipating the firestorm of criticism with the release of the murder simulator sequel , is lying to the public on both sides of the pond in stating this week that the game had nothing to do with the murder . 
 His efforts to have Manhunt 2 banned were unsuccessful . 
 = = = Legal status = = = 
 In New Zealand , the game was banned on December 11 , 2003 , with possession deemed an offence . Bill Hastings , the Chief Censor , stated " it 's a game where the only thing you do is kill everybody you see [ ... ] You have to at least acquiesce in these murders and possibly tolerate , or even move towards enjoying them , which is injurious to the public good . " The game was similarly " refused classification " in Australia on September 28 , 2004 by the Classification Review Board , despite having already been on sale for almost a year at the time with the classification of MA15 + ( restricted to ages 15 and over ) . 
 In Canada , following a meeting in Toronto on December 22 , 2003 between Hastings and officials from the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Business Services , Manhunt became the first computer game in Ontario to be classified as a film and was restricted to adults on February 3 , 2004 . Apart from Ontario , however , Manhunt had little or no classification problems elsewhere in North America . The British Columbia Film Classification Office reviewed the game after the controversy in Ontario and deemed the Mature rating by the ESRB to be appropriate . In Germany , the Amtsgericht in Munich confiscated all versions of Manhunt on July 19 , 2004 for violation of § 131 StGB ( " representation of violence " ) . According to the court , the game portrays the killing of humans as fun . They also said it glorified vigilantism , which they considered harmful . 
 = The Warning ( Eminem song ) = 
 " The Warning " is a hip hop diss song written and performed by American rapper Eminem and produced by Dr. Dre as part of an ongoing conflict with Mariah Carey . Throughout his career , Eminem claimed he once had a relationship with Carey , dating her for six months . Carey , however , always denied the claim . As a result , Eminem recorded a number of songs in which he rapped about the singer in a negative light , angered by her not admitting to seeing him . 
 Eminem 's sixth studio album Relapse ( 2009 ) features a song entitled " Bagpipes from Baghdad " , with lyrics suggesting that Eminem is still in love with Carey , and features insulting comments about the singer and her then husband Nick Cannon . After , Cannon made a post on his website , defending Carey and expressing his disgust at the rapper 's comments , Eminem responded to his comment by saying he meant well and that the song is actually " wishing the couple the best " , and later noted that he respected Cannon for his comment , expecting him to defend his wife . 
 After the release of Carey 's " Obsessed " , a song about an obsessed man who claims to be having a relationship with her , suspicions were raised by many , including Eminem himself , that it was directed at Eminem , despite claims to the contrary by Cannon . As a response , Eminem released " The Warning " , in which he claims he still has proof of the couple . Cannon responded to the song with his " I 'm a Slick Rick " , and even challenged Eminem to a boxing match for charity which never took place . Though not released as a single or as part of an album , " The Warning " appeared on three Billboard charts . 
 = = Background = = 
 From the year 2001 onwards , Eminem claimed to have dated Carey for six months throughout the gloomy times in her life . Carey denied ever having been involved with the rapper in a personal relationship , claiming that they had only met a handful of times , and it was professional . Subsequently , he referred to Carey in several of his songs in a negative light , claiming to have been angered by her not admitting to seeing him . On Charmbracelet , Carey included a song titled " Clown " , which critics suggested was aimed at Eminem . " Clown " ' s lyrics were described as " languidly sinister " by Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe , and read : " I should 've left it at ' I like your music too ' ... You should never have intimated we were lovers / When you know very well we never even touched each other . " In 2005 , during concerts on the rapper 's Anger Management Tour , he began playing voice @-@ mails and recordings that were reportedly left by Carey . One of the messages said : " I heard you were getting back with your ex @-@ wife . Why won 't you see me ? Why won 't you call me ? " . After playing the excerpt , Eminem would pretend to be sick before launching into his song " Puke " . On May 12 , 2009 , Eminem released his sixth studio album Relapse , which included the song " Bagpipes from Baghdad " . The song 's lyrics suggested Eminem was still in love with Carey and " wanted her back " : " I want another crack at ya " and " Nick Cannon better back the f * * k up . I 'm not playing , I want her back , you punk . " After the song 's release , Cannon went on his website , defending Carey and expressing his disgust at the rapper 's comments : 
 I felt sorry for him because he must really be stuck in the past . Not only has his music not evolved , but also homeboy is still obsessed with my wife , the same female that wouldn 't let him get to second base from eight years ago . What type of grown ass man lies about getting with a chick ? Only Slim <unk> ! LOL ! I ’ m putting this out there now . Marshall Mathers , you need to holler at me ... Man to man , let ’ s meet up and deal with this like adults . So , Miss Marshall , I 'm going to make you wish you never spoke my name and regret the ungodly things you said about my wife . Your legacy has now been tainted from this day forth ! You will now be known as the rapper who lost to corny @-@ ass Nick Cannon ! 
 Eminem responded to Cannon 's comments sarcastically , clarifying that the song was really " wishing the couple the best " , and that it was a misunderstanding . In an interview with BBC Radio , Eminem clarified that although contained a " harsh " line , he meant well : " There 's a line on there that was a little harsh . It 's a harsh line . But it 's like this , the way I look at it , I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it . I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start <unk> ' out on me . No pun intended . " He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment , and that he expected him to stand up for his wife : " I didn 't read his blog or anything . But it is what it is . He 's supposed to defend his wife , and I expected him to do that . But at the end of the day , it 's a line I said – it 's a song . What I actually meant to say is , I wish them the best . That 's what I meant to say . That 's the whole message of the record . " 
 After Carey premiered " Obsessed " on June 16 , 2009 , the media frenzied and began speculating the song was targeting Eminem , due to its lyrics and overall message . Following the song 's accompanying music video , which featured Carey playing a role that resembled the rapper , critics considered it Carey 's response to Eminem 's " Bagpipes from Baghdad " . Soon after both the release of the song and its video , Eminem released " The Warning " on July 30 , 2009 , which he claimed to be a retaliation . In the aftermath of the releases , Cannon was questioned regarding the inspiration of " Obsessed " , and whether it was ever directed at Eminem : 
 She 's Mariah Carey . She 's not <unk> ' , she 's a vegetarian . People keep saying [ ' Obsessed ' ] was directed at certain people . To be completely honest , she did the record ' cause she 's a huge fan of this movie Mean Girls , and there 's a line in the movie where one of the girls is like , ' Why are you so obsessed with me ? ' She says that at the beginning of the song , and that 's where the concept came from . But , you know , art imitates life . 
 = = Content and composition = = 
 Produced by Dr. Dre , " The Warning " is a mid @-@ tempo track that is almost entirely made up of soft piano keys playing in the background , a consistent drum beat , and occasional horns every few seconds . The song contains no chorus . 
 The song 's lyrics allude to his supposed relationship with Mariah Carey , the music video for " Obsessed " , and pictures and proof he claims to have of the couple . The song begins " Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me . Now I 'm pissed off , " before describing Carey 's impersonation of him in her video , " Oh gee , is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee ? / Wow Mariah , didn 't expect you to go balls out . " Eminem continues describing a near @-@ sexual encounter with the singer , threatening to release voice @-@ mails and pictures he still has in his possession . Additionally , the song features a females voice , unknown whether or not Carey 's , where she calls herself Mary Poppins , as well as several intervals of her laughter . 
 = = Response = = 
 Although Carey did not publicly respond to " The Warning " , in September 2010 Cannon responded with a song titled " I 'm a Slick Rick " , on which he attacks Eminem for his disparaging lyrics towards Carey , using a flow similar to that of English rapper Slick Rick . He also later proposed a boxing match between himself and Eminem for charity , even setting up a Facebook page to promote the idea : however , the event never took place . 
 Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone noted that Eminem " is more sharp and on @-@ point here than on some of Relapse . " Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson of Entertainment Weekly however , stated that there is only one " clever " line aimed at Cannon , and that " everything else is just so predictable coming from Em [ <unk> ] at this point .

 = Burger King legal issues = 
 The legal issues of Burger King include several legal disputes and lawsuits , as both plaintiff and defendant , of the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King ( BK ) , in the years since its founding in 1954 . Situations involving these many legal topics have affected almost every aspect of the company 's operations . Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents , the company 's responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences . The company 's response to these various issues has drawn praise , scorn , and accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years . 
 Controversies and disputes have arisen from a diverse source of group such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) over the welfare of animals , governmental and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws , and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws . These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights , corporate responsibility and ethics , as well as social justice . While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits , in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions , dealt with statutory compliance , or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties . The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public . 
 Further controversies have occurred because of the company 's involvement in the Middle East . The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli @-@ occupied territories lead to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise ; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law . The case eventually elicited reactions from the members of the 22 @-@ nation Arab League ; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King 's business licenses within the member states ' territories . A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of canon law , Shariah , regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity , and , with the former example , posed a larger question about the lengths that companies must go to insure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve . 
 A trademark dispute involving the owners of the identically named Burger King in Mattoon , Illinois led to a federal lawsuit ; the case 's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and trademark law in the United States . An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia , while another state trademark in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product , the Whopper , in several counties around San Antonio . Legal decisions from other suits have set contractual law precedents in regards to long @-@ arm statutes , the limitations of franchise agreements , and ethical business practices ; many of these decisions have helped define general business dealings that continue to shape the entire marketplace .

 = = = Animal welfare = = = 
 In 2001 , the animal rights group PETA began targeting fast food chains in the United States regarding the treatment of chickens by suppliers such as Tyson Foods . Using parodies of corporate logos and slogans , the group sought to publicly embarrass the companies into changing their corporate policies in dealing with their poultry suppliers . After winning concessions from McDonald 's with its " McCruelty " campaign , the group targeted Burger King with a six @-@ month campaign it called Murder King . The group and its supporters , with the backing of celebrities including Alec Baldwin , James Cromwell , and Richard Pryor , staged protests outside Burger King restaurants across the United States , calling on the company to establish these new compliance guidelines . On June 28 , 2001 , Burger King entered into an agreement with the group and established a contractual framework that defined procedures to ensure that its suppliers were conforming to the agreed @-@ upon standards of animal welfare . These changes , along with the company 's new vegetarian offering , the BK Veggie sandwich , drew praise from the group . 
 In 2006 , PETA went before Burger King 's board of directors during its parent company 's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more @-@ humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing ( CAK ) . Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane , the group claimed that CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal . Responding to the proposal in March 2007 , Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal @-@ welfare policies . The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter , and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens . Under the agreement , 2 % of BK 's North American egg suppliers are to use cage @-@ free @-@ produced eggs and 10 % of pork suppliers are to use crate @-@ free pigs for its pork products . PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King ’ s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole . 
 = = = Nutrition = = = 
 Since the 1980s , several parties , including the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) , the British Heart Foundation , the City of New York , and the Spanish government , have argued that Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt , fat , trans @-@ fat and calories . After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002 , the company introduced several large , over @-@ sized products including its European BK XXL line , the British Angus burger six @-@ pack , the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line . These new offerings , and others like them , have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans @-@ fats in these items . Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives . 
 A 1985 agreement with the New York city public health commissioner 's office , over publication of nutritional data regarding the food it sells , helped define guidelines used by the city for the dissemination of nutritional information . In a five @-@ month negotiation with Burger King and its then parent Grand Metropolitan PLC ( now part of Diageo ) , the company agreed to post complete nutritional information that complied with the Federal Government 's guidelines for the maximum daily recommended intake of fat and sodium . Additionally the data was to be presented in a format easy for the general public to understand and use . On the basis of this agreement , New York public health commissioner Mark Green , with support of Mayor David Dinkins , proposed legislation that would require all fast food restaurants to display nutritional data as well . 
 In response to the 2006 introduction of the BK XXL product line in Spain , the Spanish Health Ministry publicly claimed that the company had violated a voluntary agreement between the company and the Spanish Federation of Hoteliers and Restaurateurs , a group to which Burger King belongs , that called on its members to refrain from advertising large portions of food . The Minister of Health , Elena Salgado , claimed that the new promotion and the new sandwiches , averaging over 970 calories each , violated the accord . The head of Spain 's food regulatory body , Felix Lobo , stated a legal case could be made against Burger King for " illegally failing to comply with a contract " . In a response to the Government 's allegations , the European offices of Burger King released this statement : " In this campaign , we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years . Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto ' As you like it , ' in which our customers ' taste trumps all . " The company also explained that it had always worked " to reduce the risk of illness provoked by an inadequate diet and to promote a balanced ... diet . " A spokesperson for the company stated that customers have the choice of salads versus a Whopper , that they have the option to modify their sandwiches as they please , and that the company was going to continue to advertising the products . 
 In May 2007 , the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) sought a state @-@ level class action lawsuit against Burger King in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia over the inclusion of trans @-@ fats in foods served by Burger King and Burger King 's failure to set a definitive time line for their elimination from the company 's menu . The CSPI suit sought to require the company to place large heath warnings on Burger King 's food packaging that explained the dangers of trans @-@ fat and the levels of trans @-@ fat contained in its products . Burger King sought to move the case to the Federal courts and have the suit dismissed . The Federal Court denied the company 's motion for dismissal and sent the case back to the Superior Court for trial . To address the CSPI 's legal challenge , as well as several laws passed in New York City , Philadelphia and other cities regarding the issue of trans @-@ fats in its food , BK announced a plan in July 2007 to phase out all trans @-@ fats from its products by the end of 2008 . 
 In response to the issue of childhood obesity , Burger King announced in October 2007 that it was joining The Council of Better Business Bureau 's Children 's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative . The program is a voluntary self @-@ regulation program designed to modify advertising messages aimed at children so as to encourage healthier eating habits and lifestyles . As part of its participation in the program , Burger King announced a series of steps in its advertising and children 's product lines to which it was committing itself : 
 ... In addition , Burger King Corp. will : 
 Restrict advertising to children under 12 that uses third @-@ party licensed characters to Kids Meals that meet its Nutrition Guidelines 
 Refrain from advertising in elementary schools and from product placement in media primarily aimed at children under 12 
 Promote Kids Meals that meet its Nutrition Guidelines on its Web site 
 Promote healthy lifestyles and healthy dietary choices in advertising 
 The modified Kid 's Meal line will include new products , such as broiled Chicken Tenders , apple " fries " ( French cut , raw apples served in a fry box ) , and Kraft macaroni and cheese . According to the statement by the company 's corporate parent , Burger King Brands , the meals will contain no more than 560 calories per meal , with less than 30 percent of the calories derived from fat , less than 10 percent of the calories from saturated fat , no added trans fats and no more than 10 percent of calories derived from added sugars . As of August 1 , 2008 , Burger King has introduced the product line in the United States , but not the broiled Chicken Tenders product available in the United Kingdom and Ireland . 
 = = = Labor = = = 
 A protracted South Florida labor dispute between the Coalition of Immokalee Workers ( CIW ) and growers of tomatoes in the region expanded to include Burger King and other major fast food companies , including McDonald 's and Yum ! Brands . In 2001 , the CIW sought a pay raise for tomato pickers in the region and , starting with its Boot the Bell campaign aimed at Yum ! subsidiary Taco Bell , began to target the chains with protests , letter writing campaigns , and petitions demanding that the companies purchase tomatoes only from suppliers who agree to the pay increase . The campaign , which eventually attracted the support of religious groups , labor organizations , student groups and anti @-@ slavery activists , became known as the Campaign for Fair Food with a stated goal to increase the wages of the pickers by 1 ¢ per pound picked above the 45 ¢ paid per bucket at the time , or about 77 ¢ for each 32 @-@ pound ( 14 @.@ 5 kg ) bucket in 2005 US dollars . In 2005 , McDonald 's Corporation and Yum ! signed agreements acquiescing to the group 's purchasing demands , although implementation was put on hold due to threats by the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange to fine its members $ 100 @,@ 000 if they complied ; however , Burger King corporate parent Burger King Brands declined to enter into a similar agreement with the group . 
 A December 2007 QSR Magazine article about the conflict claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute . Citing internal company documents , the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might prove to be a possible violation of anti @-@ trust laws , had possible tax implications , and that there were issues with third @-@ party oversight for the agreements . As part of the company 's plan , QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement . In response , the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser , it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers ' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer . BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships ( through its Have it Your Way Foundation ) for family members of CIW workers . 
 In the release , Steven Grover , BK Vice President of Global Food Safety , Quality Assurance , and Regulatory Compliance , confirmed the factuality of the QSR report and that if the dispute between the growers and the CIW continues , the company would go forward with its plans to stop purchasing tomatoes from farms in the Immokalee region . The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference . Speaking on the dispute , Grover stated , " We ’ re being asked to do something that we have legal questions about . We want to find a way to make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage . " CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move , stating , " ... farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region , but many do not have a human rights organization , such as the CIW , to stand up for their interests . Running away from the scene of the crime , does that make you any more innocent ? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost [ s ] to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound ? " 
 In an April 2008 Senate hearing chaired by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I @-@ VT ) regarding farm conditions , Eric Schlosser , author of the best @-@ selling Fast Food Nation , commented on Burger King 's recalcitrance to sign an agreement with the CIW while Yum ! and McDonald 's had . Schlosser stated , " The admirable behavior of these two industry giants makes the behavior or Burger King ... seem completely unjustifiable . " 
 In May 2008 , several issues came to the fore that damaged the credibility of Burger King and its position on the topic . Steven Grover was found to be trolling websites that have posted pro @-@ CIW positions and opinions ; under an assumed screen name , Grover posted several comments disparaging the ethics and honesty of the leadership of the group . Besides the trolling incident , Grover was tied to several terse , stridently worded e @-@ mails sent from a possibly fictitious employee name at the BK global headquarters in Miami to supporters and media groups ; the company labeled these communications as unsanctioned and not reflecting official corporate positions . Additionally , Burger King was found to have hired an outside security company , Pembroke Pines , Florida based Diplomatic Tactical Services , to infiltrate the CIW and its supporting groups and spy on their members . After these issues came to light , BK terminated Grover and company spokesman Keva Silversmith , as well as its relationship with Diplomatic Tactical Services . Critics of the personnel action , such as PR Watch editor Sheldon Rampton , noted that it appeared that the two terminated employees were being made scapegoats by the company . Rampton went on to note that Silversmith had been , up to a few weeks before the story came to light , employed by the PR firm Edelman , which had been contracted by company parent Burger King Brands to provide PR services ; Edelman has employed tactics on the behalf of its other clients , Wal @-@ Mart and Microsoft , which Rampton and his organization termed " sleazy " . Sen. Sanders agreed with Rampton 's claim of scapegoating , and called for hearings into the incidents to investigate the company 's behaviors to see if other Burger King officers had instigated the attacks on the labor group as company policy . Sanders stated that he wished to " make sure that we find out how high up the corporate ladder this scheme went " . 
 The issue was resolved on May 23 , 2008 when BK CEO John Chidsey announced an agreement with the CIW granting the requested 1 ¢ pay increase to the workers . Chidsey also apologized on behalf of the company for the comments made about the pickers and the behavior of Grover and Silversmith . Additionally , the company agreed to provide a ½ ¢ per pound payment to the CIW to cover payroll taxes and administrative costs for the tomato growers .

 In the summer of 1999 , a geopolitical dispute with the global Islamic community and Jewish groups in the United States and Israel arose over an Israeli franchisee opening stores in the Israeli @-@ occupied territories . When Burger King franchisee in Israel , Rikamor , Ltd . , opened a store in the West Bank settlement of Ma 'aleh Adumim in August of that year , Islamic groups , including the Arab League and American Muslims for Jerusalem , argued that international Burger King parent Burger King Corporation 's licensing of the store helped legitimize the illegal settlement . Beyond the called @-@ for Islamic boycott of the company , the Arab League also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King 's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries that are part of the League 's membership . 
 Burger King Corporation quickly pulled the franchise license for that location and had the store shuttered explaining that Rikamor , Ltd. had violated its contract by opening the location in the West Bank . Several American @-@ based Jewish groups issued statements that denounced the decision as acceding to threats of boycotts by Islamic groups . Burger King Corporation issued a statement that it " made this decision purely on a commercial basis and in the best interests of thousands of people who depend on the Burger King reputation for their livelihood " .

 An issue of a religious nature arose in 2005 in the United Kingdom when Burger King introduced a new prepackaged ice cream product ; the label of the product included a silhouette of the ice cream that when rotated on its side bore a resemblance to the Islamic inscription for God , Allah ( الله ) . When a British Muslim named Rashad Akhtar , a resident of the community of High Wycombe , was presented with the ice cream cone in a Park Royal Burger King restaurant , he noticed the resemblance and became angered at what he felt was an offense to the Islamic faith . After being informed of the likeness , the local Islamic group Muslim Council of Britain pointed out the issue of the possible interpretation to Burger King and its relevance to Shariah , the Muslim version of canon law which governs the lives of members of the Islamic faith and carries the same weight as civil law in their belief structure . The company responded by voluntarily recalling the product and reissuing it with a new label . The Muslim Council praised the company for its " sensitive and prompt action " in resolving the matter ; however , Akhtar was not satisfied with the company 's withdrawal of the product . 
 In response to the perceived blasphemy , Akhtar declared it was his personal jihad to find those responsible for the packaging and destroy their professional status , personal life and the UK as a whole for having a culture allowing the insult to occur . This event , Akhtar 's reaction and other similar issues with companies such as Nike and Unilever have been used by conservative political critics , such as James Joyner , claiming that western nations and organizations are kowtowing in too easily to Muslims ' claims or threats and by commentators , including author Daniel C. Dennett , highlighting how factions of the Islamic faith gravitate towards iconoclasm .

 = = = Burger King Corporation v. Hungry Jack 's Pty Limited = = = 
 When Burger King moved to expand its operations into Australia in the early 1970s , its business name was already trademarked by a takeaway food shop in Adelaide . As a result , Burger King provided the Australian franchisee , Jack Cowin , with a list of possible alternative names derived from pre @-@ existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury that could be used to name the Australian restaurants . Cowin selected the Hungry Jack brand name , one of Pillsbury 's US pancake mixture products , and slightly changed the name to the possessive form , Hungry Jack 's . The first Australian franchise of Burger King Corporation was established in Perth in 1971 , under the auspices of Cowin 's new company Hungry Jack 's Pty , Limited . 
 In 1990 , Hungry Jack 's renewed its franchise agreement with then BK parent Burger King Corporation , which allowed Hungry Jack 's to license third party franchisee . One of the terms and conditions of the renewed agreement required Hungry Jack 's to open a minimum number of new locations each year for the duration of the contract . Shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed in 1996 , Burger King requested that Cowin rebrand the Hungry Jack 's locations to Burger King , which Cowin declined . Burger King Corporation accused Hungry Jack 's of violating the conditions of the renewed franchise agreement by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined and sought to terminate the agreement . Under the aegis of this claim , Burger King Corporation , in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell 's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd . , began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and extending throughout the regions of New South Wales , Australian Capital Territory and Victoria . In addition , BK sought to limit HJ 's ability to open new locations in the country , whether they were corporate locations or third @-@ party licensees . 
 As a result of Burger King 's actions , Hungry Jack 's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal proceedings in 2001 against Burger King 's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter @-@ claim that the company had violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract . In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin 's claims , Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack 's a A $ 46 @.@ 9 million ( US $ 41 @.@ 6 million 2001 ) award . The court 's decision was one of the first major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system , which until that verdict , had rarely been seen in the country 's courts . In its decision , the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement , allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack ’ s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own , a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement . 
 After Burger King Corporation lost the case , it decided to terminate its operations in the country , and in July 2002 , the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group , Trans @-@ Pacific Foods ( TPF ) . The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises in the region as the Burger King brand 's master franchisee . Trans @-@ Pacific Foods administered the chain 's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack 's Pty Ltd to re @-@ brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack 's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands . An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products . Trans @-@ Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack 's Pty Ltd , which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as Hungry Jack 's . 
 = = = Burger King v. Rudzewicz = = = 
 In 1979 , two Michigan businessmen , John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara , entered into a franchise agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in Detroit , Michigan . After MacShara attended four months of training courses at the regional Burger King training facilities in Michigan and in the Florida headquarters on how to operate and administer a Burger King franchise , it was agreed that the partners would take over operation of an existing Burger King location in Drayton Plains , Michigan . However , during this time disagreements arose between the partners and BK over issues of rent , construction fees , building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities . MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues , with Rudzewicz assuming a 20 @-@ year , $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 financial obligation over the life of the contract . 
 Due to a recessionary period in the United States beginning with the energy crisis in late 1979 , sales began to decline at the location and the partnership failed to pay their required franchise fees and rent service to Burger King Corporation . After attempts over the intervening months to negotiate a compromise with MacShara and Ruzewicz failed , Burger King terminated the franchise agreement and ordered the pair to vacate the property . Rudzewicz and MacShara refused to comply and continued operation of their restaurant even after they were served the notice . Burger King response was to file a lawsuit in May 1981 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida claiming breach of contract and trademark infringement . Burger King sought an injunction against the pair preventing them from operating the restaurant and seeking damages because MacShara and Ruzewicz were " ... tortiously infringing its [ Burger King ] trademarks and service marks through their continued , unauthorized operation as a Burger King restaurant " . The company also sought reimbursement of all legal fees and costs associated with the filing . 
 The defendants , MacShara and Rudzewicz , filed a motion to dismiss the case on the argument as Michigan residents , the District Court of Southern Florida did not have jurisdiction . After a hearing , the Court ruled that Florida has personal jurisdiction under State of Florida 's long @-@ arm statute , stating that " ... a non @-@ resident Burger King franchise is subject to the personal jurisdiction of this Court in actions arising out of its franchise agreements " . The partners filed a counter claim and alleged Burger King had violated Michigan 's Franchise Investment Law and sought damages and fees . After a short trial , the Court found for Burger King and ordered Rudzewicz and MacShara to close the restaurant and awarded BK damages , fees , and costs . 
 After the loss , MacShara withdrew from the case but Rudzewicz appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit . In the filing , Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents of Michigan , and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida , that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them . Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long @-@ arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional . Citing a similar case , World @-@ Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson , the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court 's decision . The court also agreed with Rudzewicz 's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida 's long arm statute in its application to the case . 
 In turn , Burger King Corporation asked for a rehearing , which was denied . Burger King then filed an appeal to the US Supreme Court , which agreed to hear the case on its merits , after which it would decide if it had jurisdiction to grant a writ of certiorari . In its decision , the Supreme Court overturned the Appellate Court and found that Florida does have jurisdiction in the case . The Court concluded that the defendants , Rudzewicz and MacShara , sought out their franchise in the state of Florida and were availed of the protections of that state and were , therefore , subject to jurisdiction there . Additionally , the Court reasoned that the defendants had a " substantial and continuing " relationship with Burger King in Florida and that due process would not be violated because the defendants should have reasonably anticipated being summoned into court in Florida for breach of contract . 
 The decision in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , has been criticized as complicating " personal jurisdiction jurisprudence by creating , in dicta , a new bifurcated test " that duplicates a venue analysis , adds little to the minimum contacts inquiry , hinders predictability , is a burdensome process , and potentially allows a plaintiff to manipulate a defendant 's constitutional rights . 
 = = = Burger King of Florida , Inc. v. Hoots = = = 
 As the company expanded , it was subject to several legal issues regarding trademarks . Because of its use as a case study in American law schools , one of the most prominent incidents of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named Burger King located in Mattoon , Illinois . Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an ice cream shop in the city of Mattoon ; due to the success of the store , in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop in a former garage next to the original operation . Keeping with theme related to the name of the ice cream shop , Frigid Queen , they named their burger stand Burger King and registered their trademark with the state of Illinois in 1959 . In 1962 The Hootses , with knowledge of the Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation , added a second location in Charleston , Illinois . 
 In 1961 , with its first location in Skokie , Illinois , Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening stores and by 1967 had over 20 locations spread throughout the state . The Hootses , claiming that their trademark gave them exclusive rights to the name in Illinois sued BK in the state , and later federal , courts under the case Burger King of Florida , Inc. v. Hoots 403 F.2d 904 ( 7th Cir . 1968 ) . The decision issued by United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois , and upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , stated that the BK federal trademark , applied for in 1961 and granted in 1963 , took precedence over the Hootses ' older , state trademark ; The Court granted the Hootses exclusive rights to the Burger King trademark within a circular area defined with a 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) radius centered on their original location . 
 The Burger King v. Hoots trademark dispute and its resulting decision went beyond the original case , it established a major legal precedent in the United States in regards to the Lanham Act . The ruling states that while the senior user of the state service mark or trademark has prior usage of the common law marks , federal statute overrides the earlier , state service mark and prohibits the senior user from preventing the junior user from exercising the use of the federally registered mark outside a defined geographic reach of the senior user . 
 The Hoots decision would again affect Burger King as it moved into the state of Texas . When Burger King expanded into the San Antonio area , it was prevented from utilizing the name of its signature product , the Whopper , in its local advertising and stores due to a prior state registered service mark owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger . The chain , owned by Frank and Barbara Bates , prevented the company from using the name in Bexar County for several years until Mrs. Bates , the CEO of Whopper Burger after the death of her husband in 1983 , retired and sold the chain with its related trademarks to then @-@ corporate parent Pillsbury in the mid @-@ 1980s .

 = Pelican = 
 Pelicans are a genus of large water birds that makes up the family <unk> . They are characterised by a long beak and a large throat pouch used for catching prey and draining water from the scooped up contents before swallowing . They have predominantly pale plumage , the exceptions being the brown and Peruvian pelicans . The bills , pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season . The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution , ranging <unk> from the tropics to the temperate zone , though they are absent from interior South America as well as from polar regions and the open ocean . 
 Long thought to be related to frigatebirds , cormorants , tropicbirds , gannets and boobies , pelicans instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop , and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes . <unk> , spoonbills and herons are more distant relatives , and have been classified in the same order . Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France . They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas ; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages . 
 Pelicans frequent inland and coastal waters where they feed principally on fish , catching them at or near the water surface . They are gregarious birds , travelling in flocks , hunting cooperatively and breeding colonially . Four white @-@ plumaged species tend to nest on the ground , and four brown or grey @-@ plumaged species nest mainly in trees . The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious . The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing . Their populations have fallen through habitat destruction , disturbance and environmental pollution , and three species are of conservation concern . They also have a long history of cultural significance in mythology , and in Christian and heraldic iconography . 
 = = Taxonomy and systematics = = 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The genus Pelecanus was first formally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae . He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip , linear nostrils , a bare face , and fully webbed feet . This early definition included frigatebirds , cormorants , and sulids as well as pelicans . The name comes from the Ancient Greek word <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is itself derived from the word <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " axe " . In classical times , the word was applied to both the pelican and the woodpecker . 
 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 Pelicans give their name to the Pelecaniformes , an order which has a varied taxonomic history . <unk> , darters , cormorants , gannets , boobies and frigatebirds , all traditional members of the order , have since been reclassified : tropicbirds into their own order , <unk> , and the remainder into Suliformes . In their place , herons , ibises , spoonbills , the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes . Molecular evidence suggests that the shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans , though there is some doubt as to the exact relationship between the three lineages . 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 The fossil record shows that the pelican lineage has existed for at least 30 million years ; the oldest known pelican fossil was found in Early Oligocene deposits at the <unk> in southeastern France and is remarkably similar to modern forms . Its beak is almost complete and is morphologically identical to that of present @-@ day pelicans , showing that this advanced feeding apparatus was already in existence at the time . An Early Miocene fossil has been named Miopelecanus gracilis on the basis of certain features originally considered unique but later thought to lie within the range of inter @-@ specific variation in Pelecanus . The Late Eocene <unk> may be a <unk> or <unk> – or a similar aquatic bird such as a pseudotooth ( Pelagornithidae ) . The supposed Miocene pelican <unk> from Patagonia is a nomen dubium ( of doubtful validity ) , being based on fragments providing insufficient evidence to support a valid description . 
 Fossil finds from North America have been meagre compared with Europe , which has a richer fossil record . Several Pelecanus species have been described from fossil material , including : 
 Pelecanus <unk> , Rich & van <unk> , 1981 ( Late Pliocene , South Australia ) 
 Pelecanus cautleyi , Davies , 1880 ( Early Pliocene , Siwalik Hills , India ) 
 Pelecanus <unk> , Lydekker , 1891 ( Middle Miocene , Bavaria , Germany ) 
 Pelecanus gracilis , Milne @-@ Edwards , 1863 ( Early Miocene , France ) ( see : Miopelecanus ) 
 Pelecanus <unk> , Wetmore , 1933 ( Late Pliocene , Idaho , US ) 
 Pelecanus intermedius , Fraas , 1870 ( Middle Miocene , Bavaria , Germany ) ( transferred to Miopelecanus by <unk> in 1984 ) 
 Pelecanus <unk> , <unk> , 1886 ( Late Miocene , near Odessa , Ukraine ) 
 Pelecanus <unk> , Olson , 1999 ( Early Pliocene , North Carolina , US )

 = = = Living species = = = 
 The eight living pelican species were traditionally divided into two groups , one containing four ground @-@ nesters with mainly white adult plumage ( Australian , Dalmatian , great white , and American white pelicans ) , and one containing four grey or brown plumaged species which nest preferentially either in trees ( pink @-@ backed , spot @-@ billed and brown pelicans ) , or on sea rocks ( Peruvian pelican ) . The largely marine brown and Peruvian pelicans , formerly considered conspecific , are sometimes separated from the others by placement in the subgenus <unk> but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either . 
 DNA sequencing of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded relationships quite different ; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage , with the American white pelican sister to the two brown pelicans , and the five Old World species the other . The Dalmatian , pink @-@ backed and spot @-@ billed were all closely related to one another , while the Australian white pelican was their next @-@ closest relative . The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but was the first to diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species . This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas , and that preference for <unk> or ground @-@ nesting is more related to size than genetics . 
 = = Description = = 
 Pelicans are very large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook at the end of the upper mandible , and the attachment of a huge gular pouch to the lower . The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and , sometimes , rainwater , though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish , the tongue itself is tiny . They have a long neck and short stout legs with large , fully webbed feet . Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds , they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water . The tail is short and square . The wings are long and broad , suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight , and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers . 
 Males are generally larger than females and have longer bills . The smallest species is the brown pelican , small individuals of which can be no more than 2 @.@ 75 kg ( 6 @.@ 1 lb ) and 1 @.@ 06 m ( 3 @.@ 5 ft ) long , with a wingspan of as little as 1 @.@ 83 m ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) . The largest is believed to be the Dalmatian , at up to 15 kg ( 33 lb ) and 1 @.@ 83 m ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) in length , with a maximum wingspan of 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) . The Australian pelican 's bill may grow up to 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) long in large males , the longest of any bird . 
 Pelicans have mainly light @-@ coloured plumage , the exceptions being the brown and Peruvian pelicans . The bills , pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences . The throat pouch of the Californian subspecies of the brown pelican turns bright red , and fades to yellow after the eggs are laid , while the throat pouch of the Peruvian pelican turns blue . The American white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females have laid eggs . The plumage of immature pelicans is darker than that of adults . Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink , darkening to grey or black after 4 to 14 days , then developing a covering of white or grey down . 
 = = = Air sacs = = = 
 Anatomical dissections of two brown pelicans in 1939 showed that pelicans have a network of subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat , breast and undersides of the wings , as well as having air sacs in their bones . The air sacs are connected to the airways of the respiratory system , and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis , but it is not clear how air sacs are inflated . The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican 's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish . Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours ( especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position ) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Modern pelicans are found on all continents except Antarctica . They primarily inhabit warm regions , although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45 ° South ( Australian pelicans in Tasmania ) and 60 ° North ( American white pelicans in western Canada ) . Birds of inland and coastal waters , they are absent from polar regions , the deep ocean , oceanic islands ( except the Galapagos ) , and inland South America , as well as from the eastern coast of South America from the mouth of the Amazon River southwards . Subfossil bones have been recovered from as far south as New Zealand 's South Island , although their scarcity and isolated occurrence suggests that these remains may have merely been vagrants from Australia ( much as is the case today ) . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Pelicans swim well with their strong legs and their webbed feet . They rub the backs of their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion , which they transfer to their plumage to waterproof it . Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies , pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface . They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling . They roost and loaf communally on beaches , sandbanks and in shallow water . 
 A fibrous layer deep in the breast muscles can hold the wings rigidly horizontal for gliding and soaring . Thus they use thermals for soaring to heights of 3000 m ( 10 @,@ 000 ft ) or more , combined both with gliding and with flapping flight in V formation , to commute distances of up to 150 km ( 93 mi ) to feeding areas . Pelicans also fly low ( or " skim " ) over stretches of water , using a phenomenon known as ground effect to reduce drag and increase lift . As the air flows between the wings and the water surface it is compressed to a higher density and exerts a stronger upward force against the bird above . Hence substantial energy is saved while flying . 
 Adult pelicans rely on visual displays and behaviour to communicate , particularly using their wings and bills . Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills , or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner . Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony , but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season . Conversely , colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively .

 The diet of pelicans usually consists of fish , which can be up to 30 cm ( 1 ft ) long , but amphibians , turtles , crustaceans and occasionally birds are also eaten . Aquatic prey is most commonly taken at or near the water surface . In deep water , white pelicans often fish alone . Nearer the shore , several will encircle schools of small fish or form a line to drive them into the shallows , beating their wings on the water surface and then scooping up the prey . They catch multiple small fish by expanding the throat pouch , which must be drained above the water surface before swallowing . This operation takes up to a minute , during which time other seabirds may steal the fish . 
 Large fish are caught with the bill @-@ tip , then tossed up in the air to be caught and slid into the gullet head @-@ first . A gull will sometimes stand on the pelican 's head , peck it to distraction , and grab a fish from the open bill . Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds . 
 The brown pelican usually plunge @-@ dives for its prey , especially for anchovies and menhaden . Although principally a fish eater , the Australian pelican is also an eclectic and opportunistic scavenger and carnivore that forages in landfill sites as well as taking carrion and " anything from insects and small crustaceans to ducks and small dogs " . Food is not stored in a pelican 's throat pouch , contrary to popular folklore . 
 Consumption of other birds by pelicans is rare , although great white pelicans have been observed swallowing pigeons in St. James 's Park in London . Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a semi @-@ urban environment and are in constant close contact with humans . However , in the Western Cape region of South Africa , biologist Marta de Ponte recorded the same species eating Cape gannet chicks on <unk> Island as well as Cape cormorants , crowned cormorants , kelp gulls , greater crested terns and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere . Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in California as well as the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California , Mexico . 
 = = = Breeding and lifespan = = = 
 Pelicans are gregarious and nest colonially . Pairs are monogamous for a single season , but the pair bond extends only to the nesting area ; mates are independent away from the nest . The ground @-@ nesting ( white ) species have a complex communal courtship involving a group of males chasing a single female in the air , on land , or in the water while pointing , gaping , and thrusting their bills at each other . They can finish the process in a day . The tree @-@ nesting species have a simpler process in which perched males advertise for females . The location of the breeding colony is constrained by the availability of an ample supply of fish to eat , although pelicans can use thermals to soar and commute for hundreds of kilometres daily to fetch food . 
 The Australian pelican has two reproductive strategies depending on the local degree of environmental predictability . Colonies of tens or hundreds , rarely thousands , of birds breed regularly on small coastal and <unk> islands where food is seasonally or permanently available . In arid inland Australia , especially in the endorheic Lake Eyre basin , pelicans will breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50 @,@ 000 pairs , when irregular major floods , which may be many years apart , fill ephemeral salt lakes and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again . 
 In all species copulation takes place at the nest site ; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3 – 10 days before egg @-@ laying . The male brings the nesting material , in ground @-@ nesting species ( which may not build a nest ) sometimes in the pouch , and in tree @-@ nesting species crosswise in the bill . The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure . 
 The eggs are oval , white and coarsely textured . All species normally lay at least two eggs ; the usual clutch size is one to three , rarely up to six . Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet ; they may display when changing shifts . Incubation takes 30 – 36 days ; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can be as high as 95 percent but , because of sibling competition or siblicide , in the wild usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks ( later in the pink @-@ backed and spot @-@ billed species ) . Both parents feed their young . Small chicks are fed by regurgitation ; after about a week they are able to put their heads into their parent ’ s pouch and feed themselves . Sometimes before , or especially after , being fed , they may seem to have a seizure that ends in falling unconscious ; the reason is not clearly known . 
 Parents of ground @-@ nesting species sometimes drag older young around roughly by the head before feeding them . From about 25 days old , the young of these species gather in " pods " or " crèches " of up to 100 birds in which parents recognise and feed only their own offspring . By 6 – 8 weeks they wander around , occasionally swimming , and may practise communal feeding . Young of all species fledge 10 – 12 weeks after hatching . They may remain with their parents afterwards , but are now seldom or never fed . They are mature at three or four years old . Overall breeding success is highly variable . Pelicans live for 15 to 25 years in the wild , although one reached an age of 54 years in captivity .

 = = = Populations = = = 
 Globally , pelican populations are adversely affected by four main factors : declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution , destruction of habitat , direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies , hunting and culling , entanglement in fishing lines and hooks , and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and <unk> . Most species ' populations are more or less stable , although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk . All species breed readily in zoos , which is potentially useful for conservation management . 
 The combined population of brown and Peruvian pelicans is estimated at 650 @,@ 000 birds , with around 250 @,@ 000 in the United States and Caribbean , and 400 @,@ 000 in Peru . The National Audubon Society estimates the global population of the brown pelican at 300 @,@ 000 . Numbers of brown pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s , largely as a consequence of environmental DDT pollution , and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970 . With restrictions on DDT use in the US from 1972 , its population has recovered , and it was delisted in 2009 . 
 The Peruvian pelican is listed as Near Threatened because , although the population is estimated by BirdLife International to exceed 500 @,@ 000 mature individuals , and is possibly increasing , it has been much higher in the past . It declined dramatically during the 1998 El Niño event and could experience similar declines in the future . Conservation needs include regular monitoring throughout the range to determine population trends , particularly after El Niño years ; restricting human access to important breeding colonies ; and assessing interactions with fisheries . 
 The spot @-@ billed pelican has an estimated population between 13 @,@ 000 and 18 @,@ 000 and is considered to be Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century , one crucial factor being the eradication of the important <unk> valley breeding colony in Burma through deforestation and the loss of feeding sites . The chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia . 
 The pink @-@ backed pelican has a large population ranging over much of Sub @-@ Saharan Africa . In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range , its conservation status is assessed as being of Least Concern . Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa . The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and to the destruction of nesting trees by logging . 
 The American white pelican has increased in numbers , with its population estimated at over 157 @,@ 000 birds in 2005 , becoming more numerous east of the continental divide while declining in the west . However it is unclear whether its numbers have been affected by exposure to pesticides as it has also lost habitat through wetland drainage and competition with recreational use of lakes and rivers . 
 Great white pelicans range over a large area of Africa and southern Asia . The overall trend in numbers is uncertain , with a mix of regional populations that are increasing , declining , stable or unknown , but there is no evidence of rapid overall decline and the status of the species is assessed as being of Least Concern . Threats include the drainage of wetlands , persecution and sport hunting , disturbance at the breeding colonies , and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals . 
 The Dalmatian pelican is the rarest species with a population estimated at between 10 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries . The main ongoing threats include hunting , especially in eastern Asia , disturbance , coastal development , collision with overhead power lines and the over @-@ exploitation of fish stocks . It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards , especially in Mongolia where it is nearly extinct . However , several colonies are increasing in size and the colony at the Small Prespa Lake in Greece has nearly 1000 breeding pairs . 
 Widespread across Australia , the Australian pelican has a population generally estimated at between 300 @,@ 000 and 500 @,@ 000 individuals . Overall population numbers fluctuate widely and erratically depending on wetland conditions and breeding success across the continent . The species is assessed as being of Least Concern . 
 = = = Culling and disturbance = = = 
 Pelicans have been persecuted by humans for their perceived competition for fish , despite the fact that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people . Starting in the 1880s , American white pelicans were clubbed and shot , their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed , and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage . Even in the 21st century , an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south @-@ eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational cutthroat trout fishery there , leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling . 
 Great white pelicans on Dyer Island , in the Western Cape region of South Africa , were culled during the 19th century because their predation of the eggs and chicks of guano @-@ producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors . More recently , such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations , especially crowned cormorants , Cape cormorants and bank cormorants . This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies . 
 Apart from habitat destruction and deliberate , targeted persecution , pelicans are vulnerable to disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers , photographers and other curious visitors . Human presence alone can cause the birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs , leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather , or even abandon their colonies completely . 
 = = = Poisoning and pollution = = = 
 DDT pollution in the environment was a major cause of decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s . It entered the oceanic food web , contaminating and accumulating in several species , including one of the pelican ’ s primary food fish – the northern anchovy . Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive <unk> in pelicans and many other birds , causing eggshell thinning and weakening , and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds . Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972 , the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered . 
 In the late 1960s , following the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning , 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re @-@ establish the population ; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide <unk> . About 14 @,@ 000 pelicans , including 7500 American white pelicans , perished from botulism after eating fish from the Salton Sea in 1990 . In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt 's cormorants died at Santa Cruz , California , when their food fish ( anchovies ) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid , produced by the diatom Pseudo @-@ <unk> . 
 As waterbirds that feed on fish , pelicans are highly susceptible to oil spills , both directly by being oiled and by the impact on their food resources . A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that , during the previous 20 years , some 500 – 1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California . A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity , a year after the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill , said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed as a result of the spill . 
 Where pelicans interact with fishers , through either sharing the same waters or scavenging for fishing refuse , they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines . Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in the skin of the pouch or webbed feet , and strong monofilament fishing line can become wound around bill , wings or legs , resulting in crippling , starvation , and often death . Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife . 
 = = = Parasites and disease = = = 
 As with other bird families , pelicans are susceptible to a variety of parasites . Specialist feather lice of the genus <unk> are found in the pouches of all species of pelican , but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants . Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito Culex <unk> , and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned . Leeches may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch . A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species , including tapeworms , flukes , flies , fleas , ticks and nematodes . Many of these do little harm , but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings , particularly if they are weak or unwell , and the soft tick <unk> capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest . Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups , but several lice are very host @-@ specific . 
 Healthy pelicans can usually cope with their lice , but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals , which hastens their demise . The pouch louse <unk> <unk> , which occurs in the pouch and therefore cannot be removed by preening , is usually not a serious problem , even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch , but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host . The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites . The nematodes <unk> <unk> and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population , possibly endangering the pelican on this island . In May 2012 , hundreds of Peruvian pelicans were reported to have perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation . 
 = = Religion , mythology , and popular culture = = 
 The pelican ( <unk> in Egyptian ) was associated in Ancient Egypt with death and the afterlife . It was depicted in art on the walls of tombs , and figured in funerary texts , as a protective symbol against snakes . <unk> was also referred to in the Pyramid Texts as the " mother of the king " and thus seen as a goddess . References in non @-@ royal funerary papyri show that the pelican was believed to possess the ability to prophesy safe passage in the underworld for someone who had died . 
 Consumption of pelican , as with other seabirds , is considered non @-@ kosher as an ' unclean animal ' , and thus forbidden in Jewish dietary law . 
 An origin myth from the Murri people of Queensland , cited by Andrew Lang , describes how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage . The pelican , formerly a black bird , made a canoe during a flood in order to save drowning people . He fell in love with a woman he thus saved , but she and her friends tricked him and escaped . The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by <unk> himself with white clay as war paint . However , before he had finished , another pelican , on seeing such a strange piebald creature , killed him with its beak , and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since . 
 The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature . They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted pelicans in their art . 
 Alcatraz Island was given its name by the Spanish because of the number of large numbers of brown pelicans nesting present . The word alcatraz is itself derived from the Arabic " al @-@ <unk> " , a term used for a water @-@ carrying vessel and likened to the pouch of the pelican . The English name albatross is also derived by corruption of the Spanish word .

 In medieval Europe , the pelican was thought to be particularly attentive to her young , to the point of providing her own blood by wounding her own breast when no other food was available . As a result , the pelican came to symbolise the Passion of Jesus and the Eucharist , and usurped the image of the lamb and the flag . A reference to this mythical characteristic is contained for example in the hymn by Saint Thomas Aquinas , " <unk> te devote " or " <unk> We Adore Thee " , where in the penultimate verse he describes Christ as the " loving divine pelican , able to provide nourishment from his breast " . Elizabeth I of England adopted the symbol , portraying herself as the " mother of the Church of England " . Nicholas Hilliard painted the Pelican Portrait in around 1573 , now owned by the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool . A pelican feeding her young is depicted in an oval panel at the bottom of the title page of the first ( 1611 ) edition of the King James Bible . Such " a pelican in her piety " appears in the 1686 reredos by Grinling Gibbons in the church of St Mary <unk> in the City of London . Earlier medieval examples of the motif appear in painted murals , for example that of c . 1350 in the parish church of <unk> Walter , Essex . 
 The self @-@ sacrificial aspect of the pelican was reinforced by the widely read medieval bestiaries . The device of " a pelican in her piety " or " a pelican <unk> ( from Latin <unk> , " to wound " ) herself " was used in heraldry . An older version of the myth is that the pelican used to kill its young then resurrect them with its blood , again analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus . Likewise , a folktale from India says that a pelican killed her young by rough treatment but was then so contrite that she resurrected them with her own blood . 
 The legends of self @-@ wounding and the provision of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill . In reality , it often presses this onto its chest in order to fully empty the pouch . Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast ; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood @-@ red pouch in the early breeding season and this may have contributed to the myth . 
 = = = = Heraldry = = = = 
 Pelicans have featured extensively in heraldry , generally using the Christian symbolism of the pelican as a caring and self @-@ sacrificing parent . The image became linked to the medieval religious feast of Corpus Christi . The universities of Oxford and Cambridge each have colleges named for the religious festival nearest the dates of their establishment , and both Corpus Christi College , Cambridge , and Corpus Christi College , Oxford , feature pelicans on their coats of arms . 
 The medical faculties of Charles University in Prague also have a pelican as their emblem . The symbol of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a pelican , and for most of its existence the headquarters of the service was located at Pelican House in Dublin , Ireland . The heraldic pelican also ended up as a pub name and image , though sometimes with the image of the ship Golden Hind . Sir Francis Drake 's famous ship was initially called Pelican , and adorned the British halfpenny coin .
