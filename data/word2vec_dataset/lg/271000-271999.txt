 Cubeb was frequently used in the form of cigarettes for asthma , chronic pharyngitis and hay fever . Edgar Rice Burroughs , being fond of smoking cubeb cigarettes , humorously stated that if he had not smoked so many cubebs , there might never have been Tarzan . " Marshall 's Prepared Cubeb Cigarettes " was a popular brand , with enough sales to still be made during World War II . Occasionally , marijuana users claimed that smoking marijuana is no more harmful than smoking cubeb . In the musical The Music Man , set in rural Iowa in 1912 , the character Harold Hill alarms parents by telling this that their sons are trying out cubeb cigarettes at the notorious pool hall in the song " Trouble " . 
 In 2000 cubeb oil was included in the list of ingredients found in cigarettes , published by the Tobacco Prevention and Control Branch of North Carolina 's Department of Health and Human Services . 
 Bombay Sapphire gin is flavored with botanicals including cubeb and grains of paradise .

 M @-@ 98 is the designation of a former 16 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 26 @.@ 1 km ) state trunkline highway in the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . It ran between M @-@ 77 at Germfask and M @-@ 28 near McMillan . The highway connected both small towns situated around Manistique Lake when it was designated with the rest of the original state highways in 1919 . The section north of Helmer on the east side of the lake ran concurrently with M @-@ 135 after the latter 's creation in the late 1920s . M @-@ 98 was extended at the end of the 1940s before the whole trunkline was removed from the highway system in the 1960s . Since the 1970s , part of M @-@ 98 has been designated as one of the two County Road H @-@ <unk> in the state .

Ten Curves Road passes between the Big and North Manistee lakes as it enters the community of Helmer in Luce County . There , M @-@ 98 intersected M @-@ 135 , and the two ran concurrently north along Manistique Lakes Road .

By 1936 , a series of corners were straightened out on the western end of M @-@ 98 near Germfask . In late 1949 or early 1950 , M @-@ 28 was realigned to take an angled route southeasterly out of McMillan . The east – west section of the previous M @-@ 28 routing was added to M @-@ 98 while the north – south segment was added to M @-@ 135 .

M @-@ 98 was removed from the state trunkline system in late 1960 or early 1961 , and the designation was decommissioned at that time . The M @-@ 98 designation has not been reused since . The routing was then assigned as a County Road H @-@ 44 after October 5 , 1970 , along the east – west section of the former M @-@ 98 .

 = Asteroid belt = 
 The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter . It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets . The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near @-@ Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids . About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids : Ceres , Vesta , Pallas , and Hygiea . The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4 % that of the Moon , or 22 % that of Pluto , and roughly twice that of Pluto 's moon Charon ( whose diameter is 1200 km ) . 
 Ceres , the asteroid belt 's only dwarf planet , is about 950 km in diameter , whereas Vesta , Pallas , and Hygiea have mean diameters of less than 600 km . The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle . The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident . Nonetheless , collisions between large asteroids do occur , and these can form an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions . Individual asteroids within the asteroid belt are categorized by their spectra , with most falling into three basic groups : carbonaceous ( C @-@ type ) , silicate ( S @-@ type ) , and metal @-@ rich ( M @-@ type ) . 
 The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals . Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets . Between Mars and Jupiter , however , gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet . Collisions became too violent , and instead of fusing together , the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered . As a result , 99 @.@ 9 % of the asteroid belt 's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System 's history . Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System , leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets . Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter . At these orbital distances , a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits . 
 Classes of small Solar System bodies in other regions are the near @-@ Earth objects , the centaurs , the Kuiper belt objects , the scattered disc objects , the sednoids , and the Oort cloud objects . 
 On 22 January 2014 , ESA scientists reported the detection , for the first definitive time , of water vapor on Ceres , the largest object in the asteroid belt . The detection was made by using the far @-@ infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory . The finding was unexpected because comets , not asteroids , are typically considered to " sprout jets and plumes " . According to one of the scientists , " The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids . " 
 = = History of observation = = 
 In an anonymous footnote to his 1766 translation of Charles Bonnet 's Contemplation de la Nature , the astronomer Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg noted an apparent pattern in the layout of the planets . If one began a numerical sequence at 0 , then included 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , etc . , doubling each time , and added four to each number and divided by 10 , this produced a remarkably close approximation to the radii of the orbits of the known planets as measured in astronomical units . This pattern , now known as the Titius – Bode law , predicted the semi @-@ major axes of the six planets of the time ( Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn ) provided one allowed for a " gap " between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter . In his footnote Titius declared , " But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty ? Not at all . " In 1768 , the astronomer Johann Elert Bode made note of Titius 's relationship in his <unk> zur <unk> des <unk> Himmels ( English : Instruction for the Knowledge of the Starry Heavens ) but did not credit Titius until later editions . It became known as " Bode 's law " . When William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781 , the planet 's orbit matched the law almost perfectly , leading astronomers to conclude that there had to be a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter . 
 In 1800 the astronomer Baron Franz Xaver von Zach recruited 24 of his fellows into a club , the Vereinigte Astronomische Gesellschaft ( " United Astronomical Society " ) which he informally dubbed the " Lilienthal Society " for its meetings in Lilienthal . Lilienthal is a town near Bremen , Germany that was home to a prominent telescope at the time . Determined to bring the Solar System to order , the group became known as the " <unk> " , or Celestial Police . Notable members included Herschel , the British astronomer royal , Nevil Maskelyne , Charles Messier , and Heinrich Olbers . The society assigned to each astronomer a 15 ° region of the zodiac to search for the missing planet . 
 Only a few months later , a non @-@ member of the Celestial Police confirmed their expectations . On January 1 , 1801 , Giuseppe Piazzi , chair of astronomy at the University of Palermo , Sicily , found a tiny moving object in an orbit with exactly the radius predicted by the Titius – Bode law . He dubbed it " Ceres " , after the Roman goddess of the harvest and patron of Sicily . Piazzi initially believed it to be a comet , but its lack of a coma suggested it was a planet . Fifteen months later , Olbers discovered a second object in the same region , Pallas . Unlike the other known planets , the objects remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications instead of resolving into discs . Apart from their rapid movement , they appeared indistinguishable from stars . Accordingly , in 1802 , William Herschel suggested they be placed into a separate category , named " asteroids " , after the Greek <unk> , meaning " star @-@ like " . Upon completing a series of observations of Ceres and Pallas , he concluded , 
 Neither the appellation of planets , nor that of comets , can with any propriety of language be given to these two stars ... They resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them . From this , their asteroidal appearance , if I take my name , and call them Asteroids ; reserving for myself however the liberty of changing that name , if another , more expressive of their nature , should occur . 
 Despite Herschel 's coinage , for several decades it remained common practice to refer to these objects as planets . By 1807 , further investigation revealed two new objects in the region : 3 Juno and 4 Vesta . The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic wars brought this first period of discovery to a close , and only in 1845 did astronomers detect another object ( 5 Astraea ) . Shortly thereafter , new objects were found at an accelerating rate , and counting them among the planets became increasingly cumbersome . Eventually , they were dropped from the planet list as first suggested by Alexander von Humboldt in the early 1850s , and Herschel 's choice of nomenclature , " asteroids " , gradually came into common use . 
 The discovery of Neptune in 1846 led to the discrediting of the Titius – Bode law in the eyes of scientists , because its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position . To date , there is no scientific explanation for the law , and astronomers ' consensus regards it as a coincidence . 
 The expression " asteroid belt " came into use in the very early 1850s , although it is hard to pinpoint who coined the term . The first English use seems to be in the 1850 translation ( by E. C. <unk> ) of Alexander von Humboldt 's Cosmos : " [ ... ] and the regular appearance , about the 13th of November and the 11th of August , of shooting stars , which probably form part of a belt of asteroids intersecting the Earth 's orbit and moving with planetary velocity " . Other early appearances occur in Robert James Mann 's A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens , " The orbits of the asteroids are placed in a wide belt of space , extending between the extremes of [ ... ] " . The American astronomer Benjamin Peirce seems to have adopted that terminology and to have been one of its promoters . One hundred asteroids had been located by mid @-@ 1868 , and in 1891 the introduction of astrophotography by Max Wolf accelerated the rate of discovery still further . A total of 1 @,@ 000 asteroids had been found by 1921 , 10 @,@ 000 by 1981 , and 100 @,@ 000 by 2000 . Modern asteroid survey systems now use automated means to locate new minor planets in ever @-@ increasing quantities .

 In 1802 , shortly after discovering Pallas , Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of a much larger planet that once occupied the Mars – Jupiter region , this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before . Over time , however , this hypothesis has fallen from favor . The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet , combined with the belt 's low combined mass , which is only about 4 % of the mass of the Moon , do not support the hypothesis . Further , the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet . Today , most scientists accept that , rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet , the asteroids never formed a planet at all . 
 In general , in the Solar System , planetary formation is thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long @-@ standing nebular hypothesis : a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets . During the first few million years of the Solar System 's history , an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles , which gradually increased in size . Once the clumps reached sufficient mass , they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals . This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the planets . 
 Planetesimals within the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter 's gravity to form a planet . Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before , occasionally colliding . In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high , the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion , preventing the formation of planet @-@ sized bodies . Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter , perturbing the object into a different orbit ; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances . As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation , these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt , dynamically exciting the region 's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other . 
 During the early history of the Solar System , the asteroids melted to some degree , allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass . Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans . However , because of the relatively small size of the bodies , the period of melting was necessarily brief ( compared to the much larger planets ) , and had generally ended about 4 @.@ 5 billion years ago , in the first tens of millions of years of formation . In August 2007 , a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it , and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt , had formed rather quickly , within ten million years of the Solar System 's origin . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 The asteroids are not samples of the primordial Solar System . They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation , including internal heating ( in the first few tens of millions of years ) , surface melting from impacts , space weathering from radiation , and bombardment by micrometeorites . Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals , other scientists consider them distinct . 
 The current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction of the mass of the primordial belt . Computer simulations suggest that the original asteroid belt may have contained mass equivalent to the Earth . Primarily because of gravitational perturbations , most of the material was ejected from the belt within about a million years of formation , leaving behind less than 0 @.@ 1 % of the original mass . Since their formation , the size distribution of the asteroid belt has remained relatively stable : there has been no significant increase or decrease in the typical dimensions of the main @-@ belt asteroids . 
 The 4 : 1 orbital resonance with Jupiter , at a radius 2 @.@ 06 AU , can be considered the inner boundary of the asteroid belt . <unk> by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits . Most bodies formed inside the radius of this gap were swept up by Mars ( which has an aphelion at 1 @.@ 67 AU ) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in the early history of the Solar System . The Hungaria asteroids lie closer to the Sun than the 4 : 1 resonance , but are protected from disruption by their high inclination . 
 When the asteroid belt was first formed , the temperatures at a distance of 2 @.@ 7 AU from the Sun formed a " snow line " below the freezing point of water . Planetesimals formed beyond this radius were able to accumulate ice . In 2006 it was announced that a population of comets had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line , which may have provided a source of water for Earth 's oceans . According to some models , there was insufficient outgassing of water during the Earth 's formative period to form the oceans , requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Contrary to popular imagery , the asteroid belt is mostly empty . The asteroids are spread over such a large volume that it would be improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully . Nonetheless , hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known , and the total number ranges in the millions or more , depending on the lower size cutoff . Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100 km , and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has 0 @.@ 7 – 1 @.@ 7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1 km or more . The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11 – 19 , with the median at about 16 . 
 The total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be 2 @.@ 8 × 1021 to 3 @.@ 2 × 1021 kilograms , which is just 4 % of the mass of the Moon . The four largest objects , Ceres , 4 Vesta , 2 Pallas , and 10 Hygiea , account for half of the belt 's total mass , with almost one @-@ third accounted for by Ceres alone . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 The current belt consists primarily of three categories of asteroids : C @-@ type or carbonaceous asteroids , S @-@ type or silicate asteroids , and M @-@ type or metallic asteroids . 
 Carbonaceous asteroids , as their name suggests , are carbon @-@ rich . They dominate the asteroid belt 's outer regions . Together they comprise over 75 % of the visible asteroids . They are more red in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo . Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites . Chemically , their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System , with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed . 
 S @-@ type ( silicate @-@ rich ) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt , within 2 @.@ 5 AU of the Sun . The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of silicates and some metal , but no significant carbonaceous compounds . This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition , probably through melting and reformation . They have a relatively high albedo , and form about 17 % of the total asteroid population . 
 M @-@ type ( metal @-@ rich ) asteroids form about 10 % of the total population ; their spectra resemble that of iron @-@ nickel . Some are believed to have formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision . However , there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance . For example , the large M @-@ type asteroid 22 <unk> does not appear to be primarily composed of metal . Within the asteroid belt , the number distribution of M @-@ type asteroids peaks at a semi @-@ major axis of about 2 @.@ 7 AU . It is not yet clear whether all M @-@ types are compositionally similar , or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes . 
 One mystery of the asteroid belt is the relative rarity of V @-@ type , or basaltic asteroids . Theories of asteroid formation predict that objects the size of Vesta or larger should form crusts and mantles , which would be composed mainly of basaltic rock , resulting in more than half of all asteroids being composed either of basalt or olivine . Observations , however , suggest that 99 percent of the predicted basaltic material is missing . Until 2001 , most basaltic bodies discovered in the asteroid belt were believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta ( hence their name V @-@ type ) . However , the discovery of the asteroid 1459 <unk> revealed a slightly different chemical composition from the other basaltic asteroids discovered until then , suggesting a different origin . This hypothesis was reinforced by the further discovery in 2007 of two asteroids in the outer belt , 7472 <unk> and ( <unk> ) 1991 <unk> , with differing basaltic composition that could not have originated from Vesta . These latter two are the only V @-@ type asteroids discovered in the outer belt to date . 
 The temperature of the asteroid belt varies with the distance from the Sun . For dust particles within the belt , typical temperatures range from 200 K ( − 73 ° C ) at 2 @.@ 2 AU down to 165 K ( − 108 ° C ) at 3 @.@ 2 AU However , due to rotation , the surface temperature of an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background . 
 = = = Main @-@ belt comets = = = 
 Several otherwise unremarkable bodies in the outer belt show cometary activity . Because their orbits cannot be explained through capture of classical comets , it is thought that many of the outer asteroids may be icy , with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts . Main @-@ belt comets may have been a major source of the Earth 's oceans , because the deuterium – hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source . 
 = = = Orbits = = = 
 Most asteroids within the asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0 @.@ 4 , and an inclination of less than 30 ° . The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0 @.@ 07 and an inclination below 4 ° . Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of the ecliptic , some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane . 
 Sometimes , the term main belt is used to refer only to the more compact " core " region where the greatest concentration of bodies is found . This lies between the strong 4 : 1 and 2 : 1 Kirkwood gaps at 2 @.@ 06 and 3 @.@ 27 AU , and at orbital eccentricities less than roughly 0 @.@ 33 , along with orbital inclinations below about 20 ° . This " core " region contains approximately 93 @.@ 4 % of all numbered minor planets within the Solar System . 
 = = = = Kirkwood gaps = = = = 
 The semi @-@ major axis of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun , and its value determines the minor planet 's orbital period . In 1866 , Daniel Kirkwood announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies ' orbits from the Sun . They were located at positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter 's orbital period . Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits . 
 When the mean orbital period of an asteroid is an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter , a mean @-@ motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements . Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits ( either <unk> because of the migration of Jupiter 's orbit , or due to prior perturbations or collisions ) are gradually nudged into different , random orbits with a larger or smaller semi @-@ major axis . 
 The gaps are not seen in a simple snapshot of the locations of the asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical , and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps . The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions . 
 The main gaps occur at the 3 : 1 , 5 : 2 , 7 : 3 , and 2 : 1 mean @-@ motion resonances with Jupiter . An asteroid in the 3 : 1 Kirkwood gap would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit , for instance . Weaker resonances occur at other semi @-@ major axis values , with fewer asteroids found than nearby . ( For example , an 8 : 3 resonance for asteroids with a semi @-@ major axis of 2 @.@ 71 AU . ) 
 The main or core population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones , based on the most prominent Kirkwood gaps . Zone I lies between the 4 : 1 resonance ( 2 @.@ 06 AU ) and 3 : 1 resonance ( 2 @.@ 5 AU ) Kirkwood gaps . Zone II continues from the end of Zone I out to the 5 : 2 resonance gap ( 2 @.@ 82 AU ) . Zone III extends from the outer edge of Zone II to the 2 : 1 resonance gap ( 3 @.@ 28 AU ) . 
 The asteroid belt may also be divided into the inner and outer belts , with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3 : 1 Kirkwood gap ( 2 @.@ 5 AU ) , and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter 's orbit . ( Some authors subdivide the inner and outer belts at the 2 : 1 resonance gap ( 3 @.@ 3 AU ) , whereas others suggest inner , middle , and outer belts . ) 
 = = Collisions = = 
 The high population of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment , where collisions between asteroids occur frequently ( on astronomical time scales ) . Collisions between main @-@ belt bodies with a mean radius of 10 km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years . A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces ( leading to the formation of a new asteroid family ) . Conversely , collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids . After more than 4 billion years of such processes , the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population . 
 Along with the asteroid bodies , the asteroid belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres . This fine material is produced , at least in part , from collisions between asteroids , and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids . Due to the Poynting – Robertson effect , the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun . 
 The combination of this fine asteroid dust , as well as ejected cometary material , produces the zodiacal light . This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending from the direction of the Sun along the plane of the ecliptic . Asteroid particles that produce the visible zodiacal light average about 40 μm in radius . The typical lifetimes of main @-@ belt zodiacal cloud particles are about 700 @,@ 000 years . Thus , to maintain the bands of dust , new particles must be steadily produced within the asteroid belt . It was once thought that collisions of asteroids form a major component of the zodiacal light . However , computer simulations by <unk> and colleagues attributed 85 percent of the zodiacal @-@ light dust to fragmentations of Jupiter @-@ family comets , rather than to comets and collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt . At most 10 percent of the dust is attributed to the asteroid belt . 
 = = = Meteorites = = = 
 Some of the debris from collisions can form meteoroids that enter the Earth 's atmosphere . Of the 50 @,@ 000 meteorites found on Earth to date , 99 @.@ 8 percent are believed to have originated in the asteroid belt . 
 = = Families and groups = = 
 In 1918 , the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama noticed that the orbits of some of the asteroids had similar parameters , forming families or groups . 
 Approximately one @-@ third of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are members of an asteroid family . These share similar orbital elements , such as semi @-@ major axis , eccentricity , and orbital inclination as well as similar spectral features , all of which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body . Graphical displays of these elements , for members of the asteroid belt , show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family . There are about 20 – 30 associations that are almost certainly asteroid families . Additional groupings have been found that are less certain . Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display common spectral features . Smaller associations of asteroids are called groups or clusters . 
 Some of the most prominent families in the asteroid belt ( in order of increasing semi @-@ major axes ) are the Flora , <unk> , Koronis , Eos , and Themis families . The Flora family , one of the largest with more than 800 known members , may have formed from a collision less than a billion years ago . The largest asteroid to be a true member of a family ( as opposed to an interloper in the case of Ceres with the Gefion family ) is 4 Vesta . The Vesta family is believed to have formed as the result of a crater @-@ forming impact on Vesta . Likewise , the HED meteorites may also have originated from Vesta as a result of this collision . 
 Three prominent bands of dust have been found within the asteroid belt . These have similar orbital inclinations as the Eos , Koronis , and Themis asteroid families , and so are possibly associated with those groupings . 
 = = = Periphery = = = 
 Skirting the inner edge of the belt ( ranging between 1 @.@ 78 and 2 @.@ 0 AU , with a mean semi @-@ major axis of 1 @.@ 9 AU ) is the Hungaria family of minor planets . They are named after the main member , 434 Hungaria ; the group contains at least 52 named asteroids . The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4 : 1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination . Some members belong to the Mars @-@ crossing category of asteroids , and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing the total population of this group . 
 Another high @-@ inclination group in the inner part of the asteroid belt is the Phocaea family . These are composed primarily of S @-@ type asteroids , whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some E @-@ types . The Phocaea family orbit between 2 @.@ 25 and 2 @.@ 5 AU from the Sun . 
 Skirting the outer edge of the asteroid belt is the Cybele group , orbiting between 3 @.@ 3 and 3 @.@ 5 AU . These have a 7 : 4 orbital resonance with Jupiter . The Hilda family orbit between 3 @.@ 5 and 4 @.@ 2 AU , and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3 : 2 orbital resonance with Jupiter . There are few asteroids beyond 4 @.@ 2 AU , until Jupiter 's orbit . Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found , which , at least for objects larger than 1 km , are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt . 
 = = = New families = = = 
 Some asteroid families have formed recently , in astronomical terms . The Karin Cluster apparently formed about 5 @.@ 7 million years ago from a collision with a progenitor asteroid 33 km in radius . The Veritas family formed about 8 @.@ 3 million years ago ; evidence includes interplanetary dust recovered from ocean sediment . 
 More recently , the Datura cluster appears to have formed about 450 thousand years ago from a collision with a main @-@ belt asteroid . The age estimate is based on the probability of the members having their current orbits , rather than from any physical evidence . However , this cluster may have been a source for some zodiacal dust material . Other recent cluster formations , such as the <unk> cluster ( circa 1 – 5 million years ago ) , may have provided additional sources of this asteroid dust .

 The first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was Pioneer 10 , which entered the region on 16 July 1972 . At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft , but it has since been safely traversed by 12 spacecraft without incident . Pioneer 11 , Voyagers 1 and 2 and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids . Galileo imaged 951 Gaspra in 1991 and 243 Ida in 1993 , NEAR imaged 253 Mathilde in 1997 , Cassini imaged <unk> <unk> in 2000 , Stardust imaged <unk> <unk> in 2002 , New Horizons imaged <unk> APL in 2006 , Rosetta imaged <unk> <unk> in September 2008 and 21 Lutetia in July 2010 , and Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015 . On its way to Jupiter , Juno traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data . Due to the low density of materials within the belt , the odds of a probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than one in a billion . 
 Most belt asteroids imaged to date have come from brief flyby opportunities by probes headed for other targets . Only the Dawn , NEAR and Hayabusa missions have studied asteroids for a protracted period in orbit and at the surface . Dawn explored Vesta from July 2011 to September 2012 , and has been orbiting Ceres since March 2015 . 
 = New Jersey Route 83 = 
 Route 83 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey . It is completely within Dennis Township , New Jersey , running 3 @.@ 81 mi ( 6 @.@ 13 km ) from an intersection with Route 47 to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) . The route , which passes through woodland and some residential development , is also known as the Trooper Bertram T. Zimmerman III Memorial Highway in honor of a New Jersey State Police officer who was killed along Route 83 in 2004 while responding to an armed robbery . 
 Between 1927 and 1953 , Route 83 was a part of Route 49 , which originally ran south of Millville along Route 47 between Millville and South Dennis and along the entire length of Route 83 . In 1953 , the route became Route 83 when Route 49 was realigned to follow what was then Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe and Route 47 was aligned to follow Route S49 between South Dennis and Wildwood . In 2007 , the state completed reconstruction of the intersection with Route 47 to include a traffic signal . A school bus accident has prompted the New Jersey Department of Transportation ( NJDOT ) to install a traffic signal at the Y intersection of Route 83 and US 9 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 83 begins at a traffic light with Route 47 in South Dennis , heading to the east on a four @-@ lane divided highway . The route crosses over the Cape May Seashore Lines railroad line and narrows to a two @-@ lane undivided highway . After this bridge , it intersects West Avenue and then crosses over County Route 628 ( Dennisville Road / School House Road ) . Route 83 then intersects County Road , which heads west to parallel the route to the south . It later crosses Gravel Hole Road , which provides access to County Route 657 ( Court House @-@ Dennisville Road ) . Past that intersection , Route 83 continues to the east through a mix of residential development and woodland . It passes under a set of power lines and comes to an intersection with County Route 608 ( Kings Highway ) . The route continues east to its eastern terminus at a signalized intersection with US 9 in Clermont . 
 Route 83 is a major route that provides access to the Jersey Shore resorts of Sea Isle City and Avalon from Route 47 . It also serves as part of an evacuation route for Cape May County that feeds into Route 47 to provide access to inland areas in the event of a hurricane .

 Route 83 was originally legislated by the Laws of 1927 , Chapter 319 as a part of Route 49 , which was to run from Route 4 ( now US 9 ) in Ocean View to Route 44 in Salem . In 1940 , a bridge was built over the Pennsylvania @-@ Reading Seashore Lines railroad tracks in South Dennis . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 49 was realigned to head along Route 47 from Millville to Tuckahoe , Route 47 was realigned to head along Route 49 between Millville and South Dennis and Route S49 from South Dennis and Wildwood , and Route 83 was created along the former alignment of Route 49 between South Dennis and Clermont . 
 On December 12 , 2004 , Route 83 was dedicated as the Trooper Bertram T. Zimmerman III Memorial Highway in honor of a New Jersey State Police trooper who was killed on the route earlier in the year while responding to an armed robbery . In the 2000s , plans were made to improve the intersections at both termini of Route 83 . The intersection with Route 47 saw realignment and the installation of a traffic light , along with improvements to Route 47 , that cost $ 6 @.@ 7 million and was completed in July 2007 . In 2006 , reconstruction of the Y intersection of US 9 and Route 83 to a T intersection and a new traffic light was planned following a school bus accident . The reconfigured intersection was completed on June 10 , 2008 .

 = No. 8 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF = 
 No. 8 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 8 EFTS ) was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) pilot training unit that operated during World War II . It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia 's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme . No. 8 EFTS was established in September 1940 at Narrandera , New South Wales . Training ceased in December 1944 and the school was reduced to maintaining base infrastructure and aircraft . It was officially disbanded in June 1945 and renamed Care and Maintenance Unit ( CMU ) Narrandera . The CMU was disbanded in December 1947 . 
 = = History = = 
 Flying instruction in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II , in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . The Air Force 's pre @-@ war pilot training facility , No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , was supplanted in 1940 – 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . The EFTS provided a twelve @-@ week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF 's initial training schools . Flying training was undertaken in two stages : the first involved four weeks of instruction ( including ten hours of flying ) to determine trainees ' suitability to become pilots . Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training ( including sixty @-@ five hours of flying ) at the EFTS . Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators . 
 No. 8 Elementary Flying Training School was formed at Narrandera , New South Wales , on 19 September 1940 , and came under the control of Central Area Command . The school occupied the site of the recently constructed civil airfield , as well as surrounding government land . Its inaugural commanding officer was Flying Officer G.F. Hughes . Despite primitive accommodation and lack of infrastructure at Narrandera , the first sixty students arrived at the school on the day of its establishment . Flying training did not get completely under way until mid @-@ November . The school 's strength as at month 's end was 469 staff , including thirty @-@ six officers . Recent newspaper reports had suggested that the Narrandera base would be closed owing to " unsuitable ground " and " the direction of the prevailing wind ... allied with the surrounding terrain " . A cyclone hit the airfield on 6 December , destroying twenty @-@ two de Havilland Tiger Moth trainers in a matter of minutes and damaging others . The RAAF resolved to replace the wrecked aircraft as soon as possible and , the next day , the Minister for Air denied the earlier reports that the base was unsuitable and would be closed . 
 No. 8 EFTS 's first course completed on 10 December 1940 ; fifty students graduated . As of the end of the month , the school had twenty @-@ nine instructors , 111 students under training , and forty @-@ one serviceable aircraft . An instructor was killed and three other men were injured when a Tiger Moth crashed while flying at low level over one of Narrandera 's satellite airfields on 4 January 1941 . Two of the school 's Tiger Moths collided at 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) on 8 March ; the instructor and student of one plane bailed out , while the other two pilots crash @-@ landed their aircraft , and there were no injuries . The school came under the control of the newly formed No. 2 ( Training ) Group in August , following the disbandment of Central Area Command . As of 31 December 1941 , the school had twenty @-@ eight instructors , 123 students under training , and thirty @-@ seven serviceable aircraft . By 30 April 1942 , the figures had risen to fifty @-@ eight instructors , 211 students , and over seventy aircraft ; strength remained at a similar level for the remainder of the year . On 8 September 1942 , a No. 8 EFTS Tiger Moth dived to the ground soon after take @-@ off from a satellite airfield and collided with a tender ; one man in the tender was killed and several others , as well as both pilots , were injured . Four pilots were killed and two Tiger Moths destroyed following a mid @-@ air collision at 600 feet ( 180 m ) over another of Narrandera 's satellite airfields on 9 March 1943 . A pilot from the school was killed in a crash near Junee on 24 March . Another No. 8 EFTS pilot was killed and his crewman badly injured on 17 August after their Tiger Math failed to recover from a spin . 
 When flying training at No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School , Tamworth , ceased in September 1944 , several of the pilots still undergoing instruction were posted to No. 8 EFTS . No. 8 EFTS received an Avro Anson the following month for use in ground instruction . Flying training was suspended in December 1944 ; the school was among several to be reduced to " nucleus " and continue to function primarily for the upkeep of base infrastructure and equipment under a reorganisation of EATS establishments in Australia . By this time No. 8 EFTS had eighty @-@ three Tiger Moths on its strength . Owing to the surplus of trained aircrew in Australia , No. 8 EFTS was officially disbanded on 16 June 1945 and re @-@ formed as Care and Maintenance Unit ( CMU ) Narrandera . CMU Narrandera was one of many such units that the RAAF raised for the storage and maintenance of surplus aircraft prior to their disposal after the war . It was disbanded on 5 July 1947 . 
 The No. 8 EFTS Tiger Moth Memorial was dedicated at Narrandera by retired Air Chief Marshal Sir Neville McNamara on 2 October 1988 .

 The Kirkenes – Bjørnevatn Line ( Norwegian : Kirkenes – <unk> ) , or the Sydvaranger Line ( <unk> ) , is a 8 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometer ( 5 @.@ 3 mi ) long railway line between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn in Sør @-@ Varanger , Norway . Owned by the private mining company Northern Iron , the single @-@ track railway is solely used to haul 20 daily iron ore trains from Bjørnevatn Mine to the port at Kirkenes . It was the world 's northern @-@ most railway until 2010 , when the <unk> – <unk> Line in Russia went further north . 
 The line was built by the mining company Sydvaranger , who started construction in 1907 and inaugurated the railway in 1910 . From 1912 , the port network received electrification , as did the mainline in 1920 . Originally , free passenger trains services were also offered . During the Second World War , the line was largely destroyed , but rebuilt afterwards and re @-@ opened in 1952 . Electric traction was abandoned in 1955 when two EMD G12 diesel locomotives were bought . The line closed in 1997 , but was reopened in 2009 , following a change in ownership of the mine . There are proposals to connect the line to either one or both of the Finnish and Russian railway networks . 
 = = Route = = 
 The Kirkenes – Bjørnevatn Line is 8 @.@ 484 kilometers ( 5 @.@ 272 mi ) long and runs from Bjørnevatn Mine to Kirkenes Port . While the line had passenger transport , it had two stations , Kirkenes Station and Bjørnevatn Station , which were located 7 @.@ 5 kilometers ( 4 @.@ 7 mi ) from each other . A third station , <unk> , was only used during the Second World War and immediately afterwards and was located 5 @.@ 01 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 11 mi ) from Kirkenes Station . The railway is standard gauge , non @-@ electrified and single track . 
 Starting at Bjørnevatn , the railway line starts underground at a silo , 77 @.@ 0 meters ( 252 @.@ 6 ft ) above mean sea level ( AMSL ) . From Bjørnevatn , the line starts to fall with a 0 @.@ 3 @-@ percent gradient . After passing the residential area , the gradient drops to 1 @.@ 5 percent . On this section , the line passes through its only tunnel , which is 68 meters ( 223 ft ) long . The line then runs along a flatter terrain , and crosses through a 450 @-@ meter ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) long cutting towards the lowest point of the line , at 50 @.@ 4 meters ( 165 ft ) AMSL . 
 The railway then runs under European Road E6 and starts climbing at a 1 @.@ 0 @-@ percent gradient until reaching 56 @.@ 2 meters ( 184 ft ) AMSL . From this point to Kirkenes it runs next to the E6 , and passes by the lakes <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . While the first part of this section is flat , towards Kirkenes the landscape is more rolling . The line passes Kirkenes Station , which is 59 @.@ 5 meters ( 195 ft ) AMSL . The swing towards the station is as a curve radius of 275 meters ( 902 ft ) , while the remaining part of the line has a minimum radius of 300 meters ( 980 ft ) . The line terminates at the silo in <unk> after running over an elevated section , nicknamed the Air Bridge .

 Iron ore was discovered at Bjørnevatn in 1866 . The ore was of poor quality , but lay close to the surface — allowing for open @-@ pit mining , had large deposits and was located close to a port . The mining company Sydvaranger was established by German and Swedish investors in 1906 . A separation plant was built in Kirkenes and the company decided to transport all ore from the mine to the port by rail . Inge T. <unk> , former manager of the Valdres Line , was hired as divisional leader for the construction of the railway , the port and the residential areas . 
 Construction of the railway was given high priority to as early as possible aid in transport of workers to the mining sites . Both stations were completed in 1908 , the same year as the laying of tracks started . The line originally had a rail profile of 30 kilograms per meter ( 60 lb / yd ) . The first steam locomotive , built at Hamar <unk> , was delivered during the fall of 1908 . For the tacks in the mine , a shunter needed and the company bought a fireless locomotive . At the time of the opening , the line was 7 @.@ 5 kilometers ( 4 @.@ 7 mi ) long , in addition to tracks at both Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn . Both stations received a turntable , while Kirkenes also received water tower , motive power depot and a workshop . Bjørnevatn Station received a depot for the fireless locomotive . Tracks were laid through the open @-@ pit mine , with the length varying . For instance , in 1910 there were 5 kilometers ( 3 mi ) of tracks in the mine . 
 Mining started on 7 July 1910 , with the first ore train being run on 13 July . The first shipload left Kirkenes on 11 October , but SS Bengal sank with the first shipment . In 1911 , the system exported 330 @,@ 000 tonnes of ore . The railway was also used for transporting workers , with trains running from the towns to the plants in the morning and returning after the working day was over . Prior to private cars becoming common , the railway operated a passenger carriage on the trains between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn — allowing free travel . The railway has never had any scheduled or public transport of passengers , but the company 's concession specifies that the authorities could at a later date require the company to operate public passenger services under specified conditions . 
 = = = Electrification = = = 
 In 1910 , construction started of an electric power supply for tracks at the port . Originally it had 500 volts direct current , but this was later reduced to 400 volts . Because an overhead wire could interfere with the cranes , third @-@ rail conduction was chosen . However , because of the possibility of iron slimes spilling onto the tracks , the railway chose to use two third rail conductors , one on each side of the track , and avoid the return current running through the tracks . The electric components were delivered by Siemens @-@ Schukert and were taken into use in 1912 . The company took delivery of two electric locomotives , both with a Bo wheel arrangement , in 1910 and 1911 . Sydvaranger operated one port train every 45 minutes , consisting of one locomotive and four hopper cars , with a combined 25 tonnes ( 25 long tons ; 28 short tons ) of ore . 
 The original system was designed for an export capacity of 650 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 640 @,@ 000 long tons ; 720 @,@ 000 short tons ) , and in 1913 , the company exported 427 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 420 @,@ 000 long tons ; 471 @,@ 000 short tons ) and had 1 @,@ 150 employees . The company initiated plans to start electrification of the mainline , but the plans were placed on hold during the First World War . Sales plummeted during the war . At first , the mining company stored the overproduction , but later production was reduced significantly . In 1918 , the tracks at the mine were electrified at 750 volts direct current . Two 50 @-@ tonne ( 49 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 55 @-@ short @-@ ton ) Bo 'Bo ' locomotives were delivered by Siemens @-@ Schukert and Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk in 1917 . The following year , another Bo @-@ locomotive was built for the port . Power was secured with the construction of <unk> Power Station . However , lack of materials after the war delayed the electrification of the mainline railway until 1920 . Also the port received overhead wires , as the third rail caused problems for snow removal . The new electric system was taken into use on 23 December 1920 . 
 In the 1920s , the economy fell into a low <unk> , forcing Sydvaranger to file for bankruptcy in 1925 . However , the facilities were quickly reopened . Two new Bo @-@ locomotives , which could operate both on the mainline and at the port , were delivered in 1930 . Built by Siemens @-@ Schukert , they were christened Lisa and Sonja . Two mainline Bo 'Bo ' locomotives were delivered by Siemens @-@ Schukert in 1935 , which were named Oscar and Ivar . They were followed by the Bo Laila and Gerd two years later — which could operate both on the mainline and at the port . During the late 1930s , the railway company started replacing the rails with heavier 35 kilograms per meter ( 70 lb / yd ) rails , although this work was not completed . The final electric locomotive was a Siemens @-@ Schukert @-@ built Bo unit delivered for the port in 1940 . In 1938 , the last year before production was reduced because of the Second World War , the mine exported 900 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 890 @,@ 000 long tons ; 990 @,@ 000 short tons ) .

 After the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany , mining continued under German administration until January 1942 . Kirkenes and the areas along the railway and at the mine were being used to store material for Wehrmacht . To allow better capacity to ship out the materials , in 1942 , a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometer ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) branch line was built to <unk> . Known as the Port Line ( Norwegian : <unk> , German : <unk> ) , the line was completed in 1943 and demolished after the war . Wehrmacht also established <unk> Station , which was used during the and slightly after the war . From the spring of 1944 , German authorities ordered that mining was to resume , and allocated two steam locomotives and thirty hooper cars to the line . There was also built a new depot for the German rolling stock . 
 As part of Operation Nordlicht , Kirkenes was scorched , causing extensive damage to the mining company 's infrastructure . During the reconstruction , Sydvaranger needed to transport large machinery to Bjørnevatn , so the loading gauge was increased to 6 meters ( 20 ft ) . All heavy transport during the reconstruction was done using railway , and tracks were laid throughout the mining facility . From 1945 , passenger trains ran between the two settlements , at first with steam locomotives , and from 1950 with electric locomotives . New storage silos were built in Bjørnevatn , but from operations started , transport within the mine was performed using trackless machinery . A new port facility was built in Kirkenes , with the line terminating at the Air Bridge , an elevated railway which led to the plant . Mining operations and revenue service on the railway did not start until 1952 . 
 The Directorate for Enemy Property took over the German portion of the ownership of Sydvaranger after the war . In 1948 , ownership of the company was transferred to the state . The initial post @-@ war plans were to use the existing rolling stock . The only remaining locomotive which could haul an ore train from the mine to the port was Oskar , which could haul up to 14 hooper cars and a train weight of 800 tonnes ( 790 long tons ; 880 short tons ) . However , the locomotive proved unreliable , so Sydvaranger decided to order new locomotives . The electric traction was taken out of use in 1955 , but the overhead wires remained until 1963 . Two G12 diesel @-@ electric locomotives were delivered from General Motors Electro @-@ Motive Division in 1954 and 1956 . The Bo 'Bo ' units had a power output of 977 kilowatts ( 1 @,@ 310 hp ) . In addition , new hooper cars were built by Skabo . 
 To allow for larger trains , the permanent way was upgraded . The rail profiles were upgraded to 49 kilograms per meter ( 78 lb / yd ) , were continuously welded and the gravel ballast was replaced with crushed stone . The distance of the line was after the upgrades 8 @,@ 484 meters ( 5 @.@ 272 mi ) . The upgrades allowed the maximum axle load to be increased to 22 tonnes ( 22 long tons ; 24 short tons ) and the train weight to increased to 1 @,@ 800 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 800 long tons ; 2 @,@ 000 short tons ) . A nominal train consisted of 20 hooper cars with air brakes . In 1960 , work started on demolishing the tracks at the port , followed by all tracks at the workshop at Kirkenes the following year . From then , all non @-@ ore transport in the company was taken over using road transport . The three remaining electric shunters and the steam locomotive were chopped up . Two diesel shunters were sold to Norsk <unk> in Mo i Rana . Up until this point , the railway had operated 33 steam locomotives , 14 electric locomotives and 4 diesel locomotives . 
 In 1980 , the mine 's production peaked with an export of 2 @.@ 4 million tonnes and 1 @,@ 000 employees . In 1984 , to improve the workplace environment , a used Allmänna Svenska <unk> <unk> ( ASEA ) <unk> <unk> locomotive was bought from Sweden . However , it suffered several breakdowns and was retired in 1989 . As a replacement , a new G 1203 BB was bought from Maschinenbau Kiel and was delivered to Kirkenes on 8 February 1991 . In 1988 , the first part of the Kirkenes plant was closed , and the mining company drastically reduced production because its owner , the Ministry of Trade and Industry , would no longer subsidize operations . All mining ceased in the spring of 1996 , and the last load of ore was hauled in April 1997 . After operations closed , the oldest G12 was transferred to Sør @-@ Varanger Museum . 
 = = = Reopening = = = 
 Arctic Bulk Minerals bought the mining rights , and operated a train once to twice a year to keep the track and rolling stock maintained . This company filed for bankruptcy in 2002 . The mining company was then bought by the local power company Varanger Kraft and Sør @-@ Varanger Municipality . In 2006 , they sold the mining company to Tschudi Group for 102 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) . The Tschudi Group established Northern Iron , registered in Perth , Australia , as a holding company to own the mining company . Operations in the mine and on the line resumed in 2009 , after the price of iron had risen dramatically since the closing of the mine . With the opening of the mine , production is estimated at 3 million tonnes of export per year . The Kirkenes – Bjørnevatn Line was the northern @-@ most railway in the world until 2010 , when Russia 's <unk> – <unk> Line was opened . 
 To haul the trains , the mining company took delivery of a Vossloh <unk> BB . Built new in 2009 , it was delivered to Kirkenes on 12 February 2010 . The unit deviates from standard production by having its maximum speed reduced by software from 100 to 45 kilometers per hour ( 62 to 28 mph ) ; it is further equipped with snowploughs , air supply to open the hopper car doors , radio remote control and <unk> couplers . As a back @-@ up , the company will retain the MaK G 1203 . The old hooper cars were renovated and put into service , while the track received new concrete ties . The train runs up to 20 trips per day . 
 On 18 November 2015 the mining company went into bankruptcy .

 In the Railway Plan of 1923 , Parliament decided to extend the Nordland Line from Fauske to Vadsø with a branch to Kirkenes . During the Second World War , the Wehrmacht revitalized the plans to build a railway to Kirkenes . No more than the unfinished Polar Line was built and there was never any railways built north of Narvik and the Ofoten Line . However , detailed plans were made for the line , including surveying geological conditions and choice of the route . 
 Since 1992 , there have been proposals to extend the Kirkenes – Bjørnevatn Line to either Nikel or <unk> , Russia , where it would connect to the Murmansk – Nikel Line . About 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) of railway is missing to connect the two lines . The proposal calls to develop Kirkenes as a port for export of Russian products , as the Murmansk is less suited and under @-@ dimensioned . Major transshipment products include metals from MMC Norilsk Nickel , steel from Arkhangelsk and crude oil . The Murmansk – Nikel Line was built in 1936 , is 206 kilometers ( 128 mi ) long , is not electrified and is operated by the Russian Railways . As it is Russian gauge , the Kirkenes – Bjørnevatn Line would be presumably undergo gauge conversion or get dual gauge . A new railway would be able to transport 5 million tonnes of cargo per year . 
 In 2003 , the cost of the necessary 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) of new railway was estimated at 1 @.@ 4 billion Norwegian krone ( NOK ) , while the cost of upgrading the existing Russian line was NOK 400 million . In 2007 , Murmansk Oblast 's governor , Yury <unk> , rejected the plans for a connection to Russia , stating that his opinion was supported by President Vladimir Putin . Because Kirkenes is a better suited port than Murmansk , local authorities in Murmansk do not want to lose transshipment business to Norway . However , with the increased realism of a line to Rovaniemi , which would serve as an alternative route to Kirkenes from Russia , Russian authorities have since 2010 again supported a railway line between Kirkenes and Russia . 
 A <unk> also exists about the possibility to connect Kirkenes to the Finnish railway network , named the Arctic Ocean Line . Possible routes include from either Rovaniemi , <unk> , Kemijärvi or multiple of these , via <unk> , <unk> and Ivalo , then either east or west of Lake Inari or via Nikel to Kirkenes . The length of the line would be between 480 and 550 kilometers ( 300 and 340 mi ) . The background is the boom of mining in Finnish Lapland and the need for access to a deep , ice @-@ free port . Railway lines exists to the Baltic Sea , but the bay is both shallow and ice @-@ covered during winter . The line would also allow for export of lumber and other products from Finland , while it would provide a route to export fish from Norway to Finland and Eastern Europe . In 2011 , the costs of the line were estimated at € 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 6 billion . A significantly deviating alternative is to build westwards from <unk> to <unk> ( 300 km ) .

It was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , directed by Michael Lange , and featured guest appearances by Barry Primus and Lisa Waltz . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Shadows " earned a Nielsen household rating of 5 @.@ 9 , being watched by 5 @.@ 6 million households in its initial broadcast . The episode was not well received by the production staff , and received mixed reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate the death of two muggers and encounter an office worker who may be haunted by the spirit of her dead boss , who is using her to uncover his murderer ; and discover covert arms deals made with Middle Eastern radicals . 
 This episode , inspired by the 1982 horror film The Entity , was written due to insistence that the creators write more episodes where Mulder and Scully help people . This allowed the writers some space to create other episodes they had in mind .

 Two muggers are found dead in a back alley of Philadelphia after robbing a woman , Lauren Kyte , at an automated teller machine . Mulder and Scully investigate the case when called in by a pair of agents from an unknown agency . The bodies of the muggers are found to have an electrical charge and their throats have been crushed from the inside . Lauren sees her boss , Robert Dorlund , and resigns due to her grief over the death of Dorlund 's partner , Howard Graves , who committed suicide weeks before . 
 Mulder and Scully determine that one of the dead men belonged to an Islamic terrorist group , the Isfahan , and using the ATM video are able to track down Lauren . A screenshot of the video reveals a blurry figure who appears to be Howard Graves . The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it , she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders . Upon leaving , the agents find their car going out of control on its own . The car is found to have no evidence of tampering , but an electrical charge is detected within it . 
 Later , upon visiting the grave of Graves , Mulder and Scully learn of his suicide and the death of his daughter at a young age , a daughter who would be Lauren 's age were she still alive . Scully suspects that Graves faked his death , but on consulting the pathologist who examined his body and testing the organs he donated to others it is proved that he indeed died . Lauren meanwhile witnesses a vision at night , including blood appearing in the bathtub , that leads her to believe that Graves was murdered . At her going @-@ away party , Lauren is threatened by Dorlund , who believes she has knowledge of confidential information that could implicate him . Lauren calls Mulder and Scully to her home , but before the agents can get there , two assassins hired by Dorlund arrive to kill her . An invisible force kills both of them , just as Mulder and Scully arrive ( with Mulder witnessing the body of one of the assassins being hanged in midair ) . 
 Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully , and the two unknown agents that called them in , who say they are involved because they believe Graves and Dorlund 's company sold technology to the Isfahan . Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed . After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves ' spirit , Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story . Mulder is confused but , after Lauren leaves , Scully admits she was just <unk> her . The agents search the company 's premises , but are unable to find any evidence . When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves ' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper , revealing a disc with evidence . Weeks later , Lauren starts her new job , but it appears that Graves ' spirit may have followed her there .

 This episode was created on Fox 's insistence that the creators write more episodes where Mulder and Scully help people . This episode was written to accomplish that , and to allow the writers some space to create other episodes they had in mind . Co @-@ writer Glen Morgan claims the episode was inspired by the movie The Entity . The name Tom Braidwood , the show 's assistant director who later played Lone Gunmen member Melvin Frohike , is used in the scene where the parking lot attendant paints over the name of Howard Graves . The episode featured guest appearances by Barry Primus , Lisa Waltz , Lorena Gale and Veena Sood . 
 Fox emphasized the horror aspect of " Shadows " by using the tagline " Don 't watch it alone " when advertising the episode . During the episode , Mulder jokes that Elvis was the only man ever to have successfully faked his own death . The joke would eventually become the first of many similar Elvis jokes littered throughout most of the series . When Mulder wonders whether or not it could have been a poltergeist , Scully mocks him by replying " they 're here " . This is a tagline and famous quote from the film Poltergeist . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 " Shadows " premiered on the Fox network on October 22 , 1993 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on October 24 , 1994 . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5 @.@ 9 with an 11 share — meaning that in the US , 5 @.@ 9 percent of television @-@ equipped households , and 11 percent of all households actively watching television , were watching the program . It was viewed by 5 @.@ 6 million households . 
 In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly , " Shadows " was rated a C + , with the episode being called " exceedingly awkward " , while the political context was seen as a weak point . Keith Phipps , writing for The A.V. Club , had mixed feeling about the episode , rating it a C + . He felt that the episode 's plot worked well , though the supernatural elements seemed " a little corny " . Matt Haigh , writing for Den of Geek , was more positive about the episode , calling it " fun viewing " and feeling that " with characters we could care about and a far more rounded plot , this proved one of the better episodes so far . I still wouldn ’ t call it a particularly brilliant one , though , either " . 
 Co @-@ writer James Wong felt that the changes he was asked to make to the script led to " Shadows " turning out to be " an average episode " , although he felt " the director did a good job with it " . His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion , calling it " a little too ordinary , like you have seen it before , which is exactly what the network wanted at the time . Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode , calling it " very well done , really great effects , and more of a meat @-@ and @-@ potatoes kind of story . An FBI sting and a good mystery that Mulder and Scully investigate . Overall , a really solid episode . " The plot for " Shadows " was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Ellen Steiber , under the title Haunted .

 The episode connects several central elements around the story of Benjamin Franklin 's kite experiment on the nature of lightning and electricity . A paperweight which Lauren takes from the desk of Mr. Graves , bearing an inscription of an epigram by Franklin , appears to serve as a conduit for his psychokinetic powers , which include high voltage electrical charges . Additionally , Lauren Kyte 's surname is a homophone of " kite , " and though she works in Philadelphia , her home is given briefly by agent Scully as " 858 Franklin " in Bensalem Township , Pennsylvania , a suburb in Bucks County . Local tradition has long claimed , erroneously , that Franklin carried out his kite experiment on the grounds of <unk> Mansion in Bensalem and that the township was named in part in honor of " Ben .

 = Hurricane Dalilia ( 1989 ) = 
 Hurricane Dalilia was the only tropical cyclone during 1989 to affect the Hawaiian Islands . A tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression on July 11 and into Hurricane Dalilia on July 13 . Dalilia crossed 140 ° W shortly after reaching its maximum intensity and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility . The storm accelerated , and headed directly towards the Hawaiian Islands . Hurricane Dalilia passed just south of the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm before dissipating July 21 as it interacted with a trough . It then interacted with the remains of Tropical Storm Erick and reformed into a depression on July 24 . A trough then accelerated the remnants towards the Aleutian Islands on July 28 . The cyclone 's effects were minimal . There was high surf , and some gusty winds . Damage was minor , and mainly limited to downed power lines . However , many areas throughout the island chain received more than 5 in ( 130 mm ) of precipitation . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Dalilia originated out of a tropical disturbance embedded in the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) during early July 1989 off the west coast of Africa . As the system became increasingly organized , the disturbance 's outflow suppressed the ITCZ . By July 9 , the disturbance had entered the eastern Pacific ocean and sufficient convective development to prompt Dvorak Technique intensity estimates . Continued development took place in the following days ; on July 11 , the National Hurricane Center determined that the disturbance spawned a tropical depression 792 mi ( 1 @,@ 275 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas . Upon being designated a depression , it was still partially embedded within the ITCZ , inhibiting rapid development . In fact , the National Hurricane Center did not operationally begin advisories on the depression until almost 24 hours later . After the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories , the depression quickly became more well @-@ defined , as it began separating from the ITCZ on July 12 . In addition , significant further intensification was expected , as sea surface temperatures ( SST 's ) were greater than 78 @.@ 8 ° F ( 26 ° C ) . Only a few hours later , satellite imagery showed a significant increase in convection . Tracking in a general west @-@ northwest direction , the depression intensified into a tropical storm late on July 12 , at which time it was given the name Dalilia by the NHC . 
 Dalilia rapidly intensified after becoming a tropical storm , and several computer models predicted it to reach winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) by July 15 . Six hours later , the National Hurricane Center upgraded Dalilia to a hurricane , after winds were estimated at 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , and satellite imagery suggested that the hurricane was continuing to organize . However , post @-@ storm analysis show this upgrade as several hours premature . While Dalilia developed well @-@ defined spiral convective bands , it had remained a minimal hurricane , since no eye had formed . Despite earlier forecasts for low wind shear values , upper @-@ level winds appeared less favorable for further intensification , after water vapor imagery showed several upper @-@ level low pressure areas to the north and northeast of Dalilia . Although the National Hurricane Center operationally held the intensity of Dalilia at minimal hurricane status for a while ; post @-@ analysis data show that Dalilia was slowly intensifying . By July 16 , the storm developed a central dense overcast , leading to further intensification . Although the storm tracked near cool waters , a well @-@ developed outflow allowed it to maintain hurricane @-@ intensity . 
 Shortly before crossing into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a central pressure of 977 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 85 inHg ) . After crossing 140 ° W , Dalilia weakened to a minimal hurricane . The storm maintained this intensity until July 19 , at which time the system slowed and turned northwest . The following day , the weakening tropical storm brushed the Hawaiian Islands to the south , eventually curving away from the island chain on July 21 . Later that day , Dalilia further weakened to a tropical depression , with the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issuing their final advisory at that time . The remnants of the former hurricane continued to track northwest . On July 24 , the system interacted with the remnants of Tropical Storm Erick and may have briefly re @-@ attained tropical storm intensity ; however , by July 28 , the storm was rapidly tracking north through the Aleutian Islands . The remnants of Dalilia dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 In preparation of the storm , a high surf advisory and a tropical storm watch were issued for the Hawaiian Islands . Officials urged residents to stock up on supplies and they closed beaches . Even though the Central Pacific Hurricane Center remarked that that watch will likely be upgraded into a hurricane warning , this failed to occur ; instead , the watch was discontinued on July 20 because meteorologists were now expecting the storm to pass south of the island chain . 
 While tracking near the Hawaiian Islands , Dalilia produced waves up to 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) along south @-@ facing coastlines . Along the coasts of Ka 'u and South Kona , winds gusted up to 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) ; the winds caused minor damage , mainly downed power lines . Most areas on Oahu received up to 3 in ( 76 mm ) of rain with localized areas reporting up to 8 in ( 200 mm ) . Hurricane Dalilia contributed to a record rainfall total for the month of July in Honolulu with 2 @.@ 33 in ( 59 mm ) falling during the storm 's passage . The heaviest rainfall was recorded on the north side of Kauai , with localized areas receiving rainfall in excess of 10 in ( 250 mm ) . Along the southeast slopes of Mauna Loa , upwards of 9 in ( 230 mm ) of rain fell . The remnants of the storm continued to produce unseasonable rains in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands through July 28 . Heavy rains caused minor flooding which forced transit officials to shut down several roads . Many power lines were down , which produced minor wind damage . Despite causing power outages , there were no reports of injuries or major property damage . Overall , impact from Tropical Storm Dalilia was less than anticipated . 
 = Anti @-@ tobacco movement in Nazi Germany = 
 After German doctors became the first to identify the link between smoking and lung cancer , Germany initiated a strong anti @-@ tobacco movement and led the first public anti @-@ smoking campaign in modern history . Anti @-@ tobacco movements grew in many nations from the beginning of the 20th century , but these had little success , except in Germany , where the campaign was supported by the government after the Nazis came to power . It was the most powerful anti @-@ smoking movement in the world during the 1930s and early 1940s . The National Socialist leadership condemned smoking and several of them openly criticized tobacco consumption . Research on smoking and its effects on health thrived under Nazi rule and was the most important of its type at that time . Adolf Hitler 's personal distaste for tobacco and the Nazi reproductive policies were among the motivating factors behind their campaign against smoking , and this campaign was associated with both antisemitism and racism . 
 The Nazi anti @-@ tobacco campaign included banning smoking in trams , buses and city trains , promoting health education , limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht , organizing medical lectures for soldiers , and raising the tobacco tax . The National Socialists also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces , and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses . The anti @-@ tobacco movement did not have much effect in the early years of the Nazi regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939 , but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945 . Even by the end of the 20th century , the anti @-@ smoking movement in postwar Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti @-@ smoking campaign . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Anti @-@ tobacco sentiment existed in Germany in the early 20th century . Critics of smoking organized the first anti @-@ tobacco group in the country named the Deutscher <unk> zum <unk> der <unk> ( German Tobacco Opponents ' Association for the Protection of Non @-@ smokers ) . Established in 1904 , this organization existed for a brief period only . The next anti @-@ tobacco organization , the Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner ( Federation of German Tobacco Opponents ) , was established in 1910 in <unk> , Bohemia . Other anti @-@ smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of Hanover and Dresden . In 1920 , a Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der <unk> ( Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Czechoslovakia ) was formed in Prague , after Czechoslovakia was separated from Austria at the end of World War I. A Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in <unk> ( Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in German Austria ) was established in Graz in 1920 . 
 These groups published journals advocating nonsmoking . The first such German language journal was Der Tabakgegner ( The Tobacco Opponent ) , published by the Bohemian organization between 1912 and 1932 . Deutscher Tabakgegner ( German Tobacco Opponent ) was published in Dresden from 1919 to 1935 , and was the second journal on this subject . The anti @-@ tobacco organizations were also against consumption of alcoholic beverages . 
 = = Reasons = = 
 = = = Hitler 's attitude towards smoking = = = 
 Adolf Hitler was a heavy smoker in his early life — he used to smoke 25 to 40 cigarettes daily — but gave up the habit , concluding that it was " a waste of money " . In later years , Hitler viewed smoking as " decadent " and " the wrath of the Red Man against the White Man , vengeance for having been given hard liquor " , lamenting that " so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning " . He was unhappy because both Eva Braun and Martin Bormann were smokers and was concerned over Hermann Göring 's continued smoking in public places . He was angered when a statue portraying a cigar @-@ smoking Göring was commissioned . Hitler is often considered to be the first national leader to advocate nonsmoking , however James VI and I , king of Scotland and England , was openly against smoking 330 years prior . 
 Hitler disapproved of the military personnel 's freedom to smoke , and during World War II he said on 2 March 1942 , " it was a mistake , traceable to the army leadership at the time , at the beginning of the war " . He also said that it was " not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking " . He promised to end the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war . Hitler personally encouraged close friends not to smoke . He even began to offer a gold watch to any of his inner circle who could quit . However , Hitler 's personal distaste for tobacco was only one of several catalysts behind the anti @-@ smoking campaign . 
 = = = Reproductive policies = = = 
 The Nazi reproductive policies were a significant factor behind their anti @-@ tobacco campaign . Women who smoked were considered to be vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness ; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family . Werner <unk> of the Nazi Party 's <unk> Amt ( Office of Racial Politics ) said that a smoking mother 's breast milk contained nicotine , a claim that modern research has proven correct . Martin <unk> , a prominent physician during the Third Reich , opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages . This opinion was also supported by well @-@ known female racial hygienist Agnes <unk> , whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view . The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible . An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women . 
 = = Research = = 
 Research and studies on tobacco 's effects on the population 's health were more advanced in Germany than in any other nation by the time the Nazis came to power . The link between lung cancer and tobacco was first proven in Nazi Germany , contrary to the popular belief that American and British scientists first discovered it in the 1950s . The term " passive smoking " ( " <unk> " ) was coined in Nazi Germany . Research projects funded by the Nazis revealed many disastrous effects of smoking on health . Nazi Germany supported epidemiological research on the harmful effects of tobacco use . Hitler personally gave financial support to the <unk> Institut zur <unk> der <unk> ( Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research ) at the University of Jena , headed by Karl <unk> . Established in 1941 , it was the most significant anti @-@ tobacco institute in Nazi Germany . 
 Franz H. Müller in 1939 and Eberhard Schairer in 1943 first used case @-@ control epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers . In 1939 , Müller published a study report in a reputed cancer journal in Germany which claimed that prevalence of lung cancer was higher among smokers . Müller , described as the " forgotten father of experimental epidemiology " , was a member of the National Socialist Motor Corps ( NSKK ) and the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) . Müller 's 1939 medical dissertation was the world 's first controlled epidemiological study of the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer . Apart from mentioning the increasing incidence of lung cancer and many of the causes behind it such as dust , exhaust gas from cars , tuberculosis , X @-@ ray and pollutants emitted from factories , Müller 's paper pointed out that " the significance of tobacco smoke has been pushed more and more into the foreground " . 
 Physicians in the Third Reich were aware that smoking was responsible for cardiac diseases , which were considered to be the most serious diseases resulting from smoking . Use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increasing reports of myocardial infarction in the country . In the later years of World War II , researchers considered nicotine a factor behind the coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in the Eastern Front . A pathologist of the Heer examined thirty @-@ two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front , and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were " enthusiastic smokers " . He cited the opinion of pathologist Franz Buchner that cigarettes are " a coronary poison of the first order " . 
 = = Measures = = 
 The Nazis used several public relations tactics to convince the general population of Germany not to smoke . Well @-@ known health magazines like the <unk> Volk ( Healthy People ) , <unk> ( People 's Health ) and <unk> Leben ( Healthy Life ) published warnings about the health consequences of smoking and posters showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed . Anti @-@ smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces , often with the help of the Hitler @-@ Jugend ( HJ ) and the Bund Deutscher <unk> ( BDM ) . The anti @-@ smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education . In June 1939 , a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the <unk> für <unk> ( Reich Office for Drug Control ) also helped in the anti @-@ tobacco campaign . Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines Die <unk> ( The Recreational Stimulants ) , Auf der Wacht ( On the Guard ) and Reine Luft ( Clean Air ) . Out of these magazines , Reine Luft was the main journal of the anti @-@ tobacco movement . Karl <unk> 's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research at Jena University purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from Reine Luft . 
 After recognizing the harmful effects of smoking on health , several items of anti @-@ smoking legislation were enacted . The later 1930s increasingly saw anti @-@ tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis . In 1938 , the Luftwaffe and the <unk> imposed a ban on smoking . Smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions , but also in several public offices and in rest homes . <unk> were restricted from smoking while on duty . In 1939 , the Nazi Party outlawed smoking in all of its offices premises , and Heinrich Himmler , the then chief of the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) , restricted police personnel and SS officers from smoking while they were on duty . Smoking was also outlawed in schools . 
 In 1941 , tobacco smoking in trams was outlawed in sixty German cities . Smoking was also outlawed in bomb shelters ; however , some shelters had separate rooms for smoking . Special care was taken to prevent women from smoking . The President of the Medical Association in Germany announced , " German women don 't smoke " . Pregnant women and women below the age of 25 and over the age of 55 were not given tobacco ration cards during World War II . Restrictions on selling tobacco products to women were imposed on the hospitality and food retailing industry . Anti @-@ tobacco films aimed at women were publicly shown . Editorials discussing the issue of smoking and its effects were published in newspapers . Strict measures were taken in this regard and a district department of the National Socialist Factory Cell Organization ( <unk> ) announced that it would expel female members who smoked publicly . The next step in the anti @-@ tobacco campaign came in July 1943 , when public smoking for persons under the age of 18 was outlawed . In the next year , smoking in buses and city trains was made illegal , on the personal initiative of Hitler , who feared female ticket takers might be the victims of passive smoking . 
 Restrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products , enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich <unk> , the President of the Advertising Council . Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression of masculinity were banned . <unk> anti @-@ tobacco activists was also outlawed , as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks , in rural regions , stadiums and racing tracks . Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited . 
 Restrictions on smoking were also introduced in the Wehrmacht . Cigarette rations in the military were limited to six per soldier per day . Extra cigarettes were often sold to the soldiers , especially when there was no military advance or retreat in the battleground , however these were restricted to 50 for each person per month . <unk> soldiers serving in the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend , composed of Hitler Youth members , were given confectionery instead of tobacco products . Access to cigarettes was not allowed for the Wehrmacht 's female auxiliary personnel . Medical lectures were arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking . An ordinance enacted on 3 November 1941 raised tobacco taxes by approximately 80 – 95 % of the retail price . It would be the highest rise in tobacco taxes in Germany until more than 25 years after the collapse of the Nazi regime . 
 = = Effectiveness = = 
 The early anti @-@ smoking campaign was considered a failure , and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany . The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring France , where the anti @-@ tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential . Between 1932 and 1939 , per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year , while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630 . 
 The cigarette manufacturing companies in Germany made several attempts to weaken the anti @-@ tobacco campaign . They published new journals and tried to depict the anti @-@ tobacco movement as " fanatic " and " unscientific " . The tobacco industry also tried to counter the government campaign to prevent women from smoking and used smoking models in their advertisements . Despite government regulations , many women in Germany regularly smoked , including the wives of many high @-@ ranking Nazi officials . For instance , Magda Goebbels smoked even while she was interviewed by a journalist . Fashion illustrations displaying women with cigarettes were often published in prominent publications such as the Beyers Mode für Alle ( Beyers Fashion For All ) . The cover of the popular song Lili <unk> featured singer Lale Andersen holding a cigarette . 
 The Nazis implemented more anti @-@ tobacco policies at the end of the 1930s and by the early years of World War II , the rate of tobacco usage declined . As a result of the anti @-@ tobacco measures implemented in the Wehrmacht , the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945 . According to a survey conducted in 1944 , the number of smokers increased in the Wehrmacht , but average tobacco consumption per military personnel declined by 23 @.@ 4 % compared to the immediate pre @-@ World War II years . The number of people who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day declined from 4 @.@ 4 % to 0 @.@ 3 % . 
 The Nazi anti @-@ tobacco policies were not free of contradictions . For example , the <unk> ( People 's Health ) and <unk> ( Duty to be Healthy ) policies were enforced in parallel with the active distribution of cigarettes to people who the Nazis saw as " deserving " groups ( e.g. frontline soldiers , members of the Hitler Youth ) . On the other hand , " undeserving " and stigmatized groups ( Jews , war prisoners ) were denied access to tobacco . 
 = = Association with antisemitism and racism = = 
 Apart from public health concerns , the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology ; specifically , the movement was influenced by concepts of racial hygiene and bodily purity . Nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for the master race to smoke and that tobacco consumption was equal to " racial degeneracy " . The Nazis viewed tobacco as a " genetic poison " . Racial hygienists opposed tobacco use , fearing that it would " corrupt " the " German germ <unk> " . Nazi anti @-@ tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a vice of the degenerate Negroes . 
 The Nazis claimed that the Jews were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects . The Seventh @-@ day Adventist Church in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews . Johann von <unk> , editor of the <unk> Welt ( Nordic World ) , during the opening ceremony of the <unk> Institut zur <unk> der <unk> in 1941 , proclaimed that " Jewish capitalism " was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across Europe . He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in Amsterdam , the principal European entry point of Nicotiana . 
 = = After World War II = = 
 After the collapse of Nazi Germany at the end of World War II , American cigarette manufacturers quickly entered the German black market . Illegal smuggling of tobacco became prevalent , and the anti @-@ smoking campaign started by the Nazis ceased to exist after the fall of the Third Reich . In 1949 , approximately 400 million cigarettes manufactured in the United States entered Germany illegally every month . In 1954 , nearly two billion Swiss cigarettes were smuggled into Germany and Italy . As part of the Marshall Plan , the United States sent tobacco to Germany free of charge ; the amount of tobacco shipped into Germany in 1948 was 24 @,@ 000 tons and was as high as 69 @,@ 000 tons in 1949 . Per capita yearly cigarette consumption in post @-@ war Germany steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1 @,@ 523 in 1963 . At the end of the 20th century , the anti @-@ tobacco campaign in Germany was unable to approach the level of the Nazi @-@ era climax in the years 1939 – 41 and German tobacco health research was described by Robert N. Proctor as " muted " . 
 = SS Batavier II ( 1897 ) = 
 SS Batavier II was a steam packet for the Batavier Line that sailed between Rotterdam and London for most of her career . The ship was built in 1897 by the Gourlay Brothers of Dundee . The Dutch ship could carry a limited amount of freight and up to 321 passengers . She was rebuilt in 1909 which increased her length by over 5 metres ( 16 ft ) . 
 During World War I , the Batavier Line attempted to maintain service , but in September 1916 , Batavier II was seized as a prize by German submarine UB @-@ 6 and sailed into Zeebrugge and retained . Ten months later , Batavier II was shelled by British submarine E55 and sank near Texel . 
 = = Career = = 
 Batavier II and her sister ship Batavier III were built for William Müller and Company by the Gourlay Brothers of Dundee , Scotland . The ship was launched on 17 August 1897 . As built , she was 74 @.@ 4 metres ( 244 ft 1 in ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 10 @.@ 2 metres ( 33 ft 6 in ) abeam . Batavier II was powered by a single 4 @-@ cylinder , triple @-@ expansion steam engine of 2 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 500 kW ) that moved her up to 14 knots ( 26 km / h ) . She could carry up to 321 passengers : 44 in first class , 27 in second class , and up to 250 in steerage . She was listed at 1 @,@ 136 gross register tons ( GRT ) . 
 Upon completion in October 1897 , she joined the 683 @-@ ton Batavier I in packet service between Rotterdam and London . The pair were joined by Batavier III after her completion in November . In Rotterdam , the ships docked at the <unk> ; in London , the ships originally docked near London Bridge , but in 1899 switched to the Customs House and Wool Quays near the Tower Bridge . Also beginning in 1899 , Batavier Line service between Rotterdam and London was offered daily except Sundays ; each of the ships made three round trips per week . In addition to passengers , Batavier II could also carry a limited quantity of freight . One example that may be typical was a load of 1 long ton ( 1 @.@ 1 short tons ) of dry chemical wood pulp in 5 bales carried to London in March 1907 . In 1909 , Batavier II was rebuilt to 1 @,@ 335 GRT and lengthened by 5 @.@ 3 metres ( 17 ft 5 in ) to 79 @.@ 7 metres ( 261 ft 6 in ) . 
 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the Batavier Line continued service on the Rotterdam – London route . In December 1914 , Batavier II made news when porters handling what was identified as a 750 @-@ pound ( 340 kg ) crate of Swedish matches discovered an escaped German Army officer inside . The plan , apparently , was for him to be shipped from London to Rotterdam via Batavier II . The plot unraveled when the porters could only move the heavy crate by rolling it , which knocked the man unconscious ; the officer was returned to the custody of British military officials . 
 In June 1915 , passengers on Batavier II witnessed an attack by two German airplanes against a British steamship between the Galloper and the North Hinder <unk> . The attack was broken off when two British airplanes arrived over the ship to engage the German aircraft ; none of the airplanes were destroyed , and the ship was unscathed . 
 On 24 September 1916 , after Batavier II had departed from Rotterdam , the ship was stopped by the German submarine UB @-@ 6 . She was seized as prize and sailed into German @-@ held Zeebrugge . There , Batavier II 's Dutch crew and women and children passengers were released and sent via train to Rotterdam . The Germans confiscated the ship 's cargo of food . Also on board Batavier II were four escaped Russian prisoners of war and Richard Hansemann , a German @-@ born New York businessman . American newspapers carried reports of Hansemann 's plight , reporting by 1 October that he would likely be impressed into the German Army . 
 Batavier II 's whereabouts and activities over the next ten months are uncertain . She remained under German control for a time , but how long is not clear from sources . Batavier II was back under Dutch control by late July 1917 . 
 On 27 July 1917 , Batavier II was shelled by British submarine E55 just outside Dutch territorial waters . Damaged by E55 's gunfire , Batavier II 's crew steered her back into Dutch territorial waters . E55 then sent a prize crew on board Batavier II and sailed her back outside Dutch waters . By the time a Dutch torpedo boat arrived on the scene , Batavier II was taking on water and had drifted back into Dutch territory . The torpedo boat sent the message " respect neutrality " to E55 which retrieved her prize crew and departed . Despite efforts to stem the flow of water , Batavier II sank 1 nautical mile ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) from the <unk> North Buoy , off Texel . 
 = Battle of White Marsh = 
 The Battle of White Marsh or Battle of Edge Hill was a battle of the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War fought December 5 – 8 , 1777 , in the area surrounding Whitemarsh Township , Pennsylvania . The battle , which took the form of a series of skirmish actions , was the last major engagement of 1777 between British and American forces . 
 George Washington , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the American revolutionary forces , spent the weeks after his defeat at the Battle of Germantown encamped with the Continental Army in various locations throughout Montgomery County , just north of British @-@ occupied Philadelphia . In early November , the Americans established an entrenched position approximately 16 miles ( 26 km ) north of Philadelphia along the Wissahickon Creek and Sandy Run , primarily situated on several hills between Old York Road and Bethlehem Pike . From here , Washington monitored British troop movements in Philadelphia and evaluated his options . 
 On December 4 , Gen. Sir William Howe , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of British forces in North America , led a sizable contingent of troops out of Philadelphia in one last attempt to destroy Washington and the Continental Army before the onset of winter . After a series of skirmishes , Howe called off the attack and returned to Philadelphia without engaging Washington in a decisive conflict . 
 With the British back in Philadelphia , Washington was able to march his troops to winter quarters at Valley Forge . 
 = = Background and movement to battle = = 
 After their October 4 , 1777 , defeat at the Battle of Germantown , Washington 's army retreated along Skippack Pike to Pawling 's Mill , beyond the Perkiomen Creek , where they remained encamped until October 8 . They then marched east on Skippack Pike , turned left on Forty @-@ Foot Road ( present @-@ day Old Forty @-@ Foot Road ) , and marched to Sumneytown Pike , where they camped on the property of Frederick <unk> near <unk> in Towamencin Township . While there , Brig. Gen. Francis Nash died of wounds incurred at Germantown and was buried in the Mennonite Meeting Cemetery . Washington remained at Towamencin for one week , gathering supplies and waiting to see if Howe would move against him . On October 16 , Washington moved his forces to <unk> Hill in Worcester Township . After learning of Howe 's withdrawal from Germantown to Philadelphia , Washington moved his army to <unk> , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) closer to Philadelphia , on October 20 . On October 29 , Washington 's army numbered 8 @,@ 313 Continentals and 2 @,@ 717 militia , although the terms of enlistment of many soldiers from Maryland and Virginia were due to expire . With his ranks reinforced , Washington dispatched a brigade to assist with the defense of Forts Mifflin and Mercer , on the Delaware River . On November 2 , at the recommendation of his council of war , Washington marched his forces to White Marsh , approximately 13 miles ( 21 km ) northwest of Philadelphia . At White Marsh , the army began to build redoubts and defensive works . 
 After the surrender of British Lt. Gen. John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga , Washington began drawing troops from the north , including the 1 @,@ 200 men of <unk> 's Rhode Island brigade , and about 1 @,@ 000 more men from various Pennsylvania , Maryland and Virginia units . Maj. Gen. Horatio Gates sent Col. Daniel Morgan 's rifle corps , and the brigades of Paterson and Glover . With these additional forces , and the pending onset of winter , Washington had to face the problem of supplying his army . A quarter of the troops were barefooted , and there were very few blankets or warm clothing . Washington became so desperate that he even offered a reward of $ 10 to the person who could supply the " best substitute for shoes , made of raw hides " . Morale was so low and desertion so common that Washington offered a pardon on October 24 to all deserters who returned by January 1 . Washington 's loss of Philadelphia and inactivity brought criticism from Congress , who pressured him to attack the city . He therefore called a council of war on November 24 which voted against an attack 11 to 4 . Nonetheless , Washington rode out the next day to view the British defenses , which turned to be stronger than he had expected . 
 On October 19 , Howe withdrew the British forces from Germantown and focused on the defense of Philadelphia . British military engineer Capt. John Montresor supervised the building of a series of fourteen formidable redoubts that began at Upper Ferry , along the Schuylkill River , and extended eastward to the shores of the Delaware River , just north of Philadelphia . Howe took advantage of his time in Philadelphia to raise additional forces from the loyalist population in the region . Newly @-@ promoted Maj. John Graves Simcoe reinforced his unit , the Queen 's Rangers , which had lost over a quarter of its men at the Battle of Brandywine . William Allen , Jr . , the son of notable loyalist William Allen , raised the 1st Battalion of Pennsylvania Loyalists , and was made its lieutenant colonel . Loyalist James Chalmers raised the 1st Battalion of Maryland Loyalists , and was given its command . Recruitment also took place among the city 's Irish Catholic population , with the formation of the Irish Catholic Volunteers , and in the counties immediately surrounding Philadelphia . In mid @-@ November , the fall of Forts Mifflin and Mercer effectively ended American control of the Delaware River , and much @-@ needed supplies began arriving at the city 's docks , along with 2 @,@ 000 additional British soldiers . 
 The weeks with two major armies sitting within miles of each other were not without conflict , and a petite guerre ensued in the no man 's land between White Marsh and Northern Liberties . Minor skirmishes between light troops increased in intensity throughout November , with almost daily losses being incurred by both the British and the Americans . In retaliation , on November 22 , Howe ordered his troops to set fire to several large country houses in the Germantown area , including Fair Hill , a mansion and country estate that had previously belonged to John Dickinson . Eleven houses in all were burned to the ground , and residents of Philadelphia climbed onto rooftops and church steeples to watch the spectacle . Just one day earlier , crowds had gathered to watch the burning of Commodore John Hazelwood 's Pennsylvania Navy in the Delaware . On the same morning the mansions were burned , an earthquake struck Philadelphia , and was felt as far away as Lancaster . On November 27 , an aurora borealis lit up the night skies . The two events caused quite a stir among both the residents of Philadelphia and the troops , British and American alike , who took them as an ominous sign of things to come . 
 By early December , Howe decided , despite having written to Colonial Secretary Lord George Germain requesting to be relieved of his command , that he was in a position to make one last attempt to destroy Washington 's army before the onset of winter , and he began preparations for an attack on the American forces . Washington 's intelligence network in Philadelphia , led by Maj. John Clark , became aware of British plans to surprise the Americans . According to a historically unsubstantiated story , Howe 's movements were revealed to the Americans by a Quaker woman named Lydia Darrah , who overheard British officers quartered in her house discussing Howe 's plan , and crossed the British lines to deliver this information to Col. Elias Boudinot of the Continental Army , who was at the Rising Sun Tavern between Germantown and Northern Liberties , ( located at the present day intersection of Germantown Avenue and Old York Road ) attempting to secure provisions . Boudinot immediately relayed this information to Washington , and the Continental Army was ready when Howe , with a force of approximately 10 @,@ 000 men , marched out of Philadelphia just prior to midnight on December 4 . The advance column , led by Lt. Gen. Lord Cornwallis , headed up Germantown Pike . A second column , led by Lt. Gen. von Knyphausen , marched toward the American left . 
 = = First day of battle = = 
 Just after midnight on December 5 , Cornwallis ' vanguard , which consisted of two British light infantry battalions , skirmished with an American cavalry patrol under the command of Capt. Allen McLane near Three Mile Run on Skippack Road . McLane sent a messenger to Washington , alerting him of the British movements . While the main body of the British troops marched through Germantown , <unk> , and <unk> , American alarm cannons were sounded and positions manned . At 3 : 00 am , the British halted on Chestnut Hill , just south of the American defenses , and waited for daybreak . During the night , Washington ordered his troops to build additional campfires to deceive the British . " ... [ I ] t looked as if fifty thousand men were encamped there . By day we could see this was merely a trick ... , " wrote Hessian Maj. Carl von <unk> . 
 Expecting a confrontation , Washington took the precaution of striking his tents before sunrise , and sent the heavy baggage north to Trappe . He then dispatched troops to find out the size and intent of the British column . Brig. Gen. James Irvine of the Pennsylvania militia took 600 men and marched them through the Wissahickon Valley toward Chestnut Hill . Brig. Gen. James Potter 's brigade of about 1 @,@ 000 Pennsylvania militia and Webb 's 2nd Connecticut Regiment of 200 men moved to screen Irvine 's right . Around noon , Irvine 's detachment encountered the British light infantry on the north side of Chestnut Hill . The Pennsylvania militia got off the first volley , but were soon routed by the British . While attempting to rally his fleeing troops , Irvine had three fingers shot off , and was taken prisoner when he fell from his horse . Potter 's brigade immediately fled , despite orders to advance and skirmish with the British light infantry . The 2nd Connecticut made a brief stand , killing three and wounding eleven , including British Capt. Sir James Murray @-@ Pulteney . 
 British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby decided to push his advantage after scattering Irvine 's troops . He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church , located on a hillock . Howe arrived a short while later , and ascended to the top of the church 's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions . Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force , he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire ; however , his guns did not have the range to hit Washington 's defenses . His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night , and planned a new way of attack for the following day . 
 = = Second and third days of battle = = 
 The two armies spent December 6 watching each other across the Wissahickon Valley . Howe hoped that Washington would leave his positions to attack the British ; Washington did not , preferring instead to let the British do the maneuvering . By day 's end , Howe decided upon a flanking movement toward the Americans ' left , toward Jenkintown and Cheltenham Township , while Maj. Gen. Charles Grey 's forces would create a distraction by attacking the American center . 
 Sometime after 1 : 00 am on December 7 , Howe marched the British Army back through Germantown , and then to Jenkintown , where they remained until noon . As the British movements were concealed by a ridge on Chestnut Hill , Washington did not become aware of Howe 's maneuvering until 8 : 00 am . He immediately moved Morgan 's Rifle Corps. and Col. Mordecai Gist 's Maryland militia eastward to cover his left flank . About a mile to the right of this detachment , Brig. Gen. James Potter 's brigade of Pennsylvania militia , and Webb 's 2nd Connecticut Regiment , under Lieut . Col. Isaac Sherman , proceeded down Lime Kiln road toward Edge Hill . Movement of the British rear guard , including the Jägers and the Queen 's Rangers , was hindered by the burning of the villages of <unk> and <unk> by troops at the front of the column . Howe 's right was now situated near the Abington Presbyterian Meeting . His main force moved to situate itself on Edge Hill , a ridge that ran parallel to , and a mile in front of , the American lines . Grey 's column had broken off from the main column , and proceeded up Whitemarsh Church Road toward the American center . 
 Gen. Grey had been instructed not to attack until he heard the sound of firing from Howe 's column , but after several hours , he became impatient and decided to proceed on his own . He formed his column into three divisions , with the Queen 's Rangers were on the left , the Jägers on each side of the road , and the light infantry of the Guards on the right , and headed in the direction of Tyson 's Tavern on Limekiln Road . As Grey advanced toward the American center , his troops took fire from American militia on Edge Hill . The militia were quickly routed , with between twenty and thirty killed , and fifteen of them taken as prisoners . Gens . John Cadwalader and Joseph Reed , out reconnoitering on horse near Twickenham , the country estate of Thomas Wharton Jr . , attempted to rally the Potter 's fleeing Pennsylvania militia . Lieut . Col. Sherman , the officer in charge of the 2nd Connecticut Continentals , resented Reed 's assumption of command , and later complained to Washington that it put " ... Officers and Men into such confusion that it rendered it impossible to keep that regularity so necessary when going into Action . " The British soon had them surrounded and outnumbered , and the Pennsylvania militia again panicked and fled . The 2nd Connecticut Continentals made a stand , firing between two and five rounds per man ; Sherman only gave the order to retreat when the Jägers were within 15 – 20 yards of his position . At some point , Cadwalader and Reed became separated from the militia , and Reed 's horse was shot out from under him . A body of Hessians charged at the two officers with bayonets , but Capt. McLane rode up with a few dragoons and ordered a charge that scattered the Hessians . McLane then took the two officers to safety . 
 The Pennsylvania militia fled in panic down Edge Hill , across Sandy Run , and toward the main American camp . Right behind them were men of the 2nd Connecticut , also in disorderly retreat . They were pursued to within yards of their encampment by the Queen 's Rangers and Jägers , who then fell back and took a position on Edge Hill , between Grey 's troops and Howe 's main column . 
 Morgan 's Rifle Corps. and Gist 's Maryland militia had taken position on Edge Hill , about a mile to the east of Grey 's troops , and higher up on the ridge . A small group of Americans moved down to attack Col. <unk> 's Light Infantry of the Guards , but were quickly repulsed by the British . William Augustus West , Lord Cantelupe , who was stationed with the light infantry , noted that the 4th and 23rd Regiments engaged the Americans with 9 men killed and 19 wounded . British Maj. John André reported that one American was killed . 
 Meanwhile , the main body of Morgan 's and Gist 's troops engaged Howe 's main column in dense woods , where they fought " Indian style " , from tree to tree . The Maryland militia attacked Abercromby 's 1st Light Infantry Battalion with unusual vigor : British officers , who were used to encountering militia who would flee at the first sign of battle , would later express admiration at the skill of Morgan 's and Gist 's men . Morgan 's troops were not reinforced , and were forced to retreat back to the main camp after Cornwallis sent in the 33rd Regiment of Foot . 
 = = British withdrawal = = 
 On the morning of December 8 , British generals and engineers once again studied the American positions , looking for any advantage they could exploit in the American defenses . To the astonishment of both the British and the Americans , Howe decided to withdraw and return to Philadelphia . Despite being successful in two major skirmishes over the previous days , his maneuvering had not gotten as far around the American flank as he had hoped and his troops ' provisions were running low . Also , the nights were getting colder and the troops had left their <unk> and gear in Philadelphia . 
 Mark Boatner says that Howe " decided that Washington 's defenses were too strong to warrant the risk of a general assault . At 2 : 00 pm , the British began their withdrawal , lighting numerous campfires — in a tactic similar to one used by Washington three days prior — to conceal their movements . An American reconnaissance party , led by Capt. McLane , discovered that Howe was marching back down Old York Road into Philadelphia and communicated this information back to Washington . Morgan 's troops harassed the enemy 's rear , in particular Grey 's column , which was hindered by the weight of the artillery that it was transporting . A contingent of Hessians formed to oppose them with their <unk> and Morgan 's troops retreated . The British arrived in Philadelphia later that day . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 No American official casualty return from December 5 to 8 is known to exist . Some information , however , can be pieced together from various sources . For December 5 , David Martin says that General Irvine 's force took about 40 casualties , while a Loyalist officer with the British Army wrote that Irvine was captured along with 23 of his men . For December 6 , Howard Peckham says that the Americans lost 30 killed , 40 wounded and 15 captured . The figure of 15 prisoners taken was confirmed by John André in his journal . 
 For December 7 , Colonel John Laurens stated that “ the loss of Morgan 's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded ” , while John Donaldson , an American cavalryman wrote that “ Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & among them was Major Morris a brave & gallant officer ” This reference was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment , so Donaldson 's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan 's command , while Laurens ' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only . Benson Lossing confirms that “ twenty @-@ seven were killed and wounded in Morgan 's Corps ” , while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost “ 16 or 17 ” wounded . For December 8 , David Martin says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 killed or wounded and 15 prisoners . From these sources , the aggregate American loss from December 5 – 8 would appear to have been 16 killed or wounded and 24 captured on the 5th ; 70 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 6th ; 44 killed or wounded on the 7th and 20 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 8th . This gives 150 killed or wounded and 54 captured , for a total loss of 204 men . 
 Lord Cantelupe wrote in his diary that " the number of killed & wounded on our side amount to one hundred & twenty , one officer killed . Cantelupe 's figure agrees approximately with Howe 's official casualty return for “ the different skirmishes from 4th to 8th December ” , which gives 19 killed , 60 wounded and 33 missing . David Martin gives the total British loss , including deserters , as 350 , which would suggest that 238 men deserted . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Washington , frustrated at not being able to confront Howe in a more decisive action , wrote in his report to Henry Laurens , president of Congress , " I sincerely wish , that they had made an Attack ; the Issue in all probability , from the disposition of our Troops and the strong situation of our Camp , would have been fortunate and happy . At the same time I must add that reason , prudence , and every principle of policy , forbade us quitting our post to attack them . Nothing but Success would have justified the measure , and this could not be expected from their position . " 
 On December 11 , the Continental Army left White Marsh for Valley Forge . It took the soldiers eight days to make the 13 @-@ mile ( 21 km ) journey . The following April , Howe resigned his post and returned to Britain , and was replaced by Gen. Sir Henry Clinton . Following France 's entry into the war , the British evacuated Philadelphia overland the following spring , and while en route to New York City , they were attacked by Washington at the Battle of Monmouth . 
 Remains of the American redoubts were visible near Farmar Mill , as were vestiges of stone chimneys from the soldier 's makeshift huts , as late as 1860 . The battle is alluded to in Sally Wister 's Journal , and the author later views the remains of the nearby camp . Fort Washington State Park , which encompasses a portion of the area occupied by the American forces , was established in the early 1920s by Philadelphia 's Fairmount Park Commission and is today managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources . The park 's Fort Hill marks the spot where a temporary fort once stood at the western end of the American position . The Pennsylvania Militia ( under Gens . Armstrong , Cadwalader and Irvine ) held positions on the park 's Militia Hill . Nearby , Emlen House , Washington 's headquarters between November 2 and December 11 , remains standing despite destructive modernization in 1854 . 
 = Privilege of peerage = 
 The privilege of peerage is the body of special privileges belonging to members of the British peerage . It is distinct from Parliamentary privilege , which applies only to those peers serving in the House of Lords and the members of the House of Commons , while Parliament is in session and forty days before and after a Parliamentary session . 
 The privileges have been lost and eroded over time . Only three survived into the 20th century : the right to be tried by other peers of the realm instead of juries of commoners , freedom from arrest in civil ( but not criminal ) cases , and access to the Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state . The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948 . Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application , if at all . The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999 , but has never been formally revoked . 
 Peers also have several other rights not formally part of the privilege of peerage . For example , they are entitled to use coronets and supporters on their achievements of arms . 
 = = Extent = = 
 The privilege of peerage extends to all temporal peers and peeresses regardless of their position in relation to the House of Lords . The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege , and is held by only some peers ( see History of reform of the House of Lords ) . Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800 , therefore , have the privilege of peerage . From 1800 , Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House . Since 1999 , hereditary peers of England , Scotland , Great Britain , and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons . Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House . Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage . The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers . A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner , but a peeress suo jure does not . Individuals who hold courtesy titles , however , do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles . Lords Spiritual ( the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords ) do not have the privilege of peerage as , at least since 1621 , they have been Lords of Parliament , and not peers . 
 = = Trial by peers = = 
 Just as commoners have a right to trial by a jury of their equals ( other commoners ) , peers and peeresses formerly had a right to trial by other peers . The right of peers to trial by their own order was formalized during the 14th century . A statute passed in 1341 provided : 
 Whereas before this time the peers of the land have been arrested and imprisoned , and their temporalities , lands , and tenements , goods and <unk> , <unk> in the King 's hands , and some put to death without judgment of their peers : It is accorded and assented , that no peer of the land ... shall be brought in judgment to lose his temporalities , lands , tenements , goods and <unk> , nor to be arrested , imprisoned , outlawed , exiled , nor <unk> , nor put to answer , nor be judged , but by award of the said peers in Parliament . 
 The privilege of trial by peers was still ill @-@ defined , and the statute did not cover peeresses . In 1442 , after an ecclesiastical court ( which included King Henry VI of England , Henry Beaufort and John Kemp ) found Eleanor , Duchess of Gloucester , guilty of witchcraft and banished her to the Isle of Man , a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers . 
 By the reign of Henry VII of England , there were two methods of trial by peers of the realm : trial in the House of Lords ( or , in proper terms , by the High Court of Parliament ) and trial in the Court of the Lord High Steward . The House of Lords tried the case if Parliament was in session ; otherwise , trial was by the Lord High Steward 's Court . 
 In the Lord High Steward 's Court , a group of Lords Triers , sitting under the chairmanship of the Lord High Steward , acted as judge and jury . By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23 , so that a majority was a minimum of 12 , but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35 . The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse , as only those peers who agreed with the monarch 's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward , thereby favouring the desired verdict . This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695 , passed during the reign of King William III . The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers . All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords . 
 In the House of Lords , technically called the Court of the King ( or Queen ) in Parliament , the Lord High Steward was the President or Chairman of the Court , and the entire House determined both questions of fact and questions of law as well as the verdict . By convention , Bishops and Archbishops did not vote on the verdict , though they were expected to attend during the course of the trial . They sat until the conclusion of the deliberations , and withdrew from the chamber just prior to the final vote . At the end of the trial , peers voted on the question before them by standing and declaring their verdict by saying " guilty , upon my honour " or " not guilty , upon my honour " , starting with the most junior baron and proceeding in order of precedence ending with the Lord High Steward . For a guilty verdict , a majority of twelve was necessary . The entire House also determined the punishment to be imposed , which had to accord with the law . For capital crimes the punishment was death ; the last peer to be executed was Laurence Shirley , 4th Earl Ferrers , who was hanged for murder in 1760 . 
 From 1547 , if a peer or peeress was convicted of a crime , except treason or murder , he or she could claim " privilege of peerage " to escape punishment if it was their first offence . In all , the privilege was exercised five times , until it was formally abolished in 1841 when James Brudenell , 7th Earl of Cardigan , announced he would claim the privilege and avoid punishment if he was convicted of duelling . He was acquitted before the introduction of the bill . 
 The last trial in the House of Lords was that of Edward Southwell Russell , 26th Baron de Clifford , in 1935 for motor manslaughter ( he was acquitted ) ; the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by peers but the Commons ignored it . In 1948 , the right to trial by peers was abolished when the Lords added an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act , which the Commons accepted . Now , peers are tried by juries composed of commoners , though they were themselves excluded from jury service until the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999 . 
 Peers were , and still are hypothetically , subject to impeachment . Impeachment was a procedure distinct from the aforementioned procedure of trial in the House of Lords , though the House of Lords is the court in both cases . Charges were brought by the House of Commons , not a Grand Jury . Additionally , while in normal cases the House of Lords tried peers only for felonies or treason , in <unk> the charges could include felonies , treason and misdemeanours . The case directly came before the House of Lords , rather than being referred to it by a writ of certiorari . The Lord High Steward presided only if a peer was charged with high treason ; otherwise the Lord Chancellor presided . Other procedures in trials of impeachment were similar , however , to trials before the House of Lords : at the conclusion of the trial , the spiritual peers withdrew , and the temporal Lords gave their votes on their honour . The last impeachment was that of Henry Dundas , 1st Viscount Melville , in 1806 for misappropriating public money ( he was acquitted ) . Since then , impeachment has become an obsolete procedure in the United Kingdom . 
 The novel Clouds of Witness ( 1926 ) by Dorothy L. Sayers depicts in the House of Lords the fictional trial of a duke who is accused , and eventually acquitted , of murder . Sayers researched and used the then current trial procedures . Kind Hearts and Coronets ( 1949 ) comedy from Ealing Studios features an almost identical scene . 
 = = Freedom from arrest = = 
 The privilege of freedom from arrest applies to members of both Houses of Parliament , because of the principle that they must , whenever possible , be available to give advice to the Sovereign . Several other nations have copied this provision ; the Constitution of the United States , for example , provides , " The Senators and Representatives ... shall in all Cases , except Treason , Felony and Breach of the Peace , be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses . " Theoretically , even when Parliament is not sitting , peers enjoy the privilege because they continue to serve the Sovereign as counsellors . However , peers are free from arrest in civil cases only ; arrests in criminal matters are not covered by the privilege . Until 1770 , a peer 's domestic servants were also covered by the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil matters . 
 Most often the privilege was applied in cases of imprisonment in debtors ' prisons . In 1870 , both imprisonment for debt and the privilege in relation to freedom from arrest for bankruptcy were abolished , and as a result the freedom became extremely limited in practical application . Now , civil proceedings involve arrests only when an individual disobeys a court order . Since 1945 , the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil cases has arisen in only two cases : Stourton v Stourton ( 1963 ) and Peden International Transport , Moss Bros , The Rowe Veterinary Group and Barclays Bank plc v Lord Mancroft ( 1989 ) . In the latter most recent case , the trial judge considered the privilege obsolete and inapplicable , and said in proceedings , " the privilege did not apply — indeed ... it is unthinkable in modern times that , in circumstances such as they are in this case , it should " . 
 = = Access to the Sovereign = = 
 The Sovereign is traditionally advised by various counsellors , including the peers of the realm . After the Norman conquest of England , peers were summoned to form the magnum concilium , or Great Council , which was one of the four councils belonging to the Sovereign . The other three were the Privy Council , Parliament ( which was called the commune concilium , or Common Council ) , and judges ( who are considered counsellors of the Sovereign on legal matters ) . 
 A council composed only of peers was often summoned by early English Kings . Such a council , having been in disuse for centuries , was revived in 1640 , when Charles I summoned all of the peers of the realm using writs issued under the Great Seal . Though such a council has not been summoned since then , and was considered obsolete at the time , each peer is commonly considered a counsellor of the Sovereign , and , according to Sir William Blackstone in 1765 , " it is usually looked upon to be the right of each particular peer of the realm , to demand an audience of the King , and to lay before him , with decency and respect , such matters as he shall judge of importance to the public weal . " 
 The privilege of access is no longer exercised , but it is possibly still retained by peers whether members of the House of Lords or not . In 1999 , the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege recommended the formal abolition of any remaining privilege of peerage . 
 = = Scandalum magnatum = = 
 At one time , the honour of peers was especially protected by the law ; while defamation of a commoner was known as libel or slander , the defamation of a peer ( or of a Great Officer of State ) was called scandalum magnatum . 
 Eighteenth century jurist Sir William Blackstone opined : 
 " The honour of peers is so highly tendered by the law , that it is much more penal to spread false reports of them , and certain other great officers of the realm , than of other men ; scandal against them being called by the peculiar name of scandalum magnatum , and subject to peculiar punishments by divers ancient statutes . " 
 The Statute of Westminster of 1275 provided that " from henceforth none be so hardy to tell or publish any false News or Tales , whereby discord , or occasion of discord or slander may grow between the King and his People , or the Great Men of the Realm . " Scandalum magnatum was punishable under the aforesaid statute as well as under further laws passed during the reign of Richard II . Scandalum magnatum was both a tort and a criminal offence . The prohibition on scandalum magnatum was first enforced by the King 's Council . During the reign of Henry VII , the Star Chamber , a court formerly reserved for trial of serious offences such as rioting , assumed jurisdiction over scandalum magnatum , as well as libel and slander , cases . The court , which sat without a jury and in secret , was often used as a political weapon and a device of royal tyranny , leading to its abolition in 1641 ; its functions in respect of defamation cases passed to the common law courts . However , the number of cases had already dwindled as the laws of libel , slander and contempt of court developed in its place . In the reign of Charles II , scandalum magnatum came briefly back into fashion ; it was used by the future James II against Titus Oates , by Lord Gerard against his cousin Alexander Fitton , and by the Duke of Beaufort against John Arnold . By the end of the 18th century , however , scandalum magnatum was obsolete . The prohibition on it was finally repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1887 . 
 = = Privilege myths = = 
 Fanciful tales of peers with whimsical privileges circulate , such as that of the right to wear a hat in the presence of the Sovereign . The most persistent example of such a legend is that of the Kingsale hat . According to the fable , John de Courcy , Earl of Ulster , obtained from King John the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign . Though the tale is untrue — de Courcy was never made an earl and did not receive such a privilege — several authorities on the peerage have seen fit to repeat it . A 19th @-@ century edition of Burke 's Peerage suggests the origins of the privilege : 
 ... the Earl of Ulster was treacherously seized while performing penance , unarmed and barefooted , in the churchyard of Downpatrick , on Good Friday , anno 1203 , and sent over to England , where the king condemned him to perpetual imprisonment in the Tower ... After de Courcy had been in confinement about a year , a dispute happening to arise between King John and Philip Augustus of France concerning the Duchy of Normandy , the decision of which being referred to single combat , King John , more hasty than advised , appointed the day , against which the King of France provided his champion ; but the King of England , less fortunate , could find no one of his subjects willing to take up the gauntlet , until his captive in the Tower , the stout Earl of Ulster , was prevailed upon to accept the challenge . But when everything was prepared for the contest , and the champions had entered the lists , in presence of the Kings of England , France and Spain , the opponent of the earl , seized with a sudden panic , put spurs to his horse , and fled the arena ; whereupon the victory was adjudged by acclamation to the champion of England . The French king being informed , however , of the earl 's powerful strength , and wishing to witness some exhibition of it , de Courcy , at the desire of King John , cleft a massive helmet in twain at a single blow . 
 To reward his singular performance , King John supposedly granted de Courcy the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign . The 1823 edition of Debrett 's Peerage gives an entirely fictitious account of how Almericus de Courcy , 23rd Baron Kingsale , asserted the privilege : 
 Being very handsome in his person , and of a tall stature , his lordship one day attended King William 's court , and being admitted into the presence @-@ chamber , asserted the privilege of being covered before his majesty , by walking to and fro with his hat on his head . The king observing him , sent one of his attendants to inquire the reason of his appearance before him with his head covered ; to whom he replied , he knew very well in whose presence he stood , and the reason why he wore his hat that day was , because he stood before the king of England . This answer being told the king , and his lordship approaching nearer the throne , was required by his majesty to explain himself , which he did to this effect : " May it please your majesty , my name is Courcy , and I am Lord of Kingsale in your kingdom of Ireland : the reason of my appearing covered in your majesty 's presence is , to assert the ancient privilege of my family , granted to sir John de Courcy , earl of Ulster , and his heirs , by John , king of England , for him and his successors for ever . " The king replied , he remembered he had such a nobleman , and believed the privilege he asserted to be his right , and giving him his hand to kiss , his lordship paid his obeisance , and remained covered . 
 Despite such inaccuracies , the tale has been frequently repeated . Individual privileges that did exist have fallen into disuse — for example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop ( which is not a peerage ) was extended the privilege and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937 , but the right was not exercised at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 . 
 = = Precedence = = 
 Peers are entitled to a special precedence because of their ranks . Wives and children of peers are also entitled to a special precedence because of their station . 
 The Sovereign may , as fount of honour , vary the precedence of the peers or of any other people . For example , Elizabeth II granted her husband , Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , precedence immediately following her ; otherwise , he would have ranked along with the other dukes of the peerage of the United Kingdom . 
 = = = General precedence = = = 
 In England and Wales , the Sovereign ranks first , followed by the Royal Family . Then follow the Archbishops of Canterbury and York , the Great Officers of State and other important state functionaries such as the Prime Minister . Thereafter , dukes precede marquesses , who precede earls , who precede viscounts , who precede bishops , who precede barons and lords of Parliament . 
 Within the members of each rank of the peerage , peers of England precede peers of Scotland . English and Scottish peers together precede peers of Great Britain . All of the aforementioned precede peers of Ireland created before 1801 . Last come peers of Ireland created after 1801 and peers of the United Kingdom . Among peers of the same rank and Peerage , precedence is based on the creation of the title : those whose titles were created earlier precede those whose titles were created later . But in no case would a peer of a lower rank precede one of a higher rank . For example , the Duke of Fife , the last non @-@ royal to be created a duke , would come before the Marquess of Winchester , though the latter 's title was created earlier and is in a more senior peerage ( the peerage of England ) . 
 The place of a peer in the order for gentlemen is taken by his wife in the order for ladies , except that a Dowager peeress of a particular title precedes the present holder of the same title . Children of peers ( and suo jure peeresses ) also obtain a special precedence . The following algorithm may be used to determine their ranks : 
 Eldest sons of peers of rank X go after peers of rank X − 1 
 Younger sons of peers of rank X go after eldest sons of peers of rank X − 1 
 Wives have a precedence corresponding to those of their husbands 
 Daughters of peers of rank X go after wives of eldest sons of peers of rank X 
 Over time , however , various offices were inserted at different points in the order , thereby varying it . 
 Eldest sons of dukes rank after marquesses ; eldest sons of marquesses and then younger sons of dukes rank after earls ; eldest sons of earls and then younger sons of marquesses rank after viscounts . Eldest sons of viscounts , younger sons of earls , and then eldest sons of barons , in that order , follow barons , with the Treasurer of the Household , the Comptroller of the Household , the Vice @-@ Chamberlain of the Household and Secretaries of State being interpolated between them and the barons . Younger sons of viscounts , and then younger sons of barons , come after the aforesaid eldest sons of barons , with Knights of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle , Privy Councillors and senior judges being intercalated between them and eldest sons of barons . 
 Children of the eldest son of a peer also obtain a special precedence . Generally , the eldest son of the eldest son of a peer comes immediately before his uncles , while the younger sons of the eldest son of a peer come after them . Therefore , eldest sons of eldest sons of dukes come before younger sons of dukes , and younger sons of eldest sons of dukes come after them , and so forth for all the ranks . Below the younger sons of barons are baronets , knights , circuit judges and companions of the various orders of Chivalry , followed by the eldest sons of younger sons of peers . 
 Wives of all of the aforementioned have precedence corresponding to their husbands ' , unless otherwise entitled to a higher precedence , for instance by virtue of holding a certain office . An individual 's daughter takes precedence after the wife of that individual 's eldest son and before the wives of that individual 's younger sons . Therefore , daughters of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of peers ; daughters of eldest sons of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of eldest sons of peers ; daughters of younger sons of peers rank after wives of eldest sons of younger sons of peers . Such a daughter keeps her precedence if marrying a commoner ( unless that marriage somehow confers a higher precedence ) , but rank as their husband if marrying a peer . 
 = = = Precedence within Parliament = = = 
 The order of precedence used to determine seating in the House of Lords chamber is governed by the House of Lords Precedence Act 1539 . Precedence as provided by the Act is similar to , but not the same as , the order outside Parliament . The Sovereign , however , does not have the authority to change the precedence assigned by the Act . 
 Lords Temporal assume precedence similar to precedence outside Parliament . One difference in the precedence of peers relates to the positions of the Great Officers of State and the officers of the Sovereign 's Household . Some Great Officers — the Lord Chancellor , the Lord High Treasurer , the Lord President of the Council and the Lord Privy Seal — provided they are peers , rank before all other peers except those who are of the Blood Royal ( no precedence is accorded if they are not peers ) . The positions of the other Great Officers — the Lord Great Chamberlain , the Lord High Constable , the Earl Marshal and the Lord High Admiral — and the officers of the Household — the Lord Steward and the Lord Chamberlain — are based on their respective ranks . Thus , if the Lord Steward were a duke , he would precede all dukes , if a marquess , he would precede all marquesses , and so on . If two such officers are of the same rank , the precedence of the offices ( reflected by the order in which they are mentioned above ) is taken into account : if the Lord Great Chamberlain and Earl Marshal were both marquesses , for example , then the Great Chamberlain would precede the Earl Marshal , as the former office precedes the latter . 
 In practice , however , the Act is obsolete , as the Lords do not actually sit according to strict precedence ; instead , peers sit with their political parties . 
 = = Coats of arms = = 
 Peers are generally entitled to use certain heraldic devices . Atop the arms , a peer may display a coronet . Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets . Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century , earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th . Until the barons received coronets in 1661 , the coronets of earls , marquesses and dukes were engraved while those of viscounts were plain . After 1661 , however , <unk> coronets became engraved , while baronial coronets were plain . Coronets may not bear any precious or semi @-@ precious stones . Generally , only peers may use the coronets corresponding to their ranks . The Bishop of Durham , however , may use a duke 's coronet atop the arms as a reference to the historical temporal authority of the Prince @-@ Bishops of Durham . 
 Peers wear their coronets at coronations . Otherwise , coronets are seen only in heraldic representations , atop a peer 's arms . Coronets include a silver gilt chaplet and a base of ermine fur . The coronet varies with the rank of the peer . A member of the Royal Family uses a royal coronet instead of the coronet he or she would use as a peer or peeress . 
 Ducal coronets include eight strawberry leaves atop the chaplet , five of which are displayed in heraldic representations . Marquesses have coronets with four strawberry leaves alternating with four silver balls , of which three leaves and two balls are displayed . Coronets for earls have eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight silver balls ( called " pearls " even though they are not ) raised on spikes , of which five silver balls and four leaves are displayed . Coronets for viscounts have 16 silver balls , of which seven are displayed . Finally , baronial coronets have six silver balls , of which four are displayed . Peeresses use equivalent designs , but in the form of a circlet , which encircles the head , rather than a coronet , which rests atop the head . 
 Peers are entitled to the use of supporters in their achievements of arms . Hereditary supporters are normally limited to hereditary peers , certain members of the Royal Family , chiefs of Scottish Clans , Scottish feudal barons whose baronies predate 1587 . Non @-@ hereditary supporters are granted to life peers , Knights of the Garter , Knights of the Thistle , Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Bath , Knights and Dames Grand Cross of St Michael and St George , Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order , Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the British Empire , and knights banneret . 
 Peers , like most other armigers , may display helms atop their arms . Helms of peers are depicted in silver and facing the viewer 's left . The helm is garnished in gold and the closed visor has gold bars , normally numbering five . Along with the helm , peers use a mantling , one side of which is red and the other a representation of the heraldic fur ermine . The mantling of peers is emblazoned gules , doubled ermine . Peeresses and other female armigers do not bear helms or <unk> . 
 = = Robes = = 
 Since the early Middle Ages , robes have been worn as a sign of nobility . At first , these seem to have been bestowed on individuals by the monarch or feudal lord as a sign of special recognition ; but in the fifteenth century the use of robes became formalised with peers all wearing robes of the same design , though varied according to the rank of the wearer . 
 Two distinct forms of robe emerged , and these remain in current use : one is worn for parliamentary occasions ( such at the State Opening of Parliament ) , the other is generally worn only at coronations . ( Formerly , new peers were invested with their coronation robe by the monarch , but this Investiture ceremony has not taken place since 1621 . ) 
 Coronets are worn with the Coronation robe ; the robes and coronets used at Elizabeth II 's coronation in 1953 cost about £ 1 @,@ 250 ( roughly £ 31 @,@ 500 in present @-@ day terms ) . ( Peers under the rank of an Earl , however , were allowed in 1953 to wear a cheaper " cap of estate " in place of a coronet , as were peeresses of the same rank , for whom a simpler robe was also permitted ( a one @-@ piece gown with wrap @-@ around fur cape , designed by Norman Hartnell ) . 
 = = = Parliament robes = = = 
 = = = = Lords Temporal = = = = 
 The Parliament robe of a peer is a full @-@ length garment of scarlet wool with a collar of white miniver fur . It is closed at the front with black silk satin ribbon ties ( except for a short slit at the neck down half the length of the robe ) but open from the shoulder on the right @-@ hand side . ( The opposite side is usually tied up with a ribbon to free the left arm ) . The back is cut long , as a train , but this is usually kept hooked up inside the garment . Miniver bars ( edged with gold oak @-@ leaf lace ) on the right @-@ hand side of the robe indicate the rank of the wearer : 4 for a duke , 3 ½ for a marquess , 3 for an earl , 2 ½ for a viscount , and 2 for a baron . These robes are worn by peers at their Introduction to the House of Lords as well as at the State Opening . They are also worn by Lords Commissioners when representing the Queen . They are directed to be worn ' when the peers attend as a body a church service or other ceremony ' ; however in the twentieth century they were only twice worn outside Parliament : at the Investitures of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969 . The Parliament robe is only worn by Peers who are sworn members of the House of Lords , and the robe is the same for female peers as for males . ( Unlike the Coronation robe , there is no equivalent garment for the wives of peers to wear . ) 
 = = = = Lords Spiritual = = = = 
 Bishops in the House of Lords have their own distinctive parliamentary robe , which is worn at the State Opening of Parliament . It is akin to the <unk> clausa of Cambridge University : a full @-@ length scarlet cloak with a cape of plain white fur . This is worn over rochet & <unk> , which is the normal day dress for Bishops in the House of Lords . As it is a parliament robe , it is not worn at coronations .

 = = = = Peers = = = = 
 For male peers , the Coronation robe is a cloak of crimson velvet extending to the feet , open in the front ( with white silk satin ribbon ties ) and trailing behind . Attached to the robe is a cape and collar of miniver ; the rank of the peer is indicated by rows of sealskin spots on the ermine cape : 4 for a duke , 3 ½ for a marquess , 3 for an earl , 2 ½ for a viscount and 2 for a baron . ( Royal dukes have six rows of spots , and additional rows on the collar and on the front edges of the garment . ) Peers are entitled to wear the coronation robe whether or not they are members of the House of Lords . 
 The robes are worn over court uniform and with collars of an order of chivalry if entitled . 
 = = = = Peeresses = = = = 
 Peeresses ( both female peers and the wives of male peers ) also wear a crimson robe at coronations , but it is of a different design : a crimson velvet <unk> , edged in miniver , is worn closely over a full evening dress ; the robe itself is attached at the shoulder , and takes the form of a long train of matching crimson velvet , edged with miniver . At the top of the train is a miniver cape ( the same width as the train ) which has rows of ermine indicating rank , as for their male counterparts . The length of the train also denotes the rank of the wearer : duchesses have two @-@ yard trains , marchionesses one and three quarters , countesses one and a half , viscountesses one and a quarter , and baronesses ( and female holders of lordships of Parliament ) one . 
 In the twentieth century , very precise details about the design of peers ' and peeresses ' robes ( and what is to be worn underneath them ) were published by the Earl Marshal in advance of each coronation . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 With the Parliament robe a black hat was customarily worn . The Wriothesley Garter Book provides a contemporary illustration of the 1523 State Opening of Parliament : the two dukes present are shown wearing coronets with their parliament robes , but the other Lords Temporal are all wearing black hats . The Lords Spiritual are wearing <unk> with their distinctive robes . <unk> ceased to be worn after the Reformation , and the wearing of hats in Parliament ceased , for the most part , when wigs came into fashion . They survive today only as part of the dress of Lords Commissioners , when they are worn with the parliamentary robe : a <unk> hat for men ( of black beaver , edged with silk <unk> ribbon ) and a tricorne @-@ like hat for women . ( The use of these hats at Introductions of peers to the House was discontinued in 1998 . ) 
 = HMS Hyperion ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Hyperion was an H @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the mid @-@ 1930s . During the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the Mediterranean Fleet . During the first few months of World War II , Hyperion searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and blockaded German merchant ships in neutral harbours until she returned to the British Isles in early 1940 . The ship participated in the Norwegian Campaign before she was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterwards . Hyperion participated in the Battle of Calabria and the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940 while escorting the larger ships of the fleet . The ship covered several convoys to Malta before she struck a mine and had to be sunk in December 1940 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Hyperion displaced 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 883 long tons ( 1 @,@ 913 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . 
 She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . The other G- and H @-@ class destroyers were built with three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers , but as a trial Hyperion uniquely used a Johnson boiler in the aft position instead . This is an O @-@ type boiler with a single lower water drum and curved tubes , rather than the triangular arrangement with two drums used by the Admiralty . The first boiler design suffered from poor circulation and so external cold <unk> were added , making the reworked boiler 10 % heavier . The boiler was well @-@ regarded in service as it reduced the amount of potentially troublesome refractory firebrick usually used for the base of the furnace . 
 Hyperion carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime , but this increased to 146 in wartime . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Hyperion had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mk III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . The ship 's anti @-@ aircraft armament was increased when the rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt AA gun , although when exactly the modification was made is not known . 
 = = Career = = 
 Ordered on 13 December 1934 , Hyperion was laid down by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson at Wallsend @-@ on @-@ Tyne , England , on 27 March 1935 . She was launched on 8 April 1936 and completed on 3 December 1936 . Excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament , the ship cost £ 251 @,@ 466 . She was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning . Hyperion patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non @-@ Intervention Committee . The ship received an overhaul at Malta between 30 September and 30 October 1937 and resumed patrolling Spanish waters for the rest of the war . Hyperion was sent to Portsmouth for another refit in August 1939 that lasted from 16 to 27 August . 
 When World War II began on 3 September , the ship was en route to Freetown , Sierra Leone to search for German commerce raiders . Hyperion was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in late October where he blockaded various German merchant ships in American and Mexican harbours . She intercepted the German ocean liner Columbus off Cape Hatteras on 19 December , but Columbus scuttled herself before she could be captured . Hyperion was transferred to the British Isles in mid @-@ January 1940 and began a refit at Portsmouth that lasted from 25 January to 6 March . The ship rejoined the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow . 
 On 5 April Hyperion escorted the battlecruiser Renown as she covered the minelayers preparing to implement Operation Wilfred , an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany . The ship and her sister Hero pretended to lay a minefield off Bud , Norway on 8 April and reported its location to the Norwegians . Hyperion escorted the aircraft carriers Glorious and Ark Royal from 21 April as their aircraft attacked German targets in Norway . She remained with Ark Royal when Glorious returned to Scapa Flow to refuel on 27 April . In early May the ship escorted the light cruiser Birmingham on an unsuccessful sweep of the North Sea looking for German ships . 
 Hyperion evacuated British personnel from the Hook of Holland from 8 to 12 May and was then ordered to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta on 16 May . On 9 July she participated in the Battle of Calabria as an escort for the heavy ships of Force C and unsuccessfully engaged Italian destroyers and suffered no damage . During the Battle of Cape Spada on 19 July , the ship escorted Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney and rescued some of the 525 survivors from the Italian cruiser Bartolomeo Colleoni together with the other escorting destroyers . Together with her sister Hereward and two other destroyers , she bombarded Italian positions around Sidi Barrani on 25 September . Hyperion escorted the carrier Illustrious during the Battle of Taranto on the night of 11 / 12 November . With Hereward , she sank the Italian submarine <unk> on 14 December 1940 near Bardia . 
 Hyperion struck a mine on 22 December 1940 off Pantelleria as she escorted the battleship HMS Malaya on passage from Alexandria to Gibraltar while covering a convoy to Malta . The destroyer Ilex attempted to tow Hyperion , but the tow cable broke twice and the destroyer Janus was ordered to sink her after Ilex took off the crew . Only two members of the crew were not rescued and were presumed killed in the explosion . 
 = Jezdimir Dangić = 
 Jezdimir Dangić ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> ; 4 May 1897 – 22 August 1947 ) was a Bosnian Serb Chetnik commander during World War II . Born in the town of Bratunac , he was imprisoned during World War I for his membership of the revolutionary movement Young Bosnia . He subsequently completed a law degree and became an officer in the gendarmerie of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes at the beginning of 1928 . In 1940 he was appointed to lead the gendarmerie detachment stationed at the Yugoslav royal palace . With the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941 , Dangić commanded the gendarmerie unit that escorted King Peter II out of the country . In August of that year , General Draža Mihailović appointed him commander of the Chetnik forces in eastern Bosnia . Here , Dangić and his men launched several attacks against the forces of the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) . In August , Dangić 's Chetniks captured the town of Srebrenica . Afterwards , they became largely inactive in fighting the Germans , choosing instead to avoid confrontation . In December , Chetniks under Dangić 's command massacred hundreds of Bosnian Muslims in the town of Goražde . In December , his Chetniks captured five nuns and took them with them through Romanija to Goražde , where they later committed suicide to avoid being raped . 
 In January 1942 , Dangić ordered his forces to not resist German and NDH troops during the anti @-@ Partisan offensive known as Operation Southeast Croatia . Afterwards , he was invited to Belgrade to negotiate the terms of proposed Chetnik collaboration with the Germans with Milan Nedić and General der Artillerie ( lieutenant general ) Paul Bader . Although a deal was struck , it was vetoed by the Wehrmacht Commander in Southeast Europe , General der Pioniere ( lieutenant general ) Walter Kuntze , who remained suspicious of Dangić . Despite this , Dangić 's Chetniks collaborated with German forces in eastern Bosnia over a period of several months beginning in December 1941 . In April , Dangić was arrested when he travelled to Serbia despite promising to operate only within the territory of Bosnia , and was sent to a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp in German @-@ occupied Poland . In 1943 , he escaped from the camp and the following year participated in the Warsaw Uprising . In 1945 , he was captured by the Red Army and was extradited to Yugoslavia , where he stood accused of committing war crimes . In 1947 , he was tried , convicted , sentenced to death and executed by Yugoslavia 's new Communist authorities . 
 = = Early life and interwar period = = 
 Jezdimir Dangić was born in the town of Bratunac on 4 May 1897 , as one of ten children . His father Savo was a Serbian Orthodox priest and his mother was a housewife . Dangić attended high school in Tuzla and became a communist sympathizer . He was also one of the youngest members of the revolutionary organisation known as Young Bosnia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Mlada Bosna , <unk> Босна ) . Following Gavrilo Princip 's assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914 , Dangić was arrested by the Austro @-@ Hungarian police because of his membership . He was tried in Bihać alongside thirty @-@ two others in September 1915 and imprisoned for 2 ½ years for participating in revolutionary activities . Dangić 's parents were also arrested . His father was charged with treason and sentenced to death , but his sentence was later reduced to 3 ½ years ' imprisonment . Dangić 's mother was never tried , as she suffered a mental breakdown from spending several months in solitary confinement and her trial was postponed indefinitely . 
 Dangić was released from prison at the end of World War I , in November 1918 . The following year , he and Božo Ilić organized a series of communist demonstrations in Belgrade , for which they were arrested and imprisoned . Following his release from prison , Dangić became a member of the League of Farmers , a party which protected the interests of Bosnian Serb peasantry and which was the precursor to the Chetnik movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War II . He also obtained a law degree and spent some time as a district officer in Belgrade , Subotica , Kratovo and Vlasenica . By 1928 , he had achieved the rank of cavalry sub @-@ lieutenant . He joined the gendarmerie on 3 January 1928 , and worked his way up to the rank of major . Over his career , Dangić served in Skopje , Tuzla , Virovitica , and Zagreb . In 1940 , he was appointed to lead the gendarmerie detachment stationed at the Yugoslav royal palace . He was married and had two daughters born in 1931 and 1937 . 
 Between 1937 and 1941 , Dangić published ten articles in the newspaper Politika . He published his first novel in 1938 , titled Our Imprisonment ( <unk> <unk> ) . The book was praised by academics such as Vladimir Ćorović , and Dangić received a literary award from the Serbian Royal Academy . In 1940 , he published a novel called Hunger and the Dungeon ( Glad i <unk> ) , for which he received another accolade from the Serbian Royal Academy . Bogoljub <unk> and poet Milan <unk> praised the book as " an excellent depiction of prison life " .

 = = = Invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia = = = 
 On 6 April 1941 , Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia . Poorly equipped and poorly trained , the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated . At this time , Dangić was assigned to command the gendarmerie unit that escorted King Peter II to Nikšić Airport as he left the country . 
 After the invasion , Yugoslavia was dismembered , with Serbia being reduced to its pre @-@ 1912 borders and placed under a government of German military occupation . Milan Nedić , a pre @-@ war politician who was known to have pro @-@ Axis leanings , was then selected by the Germans to lead the collaborationist Government of National Salvation in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia . Meanwhile , the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Pavelić , who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini 's Italy , was appointed Poglavnik ( leader ) of an Ustaše @-@ led Croatian state – the Independent State of Croatia ( often called the NDH , from the Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska ) . The NDH combined almost all of modern @-@ day Croatia , all of modern @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern @-@ day Serbia into an " Italian @-@ German quasi @-@ protectorate . " NDH authorities , led by the Ustaše militia , subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb , Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state . As a result , two resistance movements emerged – the royalist and Serb Chetniks , led by Colonel Draža Mihailović , and the multi @-@ ethnic , Communist Yugoslav Partisans , led by Josip Broz Tito .

 = = = = Background = = = = 
 At the time of the Yugoslav surrender , Dangić was in Belgrade . He obeyed the summons of Milan Aćimović , head of the first Serbian puppet government , to serve in the gendarmerie of the Serbian quisling state and did so until mid @-@ August . When news reached him of the Ustaše massacres of Serbs in Bosnia , he sought permission to travel there and escort his family and relatives to safety . In the summer his request was approved , and he travelled via Mihailović 's headquarters at Ravna Gora . Early on , Mihailović designated Dangić as one of three men who were to succeed him as leaders of the Chetnik movement should anything happen to him . Within the first months of their occupation of Yugoslavia , the Germans had threatened to murder 100 Serb civilians for every German soldier killed and 50 for every German soldier wounded . As a result , Mihailović increasingly sought to avoid attacks that would bring German reprisals against the Serb population . Despite this , more than 25 @,@ 000 Serbs were killed in German reprisal killings by October 1941 . However , as early as that August , Mihailović had urged the Chetniks to " avoid clashes with the Germans for as long as possible . " Dangić likewise sought to avoid conflict with the Germans and began to pursue a policy of " self @-@ defence against the Ustaše and revenge against the Croats and Muslims . " In August 1941 , Dangić was sent by Mihailović to eastern Bosnia to take command of the Chetnik detachments in the region and bring them under Mihailović 's control , and he collected a group of Bosnian Serbs and crossed the Drina into the NDH . Dangić was accompanied by Major Boško Todorović who had been appointed by Mihailović as his commander for east Bosnia and Herzegovina . Dangić himself was appointed as the commander of the Mountain Staff of the Bosnian Chetnik Detachments , and had direct responsibility for east Bosnia , including the senior local Chetnik commanders , <unk> Babić and Rade Kosorić . According to the historian Dr. Marko Attila Hoare , Dangić may have had more influence on Chetnik decision @-@ making , despite his formal subordination to Todorović . Todorović was responsible for negotiating with the Italians and Dangić with the Germans . At the time Dangić arrived in east Bosnia , some Chetnik detachments were still co @-@ operating with the Partisans in the region . At the beginning of the uprising in east Bosnia , the 20 @-@ strong Han Pijesak @-@ based Chetnik detachment of Babić had accepted the command of the much larger Partisan Romanija company , but he became more independent as events unfolded and his own force grew . In early August , Babić refused to participate in a joint attack on Vlasenica with the Birač Partisan detachment due to the presence of " Turks " ( derogatory term for Bosnian Muslims ) in the Partisan force , and consequently the town was captured by the Partisans without Babić 's assistance on 11 August . Babić then moved his headquarters to Vlasenica and established a town administration that was completely independent of the Partisans . By this time Babić was the most powerful local Chetnik leader in the region , and had become the self @-@ styled " vojvoda ( warlord ) of the Bosnian Uprising " . 
 = = = = Initial activities and liaison with the Partisans = = = = 
 Dangić arrived in east Bosnia on 16 August . In the beginning , his operations were directed primarily against the Ustaše and the Bosnian Muslim population of the area , where Dangić exercised considerable influence over the Serb population . On 18 August , a 400 @-@ strong Chetnik force led by Dangić captured the town of Srebrenica . The Chetniks confiscated all weapons that were in the hands of the local inhabitants and began recruiting local Serbs to join the Chetniks . On 1 September , Babić signed an agreement with the Partisan Sarajevo Oblast ( district ) Staff led by Slobodan Princip @-@ Seljo and <unk> Kovačević to form a joint command . At the time , the Oblast Staff considered Babić 's troops were " semi @-@ bandit " , and that they had undermined the position of the Partisans with local Muslims . Princip @-@ Seljo and Kovačević had also intercepted one of Babić 's couriers carrying a message to the Germans . In the message Babić offered to work with the Germans and assured them he was only interested in fighting the Ustaše . By early September , Dangić had established himself as the leader of the Chetnik groups in eastern Bosnia , including those led by Babić and Kosorić . On 5 September , in response to a failed joint Partisan @-@ Chetnik attack on Kladanj , he burnt a number of Muslim homes , and his Chetniks engaged in the robbing and beating of Muslim civilians . At this point , occasional killings of Muslims occurred , although Hoare describes this behaviour as being " not yet genocidal . " That month , under the direct orders of Dangić , Chetniks burnt and looted the Muslim village of Novo Selo , killing Muslims and carrying out other crimes in the process . At the end of September , the Abwehr ( German military intelligence ) reported that Dangić was supported by and was in contact with the Nedić administration . It also reported that " [ Dangić ] has had good relations with the Germans and does everything in order to avoid collision between his troops and the Germans . " 
 On 1 October 1941 , Dangić and two other east Bosnian Chetnik commanders , Pero Đukanović and Sergije Mihailović , met with the Partisan General Staff for Bosnia @-@ Hercegovina at the village of Drinjača south of Zvornik . The Partisans were Svetozar Vukmanović ( known as " Tempo " ) , <unk> Čolaković and Princip @-@ Seljo . The meeting agreed on the creation of a joint Chetnik @-@ Partisan Staff , the " Command of the Bosnian Military and Partisan Detachments " , to consist of six members , three Chetniks and three Partisans . The meeting also agreed that joint Chetnik @-@ Partisan administration would be imposed on liberated areas , using the Partisan model of people 's liberation committees . The resulting declaration was a compromise , and called on the patriotism of both Serbs and Bosnians , although Dangić opposed the inclusion of any call for the unity of Muslims or Croats with the Serbs of Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , as he stated that all Muslims were responsible for the Ustaše crimes against Serbs . According to Hoare , the Drinjača agreement represented the pinnacle of co @-@ operation between Partisans and Chetniks in east Bosnia , but effectively sidelined the Provincial Committee . On 6 October , a further meeting was held at <unk> near Vlasenica , and the composition of the joint staff was decided . Dangić , Babić and Sergije Mihailović became the Chetnik representatives , and Vukmanović , Čolaković and Princip @-@ Seljo represented the Partisans , with Sergije Mihailović appointed as chief of staff . After the war , the Drinjača agreement was the subject of much heated debate between Vukmanović and Čolaković , with Vukmanović blaming Čolaković for the negative medium @-@ term consequences of the agreement for the Partisan movement in east Bosnia . According to Vukmanović , these consequences included the virtual disappearance of an independent Partisan General Staff for Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , the domination of the joint staff by Sergije Mihailović , including his appointment of officers hostile to the Partisans as commanders of Partisan units , the diversion of weapons from the Partisan controlled arms factory at Užice to Chetnik troops , and the alienation of the Muslim and Croat population of the region . When Vukmanović raised his concerns with Tito , the Bosnian Communists were forced to insist that the joint staff could have no contact with Chetnik units except during operations against Axis forces , and no joint Chetnik @-@ Partisan operations would be permitted in Muslim areas . 
 Relations between the Partisans and Chetniks were placed under pressure by the continued targeting of Muslims by Chetnik units . Over the period of 13 – 23 October 1941 , a joint Chetnik @-@ Partisan operation captured the town of Rogatica . During and after its capture , Chetnik elements of the force burned and looted Muslim homes , and Partisan units refused to obey orders to stop the Chetniks , stating they would not defend the " Turks " . 
 During this time , Dangić and his men cooperated with the Partisans in accordance with Chetnik policy at the time . Chetnik – Partisan cooperation in areas under Dangić 's command continued to some extent even after the two groups began clashing . Dangić is said to have held a " fierce hatred " of Muslims , allegedly saying that he wished to " kill them all " , and that he had an " absolute willingness " to collaborate with the Germans . That fall in the village of <unk> , about 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) east of Vlasenica , they barricaded a group of Muslims in a local <unk> ( Muslim religious school ) which was then set alight , killing eighty @-@ one people . Chetnik persecution of Muslims worsened after the break with the Partisans . The largest Chetnik massacres took place in eastern Bosnia and preceded any significant genocidal campaigns by the Ustaše , which began in the spring of 1942 . According to Hoare , the massacres were " above all an expression of the genocidal policy and ideology of the Chetnik movement " . 
 Although his original objective was solely to protect the Serb population against the Ustaše , Dangić quickly became an important factor in the conflict between the two groups in eastern Bosnia . The Germans sought to win Dangić over to collaboration in order to strengthen anti @-@ Partisan operations in the region , where Dangić 's Chetniks reportedly numbered about 10 @,@ 000 men , but at this time neither Dangić nor any of Mihailović 's other commanders had any arrangement with the Germans . 
 On 9 November 1941 , Mihailović ordered Dangić to attack Partisan forces in the Serbian town of Užice and to retain only his " most necessary units " in Bosnia . His order claimed that the Partisans were led by the Ustaše and were pursuing a " fratricidal war " amongst Serbs to " prevent the Chetniks from taking their revenge against the Croats . " However , Dangić failed to carry out the attack , likely because he considered the strengthening of Chetniks in eastern Bosnia a greater priority and because Partisans in Užice had previously provided Chetniks in Srebrenica with arms and munitions from the local weapons factory . The factory later blew up on 21 November and the Partisans withdrew from Užice on 29 November after being forced out by the German 113th , 342nd , and 717th Infantry Divisions . 
 = = = = Vlasenica conference = = = = 
 The break between the forces of Mihailović and Tito in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia reached eastern Bosnia in early November . In response , a joint Partisan @-@ Chetnik conference was held in Vlasenica on 16 November . It was convened by Čolaković and Vukmanović without consulting the Partisan Provincial Committee for Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina . Serbian Partisans were situated at Ljubovija at the time , ready to launch an offensive across the Drina against Dangić 's forces in Bratunac and Srebrenica , but held off at Čolaković 's request . At the conference , Čolaković tried to maintain the alliance , but Vukmanović raised Mihailović 's attack on Tito 's headquarters at Užice and the Chetnik 's failure to fight Axis forces . Dangić questioned Vukmanović 's Montenegrin background and told him to return to Montenegro . The Partisan representatives sought a policy of brotherhood and unity among Serbs , Muslims , and Croats , whereas Dangić stated that his Chetniks were fighting a purely Serbian war for the Serbian people . Dangić 's envoys told them they intended " to slit the throats of the Turks , except for any pretty Turkish ladies " and " screw down the Croats so hard that they wouldn 't dare for a thousand years to look at a Serb askance . " At this conference the two sides failed to come to an agreement . The next day a separate Chetnik conference was held where a 14 @-@ article resolution was adopted in support of Dangić 's views . Meanwhile , the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia and Herzegovina appealed to the Chetnik rank and file that Partisan @-@ Chetnik cooperation was broken due to the Chetnik importation of Royal Yugoslav Army officers from Serbia to Bosnia and due to Dangić wanting " to turn our People 's Liberation Struggle into a war of Serbs against Muslims " as opposed to the Partisan belief " that the peaceful toiling Muslim people is not to blame for the crimes that the Ustaše have committed , and that the People 's Liberation Army must protect them from persecution and killing . " The Staff charged that Dangić wished for " Serbs to gather for a war of revenge " instead of the Partisans ' " summon to our flag all honorable people , Serbs , Muslims , and Croats . " They claimed that Dangić attempted to collaborate with the Germans and Italians . 
 = = = = Capture of Goražde and atrocities = = = = 
 Sources vary to some extent in respect of the Chetnik massacre of Muslims in the town of Goražde . According to Hoare , on 29 November 1941 , the Italians handed Goražde over to the Chetniks , who immediately massacred Croatian Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials . This expanded into the systematic killing of the Muslim civilian population . Their corpses were left hanging in the town or were tossed into the Drina . Several hundred civilians were killed in Goražde at this time . Todorović had reached an agreement with Lieutenant @-@ Colonel <unk> , commander of the Italian garrison in Goražde , regarding Italian evacuation and hand over of Goražde to the Chetniks . According to Tomislav <unk> , the town was occupied by Dangić and his Chetniks on 1 December . Upon arrival , Dangić gave a speech to a group of Serbs , Croats and Bosnian Muslims which contained references to Greater Serbia and ended with Dangić proclaiming that Serbs and Bosnian Muslims could no longer live together . Following the speech , Chetnik bands spread through the town and began killing , raping , pillaging and torching homes . A significant number of victims were killed on a bridge over the Drina , after which their bodies were dropped into the river . Chetnik forces in Bosnia , including those of Dangić , then set about pursuing an anti @-@ Muslim campaign to recompense for the persecution experienced by ethnic Serbs in the NDH . On 11 December , Dangić 's Chetniks entered Pale and looted and burnt down the local convent . They captured five nuns ( two Croats , two Slovenes , and one Austrian ) and took them with them through Romanija to Goražde , where on 15 December they committed suicide to avoid being raped . 
 = = = = Operation Southeast Croatia = = = = 
 In December 1941 and January 1942 , Chetniks under Dangić 's command co @-@ operated with the Germans in eastern Bosnia . Between December 1941 and April 1942 , Dangić engaged in direct negotiations with the Germans . During the latter half of December he met with Abwehr representatives numerous times in an effort to reach an agreement with them . In January 1942 , Dangić and other Chetnik leaders met with Renzo Dalmazzo , the commander of the Italian 6th Army Corps . By this time , Dangić 's cooperation with the Germans came to be seen as being even more valuable because of the arrival of Tito and his First Proletarian Brigade to eastern Bosnia . The Germans and Croats launched Operation Southeast Croatia on 17 January . Dangić and Todorović advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans , and there was no need for the Chetniks to get involved . Following this , their units withdrew from their positions on the front line , let the Germans pass through their areas , or went home . Many withdrew across the Drina river into the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia to avoid being engaged . On 22 January , Dangić ordered his own troops to permit the Germans to pass through Bosnia , saying " they are advancing peacefully and minding their own business without disturbing our unfortunate and long @-@ suffering people . " He urged Chetniks and Serbs to annihilate the Ustaše , Croats and Communists . Within a few days , the Germans and Croats succeeded in pushing the Partisans out of eastern Bosnia and southward into the Italian @-@ occupied zone of the NDH . The Chetnik actions in response to Operation Southeast Croatia severely weakened Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory . The result was the severing of any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia . In the same month Dangić 's staff declared that the Partisans " are led by the Kike Moša Pijade , the Turk <unk> <unk> , the Magyar Franjo Vajnert , and that so @-@ and @-@ so Petar Ilić whose real name nobody knows [ emphasis in the original ] " and announced the shared goal of the Partisans and Ustaše was " to break up and destroy Serbdom . That , and that alone ! [ emphasis in the original ] " . In February , Dangić and other former Royal Yugoslav Army officers re @-@ entered eastern Bosnia from the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia , where some of them had withdrawn to avoid Operation Southeast Croatia . They started to re @-@ form Chetnik units in eastern Bosnia and began agitating against the Partisans on a " conservative , Serb @-@ nationalist and anti @-@ Muslim basis . " 
 = = = = Meeting in Belgrade = = = = 
 In order to enlist further Chetnik aid and to intensify the Chetnik – Partisan split , Dangić was invited to Belgrade in late January by Nedić and General der Artillerie ( lieutenant general ) Paul Bader . There , meetings were held from 30 January to 2 February 1942 . Present were Bader , Professor Josif <unk> , and Colonel Erich Kewisch for the Germans , Dangić and Pero Đukanović for the Chetniks , and Nedić and Aćimović for the Serbian puppet government . Eventually , the involved parties reached an agreement . The terms of the agreement stipulated that : 
 Dangić and his detachments bordered by the Drina , Sava and Bosna rivers in the east and the Italian – German Demarcation Line to the south were to place themselves immediately under the command of Generalleutnant Johann Fortner , commander of the 718th Infantry Division and holder of executive power in the area . 
 Dangić 's Chetniks were to remain aligned with the Germans , even in the event of a general uprising . 
 The town of Zvornik was to be Dangić 's assigned seat of command . 
 Dangić 's Chetniks were to help pacify northern Bosnia by ensuring that each Serb , Croat and Muslim there was to live in peace . 
 Murder was to be punishable by death . 
 The presence of NDH authorities was to be maintained . 
 Dangić was to spread news of the agreement , fight the Yugoslav Partisans , and protect German industrial and mining enterprises in eastern Bosnia according to Fortner 's instructions . 
 Ammunition for Dangić 's Chetniks was to be provided by Bader . 
 All prisoners held by Dangić 's forces were to be released . 
 The parties all agreed that seventeen districts in east Bosnia would have its military control shifted from NDH control to Chetnik control with the German military in Serbia attaining authority over it and having the ability to supply certain Chetnik forces no longer considered illegal by the Germans . The Germans demanded the area remain formally a part of the NDH though Bader implied " East Bosnia from the Serbian frontier to the River Bosna together with Sarajevo will be incorporated into occupied Serbia . " Dangić accepted it as formally being a part of the NDH , but informed the Chetniks in east Bosnia that occupied Serbia would include " the following districts from the territory of Bosnia : Sarajevo , Višegrad , Rogatica , Srebrenica , <unk> , Vlasenica , Zvornik , Kladanj , Fojnica , Travnik , Brčko , Foča , Doboj , Bijeljina , Tuzla , Zenica , and Čajniče . " Đukanović understood the agreement as meaning Serbian annexation of the districts . However , despite the concurrence of the parties , the agreement was not signed because negotiations had not been cleared in advance by General der Pioniere Walter Kuntze , the Wehrmacht Commander in Southeast Europe . Kuntze believed and informed Bader that " Major Dangić is a Serb and will remain one . He has only made the offer in order to use East Bosnia as his troop training ground , to overcome the winter months , and to make preparations to gain East Bosnia for Serbia . " Thus , he vetoed the conclusion of the agreement on 12 February . The agreement was also opposed by representatives of the NDH and the German Foreign Ministry . Siegfried Kasche , German envoy in Zagreb , Joachim von Ribbentrop , German foreign minister , and General Edmund Glaise @-@ Horstenau , opposed the agreement with Kasche arguing it would harm the NDH 's position , expand the suffering of Muslims in east Bosnia who outnumbered the Serbs , and damage German – Muslim world relations . This opposition led Bader to change his mind and not sign it . 
 Despite this , Dangić 's Chetniks collaborated with German forces in eastern Bosnia over a period of several weeks and with the understanding that Dangić and his forces would operate only inside Bosnia . Bader reported following the talks that " Dangić on this occasion declared that he and his men would , even in the conditions of a general uprising in the Balkans and the arrival of the English , fight loyally and without wavering on the German side . He declared on this occasion his belief that only German victory could guarantee Serbia the position due to it in the Balkans , while the victory of Bolshevism would mean the destruction of every nation , thus also including the Serb nation . " The plan of a Greater Serbia protected by the Germans continued to be pursued by Nedić and Dangić . 
 The Ustaše authorities were concerned about negotiations between the German and Italian commanders and Dangić , and were particularly worried that the Germans would permit the Italians and Chetniks to use Sarajevo as a base . In March , NDH gendarmerie in Tuzla reported " Nedić 's Chetniks are distributing weapons and ammunition from the quota they receive from the Germans for the struggle against the Communists . They are constantly sent from Serbia into Bosnia and are claiming that they will conquer the latter . " On 31 March , Jure Francetić , commander of the Black Legion , an Ustaše militia infantry unit consisting largely of Muslim and Croat refugees that fled from eastern Bosnia , launched a pre @-@ emptive offensive primarily against Dangić 's Chetniks . Francetić captured Vlasenica , Bratunac and Srebrenica , meeting limited resistance from the Partisans , and then scattered the more numerous Chetniks while inflicting significant losses and committing atrocities against segments of the Bosnian Serb population . In mid @-@ 1942 , <unk> Đorđević , senior Serbian Interior Ministry official , asked Đukanović during a visit to Nedić : " Do you really still have Turks in Bosnia ? They must all be expelled and cleansed , so that we can enter Bosnia and establish our government . " 
 In early April , Dangić made the mistake of travelling to Serbia , where he met one of Nedić 's representatives and various other Chetnik leaders , and attended a public rally in Valjevo . Shortly afterwards , Kuntze ordered Dangić 's arrest . Dangić was then seized and taken to a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp in German @-@ occupied Poland , being replaced by Stevan Botić as the Chetnik commander in eastern Bosnia . Dangić escaped from prison in 1943 . The following year he participated in the Warsaw Uprising , an anti @-@ German rebellion which resulted in the deaths of 18 @,@ 000 members of the Polish Home Army and over 200 @,@ 000 Polish civilians .

 In 1945 , after the Soviets drove the Germans out of Poland , Dangić was captured by the Red Army and extradited to Yugoslavia 's new Communist authorities . Accused of committing war crimes , he was immediately arrested and charged . Dangić was then tried , found guilty by a court in Sarajevo and sentenced to death . He was executed by firing squad on 22 August 1947 . According to the indictment against Mihailović and others , Dangić was awarded the Order of the Star of Karađorđe by the Yugoslav government @-@ in @-@ exile on the recommendation of Mihailović .

 The Korean War began when North Korean People 's Army forces attacked south in June 1950 . As the fighting progressed , temporary military cemeteries for battle casualties were established by United Nations forces near the towns of Taejon ( July 9 , 1950 ) , Kwan @-@ ui ( Kwan @-@ ni ) , Kum @-@ chon , and <unk> . When the North Korean forces pushed towards Pusan , these cemeteries had to be abandoned . Later , as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter developed , temporary cemeteries were established at Masan , Miryang , and Taegu , with a Pusan cemetery being established on July 11 , 1950 . As the fighting pushed into North Korea , temporary cemeteries were established in or near the towns of Kaesong , <unk> , Wonsan , <unk> ( <unk> County ) , <unk> @-@ ni and Koto @-@ ri . Some 11 division @-@ level cemeteries were established in the first two months of fighting and later 5 UN military cemeteries were established in North Korea . 
 At the beginning of the war , the nearest U.S. Army mortuary affairs unit was the 108th Graves Registration Platoon in Yokohama , Japan , which was searching for the remains of missing World War II American airmen . The 108th was reconfigured as the 114th Graves Registration Company and deployed to establish temporary cemeteries at Hungnam , Pyongyang , and <unk> as the fighting continued . Supporting the 2nd Infantry Division was the Graves Registration Section of the 2nd Quartermaster Company , which collected the remains of Allied and American soldiers to be further processed by the 148th Graves Registration Company . When UN forces launched the Inchon Invasion in September 1950 , a platoon from the 565th Graves Registration Company accompanied them . Other mortuary affairs units included the 293rd Graves Registration Company , activated in April 1951 . It was difficult to recover remains and conduct burials in Korea , due to the rugged geography and harsh climate , and the threat of unexploded ordnance and booby @-@ traps .

 Auto Club Speedway , formerly California Speedway , is a two @-@ mile ( 3 km ) , low @-@ banked , D @-@ shaped oval superspeedway in Fontana , California which has hosted NASCAR racing annually since 1997 . It is also used for open wheel racing events . The racetrack is located near the former locations of Ontario Motor Speedway and Riverside International Raceway . The track is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation and is the only track owned by ISC to have naming rights sold . The speedway is served by the nearby Interstate 10 and Interstate 15 freeways as well as a Metrolink station located behind the backstretch . 
 Construction of the track , on the site of the former Kaiser Steel Mill , began in 1995 and was completed in late 1996 . The speedway has a grandstand capacity of 68 @,@ 000 and 28 skyboxes . In 2006 , a fanzone was added behind the main grandstand . Lights were added to the speedway in 2004 with the addition of a second annual NASCAR weekend .

 On April 20 , 1994 , Roger Penske and Kaiser announced the construction of a racetrack on the site of the abandoned Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana , CA . A day after the announcement CART announced it would hold an annual race at the speedway . Three months later NASCAR President Bill France , Jr. agreed to sanction Winston Cup Series races at the speedway upon completion , marking the first time NASCAR has made a commitment to run a race at a track that had yet to be built . Community meetings were held to discuss issues related to the construction of the track and the local effects of events held . The local community largely supported construction of the speedway citing potentially increased land values and rejuvenation of the community . In April 1995 , after having toured the sister track Michigan International Speedway , the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the project . The California Environmental Protection Agency gave Penske permission to begin construction after Kaiser agreed to pay $ 6 million to remove hazardous waste from the site . Construction on the site began on November 22 , 1995 with the demolition of the Kaiser Steel Mill . The 100 @-@ foot water tower , a landmark of the Kaiser property , was preserved in the center of the track to be used as a scoreboard . 3 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 2 @,@ 300 m3 ) of contaminated dirt was removed and transported to a toxic waste landfill . To prevent remaining impurities from rising to the surface , a cap of non @-@ porous polyethylene was put down and covered with 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) of clean soil . Construction of the track was completed in late 1996 . 
 On January 10 , 1997 Marlboro Team Penske ’ s driver Paul Tracy became the first driver to test on the new speedway . NASCAR held its first open test session on at the track from May 5 – 7 . The official opening and ribbon cutting ceremony was held on June 20 , 1997 with the first race , a NASCAR West Series race , being held the next day .

In 2001 the Auto Club <unk> , a 1 / 4 mile dragstrip , was built outside of the backstretch of the main speedway . That same year , the infield of the speedway was reconfigured to hold a multipurpose road course . On April 24 , 2003 The San Bernardino County Planning Commission approved the changing of the speedway ’ s conditional use permit to allow the installation of lights around the track . Later that year NASCAR announced a second annual Sprint Cup Series race at the track for the 2004 season , with the second race being run " under the lights " . NASCAR ran two weekends of racing annually until the 2011 season , when the track returned to a single annual race weekend . 
 In 2006 , the speedway 's midway , located behind the main grandstand , was overhauled . The new midway , called Discover IE <unk> , includes the addition of Apex ( a Wolfgang Puck restaurant ) , additional shade and lounge areas , a new retail store and an entertainment stage . 
 In March 2014 , Las Vegas based company <unk> Racing expanded to California by opening a new 1 @.@ 2 mile road course at the Auto Club Speedway .

 Upon the addition of a second NASCAR weekend at the track in 2004 , attendance at the races dropped off dramatically , by as much as 20 @,@ 000 . With such a large attendance swing , drivers and media began to doubt if the track deserved two dates , even if the track was near Los Angeles , the nation 's second @-@ largest media market . Weather also became a concern with either extremely hot days or with rain threatening the races . All of this factored into NASCAR 's decision to remove a second race from the track with the realignment of the 2011 NASCAR schedule . Former track owner Roger Penske said the track may be located in a one @-@ race market . Track president Gillian Zucker cited bad weather windows and fans having other entertainment options as reasons for the attendance decline . 
 Effective in the 2014 racing season , the grandstand capacity was reduced from 92 @,@ 000 to 68 @,@ 000 . This was accomplished by removing approximately 12 @,@ 000 seats near Turn 1 and installing a hospitality area and a digital display showing speeds along the straightaway . In addition , seats were further reduced as a result of modifying average seat width from 18 inches to 23 inches . The capacity quoted does not include luxury boxes and infield seating , which when added up reaches a capacity of approximately 100 @,@ 000 .

 On February 21 , 2008 , the Automobile Club of Southern California ( ACSC ) became the title sponsor of the raceway , making Auto Club Speedway the track 's official name . The naming rights deal will last for ten years and is worth an estimated $ 50 to $ 75 million . In addition to naming rights , the ACSC will have use of the facility for road tests for <unk> Magazine and other consumer tests . The money will be used for capital improvements to the track .

 The facility is often used for filming television shows , commercials and films . In 2000 , portions of Charlie 's Angels were filmed at the speedway , and in 2005 , portions of Herbie : Fully Loaded were filmed there . In 2007 , The Bucket List saw Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman drive a vintage Shelby Mustang and Dodge Challenger around the 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) speedway . 
 A parody of the track was used in the 2006 Pixar film Cars . It is the venue for the Piston Cup tiebreaker race between the movie 's main character Lightning McQueen ( voiced by Owen Wilson ) , retiring veteran Strip " The King " Weathers ( voiced by Richard Petty ) and perennial runner @-@ up Chick Hicks ( voiced by Michael Keaton ) . The race is held at the Los Angeles International Speedway , which is a conglomeration of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena where the Rose Bowl is located , as well as the Auto Club Speedway .

 During the 1999 Marlboro 500 CART race , Canadian driver Greg Moore died in a crash along the backstretch of the track . It was determined that after sliding along the infield grass , Moore 's car hit the edge of oncoming pavement , which caused the car to flip into a concrete retaining wall . The incident prompted the track owners , ISC , to pave the backstretch of both Auto Club Speedway and its sister track Michigan International Speedway in an attempt to prevent a similar accident . Shortly after the crash , CART mandated the use of a head @-@ and @-@ neck restraint system on all ovals . The rule eventually became mandatory on all tracks . 
 On April 5 , 2002 , Ricky Lundgren was killed in a qualifying session for a motorcycle race . 
 On August 7 , 2004 , a police officer from San Diego , John Barr , died during an open track event after coming off his motorcycle . 
 On June 2 , 2005 , two men died while participating in an event sponsored by the San Diego Chapter of the Ferrari Owners ' Club . 
 On October 15 , 2010 , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old woman died while participating in a driving school at the track . The woman was driving a replica Indycar as part of the Mario Andretti Racing Experience when she lost control and hit the inside wall of the track .

 = Council House , Perth = 
 Council House is a 13 @-@ storey office building on St Georges Terrace in Perth , Western Australia . Located beside Stirling Gardens and Government House in the city 's central business district , the 47 @.@ 9 @-@ metre ( 157 ft ) building was designed by Howlett and Bailey Architects and opened by The Queen in 1963 , after Perth hosted the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games . For most of its history , it has served as the headquarters for the City of Perth . 
 Built in a modernist style , the building has been the subject of vigorous public debate about its heritage value . Some parties , such as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects , consider the building to be an important example of modernist architecture in the city , whilst others consider it ugly . These conflicting views led to animosity in the 1990s , when the State Government refused to heritage list the property , and instead recommended its demolition . Despite this , the City of Perth opted to renovate the tower and keep it as its headquarters . Following this , the building was admitted to the State 's Heritage Register . 
 = = Prior site history = = 
 The site was originally home to the Colony 's governing Legislative Council in a building which came to be known as the Old Government Offices or Public Offices . The building was designed by Acting Civil Engineer Henry Reveley in August 1836 after he was asked to prepare plans for public offices on the site . A call for tenders was made , and the tender accepted was for £ 1 @,@ 833 , well above the £ 1 @,@ 200 maximum specified in the call for tenders . Payment was delayed until February 1839 . 
 The Public Offices stood 10 metres ( 33 ft ) back from St Georges Terrace . The Legislative Council occupied the building until 1870 , when it moved to a chamber adjoining the new Perth Town Hall . The Legislative Council returned to the building in 1890 after the newly formed Legislative Assembly took over that chamber . In the 1890s , the building became a Post Office , before being taken over by the Department of Agriculture , and the building continued to be used as public offices until 1961 . Additions to the building in the 1930s included a second storey , which contained a Legislative Council room and offices for senior public servants . Showing its age , the building eventually became what was described as a " rat @-@ infested hell @-@ hole " . 
 The Perth City Council had been based from 1871 in the Perth Town Hall , then in 1925 moved to offices in Murray Street . The site of the Public Offices on St Georges Terrace was chosen as the site for a new home for the Perth City Council in 1954 . Immediately south of the Public Offices building stood the Soldiers ' Institute building . This building was taken over from the Returned Soldiers ' League by the ABC in 1937 for its <unk> radio studio . 
 = = Competition and construction = = 
 With the news that Perth would be hosting the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games , Perth City Council in 1959 launched an international competition to design its new building . The brief in the competition was to design a " creative building that marked where Perth was at the time " and have the building ready in time for the opening of the Commonwealth Games . 
 There were 61 designs entered into the competition , including one by Jeffrey Howlett and Don Bailey from the Melbourne architectural firm Bates , Smart and McCutcheon . The jury assessing the competition entries , which included architect Harry Seidler , described the Howlett @-@ Bailey plan as " a remarkably simple solution to a complex problem " and declared them winners of the competition . 
 The ABC moved to new premises on Adelaide Terrace in 1960 when the Council House site was taken over by the Perth City Council for construction to begin . Both the Public Offices and Soldiers ' Institute buildings were demolished to make way for the redevelopment . 
 Excavations for construction of the building 's foundations started in October 1961 and the first concrete pour occurred in November 1961 . The building was not completely finished by the time Perth hosted the Commonwealth Games in November 1962 , however the builders rushed to finish the ground , eighth , and 10th floors in time so that foreign dignitaries could be entertained in the reception areas . Following the Games , the fit @-@ out of the building was finished in March 1963 , and on 25 March 1963 Queen Elizabeth II officially opened Council House , unveiling a 2 @.@ 4 @-@ metre ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) tall ceremonial plaque set in granite from the original 1817 Waterloo Bridge in London . 
 Construction of Council House was performed by J. Hawkins and Son Pty Ltd , and cost £ 1 @.@ 5 million . It was the first building in Perth to use complete window walling . In order to reduce the heat entering the building through these full @-@ height windows , the building used internal blinds and external sun @-@ breakers . When the building was opened , all Perth City Council activities were moved there . 
 Part of Howlett and Bailey 's plans for the complex included the extension of Terrace Road westwards across the sites of the Old Court House and the Supreme Court , but this was never done . Also part of their plan was the construction of an elliptical auditorium called the " Public Suite " behind Council House ; the plan to build this was dropped after the completion of Council House , with the design reformulated by Howlett and Bailey and the building eventually built on the opposite side of Government House as the Perth Concert Hall . 
 = = 1990s refurbishment and heritage listing = = 
 The building continued to serve as the headquarters for the Perth City Council from its completion until 1994 , when it was vacated to allow for the removal of asbestos which had been used to insulate the building 's steel frame . The Council moved to office space in the Westralia Square building . 
 In 1994 , Commissioners appointed by the State to oversee the break @-@ up of the Perth City Council voted to demolish the building . At the time , refurbishment costs were estimated to run to $ 42 million . The State Government 's plan was to demolish the building and extend Stirling Gardens right across the site to beside Government House , as part of a broader plan entitled " Perth - A City for People " which also included the Northbridge Tunnel , the sinking of Riverside Drive , and the housing of Supreme Court and District Court under the one roof . The State Government suggested that the Council move into the Old Treasury Building across St Georges Terrace , for which they offered an incentive of $ 30 million . 
 Significant public debate ensued about whether the building should be kept . Those prominent in the fight to save the building included Bill Warnock , architect Ken Adam , and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects . Others said it was " out of date , unattractive , and out of step " with the older heritage buildings which surround it . Heritage Minister Graham Kierath also refused to place the building on the WA Register of Heritage Places , despite calls from the Heritage Council and the National Trust to do so . This decision " stunned " the Institute of Architects . 
 Despite the recommendation for demolition , in late 1995 , the Councillors of the newly formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council House could be refurbished . This feasibility study was carried out by Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey , of which one of the partners was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett , and cost $ 100 @,@ 000 . The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished , and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans , removing its asbestos and building an underground car park at the rear of the site . The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent . At the time , the refurbishment was expected to cost around $ 26 million . 
 The new 95 @-@ bay car park at the rear of the building required the removal of a New Zealand Kauri Pine estimated to be up to 150 years old , and was described by Opposition MLC John <unk> as a " disgrace " which would undermine the heritage value of the precinct . There was also some concern expressed that the refurbishment might cause the building to lose heritage value through the updating of its interiors . 
 The contract to refurbish the building was won by John Holland Group , the construction company of Janet Holmes à Court , on 29 July 1997 , at a price of $ 25 @.@ 3 million . The architect for the refurbishment was Geoffrey Clough of Peter Hunt and Daryl Jackson Architects . The building was " stripped back to bare bones " and the tiny tiles coating the building 's distinctive " T " -shaped fins were removed , repaired , and re @-@ glued to the surface . The refurbishment also involved the construction of a new " Lord Mayoral space and reception area " on the eleventh floor ( formerly a plant level ) , the full enclosure of the ground floor ( which had previously been partially open to the elements ) and the replacement of gold Venetian blinds which had been a feature of the building in the past . 
 The City of Perth moved back to Council House in February 1999 and placed three unused floors of Council House for lease . The refurbishment was widely considered a " qualified success " , with the building " handsomely restored " . 
 The Western Australian state election of 2001 had resulted in a change of government , including a change of Heritage Minister . The restored building was finally placed on the interim heritage list by Heritage Minister Michelle Roberts on 5 March 2006 . Former Heritage Minister Graham Kierath , who had resisted the nomination in the 1990s , attacked the decision to list the building as pandering to left @-@ wing supporters . The Heritage Council of Western Australia recommended on 17 November 2006 that the listing of the building go ahead . The building was entered as a permanent entry on the Heritage Register on 8 December 2006 . 
 = = Design and reaction = = 
 Council House is constructed from concrete @-@ encased steel frame , with lifts and service rooms located at its eastern end and a fire escape stairwell at its western end . Level 9 houses the distinctive circular Council Chamber , which features wood panelling and has been restored to largely its original state in the 1990s refurbishment ( by contrast to most of the other levels of the building ) . The building is almost completely clad with glass , which led to criticism about its excessive air conditioning costs . The glass exterior of the building has T @-@ shaped white <unk> superimposed in an alternating pattern across the building , coated with fine mosaic tiles . With the newly enclosed top floor , the building now has 13 levels above ground . 
 The building , which was the favourite creation of its designer Jeffrey Howlett , has been called the most important example of modernist architecture in Perth and " one of the State 's modernist icons " . The building has been described as demonstrating " modernist aspirations " from the Bauhaus school , exuding " brutalist warmth " . Stephen <unk> , the Chair of Architectural Design at Curtin University , described it as reflecting Perth of that time : a city " brimming with confidence and consciously promoting itself to the world as a modern city " . Adrian Iredale , from architects Iredale Pederson Hook , described the building as " simultaneously elegant and heavy and introducing poetry through the repetitive system of sun shading , the big Ts that hover in front of the facade on all sides . " 
 The building has divided the public over the years , with some branding the building an " eyesore " and a " hideous folly " , whereas others considered it a " classic example of 1960s architecture and an important reminder of Perth 's past " and a " unique building " . It has been suggested by Associate Ralph Hoare from the Australian Institute of Architects said the building should never have been built on St Georges Terrace , having been built in the " wrong place " .

 = BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 = 
 The BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 was a maritime patrol and attack aircraft intended to replace the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2 . The rebuilt aircraft would have extended the operating life of the Nimrod fleet by several decades and significantly improved the aircraft by installing more efficient Rolls @-@ Royce <unk> turbofan jet engines to almost double the flight range . The conversion of the flight deck to a digital glass cockpit would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements . New detection systems were to be installed , as well as additional weapons for anti @-@ submarine warfare . 
 However the project was subject to significant delays due to cost over @-@ runs and contract re @-@ negotiations . This was partly due to difficulties combining refurbished Nimrod MR2 fuselages , which had not been built to a common standard , with newly built wings . The numbers of aircraft to be procured fell from 21 to nine over a course of years , while costs continued to climb . 
 The MRA4 was ultimately cancelled in 2010 as a result of the Strategic Defence and Security Review , at which point it was £ 789 million over @-@ budget and over nine years late . There is no direct replacement under development . The roles intended for the MRA4 are filled by existing assets such as the Type 23 Frigate and the Merlin helicopter . Ultimately , On 23 November 2015 , the UK announced its intention to order nine P @-@ 8 Poseidon ASW aircraft as part of the Strategic Defense and Security Review 2015 , effectively replacing the Nimrod .

 = = = Background and origins = = = 
 In 1988 , the Royal Air Force started a Replacement Maritime Patrol Aircraft ( <unk> ) procurement programme to replace the Nimrod MR2 aircraft . To meet the requirement British Aerospace proposed rebuilding each Nimrod MR2 with new engines and electronics which it called Nimrod 2000 . The RAF considered bids from Lockheed with its P @-@ 3 Orion , <unk> Corporation with rebuilt ex @-@ US Navy Orions , and Dassault with the Atlantique 3 . In December 1996 the $ <unk> @-@ billion contract was awarded to British Aerospace for the Nimrod 2000 , under the designation Nimrod MRA4 . British Aerospace became BAE Systems in 1999 and continued development on the Nimrod MRA4 . 
 The MRA4 was to be essentially a new aircraft . Significant changes included the installation of current @-@ generation Rolls @-@ Royce BR710 turbofan engines , a larger and more efficient wing , and a fully refurbished fuselage . Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 because the airflow requirements of the BR710 engine are significantly higher than that of the original Spey 250 powering the original Nimrods . The MRA4 also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology ; the glass cockpit was derived from the Airbus A340 . 
 According to BAE Systems , the Nimrod MRA4 systems was to enable the crews to gather , process and display up to 20 times more technical and strategic data than the MR2 . The Searchwater 2000 radar was stated to have been capable over land as well as water ; with the ability to have swept an area the size of the UK every 10 seconds . The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids ( ASTA ) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground @-@ based training systems ; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises . 
 = = = Delays and development problems = = = 
 The original scheduled date of entry into service for the MRA4 was April 2003 ; however , development proved far more protracted than anticipated . An independent company , Flight Refuelling Ltd . , was contracted to undertake the conversions to MRA4 standard , however BAE discovered that the Nimrod airframes supplied by the RAF were not built to a common standard and this considerably complicated the refurbishment process . The task of converting the existing airframes was transferred in @-@ house to BAE Systems Woodford . The BAE team at Woodford then found that the new wing was flawed , which resulted in the project being put on hold while another wing design was developed . 
 BAE Systems issued a shock profit warning in December 2002 due to cost overruns of the Nimrod MRA4 and the Astute class submarine projects . On 19 February 2003 BAE took a charge of £ 500 million against the MRA4 contract . The company had previously taken a £ 300 million " loss charge " in 2000 , which was expected to cover " all the costs of completion of the current contract " . The contract was renegotiated for the second time in 2002 , where the aircraft requirement was reduced from 21 to 18 . 
 Announcing plans for the future of the British military on 21 July 2004 , the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft , and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice . <unk> , the second development MRA4 , achieved its first flight in December 2004 and was used to test elements of the mission system and the air vehicle . BAE Systems received a contract worth £ 1 @.@ 1 billion for 12 <unk> on 18 July 2006 ; three were to be development aircraft and nine more converted to production standard . The Nimrod MRA4 successfully released the Sting Ray torpedo for the first time on 30 July 2007 . 
 Further disputes over cost meant that the number of <unk> to be delivered was further reduced to nine by Spring 2008 . The first production aircraft took its maiden flight on 10 September 2009 . At the time of the flight , each MRA4 was to cost at least £ 400 million . The Ministry of Defence announced in December 2009 that the introduction of the MRA4 would be delayed until 2012 as part of defence spending cuts . The first Nimrod MRA4 was delivered in March 2010 to the RAF for acceptance testing ; initial operational capability was expected to be reached in October 2012 . The MRA4 was to operate out from its main base at RAF Kinloss , Scotland ; all nine aircraft were due to be delivered by 2012 . 
 = = = Cancellation = = = 
 In the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review of the Armed Forces , the UK government announced the cancellation of the MRA4 on 19 October 2010 and consequently that RAF Kinloss , the intended base for the Nimrod fleet , would be closed . On 24 November 2010 , 382 sub @-@ contract workers previously working on the MRA4 were laid off at BAE Systems Warton and Woodford . After the airframes were stripped of electronic equipment , the remaining fuselages were scrapped at BAE Systems Woodford beginning on 26 January 2011 . Although the process was conducted behind screens intended to hide the process from the media , the BBC flew a helicopter over Woodford and broadcast footage of the scrapping in process . 
 Although late and over @-@ budget the decision to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion . It has been reported that following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 ( in March 2010 . ) , Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters , but they could not be tracked because of the lack of suitable aircraft . In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France , Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland . 
 The aircraft would also have been used in the civilian search and rescue role , the Nimrod MR2 had often been used in this role . In this respect the Strategic Defence and Security Review stated that the UK " will depend on other maritime assets to contribute to the tasks previously planned for [ the Nimrod MRA4 ] " . 
 Following the cancellation , the Defence Secretary Liam Fox used the Nimrod MRA4 procurement as an example of the worst of MOD procurement performance : " The idea that we ever allow ourselves into a position where something that was originally Nimrod 2000 – where we ordered [ 21 ] was reduced to nine , spent £ <unk> and we still weren 't close to getting the capability – is not to happen again . " 
 In January 2011 it was reported by the Financial Times that when the decision was taken to scrap the aircraft , " [ The MRA4 ] was still riddled with flaws .... Safety tests conducted [ in 2010 ] found there were still ' several hundred design non @-@ <unk> ' with the aircraft . It was unclear , for example , whether its bomb bay doors functioned properly , whether its landing gear worked and , most worryingly , whether its fuel pipe was safe . " According to Air Forces Monthly magazine , " significant aerodynamic issues and associated flying control concerns in certain regimes of flight meant that it was grounded at the time of cancellation and may not have been signed over as safe by the Military Aviation Authority . " The magazine also stated that the reason for the cancellation was that the RAF and Navy placed a higher priority on fast jets and frigates than on maritime patrol . 
 Nevertheless , six ex @-@ defence chiefs publicly criticised the decision to scrap the Nimrods in January 2011 and the Public Accounts Committee concluded in February 2012 that the decision had been made without a proper understanding of the cost implications and had wasted £ <unk>

 Press reports in February 2011 claimed the Royal Navy 's Fleet Air Arm had established a committee to consider the acquisition of maritime patrol aircraft to replace the Nimrod in the anti @-@ submarine role , with an estimated budget of around £ 1 billion , contrasting with the MRA4 program 's cost of £ 3 @.@ 6 billion .

 Lurie Garden is a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 10 @,@ 000 m2 ) garden located at the southern end of Millennium Park in the Loop area of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States . Designed by Kathryn Gustafson , Piet Oudolf , and Robert Israel , it opened on July 16 , 2004 . The garden is a combination of perennials , bulbs , grasses , shrubs and trees . It is the featured nature component of the world 's largest green roof . The garden cost $ 13 @.@ 2 million and has a $ 10 million endowment for maintenance and upkeep . It was named after Ann Lurie , who donated the $ 10 million endowment . For visitors , the garden features guided walks , lectures , interactive demonstrations , family festivals and picnics . 
 The Garden is composed of two " plates " protected on two sides by large hedges . The dark plate depicts Chicago 's history by presenting shade @-@ loving plant material . The dark plate has a combination of trees that will provide a shade canopy for these plants when they fill in . The light plate , which includes no trees , represents the city 's future with sun @-@ loving perennials that thrive in the heat and the sun .

 Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west , Grant Park has been Chicago 's front yard since the mid 19th century . Its northwest corner , north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute , east of Michigan Avenue , south of Randolph Street , and west of Columbus Drive , had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997 , when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park . Today , Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction . Today , there is truly a rooftop garden on top of the Millennium Park parking garage , which is itself above railroad tracks . 
 In 1836 , a year before Chicago was incorporated , the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city 's first lots . Foresighted citizens , who wanted the lakefront kept as public open space , convinced the commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between Randolph Street and Park Row ( 11th Street ) " Public Ground — A Common to Remain Forever Open , Clear and Free of Any Buildings , or Other Obstruction , whatever . " Grant Park has been " forever open , clear and free " since , protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court rulings . 
 In 1839 , United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue " Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings " . Aaron Montgomery Ward , who is known both as the inventor of mail order and the protector of Grant Park , twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones . In 1890 , arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held easements on the park land , Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free of new buildings . In 1900 , the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements . In 1909 , when he sought to prevent the construction of the Field Museum of Natural History in the center of the park , the courts affirmed his arguments . As a result , the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park and there are no tall buildings in the park blocking the sun for large parts of the day . 
 The Lurie garden constantly depicts the dynamics of nature , but it is most colorful from June through the autumn . It is not a botanical garden with a scientific purpose and is instead a public garden . Thus , it does not use a plant labeling system . The plant life of the garden consists entirely of perennials . It does not now nor does it intend to incorporate annuals , which rarely survive Chicago winters . Approximately 60 % of the plant life in the light and dark plates are plants that are native to Illinois . It is located across the street from the Art Institute of Chicago 's new Modern Wing , and within the park it is south of Jay Pritzker Pavilion , east of the South Chase Promenade and Southwest Exelon Pavilion as well as the future site of the Nichols Bridgeway , west of the Southeast Exelon Pavilion , southwest of the BP Pedestrian Bridge . 
 = = Culture = = 
 The world @-@ class garden was an essential element of the park , as the motto of Chicago is Urbs in Horto , which is a Latin phrase meaning City in a Garden . The Garden also pays tribute to Carl Sandburg 's moniker of Chicago as the " City of Big Shoulders " with a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) " shoulder " hedge that protects the perennial garden and encloses the park on two sides . It keeps the garden from being trampled by crowds exiting events at the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion . 
 The " shoulder " hedge , which serves as the northern edge of the garden , also fills the space next to the void of the great lawn of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion . These hedges use a metal armature , to prefigure the mature hedge . The shoulder hedge is an evolving hedge screen of deciduous Fagus ( beech ) and Carpinus ( hornbeam ) and evergreen Thuja ( <unk> , also known as <unk> ) that will eventually ( over the course of approximately ten years ) branch horizontally to fill the permanent armature frame and create a solid hedge . 
 The garden was one of the gardens depicted in the 2006 In Search of Paradise : Great Gardens of the World exhibition that was shown from May 12 – October 22 , 2006 in the Boeing Galleries and that was later shown in the Chicago Botanic Garden . The Chicago Botanic Garden developed the exhibition that included 65 <unk> of gardens from 21 countries using photographs that were less than five years old . 
 = = Design = = 
 Kathryn Gustafson , known generally for sculptured parks and lively waterworks and specifically for the Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain , and Israel , a renowned lighting and set designer , determined the thematic concepts such as the placement of paths , and the shapes of perennial beds . Oudolf , a Dutch master of perennial , designed the flower beds which contain 26 @,@ 000 perennial plants in 250 varieties native to the prairie . Gustafson and her partners , Jennifer Guthrie and Shannon Nichol , and Israel are Seattle @-@ based . The garden is designed with four primary components : the shoulder hedge , the light plate , the dark plate and the seam boardwalk . 
 The shoulder hedge frames the garden 's north and west sides , and the hedge and armature help to protect the perennials from heavy pedestrian traffic . The 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) armature also provides a permanent pruning guide . In addition to the Carl Sandburg symbolism , the western hedge also forms a topiary referring to greek mythology . 
 Lurie Garden is bisected by a diagonal boardwalk , which represents the natural Lake Michigan seawall that still bisects Grant Park . The boardwalk divides the garden into two plates , one of which contains muted colors , the other bright colors , while paralleling the line of the old Illinois Central Railroad retaining wall . The dark plate represents the early landscape history of the site , while the light plate represents the landscape of the future . The diagonal plate @-@ dividing seam boardwalk serves as a demarcation between two eras of Chicago 's landscape development . It also serves as a reminder of the time when Chicago placed boards over the marshland for pedestrians . 
 The boardwalk has a 24 @-@ inch ( 61 cm ) wide step on one side . The step , which provides seating , leads down to a 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) wide canal , which runs between this step and a limestone wall . The limestone supports the plant beds of the dark plate . The water is invigorated with jets , and visitors are allowed to sit and dangle their feet in the water . It traces the angle of a historic subterranean seawall that remains beneath the site and used to be the boundary between the marshy Lake Michigan shoreline and the city . The boardwalk also crosses over stepped pools that expose a 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) wide seam of water . 
 The garden initially had a hardwood footbridge that passes over the shallow water in the canal , and that divides the garden diagonally . However , stories in the sixth year of the garden described steel bridges . The entire garden slopes downward to present itself for the new Renzo Piano Modern Wing addition to the Art Institute of Chicago Building . At the foot of the canal opposite the Building the water ends in a pool . Oudolf 's lighting accents the hedges , and pathways are lit by in @-@ ground lighting fixtures . There were complaints that the construction of the Nichols Bridgeway <unk> the picturesque view of Lurie Gardens and in so doing diminishes its prairie aspect . 
 = = = Materials = = = 
 The garden is a sustainable design built on lightweight <unk> under the soil . All curbing , stone stairways , stair landings , wall coping , and wall cladding in the interior of the Garden use midwestern limestone . The garden uses granite for paving and wall veneer . Where it is exposed , the granite surfaces have a flamed finish . The boardwalk and wood benches in the Garden are fabricated from FSC @-@ certified <unk> . The garden primarily uses <unk> Naval Brass ( all metal plates in the <unk> ) , <unk> architectural bronze ( all handrails ) , and <unk> steel ( the armature ) .

 The seasonal highlights are as follows : Spring highlights include - Star of Persia , Arkansas Blue Star , Wild White Indigo , <unk> , Shooting Star , Prairie Smoke , Virginia Bluebells , Herbaceous Peony , <unk> , Meadow Sage , Burnet , and Tulip ; Summer highlights include - Giant <unk> , Ornamental Onion , Butterfly Weed , Purple Lance <unk> , <unk> , Rusty <unk> , Pale <unk> , <unk> , White Blazing Star , Bee Balm , Oregano , and Culver 's Root ; Fall / Winter highlights include - Japanese Anemone , White Wood Aster , Northern Sea Oats , Tennessee <unk> , Purple Love Grass , Rattlesnake Master , Bottle Gentian , Common Eulalia Grass , Red Switch Grass , Little <unk> , Prairie <unk> , and Toad Lily . The garden features dozens of types of perennials and bulbs . The garden features both ornamental and prairie grasses . It includes evergreen and deciduous shrubs . Its trees serve as its foundation . The wide variety of plant life has lured dozens of cottontail rabbits to the Garden and the surrounding park . The garden uses no synthetic pesticides . 
 60 @,@ 000 and 42 @,@ 000 bulbs were <unk> in 2006 and 2008 , respectively . In 2009 , 20 @,@ 000 additional bulbs were planted , bringing the total to 120 @,@ 000 and extending the flowering season earlier . The garden includes 35 @,@ 000 perennials in 240 varieties and 5 @,@ 200 " woody " plants in 14 varieties . 
 The dark plate 's perennials include ferns , <unk> and other broad @-@ leaved species , with a scattering of trees sprouting out of the flower beds . These plants thrive with shade from trees . The lush plants of this plate were selected by Oudolf as a tribute to Chicago 's marshy beginnings . It is described as a thick wetland whose designers have described as " wild , naughty and hidden . " 
 The light plate is dominated by prairie plants : grasses , <unk> , prairie @-@ smoke and no trees . These plants thrive in direct sunlight . This plate unites lighter native plants with imported specimens . It is described as a fine @-@ textured upland whose designers have described as " clean , noble and prominent " . 
 At the time of the 2004 opening of the Garden , the perennials were expected to need a year or two to mature and the hedges were expected to need another five to ten years to fill out . Another Tribune critic , Beth Botts , noted that the historical symbolism of the plantings is a future pleasure to be anticipated . However , she noted that it would be many years before the rosebud trees to the east could provide a pleasant shade . By the July / August 2010 issue of Garden Design , the garden was described as a garden in maturity worth revisiting . 
 Several animal species have been sighted in the garden . 27 species of birds have been identified in the park and its garden . Butterflies and bees have are among the wildlife that visit the garden .

In its first few years , it has had over two dozen adult programs attended by 1 @,@ 800 people each year and over three dozen family programs attended by 5 @,@ 000 people per year . The garden participated in an " Ask Me " program in 2009 , during which 12 volunteers logged 192 hours answering questions from 1 @,@ 094 guests from 35 states and 20 countries as well as a series of 2009 Sunday Garden Tours in which 24 people volunteered 391 hours to guide 2 @,@ 027 guests from 45 states and 26 countries through the garden .

 Chicago Tribune Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning architecture critic Blair Kamin , rated the garden as three stars , but projected it to be a four star venue once mature . He praised the light plate especially for its vibrant composition and undulating garden as a fitting contrast to the historic Chicago skyline . He also praised the symbolism of the seam for its uniqueness . He considers the garden a testament to the value of urban planning of public spaces . Botts noted that the reward of a design awaiting maturity is in enjoying the maturation .

 = Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps = 
 Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps ( also known as Wall Street 2 or Wall Street 2 : Money Never Sleeps ) is a 2010 American drama film directed by Oliver Stone , a sequel to Wall Street ( 1987 ) . It stars Michael Douglas , Shia LaBeouf , Josh Brolin , Carey Mulligan , Frank Langella , Susan Sarandon and , in his final film role before his death in 2014 , Eli Wallach . 
 The film takes place in New York , 23 years after the original , and revolves around the 2008 financial crisis . Its plot centers on a reformed Gordon Gekko , played by Douglas , acting as an antihero rather than a villain , and follows his attempts to repair his relationship with his daughter Winnie ( Mulligan ) , with the help of her fiancé , Jacob ( LaBeouf ) . 
 Principal photography took place in New York between September and November 2009 . After having its release date moved twice , Money Never Sleeps was released theatrically worldwide on September 24 , 2010 , by 20th Century Fox . Prior to its official release , many journalists connected to the financial industry were reportedly shown advance screenings of the film . 
 Despite opening to positive reception at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival , Money Never Sleeps received polarized reviews from critics , who generally praised the acting , but considered it an unnecessary sequel . Though failing to meet its critical expectations , the film was successful at the box office , topping the United States 's ranking during its opening weekend , and earning a worldwide total of $ 134 million in ticket sales , and more than $ 15 million on DVD . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 2001 , Gordon Gekko ( Michael Douglas ) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud . Seven years later , Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good ? , warning about the coming economic downturn . His estranged daughter , Winnie ( Carey Mulligan ) , runs a small , non @-@ profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore ( Shia LaBeouf ) , a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments ( <unk> ) . Jacob is a protégé of managing director Louis Zabel ( Frank Langella ) , and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world . Jake is also financially assisting his mother ( Susan Sarandon ) , who has begun a new career selling real estate . 
 When the recession of 2008 hits , Keller Zabel 's stock loses more than 50 % of its value . Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for <unk> from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James ( Josh Brolin ) , head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz , which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier . Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train because he cannot handle the stress and embarrassment of losing his company . 
 A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie , who accepts , then attends a lecture given by Gordon Gekko and introduces himself afterward . Gekko tells him that Keller Zabel 's collapse started when rumors of the company having toxic debt started to spread . Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade : Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie 's and Gekko 's relationship , and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton 's career to seek revenge for Zabel 's suicide . 
 Jake , aided by Gekko , learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse . In revenge , Jake spreads rumors about the nationalization of an Equatorial Guinea oil field owned by Churchill Schwartz . The company loses $ 120 million , but Bretton offers Jake a job , impressed by his initiative . In his new position , Jake convinces Chinese investors to fund the fusion research by Dr. Masters ( Austin Pendleton ) he has been supporting . Bretton is impressed even more . 
 Jake attends a fundraiser with Winnie and pays for a seat at a table for Gekko priced at $ 10 @,@ 000 . Gekko confronts Bretton about what he did to him and also to Zabel . Bretton mocks him that no one cares what Gekko knows or thinks anymore . Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox ( Charlie Sheen ) , and they discuss their shared experience going to jail . Gekko then follows Winnie outside , where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong , particularly her brother Rudy 's suicide . Gekko claims he paid for the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy , who died from an overdose . Winnie forgives him somewhat . 
 As the economy starts to crumble , Bretton and business mentor Julius Steinhardt ( Eli Wallach ) advise federal regulators what drastic actions must be taken . Jake 's mother continues to come to him for large sums of money . Winnie then announces to Jake she is pregnant with a boy . After riding motorcycles together , Bretton reveals to Jake that the Chinese investment is going into solar panels and fossil fuels instead of fusion research , leaving Jake furious and feeling betrayed . 
 Gekko proposes a solution , using a $ 100 million trust fund account in Switzerland , which Gekko set up for Winnie in the 1980s , to fund the research and save the company . She signs the money over to Jake , who then entrusts it to Gekko to legitimize the funds for investment in the fusion research company . However , the money never arrives , and Gekko betrays his daughter and Jake by leaving the country with Winnie 's $ 100 million . Jake realizes that Gekko has been using him to get the money in the account for his own gain . Winnie then tells Jake to leave , no longer trusting him . 
 Gekko is now in London , running a hugely successful <unk> @-@ like financial company , capitalized by the $ 100 million . Jake travels there to propose one last trade : Winnie gets her money back , and Gekko can participate in his grandson 's life . Gekko , however , refuses . 
 Jake pieces together everything from Keller Zabel 's collapse to the economic bailout of Bretton 's company and gives the information to Winnie , telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility . Winnie runs the story , and Bretton James is exposed . The investors , including Steinhardt , promptly abandon Bretton and go to Gekko on the back of his $ 1 @.@ 1 billion return as Bretton finds himself under intense legal scrutiny by the government . 
 Jake has successfully reunited with Winnie in New York , when late one night Gekko appears and tells them that he deposited $ 100 million into the fusion research 's account anonymously . He apologizes to them . One year later , Gekko is seen at his grandson Louis 's first birthday party , along with Jacob 's mother and Jacob and Winnie 's friends .

 Michael Douglas reprises his role as Gordon Gekko , which won him an Academy Award after the original film . Gekko has recently been released from prison and , after a failed attempt to warn business leaders of the imminent economic downturn , he decides to try to rebuild a relationship with his estranged daughter Winnie . 
 Shia LaBeouf portrays Jacob " Jake " Moore , an ambitious , young proprietary trader who works for Keller Zabel Investments , and is in a relationship with Winnie . LaBeouf 's role in the film has been said to be a role similar to that of Charlie Sheen 's in the original . The young actor said he was able to relate to his character 's background and found similarities in their motivations . Initially the actor was intimidated by the idea of working on a film that was going to stretch his dramatic abilities and came to the film set with a different approach , which was that if he disappointed his fans twice , his career was finished after making two recently panned sequels . 
 LaBeouf stated that , during his first meeting with Stone , the director was " really expedient about killing any ego or conceit on my part " , saying not to worry because Tom Cruise was not an actor when he first worked with him either , which LaBeouf considered a knife to his heart . LaBeouf said that he did not know what a credit derivative is or what a CP , LP , or <unk> were , commenting " You gotta know ticker names . " He also said that he has " no concept " of the " ins and outs of the financial world " and , as part of getting into character , he chose to stay thin to be like hedge funders . To prepare for the film he traded with different firms , playing with up to $ 1 million and became so interested in trading that he began studying for the Series 7 Exam . 
 Josh Brolin plays Bretton James , head of the Churchill Schwartz investment bank , whom Jacob blames for the death of his mentor . Bretton has been described as being a villain . Bretton is presented as a " new style " version of Gekko in the film . Javier Bardem was in final talks to play the character ; in July 2009 it was confirmed that he had turned down the project in favor of a film adaptation of the book Eat , Pray , Love , with Julia Roberts . Brolin took the part and lost 30 pounds in a month to prepare physically for this part . The actor , acknowledging that every character had both good and bad in them , viewed Bretton as being on a " higher level , " adding that he liked the ambition his character had and that he was an opportunist . 
 Carey Mulligan was cast as Winnie Gekko , Gordon 's estranged daughter and Jacob 's fiancée . Winnie has not spoken to her father since his imprisonment ; she blames Gordon for the suicide of her drugged @-@ out brother , Rudy . The character has been said to be the " moral center of the story " and described as being liberal , and to some extent passive . Mulligan is British and had to speak with an American accent for her role . Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps was her first major studio film . When she first met Stone for the role she explained that she did not want her character to be a " token girlfriend ; " both agreed to work to make sure that would not happen . During the same encounter Stone learned that she had short hair , and he initially discussed having her wear a wig , but Mulligan said she did not feel like herself when wearing the hairpiece . Stone trusted her and made an exception . According to Mulligan , Stone cast her in the Wall Street sequel based on her performance in An Education ( 2009 ) . 
 Frank Langella was cast as Louis Zabel . His death " ultimately leads the characters to discover the shady practices " of James 's hedge fund . Susan Sarandon portrays Sylvia Moore , Jacob 's real @-@ estate agent mother who is just as consumed by greed as Gekko is , but in a different sense . Audrey , a " tough , intelligent trader in the Wall Street trenches " , is portrayed by Vanessa Ferlito . John Buffalo Mailer plays Jacob 's Long Island financier friend , Robby and Eli Wallach plays the part of Jules Steinhardt , a Churchill Schwartz top executive and Wall Street patriarch who considers the current economic climate to be like the 1929 stock market crash . Pressman deemed the actor 's role as the " crier of doom , " who , " reveals just how much more devastating things can be today . " Charlie Sheen reprised his role of Bud Fox , Gekko 's former protégé , whom he meets briefly at a cocktail party . Sylvia Miles reprised her role as a real estate agent from the first film . 
 Television personality Natalie Morales , Vanity Fair magazine editor Graydon Carter , economist Nouriel Roubini , financier Warren Buffett and director Stone 's mother have minor roles in the film . Jim Cramer also makes a brief appearance after Stone cast him because he was a former hedge fund manager . Stone , who had a cameo in the first film , plays a similarly brief role in Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps . He wanted to give the young LaBeouf " some older connections " that would " give it weight " in the movie . Donald Trump and Julianne Michelle played minor parts , but Trump 's scene was cut from the final version ( it is instead available on the DVD ) . Stone said the scene was too " distracting " for the ending . Program host Neil Cavuto appears in the sequel for several seconds . A longer scene that involved him was cut ; a representative for Stone clarified that his decision was an aesthetic , not political , choice . Roger Hendricks Simon , a director @-@ actor , landed a part acting as a thinly veiled version of former AIG CEO Hank Greenberg . Like Trump 's part , his scenes were not included but are in the film 's DVD version .

 = = = Development = = = 
 In early 2007 , The New York Times reported that a sequel to Wall Street , then tentatively titled Money Never Sleeps , had entered pre @-@ production and was in the early stages of development with a screenplay by Stephen Schiff of The New Yorker . Shortly after the film was confirmed , Douglas was reported to be interested in reprising his role as Gordon Gekko , depending on the script . In October 2008 , 20th Century Fox announced that it had officially green @-@ lit the film and would serve as a distributor . In the same month it was announced that Allan Loeb had been approached to write a script that was being referred to as a " page one rewrite " , meaning that he would be starting " from scratch " . Shortly after the film had entered pre @-@ production it was announced that both Charlie Sheen and Daryl Hannah would not be involved with the sequel for unknown reasons . Despite stating that Sheen was not going to return , Stone confirmed he would briefly reprise his role as Bud , which would be worked into the script . 
 Around May 2007 , The New York Times reported that Stone had turned down the opportunity to direct the film , even after months of being pressured to do so by Douglas , among others . However , in April 2009 Fox confirmed that Stone would be returning as both director and producer , alongside Douglas and Edward R. Pressman . Stone stated that he reconsidered passing on directing the film after the stock market crash . The film was co @-@ produced by Eric <unk> with Alessandro <unk> and Celia D. Costas serving as executive producers . In addition to screenwriter Loeb , the film 's overall writer is Schiff . Bryan Burrough received credit as a consultant , and may have done uncredited work on the story . 
 At the time of the film 's announcement the plot details were kept under wraps , but Loeb later confirmed that its plot would primarily focus on Gekko , recently released from prison and re @-@ entering a much more " chaotic " financial world than the one he once oversaw from the previous film . Its budget was reported to be between $ 60 million ( $ 50 million with the tax credits ) and $ 70 million . Money Never Sleeps was being used as the film 's working title before being renamed Wall Street 2 at the director 's request and finally changed to Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps . As part of research for the film , Douglas and Stone had a dinner meeting with Samuel D. <unk> , the founder of the bio @-@ pharmaceutical company <unk> Systems , who spent five years in federal prison for securities fraud . LaBeouf , along with Stone , discussed the financial collapse with multiple hedge fund managers . 
 Early in mid @-@ 2009 , Stone took LaBeouf to a cocktail party organized by Nouriel Roubini , a New York University economics professor and chairman of a consulting firm . There , Stone and LaBeouf discussed the financial collapse with Roubini and also discussed hedge fund managers who are clients of Roubini 's firm . Roubini said that " in this financial crisis it was the traditional banks and the investment banks that had a larger role in doing stupid and silly things than the hedge funds . " Stone also stated that he had conversations with Jim <unk> , a prominent hedge fund manager who had urged him to focus less on hedge funds and more on the banking system , <unk> said , " there was a much more important story , a bigger story , in what happened with the system . " 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 In October 2008 , 20th Century Fox confirmed that Allan Loeb , who is a licensed stock broker , had been selected to re @-@ write the script . Stanley Weiser had worked on a treatment for a sequel set in the present with Gekko being released from jail ; the second part would be set in China . The studio felt that the material was dated , and put the project in turnaround . Stone had a falling out with Pressman , the producer , and began work on W. with Weiser . Weiser 's treatment for Wall Street Two was discarded and the film began taking shape from an original script by Stephen Schiff . It was reported that Aaron Sorkin had turned down the opportunity to work on the film 's script . 
 During December 2008 , while still in the process of drafting , Loeb said that he had been riveted by the Bernie Madoff headlines and showed interest in referencing him in the film , noting : " the thing that is so crazy about this story is that Ponzi schemes seem to be the simplest low @-@ class scam , " and " but this was carried out in the highest echelon of high finance . You couldn 't even get in to see this guy unless you had $ 2 million to invest . " Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film , commenting that he considered Madoff 's actions to be " a crook running a Ponzi scheme " which is " legal robbery . " The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script , feeling Loeb 's draft was " so great " that he did not feel the need to touch it , although he did have the option . 
 Sometime in early June , Loeb reportedly handed in his second draft of the film to Fox , and in July , was finalizing the screenplay . Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps is based in four locations ; New York , London , the United Arab Emirates , and an Asian country . One of the character consultants to the new film will be billionaire Vincent Tchenguiz . Pressman said that Tchenguiz had modeled Gekko but did admit that Gekko was " partly Milken " and that Gekko will be a more outwardly altruistic figure but , admits , " a leopard doesn 't change its spots , despite appearances . " Pressman said of the origin of the film 's subtitle : " Wall Street was New York @-@ centric . Today the markets are much more global , hence the title of the new film , Money Never Sleeps . " He described Gekko 's involvement in the film as being " larger than life " . 
 It was reported that Loeb had taken advice from a " number of real Wall Street movers and shakers " to ensure " horrifying accuracy " for the film 's script . Of the re @-@ writes done to script , Stone said : " We sort of started over with the story of a young man who is at the center of it , and how he needs Gordon Gekko 's help to navigate those waters . " In a reference to the GEICO Gecko commercial , which was suggested by New York Governor David Paterson , Gekko says " even a caveman could do it " in the movie . At the request of Mulligan and LaBeouf , the filmmaker cut some dialogue from the character 's break @-@ up scenes , which he at first was initially hesitant to do . 
 Stone said that the film will provide more of a social commentary and admitted that he had never expected high finance to " serve again as a tableau for his storytelling " . He also added that its plot will showcase the unemployment rate at an all @-@ time high and the " our national debt ever climbing . " Discussing the difference between Wall Street and its sequel , the director explained , " In the other movie , Charlie Sheen is corrupt at the beginning and he finds a path to integrity . In this movie , it starts out the other way . Shia and Carey are idealists . And their idealism is being threatened . " A writer for USA Today believed that the film 's story line " attempts to put the complicated financial schemes that led to the worldwide economic collapse on a human scale . "

 A shift in location in the sequel reflected some of the changes in the world since then : while the New York Stock Exchange and its trading floor had featured heavily in the first film , they are less prominent in the second . Instead , more time is spent at the Federal Reserve Building , reflecting its new position as a " bulwark of the system " according to Stone . The location provided a link to the contemporary crisis the film examines , since September 2008 it has been an important site for meeting on the crisis . 
 Although August 10 was reportedly the start date , principal photography began on September 9 . The filmmaker continued to make additions to the script and meet with financial consultants about the project whilst filming . Mulligan was able to film all of her scenes in 15 days . Stone said that they were on schedule and on budget , but claimed that the constantly changing weather was a problem for filming . He also said that the filming on location process was similar to the first film . While filming , LaBeouf said that Douglas was an " opened wound on the set " due to his oldest son 's arrest in July for drug trafficking , adding that Stone filmed a " struggling " Douglas . 
 Charlie Sheen was able to shoot his scene in one day and described being on set with the director and Douglas as strange , with Stone adding that it was difficult for the actor . Sheen reportedly had trouble remembering his lines and required some prodding to remember his cue during the party scene in which Gekko encounters Fox . Although eager to meet him , LaBeouf did not interact with Sheen on set per request . Regarding working with the director , who has a reputation for being demanding on his cast , Douglas described him as being mellow , but acknowledged that " it 's still always a workout with him . " " Everyone was very friendly , but the scene work felt dangerous , " LaBeouf recalls of the on @-@ set atmosphere . " These guys aren 't going to coddle you . Douglas was the one who comforted me . And I 've never gone deeper with a director than Oliver . He 's the Easter bunny and Orson Welles in one man . " The young actor further discussed Stone 's work ethic on @-@ set with him , saying : 
 We 'd be on the street [ filming ] , and Oliver would just say , " Go to that bar , get fucked @-@ up , and come back . " I 'd walk over , get smashed , and go back to work . He would really fuck with me when I was smashed . I get aggressive when I 'm smashed , and he 'd film that . He would just open you up completely , make you fucking naked – and then call , " Action ! " 
 Douglas filmed the opening scene , which is Gekko being released from Sing Sing maximum @-@ security prison , in Ossining , Westchester County , on September 18 . Stone felt that the prison scene was a " key plot element " because there is no one there to meet Gekko , who returns to society as an outsider . Regarding there being no scenes that show Gekko adjusting to the modern world , the director clarified that there is " very little space to do those kind of tricks in this movie " because of how modern the world is becoming on a monthly basis . Filming took place in Fordham University for the classroom scenes on October 10 and 11 . In order to shoot a dining scene between LaBeouf and Douglas , Shun Lee West closed for 24 hours so the two could film scenes at the restaurant for the entire day of November 10 . Brolin and Stone found extras simply by asking workers , at places like <unk> , if they would like to be a part of the sequel .
