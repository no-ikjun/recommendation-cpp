 Hydroxyl megamasers occur in the nuclear regions of LIRGs , and appear to be a marker in the stage of the formation of galaxies . As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG , hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place . At redshifts of z ~ 2 , there are LIRG @-@ like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe . The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers . Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift , and aid understanding of star formation in these objects . 
 The first detection of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers . The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a spectral line due to the presence of a magnetic field , and the size of the splitting is linearly proportional to the line @-@ of @-@ sight magnetic field strength . Zeeman splitting has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers , and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few <unk> , similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers . 
 = = Water megamasers = = 
 Whereas hydroxyl megamasers seem to be fundamentally distinct in some ways from galactic hydroxyl masers , water megamasers do not seem to require conditions too dissimilar from galactic water masers . Water masers stronger than galactic water masers , some of which are strong enough to be classified " mega " masers , may be described by the same luminosity function as galactic water masers . Some extragalactic water masers occur in star forming regions , like galactic water masers , while stronger water masers are found in the <unk> regions around active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) . The isotropic luminosities of these span a range of order one to a few hundred L ☉ , and are found in nearby galaxies like Messier 51 ( 0 @.@ 8 L ☉ ) and more distant galaxies like NGC 4258 ( 120 L ☉ ) . 
 = = = Line characteristics and pumping mechanism = = = 
 Water maser emission is observed primarily at 22 GHz , due to a transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule . The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 Kelvin about the ground state , and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm − 3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 Kelvin . The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm − 3 , so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region . Water masers emission has been successfully modeling by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in the interstellar medium . These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures ( relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium ) required for maser emission , and are successful in explaining observed masers . 
 = = = Applications = = = 
 Water megamasers may be used to provide accurate distance determinations to distant galaxies . Assuming a Keplerian orbit , measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots . By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky , the distance to the maser may be determined . This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN , and have narrow linewidths . This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles . The method is limited , however , by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow . This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object , which in this case is a supermassive black hole . Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way . The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M @-@ sigma relation , an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole . 
 = Earnings management = 
 Earnings management , in accounting , is the act of intentionally influencing the process of financial reporting to obtain some private gain . Earnings management involves the alteration of financial reports to mislead stakeholders about the organization 's underlying performance , or to " influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting numbers . " 
 Earnings management has a negative effect on earnings quality , and may weaken the credibility of financial reporting . Furthermore , in a 1998 speech Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt called earnings management " widespread " . Despite its pervasiveness , the complexity of accounting rules can make earnings management difficult for individual investors to detect . 
 = = Occurrence and response by regulators = = 
 Earnings management is believed to be widespread . A 1990 report on earnings management situations stated that " short @-@ term earnings are being managed in many , if not all companies " , and in a 1998 speech , Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) chairman Arthur Levitt called earnings management a " widespread , but too little @-@ challenged custom " . In a 2013 essay , Ray Ball , while opining that accounting research was not reliably documenting earnings management , wrote : " Of course earnings management goes on . [ ... ] People have been tried and convicted . " 
 The SEC has criticized earnings management as having adverse consequences for financial reporting , and for masking " the true consequences of management 's decisions " . It has called on standard @-@ setters to make changes to accounting standards to improve financial statement transparency , and has called for increased oversight over the financial reporting process . The SEC has also pressed charges against the management of firms involved in fraudulent earnings management . 
 = = Motivations and methods = = 
 Earnings management involves the manipulation of company earnings towards a pre @-@ determined target . This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings , in which case management is said to be carrying out income smoothing . Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm 's market value . Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants , and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets . 
 Earnings management may involve exploiting opportunities to make accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements . Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting . For example , a comparatively small change in the estimates for <unk> accounts can have a significant effect on net income , and a company using last @-@ in , first @-@ out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods . 
 = = Detecting earnings management = = 
 Earnings management may be difficult for individual investors to detect due to the complexity of accounting rules , although accounting researchers have proposed several methods . For example , research has shown that firms with large <unk> and weak governance structures are more likely to be engaging in earnings management . More recent research suggested that linguistics @-@ based methods can detect financial manipulation , for example studies in 2012 found that whether a subsequent irregularity or deceptive restatement occurred is related to the linguistics used by top management in earnings conference calls . 
 = Adenanthos cuneatus = 
 Adenanthos cuneatus , also known as coastal jugflower , flame bush , bridle bush and sweat bush , is a shrub of the family Proteaceae native to the south coast of Western Australia . The French naturalist Jacques Labillardière originally described it in 1805 . Within the genus Adenanthos , it lies in the section Adenanthos and is most closely related to A. stictus . A. cuneatus has hybridized with four other species of Adenanthos . Growing to 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) high and wide , it is erect to prostrate in habit , with wedge @-@ shaped lobed leaves covered in fine silvery hair . The single red flowers are insignificant , and appear all year , though especially in late spring . The reddish new growth occurs over the summer . 
 It is sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback , hence requiring a sandy soil and good drainage to grow in cultivation , its natural habitat of sandy soils in heathland being an example . Its pollinators include bees , honey possum , silvereye and honeyeaters , particularly the western spinebill . A. cuneatus is grown in gardens in Australia and the western United States , and a dwarf and prostrate form are commercially available . 
 = = Description = = 
 Adenanthos cuneatus grows as an erect , spreading or prostrate shrub to 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) high and wide . It has a woody base , known as a lignotuber , from which it can resprout after bushfire . The wedge @-@ shaped ( cuneate ) leaves are on short petioles , and are 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) long and 1 – 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 6 in ) wide , with 3 to 5 ( and occasionally up to 7 ) rounded ' teeth ' or lobes at the ends . New growth is red and slightly translucent . It glows bright red against the light , especially when the sun is low in the sky . New growth is mainly seen in summer , and the leaves in general are covered with fine , silvery hair . Occurring throughout the year but more often from August to November , the insignificant single flowers are a dull red in colour and measure around 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) long . The pollen is triangular in shape and measures 31 – 44 µm ( 0 @.@ 0012 – 0 @.@ <unk> in ) in length , averaging around 34 µm ( 0 @.@ 0013 in ) . 
 The species is similar in many ways to its close relative A. stictus . The most obvious difference is in habit : the multi @-@ stemmed , lignotuberous A. cuneatus rarely grows over 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) in height , whereas A. stictus is a taller single @-@ stemmed non @-@ lignotuberous shrub that commonly reaches 5 m ( 16 ft 5 in ) in height . Leaves are similar , but the lobes at the leaf apex are regular and crenate ( rounded ) in A. cuneatus , but irregular and dentate ( toothed ) in A. stictus . Also , new growth does not have a red flush in A. stictus , and juvenile leaves of A. stictus are usually much larger than adult leaves , a difference not seen in A. cuneatus . The flowers of the two species are very similar , differing only subtly in dimension , colour and indumentum .

 = = = Discovery and naming = = = 
 Although the precise time and location of its discovery are unknown , Jacques Labillardière , botanist to an expedition under Bruni d 'Entrecasteaux , which anchored in Esperance Bay on the south coast of Western Australia on 9 December 1792 , most likely collected the first known botanical specimen of Adenanthos cuneatus on 16 December while searching the area between Observatory Point and Pink Lake for the zoologist Claude Riche , who had gone ashore two days earlier and failed to return . Following an unsuccessful search the following day , several senior members of the expedition were convinced that Riche must have perished of thirst or at the hands of the Australian Aborigines and counselled d 'Entrecasteaux to sail without him . However , Labillardière convinced d 'Entrecasteaux to search for another day , and was rewarded not only with the recovery of Riche , but also with the collection of several highly significant botanical specimens , including the first specimens of <unk> ( Kangaroo Paw ) and Nuytsia floribunda ( West Australian Christmas Tree ) and , as aforementioned , A. cuneatus . 
 Thirteen years passed before Labillardière published a formal description of A. cuneatus , and in the meantime several further collections were made : Scottish botanist Robert Brown collected a specimen on 30 December 1801 , during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound ; and , fourteen months later , Jean @-@ Baptiste Leschenault de La Tour , botanist to Nicolas Baudin 's voyage of exploration , and " gardener 's boy " Antoine <unk> collected more specimens therein . The official account of Baudin 's expedition contain notes from Leschenault on vegetation : 
 " Sur les <unk> de la mer , croissent , en grande abondance , l 'adenanthos cuneata , l 'adenanthos sericea au <unk> velouté , et une espèce du même genre dont les <unk> sont <unk> . " 
 ( " On the seashore , grows , in great abundance , Adenanthos cuneata , the softer @-@ leaved Adenanthos sericea , and a species of the same genus with rounded leaves . " ) 
 Labillardière eventually published the genus Adenanthos , along with A. cuneatus and two other species , in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen . He chose the specific name cuneata in reference to the leaves of this species , which are cuneate ( triangular ) . This name has feminine gender , consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus . He did not designate which of the three published species was to serve as the type species of Adenanthos , but Irish botanist E. Charles Nelson has since chosen A. cuneatus as lectotype for the genus , since the holotype of A. cuneatus bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name , and because Labillardière 's description of it is the most detailed of the three , and is referred to by the other descriptions . 
 = = = Synonymy = = = 
 In 1809 , Richard Salisbury , writing under Joseph Knight 's name in the controversial On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae , published the name <unk> [ sic ] flabellifolia , listing A. cuneata as a synonym . As no type specimen was given , and no specimen annotated by Knight could be found , this was treated as a nomenclatural synonym of A. cuneata and was therefore rejected on the principle of priority . 
 Also synonymised with this species is Adenanthos crenata , published by Carl Ludwig Willdenow 's in Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel 's 1825 16th edition of Systema Vegetabilium . Willdenow published both A. cuneata and A. crenata , giving them different descriptions but designating the same type specimen for both . Thus A. crenata was rejected under the principle of priority , and is now regarded as a nomenclatural synonym of A. cuneatus . 
 = = = Infrageneric placement = = = 
 In 1870 , George Bentham published the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark " Flora Australiensis " . He divided the genus into two sections , placing A. cuneata in A. sect . <unk> because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle . This arrangement still stands today , though A. sect . <unk> is now renamed to the autonym A. sect . Adenanthos . 
 A phenetic analysis of the genus undertaken by Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which A. cuneatus was grouped with A. stictus . This pairing was then neighbour to a larger group that included A. forrestii , A. <unk> , A. <unk> , A. <unk> , and several hybrid and unusual forms of A. cuneatus . Nelson 's analysis supported Bentham 's sections , and so they were retained when Nelson published a taxonomic revision of the genus in 1978 . He further subdivided A. sect . Adenanthos into two subsections , with A. cuneata placed into A. subsect . Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth , but Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos , for the Flora of Australia series of monographs . By this time , the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in <unk> must be treated as having masculine gender ; thus the specific epithet became cuneatus . 
 The placement of A. cuneatus in Nelson 's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows : 
 Adenanthos 
 A. sect . Eurylaema ( 4 species ) 
 A. sect . Adenanthos 
 A. drummondii 
 A. <unk> 
 A. apiculatus 
 A. linearis 
 A. pungens ( 2 subspecies )

 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 Adenanthos cuneatus apparently forms hybrids with other Adenanthos species quite readily , as four putative natural hybrids have been reported : 
 A. × cunninghamii ( Albany <unk> ) , a hybrid between A. cuneatus and A. sericeus , was first collected in 1827 , and published as A. cunninghamii in 1845 . Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s , no further sightings are known to have been made until 1973 , when Nelson rediscovered it . At the time it was regarded as a distinct species , but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid , and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002 . In appearance it is very similar to A. sericeus , but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical . 
 A single plant discovered by Nelson near Israelite Bay , where both putative parents are found , is regarded as a hybrid between A. cuneatus and A. dobsonii . Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A. cuneatus , but whereas A. cuneatus leaves are mostly five @-@ lobed , the putative hybrid usually has three lobes , with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A. dobsonii ( though A. <unk> itself occasionally bears entire leaves ) . Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A. cuneatus , being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A. dobsonii . Flower colour is like that of A. cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum , like A. dobsonii . 
 Two plants found near Twilight Cove are regarded as hybrids between A. cuneatus and A. forrestii , the only two Adenanthos species to occur in the area . One was discovered by Nelson in 1972 , the other by Alex George in 1974 . They are about 5 km apart , and differ somewhat . The leaves are triangular and flat like those of A. cuneatus , but the leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow , and the leaves of younger shoots are deeply lobed . 
 In his 1995 revision , Nelson refers to putative hybrids with A. dobsonii and A. apiculatus , citing the 1978 paper in which he published putative hybrids with A. dobsonii and A. forrestii . It is unclear whether the reference to A. apiculatus is an error or a fourth putative hybrid . 
 = = = Common names = = = 
 This species has several common names , some highly localised . Two names allude to its consumption by horses ; bridle bush , a name used east of Esperance , refers to the fact that horses favour it as fodder ; and sweat bush , used around Hopetoun , derived from the claim that horses break out in sweat after consuming young growth . The common name of flame bush derives from the brilliant red new growth . It is also known as coastal jugflower . Nelson also records the use of the names <unk> and native temp , but ridicules them as obvious errors . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The most widely distributed Adenanthos species of the south coast , A. cuneatus is common and locally abundant between King George Sound and Israelite Bay , along the coast and up to 40 km ( 25 mi ) inland , with isolated populations extending west to Walpole and the Stirling Range , and as far east of Israelite Bay as Twilight Cove . 
 This species is restricted to siliceous sandplain soils and will not grow in calcareous soils such as the limestone plains of the Nullarbor , or even siliceous dunes with limestone at little depth . This restriction explains the disjunctions east of Israelite Bay : the species occurs only in those few locations where the existence of cliff @-@ top dunes of deep siliceous sand provide suitable habitat . Provided the soil is siliceous and fairly dry , A. cuneatus tolerates a range of edaphic conditions : it grows in both lateritic sand and sands of marine origin , and it tolerates pH levels ranging from 3 @.@ 8 to 6 @.@ 6 . 
 Consistent with these edaphic preferences , A. cuneatus is a frequent and characteristic member of the kwongan heathlands commonly found on the sandplains of Southwest Australia . The climate in its range is mediterranean , with annual rainfall from 275 to 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 10 @.@ 8 to 39 @.@ 4 in ) . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Colletid bees of the genus Leioproctus visit Adenanthos cuneatus flowers . A 1978 field study conducted around Albany found the honey possum ( Tarsipes rostratus ) occasionally visited Adenanthos cuneatus , while the western spinebill much preferred the species to other flowers . A 1980 field study at Cheyne beach showed that the New Holland honeyeater and white @-@ cheeked honeyeater pollinate it A 1985 – 86 field study in the Fitzgerald River National Park found that the nectar @-@ feeding honey possum occasionally eats it . The silvereye ( Zosterops lateralis ) feeds on nectar from the flowers , and has also been observed taking dew @-@ drops from leaves early in the morning . 
 Adenanthos cuneatus is known to be susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback , but reports on the degree of susceptibility vary from low to high . A study of Banksia attenuata woodland 400 km ( 249 mi ) southeast of Perth across 16 years , and following a wave of P. cinnamomi infestation , showed that A. cuneatus populations were not significantly reduced in diseased areas . Phosphite ( used to combat dieback ) has some toxic effects in A. cuneatus , with some necrosis of leaf tips , but the shrub uptakes little of the compound when compared with other shrubs . Specimens in coastal dune vegetation showed some sensitivity to the fungus Armillaria luteobubalina , with between a quarter and a half of plants exposed succumbing to the pathogen . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Adenanthos cuneatus was taken to Great Britain in 1824 , and has been grown in cultivation in Australia and the western United States . Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature , along with its ability to attract birds to the garden . It requires a well @-@ drained position to do well , but will grow in full sun or semi @-@ shade , and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils . George Lullfitz , a Western Australian nurseryman , recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs , or in a rockery . 
 The following cultivars exist : 
 A. " Coral Drift " is a compact form in cultivation since at least the 1990s . It is 50 – 70 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 – 27 @.@ 6 in ) tall and 1 – 1 @.@ 5 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 9 ft ) wide . The grey foliage has pinkish purple new growth . 
 A. " Coral Carpet " is a prostrate form which peaks at around 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) high and spreads to 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) across . The new foliage is a pinkish purple . A chance seedling from ' Coral Drift ' , it was originally developed by George Lullfitz of Lullfitz Nursery in Wanneroo . It became available to the public in 2005 , and has been registered successfully under Plant Breeders ' Rights .

 Hatoful Boyfriend : A School of Hope and White Wings ( Japanese : はーとふる彼氏 〜 <unk> 〜 , Hepburn : Hātofuru <unk> ~ <unk> no <unk> to <unk> <unk> ~ ) is a Japanese dōjin soft otome visual novel released in 2011 for Microsoft Windows and OS X. It was developed by manga artist Hato Moa 's dōjin circle PigeoNation Inc . , and is the successor of a Flash game of the same name she created for April Fools ' Day in 2011 . A free demo version of Hatoful made with the FamousWriter engine was released later that year , followed by a full commercial version released on 30 October 2011 at <unk> 98 , and an English version released in February 2012 . An international remake by developer Mediatonic and publisher Devolver Digital , dubbed Hatoful Boyfriend HD in Japan , was released on 4 September 2014 for Microsoft Windows , OS X , and Linux and for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on 21 July 2015 in North America , and on 22 July 2015 in Europe , respectively . A port for iOS was released on 25 May 2016 . 
 Hatoful Boyfriend received generally positive reception ; reviewers praised the game 's replay value as well as its writing and characterization , while repetitive gameplay and the accessibility of the game 's Bad Boys Love mode received a more mixed response . A sequel , Hatoful Boyfriend : Holiday Star , was released on 29 December 2011 , with an English version being released on Christmas Day the following year . In addition to the main games in the series , Hatoful Boyfriend has made transitions into other media : a monthly webcomic was serialized in the anthology Manga Life WIN + , several supplementary materials and official dōjin works have been released , and four drama CDs based on the series have been made . An episodic web series began in 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Hatoful Boyfriend is an interactive text @-@ based visual novel that follows a branching plot line , with the player 's decisions determining which of the game 's multiple endings they receive . The title is a pun on the <unk> @-@ <unk> word <unk> ( <unk> , " heartful " , also " hurtful " ) , and the Japanese word <unk> ( <unk> , " pigeon " , " dove " ) , as the game features pigeons and other birds as major characters . The game is set in a version of Earth populated by sapient , anthropomorphic birds , and its main story follows the player character and protagonist — the only human attending St. PigeoNation 's Institute , an elite school for birds — as she finds love among her avian acquaintances . 
 Bad Boys Love , a hidden alternate story mode , opens with the discovery of the protagonist 's corpse , after which the player follows her best friend Ryouta Kawara as he investigates the circumstances of her death and unravels darker conspiracies surrounding the school . 
 Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend is similar to most other visual novels for the PC , with the controls limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game 's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices . The keyboard can also be used instead of the mouse , with the ' enter ' key serving the same purpose as clicking . The save button can be employed at any point during the game , which also features several pages of save slots , allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made . An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced . 
 The player assumes control of the protagonist , a teenage human girl . As the game follows a branching plot line with multiple endings , at various points during gameplay the player is allowed to make choices that determine which character 's romance route the player will encounter . On weekdays , the player can also choose which classes to attend , which changes one of the protagonist 's three stats depending on the activity chosen . Having certain stat values are required to obtain the good endings for each love interest and to otherwise advance along certain routes . There are thirteen ( fourteen in the 2014 remake ) endings in total : one ending for each of the main love interests , three extended endings for three of the love interests based on stat values , one ending for the gaiden @-@ esque Torimi Café storyline , and one ending attained if the player fails to romance any character . 
 When routes are completed , documents are unlocked that provide insights into the game 's overarching storyline . These documents can be viewed at any time in the game 's archive feature , which is accessed from the title screen . After obtaining the four specific endings required to trigger it , the player is given a new prompt to either " fulfill the promise " or live " a normal life " upon starting a new game . Choosing to live a normal life will result in a normal playthrough , while choosing to fulfill the promise locks the player into the true route or scenario Bad Boys Love , or BBL ( also known as Hurtful Boyfriend ) , which explores the full extent of the underlying plot alluded to by the documents and various points of foreshadowing in the dating simulation portion of the game . If the player chooses to fulfill the promise , aside from several dream sequences , gameplay at first appears to continue normally until the in @-@ game date is 2 September . The player 's perspective then switches from the protagonist to the protagonist 's best friend , and the events of the scenario begin regardless of any other choices made by the player up to that point . If the player obtains all other possible endings prior to starting Bad Boys Love , an extended epilogue plays after the game 's credits upon completion of the scenario . In a departure from the generally lighthearted romantic routes , Bad Boys Love is presented as a murder mystery psychological thriller , and is significantly longer than any other route in Hatoful Boyfriend , making up most of the game 's actual length . 
 There are several changes to gameplay and the way text is displayed during Bad Boys Love in the original version of the game : saving is disabled except at certain points in the story , the function to skip dialogue and interactions is removed , and plot @-@ important dialogue and narrative are highlighted with colored text ; usually yellow , though text of particularly critical importance is highlighted in red . In the 2014 remake however , the option to save is available at all times , the skip function is retained , and text is no longer highlighted . In both versions , the game 's interface and controls change from that of a standard visual novel to similar to that of a ' 90s @-@ era turn @-@ based role @-@ playing game during certain segments of the narrative .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Hatoful Boyfriend is set in an alternate version of Earth in which sapient , anthropomorphic birds have seemingly taken the place of humans in society for reasons that are hinted at , but not fully explained in the dating simulation portion of the game . In Bad Boys Love , it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post @-@ apocalyptic , dystopian future — in which a pandemic of a deadly , mutated strain of the H5N1 virus , or bird flu , nearly wipes out mankind in the year 2068 . The release of a counter @-@ virus , cultivated to destroy the virus ' avian carriers in a desperate attempt to stop the spread of the disease , ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter @-@ virus instead developed human @-@ level intelligence . War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity , resulting in birds emerging as the planet 's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb to the disease . Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency , all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid @-@ like segregation . 
 The game 's story takes place primarily at St. PigeoNation 's Institute ( <unk> , Sei Pijoneishon Gakuen ) — a bird @-@ only high school located in the fictional Japanese town of <unk> Hachiman City ( <unk> , <unk> Hachiman @-@ shi ) — long after open warfare between humans and birds has ended . Society has adjusted to the avian conquest , though with minor bird @-@ related cultural changes — for example , while some holidays such as Christmas and Tanabata are celebrated much as they are in the present day , a major event in the game is <unk> 's Day , an amalgamation of the traditions of Valentine 's Day and <unk> . In a more grim case , the terms war dove and war hawk have been re @-@ purposed as labels for two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority : the altruistic Dove Party , who advocate for cooperation and peace between the two groups , and the militant Hawk Party , whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether . By the time Hatoful Boyfriend 's narrative begins , the Dove Party , the Hawk Party , and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world 's politics . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The primary playable character in Hatoful Boyfriend is the human protagonist , a boisterous hunter @-@ gatherer who lives in a cave in the wilderness . Her eight potential love interests in the original version of the game , who together form the rest of the main cast , are Ryouta Kawara , a rock dove and the protagonist 's sickly but hardworking childhood friend ; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane , a fantail pigeon and snobbish French aristocrat ; Sakuya 's older half @-@ brother Yuuya Sakazaki , a popular and flirtatious but strangely secretive fantail pigeon ; Nageki Fujishiro , a quiet , bookish mourning dove who never seems to leave the library ; San <unk> , an athletic , hyperactive fantail pigeon who is obsessed with pudding ; Anghel <unk> , an eccentric Luzon bleeding @-@ heart who behaves as if he were in some kind of fantasy role @-@ playing game ; Kazuaki Nanaki , a kind but narcoleptic button quail and the protagonist 's homeroom teacher ; and Shuu <unk> , a creepy , antisocial chukar partridge who serves as the school 's doctor . Azami <unk> , a no @-@ nonsense Java sparrow and <unk> saleswoman , became a possible love interest in the 2014 remake . 
 While most of the characters are normally represented in @-@ game with pictures of birds , if the player toggles on the <unk> ( Intra @-@ Cerebral Playback Synchro System ) feature at the start of the game , or NS3 ( <unk> , <unk> Saisei Shinkuro Shisutemu ) in Japan , each of the possible love interests is shown with a version of what they would look like as a human when first introduced . Although the <unk> feature also lists voice credits for each of the main love interests in the original version of the game , the game itself is unvoiced ; however most of the voice actors who were credited later signed on to actually voice their respective characters in the drama CDs based on the series .

 The events of Hatoful Boyfriend begin in the year <unk> , when the protagonist , a teenage human girl invited to attend the prestigious bird @-@ only St. PigeoNation 's Institute , starts her second year of high school . After a hectic and surreal freshman year of attendance at St. PigeoNation 's , the protagonist has grown accustomed to the confusion of being the only human in a school full of birds , and is looking forward to her sophomore year . The story of the dating simulation portion of the game follows the protagonist , and the inter @-@ species love and hijinks — of both the mundane high school and quasi @-@ anthropomorphic bird @-@ specific varieties — that ensue as she draws the attention of and attempts to romance one of a number of eligible birds she comes in contact with over the course of the year . 
 = = = = Bad Boys Love = = = = 
 Should the player choose to fulfill the promise , the protagonist begins her sophomore year at St. PigeoNation 's largely as normal , but with one exception — she begins to have recurring dreams of her younger self and Ryouta , and her parents lying dead in front of an unfamiliar house . A mysterious man approaches them , promising to grant any wish that they make . On 2 September , she decides to check on Ryouta , who had gone to the infirmary earlier that day ; the next morning , she fails to show up for class . Kazuaki asks Ryouta to retrieve their class ' box of print handouts , and upon retrieving it , blood is discovered leaking from a corner of the box . Ryouta opens the lid , and it is revealed that the box contains the protagonist 's severed head . A siren sounds and there is an order to evacuate to the gymnasium , where Ryouta overhears other students mention that more pieces of a human corpse were found in the other print boxes . Doubting the headmaster 's explanation of a natural disaster occurring , Sakuya and Ryouta resolve to figure out the identity of the protagonist 's killer and leave the gymnasium , discovering a large metal dome surrounding the school . Upon returning to their classroom and finding the box empty , Yuuya explains that the protagonist 's body had been gathered in the chemistry lab , where Shuu performs an autopsy concluding that the protagonist died of asphyxiation caused by illness or poison with the dismemberment occurring afterwards . 
 Assisted by the school janitor Mister One , and pursued by a grotesque scarecrow @-@ like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds , Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder . They visit the lab and compare alibis ; Shuu , who Ryouta distrusts , asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important , to which he replies that he hasn 't . Upon investigating the headmaster 's office , they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death , what they saw earlier being merely pre @-@ recorded footage ; they also find a computer and a pair of documents , one titled The Human Representative and a torn , unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful . The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist , a symbol of humanity , were to die , the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices — something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee — when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported . 
 In trying to find a way to escape before the dome rises , Ryouta and Sakuya uncover records in the library mentioning a medical center that was shut down due to a fire , and that the ghostly Nageki , who Ryouta previously encountered , died in that fire . Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating , they find its basement blocked off . They also encounter Anghel , who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before , contradicting Yuuya and Shuu 's shared alibi . As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues , he finds medical records for himself , the protagonist , Nageki , and Sakuya , but is knocked out immediately after . When he regains consciousness , he discovers the protagonist 's bloody student ID — now with concrete evidence , Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya , only to find that Sakuya had left to do so alone . Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu 's attempts to kill him ; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center 's basement before escaping with Labor 9 . Yuuya apologizes , affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist , they were the ones who dismembered her , and asks to speak to Sakuya alone . He reveals that they are full @-@ blooded siblings , with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya 's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him . Yuuya dies , Shuu 's scalpel having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster , leaving Sakuya in a state of shock . 
 Ryouta , searching for a way into the medical center basement , seeks out Nageki in the library to ask him about his death . Upon discovering documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility — with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus — Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self @-@ immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus , which was isolated in his body , and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room . Ryouta , Kazuaki , and Anghel make their way into the medical center 's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9 , electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One . They confront Shuu , who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel , leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away . Meanwhile , San comforts Sakuya , and the two of them arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison . 
 Alone with Shuu , Ryouta finally remembers what he had forgotten due to the traumatic nature of the events : he recognizes the doctor as a man who promised to grant his wish for peace between birds and humans after he and the protagonist witnessed a human terrorist incident at a bird orphanage in which the protagonist 's parents , crisis negotiators , were killed , and that the protagonist died when she visited him in the infirmary . It is revealed that she died by Charon virus after coming in contact with Ryouta , as Shuu had induced the virus into Ryouta 's body though grafts from Nageki 's remains for the purpose of using him to exterminate humanity — since there can be no more fighting between two factions if one is wiped out , this would grant Ryouta 's wish . Shuu then remarks that Labor 9 was powered by the protagonist 's now irreversibly damaged brain . A broken Ryouta submits to Shuu 's offer of becoming a living weapon of mass destruction after these revelations , and a struggle ensues during which the protagonist 's spirit intervenes . Ryouta then asks Shuu why he decided to grant his wish , to which it is implied that Shuu 's affection towards Ryouta 's deceased father , <unk> , was greater than Shuu himself would like to admit , and that he was motivated by <unk> 's dying request : to do something for his son . 
 Shuu admits defeat and offers to lead them out of the school through a safe passage , but Kazuaki pulls out a gun and shoots him as the group prepares to escape . Shuu then recalls that Nageki 's only relative — his adoptive brother — was , like Kazuaki , a quail . The terrorist incident occurred at Kazuaki and Nageki 's orphanage and left them as the only survivors ; witnessing Nageki 's subsequent suicide drove Kazuaki insane , leading him to fake his own death , assume a new identity , and join the school 's faculty to take revenge against Shuu , the head of Operation Hatoful . Ryouta , channeling Nageki , eases Kazuaki 's guilt and convinces him to move on . 
 They reunite with the other characters and exit the school along with the other students and faculty brought there by Mister One ; however Ryouta , now thoroughly infected by the Charon virus , elects to stay behind in cryonic storage until a cure is found . The scenario ends with Sakuya vowing to come back for Ryouta , and Ryouta offering to recap the day 's events to the protagonist 's spirit as the door to the storage facility closes . If the extended epilogue is unlocked , it is revealed that Yuuya survived being poisoned long enough to receive an antidote , and the game 's closing lines imply that with Shuu 's cooperation , a cure for the Charon virus has been developed . 
 = = Development = = 
 Hatoful Boyfriend is the first game developed by manga artist and writer Hato Moa — author of the series Vairocana and a former Dengeki Comic Grand Prix honoree — under her dōjin circle PigeoNation Inc . As she had no experience with game development prior to Hatoful , Hato initially wanted to start with a visual novel , as she believed it was an easier game type for amateur developers to make ; the format also allowed visuals to easily accompany her stories , something that she , as a manga artist , was accustomed to and viewed as being necessary in her work . She first came up with the concept for Hatoful as a 2011 April Fools ' Day joke : despite her lack of familiarity with the genre , she initially intended to create a parody of otome game stereotypes . Birds in particular were used as a theme due to Hato 's fondness for pigeons ; however , this was also partially due to Hato 's prioritization of writing over illustrating , as the use of bird photographs instead of hand @-@ drawn sprites allowed her more freedom to focus on the script . The first incarnation of the game was created over the course of half a day and posted as a browser game made with Adobe Flash ; but due to strong word of mouth from social media it was taken down after immense traffic caused the web server it was hosted on to crash on two separate occasions . Following the unexpected popularity of the Flash game , development began on a longer visual novel using the FamousWriter game engine . 
 Most of the technical aspects of development — game direction , scripting , and programming — were handled by Hato alone , with fellow artist <unk> assisting with some minor aspects of the script and art direction . Despite this , most of the roughly seven @-@ month period Hato spent developing Hatoful from a one @-@ off April Fools ' gag to the finished product was dedicated to the construction of the narrative . Hato 's approach towards the game 's writing was " to create something that seems ridiculous and crazy at first glance , but that once you look into the world , you would fall into the depth " ; however , resolving the darker elements of the plot , particularly the Bad Boys Love scenario , with facts established in the quickly conceived and largely comedic pilot proved to be difficult for her , with inconsistencies in the overall timeline becoming a major concern . During the writing process , Hato admitted that she was critical of the scenarios she had written and constantly doubted whether the final product " turned out well " , later remarking in a postscript written for the game 's official guidebook : 
 Most of the background images and photography used for the characters ' sprites in the original games and associated media are taken from royalty @-@ free sources or fan submissions , though in some cases pictures of birds and backgrounds used are Hato 's own artwork or photography — the character San <unk> is depicted by and based on her real life pet bird Okosan , and several of the sprites featured in Hatoful Boyfriend were derived from pictures she had taken of birds kept at the Kobe Animal Kingdom or the Torimi Café , also located in Kobe . All of the music tracks and sound effects used in Hatoful are also similarly taken from royalty @-@ free sources . 
 = = = Naming and allusions = = = 
 The title of the game is a pun ; the <unk> @-@ <unk> word <unk> ( <unk> ) means " heartful " , however it is also phonetically identical to the Japanese pronunciation of the English word " hurtful " . This is referenced in an alternate name for the Bad Boys Love route , Hurtful Boyfriend , as well as in the subtitle for the full release of the original game , Hatoful Boyfriend : Hurtful Complete Edition . The official English transliteration of the title also incorporates the Japanese word <unk> ( <unk> ) , which means " pigeon " or " dove " . Similarly , the names of several characters are puns on the Japanese names of their respective species of bird : for example , Ryouta Kawara is a rock dove , or <unk> ( <unk> ) ; Nageki Fujishiro is a mourning dove , or <unk> ( <unk> ) ; Shuu <unk> is a chukar partridge , or <unk> ( <unk> ) ; and Kazuaki Nanaki is a button quail , or <unk> ( <unk> ) — the character hime ( <unk> ) being present in his last name , Nanaki ( <unk> ) . 
 Several locations and personalities featured in the game directly correspond to real life venues and people — for example , blogger Brian Pigeon is mentioned as one of the Hatoful world 's most influential writers , and the aforementioned Torimi Café , featured in @-@ game as a location where the protagonist can work during summer vacation , is an actual bird @-@ themed café located in Kobe . Likewise , some aspects of Hatoful 's narrative reference real world events , media , or people : the deadly H5N1 pandemic forming the basis of the game 's post @-@ apocalyptic setting was inspired by historical outbreaks of disease , most prominently the 1918 flu pandemic ; depictions of Hitchcock 's Winter , the in @-@ universe war between humans and birds , bear several similarities to Alfred Hitchcock 's film The Birds ; and Operation Carneades — the codename given to the human countermeasure against H5N1 that instead granted intelligence to birds in the Hatoful universe — was named after Greek philosopher Carneades and one of his thought experiments , the Plank of Carneades . 
 = = = Release history = = = 
 Hatoful Boyfriend 's first release in its current visual novel format was a freeware demo released as a downloadable application on 31 July 2011 . The demo version contains basic routes for seven of the love interests , and also functions as a benchmark for players to assess if the full game will run on their computer before purchasing it . The first commercial variant of the game , Hatoful Boyfriend : Plus , introducing Anghel as a love interest , was released on 14 August 2011 . Plus , a precursor of the full game used as a debugging site for new content and additional scenes intended for the final release , was discontinued on 28 October 2011 when it was patched with the finalized full version . The completed full game itself , Hatoful Boyfriend : Hurtful Complete Edition , was released at <unk> 98 on 30 October 2011 , and includes all content in previous versions of the game as well as the Torimi Café and Bad Boys Love scenarios . In Japan , Plus and Hurtful Complete Edition were initially available only as physical CD @-@ ROMs ; a downloadable version of the full game in Japanese was eventually released three years later on 13 April 2014 , where the Hurtful Complete Edition was renamed to simply Full version . Due to limitations of the FamousWriter game engine , the demo , Plus , and Hurtful Complete Edition versions of Hatoful Boyfriend are only supported on computers running Windows XP or OS X 10 @.@ 1 @-@ 10 @.@ 5 , but are playable — though unsupported — on computers running Windows Vista , Windows 7 , or OS X 10 @.@ 6 with Rosetta .

 Plans to remake the original game in high @-@ definition first began to form when Ed Fear , a writer and creative producer at game developer Mediatonic , contacted Hato Moa about the possibility of translating any projects she was involved in to English . According to the remake 's creative director Jeff <unk> , the decision was made to remake the game following several e @-@ mail conversations between Fear and Hato , with Fear 's positive experience with the Japanese version of the game and the incompatibility of FamousWriter @-@ made games with newer operating systems — which had rendered the original game effectively unplayable on newer PCs — being major factors in the decision . An international remake of Hatoful developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital made using the Unity game engine — allowing the game to be fully compatible with computers that run Windows Vista , Windows 7 or OS X 10 @.@ 6 , and playable for the first time on those that run Linux or OS X 10 @.@ 7 or newer — was first revealed to be in development on 6 June 2014 , with a formal announcement coming shortly afterwards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 . 
 The remake , known as Hatoful Boyfriend HD in Japan , was originally slated for release via Steam on 21 August 2014 ; however release was later postponed to 4 September 2014 to allow for final adjustments to the Japanese version . The remake includes a new route for Azami , full screen capability , and redrawn backgrounds . A collector 's edition of the remake titled Hatoful Boyfriend Summer of Dove Collector 's Edition was released for pre @-@ order along with the normal edition , and bundles together the remake , the original Hatoful Boyfriend : Hurtful Complete Edition , a digital version of the game 's soundtrack , a new comic illustrated by Hato , exclusive wallpapers of Okosan , and a St. PigeoNation 's Class of 2014 yearbook . The remake was also included in the Humble Bundle pack for Valentine 's Day 2015 , which exclusively featured dating sim games , along with a Hatoful Boyfriend pillowcase for the highest price point option . A port of the remake for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was released on 21 July 2015 . And one to for iOS on 25 May 2016 . 
 = = = English localization = = = 
 On 22 November 2011 , freelance translator Nazerine released a fan translation patch of the free demo version of the game . The initial project involved Nazerine translating , writing , and revising the game text , while another person hacked the game so that the translated text displayed properly on the game screen . This English patch launched the first wave of western interest in the game , with several video game publications reporting on it due to the game 's unusual concept . The success of this translation attracted the attention of Hato Moa herself , who then offered Nazerine the opportunity to translate the full game — and later its sequel , Holiday Star — for an official English release . The translation process of the full game was also a solo effort by Nazerine ; however , Hato removed the need for hacking by directly supervising the translation , adjusting images in the game for English sentences . As the demo 's English patch was made before Nazerine had access to the full version of the game , several lines of dialogue were translated differently to reflect context revealed in Bad Boys Love ; for example , third @-@ person pronouns from Kazuaki Nanaki 's route implying that he had a female lover in the fan translation were replaced with gender @-@ neutral ones in the official translation . Few dramatic changes were made , though several jokes were added in Nazerine 's translations of the game that were not present in the original Japanese text . The official English version of the game was released for download on 15 February 2012 . The 2014 remake has also been confirmed to have used Nazerine 's translation .

 = = Reception = = 
 As a dōjin soft title , Hatoful Boyfriend was created on a limited budget and had even more limited promotion ; however , due to strong word of mouth on Twitter and other social media Hatoful has enjoyed a degree of commercial success , especially when compared against its minimal production costs — with Mado no Mori reporting that the game was a " popular title " whose physical CD @-@ ROM copies " consistently sold out at dōjin markets and wherever it became available for purchase " , and 4Gamer.net noting that the game disk was difficult to purchase due to overwhelming demand . Outside Japan , where it is only available by download , the English release of the game is dōjin soft distributor <unk> English 's best @-@ selling title with 7 @,@ 000 separate purchases as of 2014 . 
 Hatoful Boyfriend has received generally favorable reception , with reviewers focusing on the surprising depth of the game 's writing and storyline . In a weekly game spotlight , Kouichi Kirishima from Mado no Mori recommends the game to " not just pigeon @-@ lovers , but anyone who enjoys visual novels " , remarking that the game is " at times surprisingly serious and emotionally involved " . On the other side of the Pacific , Julian Murdoch comments in a Gamers With Jobs analysis of the game that the scenarios featured in Hatoful are " elaborate and multifaceted " , and that Hato Moa herself " isn ’ t just a storyteller , she ’ s actually a good storyteller " . Hatoful Boyfriend was also named the best PC game of 2012 by <unk> ; Paul Franzen explains the game 's inclusion among higher budget and more technically sophisticated titles as being due to the strength of its storytelling and pathos , stating that " Hatoful Boyfriend isn 't just a weird game about heathen human @-@ animal relationships [ ... ] there ’ s an actual , serious , emotional game here , too " . In an article discussing the E3 announcement of the 2014 remake , Carly Smith for The Escapist remarks that Hatoful Boyfriend is " absolutely hilarious " , but recommends that players " start the game for a laugh , but stick with it for a ride you wouldn 't have expected by looking at the cover " . 
 Reviewers also praised the game 's varied scenarios and replayability . Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game , saying that " with a huge amount of replay value , creativity to burn , and some of the most shocking plot lines you could ever hope to encounter , Hatoful Boyfriend is a fascinating and surprising text adventure well worth checking out " , though she also observes that " the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre " . Alexa Ray Corriea 's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10 , concluding that the " witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios are genuinely fun to discover , and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile " . Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay — noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs — as well as the accessibility of the game 's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players : in his review of the remake for PC Gamer , Julian Murdoch states that " I suspect few will have the patience to ride the fast forward button and <unk> out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending — really a second half — of the game " . 
 Much attention was drawn to Hatoful Boyfriend 's surreal concept in both its native Japan as well as overseas . Mentions of the game 's " bird romance " spread through Japanese social media , leading several news agencies and publications to report on Hatoful and the " newness " of its premise . As translations began to make the game accessible to an English speaking audience , western media reacted similarly : Alec Meer for Rock , Paper , Shotgun commented on Hatoful 's premise , citing it as being " reason enough to play it " ; also for Rock , Paper , Shotgun , Craig Pearson stated that the game " could only be better if it was a secret game from Valve and Bioware " . One of the main spurs to the game 's popularity was a playthrough recorded by Angie Gallant on the Quarter to Three forums . In a retrospect , Jeffrey Matulef for Eurogamer remarks that Hatoful Boyfriend 's " outlandish premise caught on and the English speaking world demanded it not be left out of this surreal creation " , while Robert Fenner of RPGFan compared it favorably to Hiroki Azuma 's writings on database consumption , praising the game as a " fierce deconstruction as well as a tender celebration of dating sims " . Several Japanese commentators have also noted the game 's overseas success , especially following the E3 announcement of the remake by British developer Mediatonic and American publisher Devolver Digital . 
 = = Sequel = = 
 A sequel titled Hatoful Boyfriend : Holiday Star ( Japanese : はーとふる彼氏 <unk> , Hepburn : Hātofuru <unk> <unk> ) , was released in Japan in 29 December 2011 , with an official English patch being released a year later on Christmas Day . The game is an episodic followup set around the holiday season and takes place in a separate universe from the first game , in which the events of Bad Boys Love do not occur . The sequel , developed largely alongside the first game , makes reference to and explores several unresolved plot elements brought up in the first game 's Bad Boys Love scenario that could not be fully addressed in its main narrative . Unlike the first game , Holiday Star is a mostly linear visual novel rather than an otome game , with more standalone scenarios and fewer branching plotlines . On 4 June 2015 , it was announced that Mediatonic , the developer responsible for the 2014 remake of the original game , was also developing a remake of Holiday Star , again to be published by Devolver Digital . The remake of the sequel is slated for release in Winter 2015 . On 8 December 2015 , it was announced that the remake of Hatoful Boyfriend : Holiday Star would be released on 15 December 2015 for Microsoft Windows , OS X and Linux , and on 22 December 2015 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita . 
 = Pitfour estate = 
 The Pitfour estate , in the Buchan area of north @-@ east Scotland , was an ancient barony encompassing most of the extensive Longside Parish , stretching from St Fergus to New Pitsligo . It was purchased in 1700 by James Ferguson of Badifurrow , who became the first Laird of Pitfour . 
 The estate was substantially renovated by Ferguson and the following two generations of his family . At the height of its development in the 18th and 19th centuries the 50 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 130 km2 ) property had several extravagant features including a two @-@ mile racecourse , an artificial lake and an observatory . The original mansion house was extended before being rebuilt . The surrounding parklands were landscaped , major renovations were undertaken , and follies such as a small replica Temple of Theseus were constructed , in which George Ferguson , the fifth laird , was thought to keep alligators in a cold bath . 
 The first three lairds transformed the estate into a valuable asset . Lord Pitfour , the second laird , purchased additional lands including Deer Abbey and Inverugie Castle . Pitfour 's son , James Ferguson , who became the third laird , continued to improve and expand the estate by adding the lake and bridges , and establishing planned villages . The third laird died a bachelor with no children , so the estate passed to the elderly George Ferguson , who was only in possession of the property for a few months . George was already a wealthy man , owning lands in Trinidad and Tobago , but despite not directly improving the Pitfour estate he added considerable value to the inheritance passed to his illegitimate son . The extravagant lifestyles of the fifth and sixth lairds led to the sequestration of the estate , which was sold off piecemeal to pay their debts . 
 What remained of the estate was sold after the First World War . The mansion house was demolished in about 1926 , and its stone used to build council houses in Aberdeen . In more recent times some of the remaining buildings , including the temple , the bridges and the stables , have been classified as at high risk by Historic Scotland because their condition has become poor . The chapel was fully renovated and converted to a private residence in 2003 ; the observatory was purchased and restored by Banff & Buchan District Council ( now Aberdeenshire Council ) and can be accessed by the public . The racecourse has been forested since 1926 , and the lake is used by members of a private fishing club . 
 = = Early history = = 
 The Pitfour estate in Mintlaw extended from St Fergus to New Pitsligo and encompassed most of the extensive Longside Parish . The meaning of Pitfour is given in the 1895 records of the Clan Fergusson as " cold croft " , but the historian John Milne breaks the name into two parts and indicates the meaning as Pit being place and <unk> or <unk> being grass . The Pitfour estate is shown on old maps as Petfouir or Petfour . It was formerly one of Scotland 's largest and best @-@ appointed estates and was referred to as " The Blenheim of Buchan " , " The Blenheim of the North " and " The Ascot of the North " by the architectural historian Charles McKean . 
 Scant early records exist of the lands but Alexander Stewart ( <unk> <unk> ) , the natural son of King Robert II of Scotland , was given the Pitfour lands together with those of Lunan by his father in 1383 . However , writing in 1887 Cadenhead states the lands were sold to Stewart by Ricardus <unk> , also known as Richard <unk> . During the next three centuries the lands had several different owners . Transactions show it passed to a burgess of Aberdeen in 1477 from Egidia Stewart ; Walter Innes of <unk> gained feudal superiority to all Pitfour lands in 1493 ; and in 1506 the land was purchased by Thomas Innes , who died the following year . His son , John , inherited the property . It remained in the possession of the Innes family until at least 1581 , when it was owned by James Innes and his wife Agnes Urquhart . Between 1581 and 1667 the lands were bought by George Morrison . His son William inherited the property in 1700 , and immediately sold the estate to James Ferguson , who became the first Laird of Pitfour . 
 The lands purchased by Ferguson were recorded in 1667 in a charter granted by Charles II and were stated as encompassing " the lands and Barony of Toux and Pitfour in the Parish of Old Deer and Sheriffdom of Aberdeen including the towns and lands of Mintlaw , Longmuir , <unk> in the Parish of Longside , and County of Aberdeen . " Several other lands , including " the Barony of Aden with the Tower , <unk> , Mains and Manor Place therof and <unk> of the same called <unk> , <unk> Mill thereof , Croft Brewerie , <unk> and <unk> " were individually listed . State papers from the reign of Queen Anne in the 18th century record the lands in favour of James Ferguson . 
 = = Lairds and subsequent development = = 
 1st laird 
 James Ferguson — known as the Sheriff , reflecting the post he held , recognised by the Society of Advocates — bought the Pitfour estate after selling the lands of Badifurrow . He had inherited Badifurrow after demanding that his uncle Robert Ferguson should appear in court if he wished to contest the inheritance . Robert , nicknamed the Plotter , was in hiding to avoid charges of treachery , and after his non @-@ appearance in court James Ferguson 's inheritance was confirmed in mid @-@ June 1700 . At that time the estate contained only a small country house . 
 2nd laird 
 James was laird until his death in 1734 , after which the estate passed to his eldest son , also called James , who was born at Pitfour soon after it was purchased . A solicitor like his father , he was promoted to the bench in 1764 and became Lord Pitfour . He continued to expand and improve the estate until his death in 1777 , and set up the planned village of Fetterangus in 1752 . 
 Lord Pitfour purchased the lands of the last Earl Marischal , George Keith , which were adjacent to Pitfour , in 1766 . They were considered the Earl Marischal 's most significant property and had been forfeited when the Earl Marischal fell out of favour . He had bought it back from the York Buildings Company for £ 31 @,@ 000 , but Pitfour only paid £ 15 @,@ 000 for it . The 8 @,@ 000 acres ( 32 square kilometres ) of land included Deer Abbey and Inverugie Castle , but consisted predominantly of peat bogs , woods and uncultivated land . This addition made the Pitfour estate the largest in the area , at more than 30 @,@ 000 acres ( 120 square kilometres ) stretching from Buchanhaven to Maud along the course of the River Ugie . 
 3rd laird 
 The third laird , also named James , inherited the estate in 1777 ; he was usually referred to as the Member to differentiate him from previous generations . Like his forebears , he was an advocate but also became a Member of Parliament . He too continued to expand and improve the estate ; he constructed a lake and a canal , and built the new mansion . He also expanded and altered Longside at the start of the 1800s , founded Mintlaw in 1813 , assisted in the extension of New Deer and extended Buchanhaven . 
 The Member died unmarried , childless and intestate in 1820 . In normal circumstances his brother Patrick would have been his heir , but he died in battle in October 1780 . 
 4th laird 
 In 1820 the estate was inherited by the Member 's younger brother , George Ferguson , who was by then in his seventies . He was known as the Governor , reflecting his appointment as Lieutenant Governor of Tobago . He was laird from September 1820 , but died in December that year . The Governor had spent most of his life in Trinidad and Tobago , where he was a principal landowner , and had inherited the Castara Estate on Tobago from Patrick . George was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Tobago in 1779 , and after a battle with the French in 1781 surrendered the island to the French on 2 June . The Governor returned to Britain , although the terms of the surrender meant he still owned the Castara estate and all the slaves who worked on it . George had illegitimate children with an unknown woman . He continued to buy estates in the Caribbean and returned there in 1793 , staying until 1810 . 
 5th laird 
 The estate started to deteriorate after it was inherited by the Governor 's illegitimate son George Ferguson , known as the Admiral because of his naval career . He was already heavily in debt when he became the fifth laird in 1821 , but he still enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and undertook much extravagant construction on the estate , including the erection of follies . To cover his substantial gambling debts , he began to sell parcels of estate land , and upon inheriting Pitfour he began selling furniture , books , farm equipment and other items , realising more than £ 9 @,@ 000 . 
 6th laird 
 After the Admiral 's death in March 1867 , the estate passed to his son , George Arthur Ferguson , the sixth and final laird . He served in the Grenadier Guards and eventually became a captain . He married Nina Maria Hood , the eldest daughter of Alexander Nelson Hood , 1st Viscount Bridport , in February 1861 . Later that year Captain Ferguson was posted to Canada , where he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and where his first two sons , Arthur and Francis William , were born . His eldest son , Arthur , became Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland . Returning to Britain in 1864 , the family had a nomadic lifestyle , but the sixth laird and his wife were extravagant and habitual gamblers . In June 1909 , a trust deed was registered , and what remained of the estate was put on the market . After large parts of the land had been sold under the ownership of the sixth laird the estate was listed by Bateman in 1883 as being just over 23 @,@ 000 acres ( 93 square kilometres ) with an income of £ 19 @,@ 938 ; at the height of its development the estate had occupied 50 square miles ( 130 square kilometres ) , and was valued at £ 30 million . 
 The last laird died in 1924 and is buried in Luton . 
 Following its 20th @-@ century decline the estate changed hands several times until local farmer Hamish Watson purchased it in December 2010 . The local historian Alex Buchan summed up the demise of the estate : " They thought the estate was here to provide them with money , to gamble , to travel , to simply fritter away and very quickly , within a couple of decades , they had wasted the whole lot . " He added , " Eccentricity amounted to just squandering money . " 
 = = Mansion house = = 
 The original small country house was first altered during the early 18th century . In 1809 the Sheriff 's grandson James Ferguson , the third laird , employed the architect John Smith to design new accommodation . The resulting three @-@ storey house , 98 feet ( 30 metres ) square and 33 feet ( 10 metres ) high , is reputed to have had 365 windows . When the fourth laird , George ( the Governor ) , died in 1820 , the estate was worth £ 300 @,@ 000 with almost £ 35 @,@ 000 of moveable assets . George Ferguson , the fifth laird ( the Admiral ) added a large , glazed gallery when he inherited the house . The Admiral had a lavish lifestyle and despite having a healthy income incurred heavy debts . 
 When the Admiral died after 46 years of managing the estate it was mortgaged for £ 250 @,@ 000 , despite the sale of a number of the lands originally included in it . The house fell into disrepair under the ownership of George Arthur , the sixth and final laird , who had inherited his father 's lifestyle . The entire estate was put on the market in September 1909 but remained unsold until after the First World War ; the house and what remained of the estate were finally purchased by a speculator , Edgar Fairweather , from London in 1926 . Fairweather bought several other Scottish estates , including those nearby at <unk> and Strichen ; he habitually reduced the estates into smaller holdings that he then sold on or rented out . The house was sold to an Aberdeen building company and was demolished sometime between 1927 and 1930 . After demolition , the mansion 's veranda was installed at the front of Kinloch Farmhouse in St Fergus . Other remains from the mansion have been discovered at the farmhouse , including a crest above the conservatory door and tiles inscribed with the Ferguson of Pitfour family crest . The stone from the mansion was transported to Aberdeen and used in the construction of council houses . 
 = = Chapels = = 
 The Fergusons were Episcopalian , and in 1766 , the second laird , Lord Pitfour had a small Qualified Chapel built on the estate at Waulkmill . It was a large , plain building that could accommodate up to 500 people . Saplinbrae , a house that was initially used as a coaching inn after it was built under instruction from Lord Pitfour in 1756 , was used as the minister 's manse for the first chapel . 
 A more modern chapel was built in 1850 after the Admiral had an argument with the Reverend Arthur Ranken , the minister at Old Deer . This was a small , private chapel for the use of the Pitfour estate . It was built in the Gothic style from rubble but was recast in 1871 . A 60 @-@ foot ( 18 @-@ metre ) tower with a battlemented top is at its western end . The chapel fell into disrepair , and by the 1980s it was a roofless ruin . 
 In 1990 Historic Scotland said that Kinloch Farmhouse , in St Fergus featured a bench and chair salvaged from the Pitfour Chapel . In 2003 , the second chapel was renovated and converted to a private residence . The chapel restoration won a " Highly commended " award for craftsmanship from Aberdeenshire Council in 2010 ; the council said the craftsmanship " allowed for the retention of the ecclesiastical spirit and integrity to remain prevalent both internally and externally . " It was also " Highly Commended " in the conservation category . 
 = = Stables and riding school = = 
 The stables were built in 1820 , during the early part of the Admiral 's ownership of the estate , based on a design by John Smith ; the buildings are sited to the rear of the mansion house . Built in a horseshoe @-@ shape , neo @-@ classical design , the two @-@ storey building was constructed in pinned rubble with granite dressings ; grey granite was used for the parapet and quoins . The main buildings were originally harled . A corrugated asbestos hipped roof was at some point substituted for the original slate roof . It features a columned rotunda above a timber clock tower , which has a finial and domed copper roof . The pedimented centrepiece of the symmetrical front elevation is a segmental arch and has three panels set back between columns . Each side is bordered by wings of three bays with single @-@ bay pavilions . 
 The stables are connected to an adjoining two @-@ storey house . They provided accommodation for ten horses and included four loose boxes , a harness room and a coachman 's house ; six bedrooms above were for servants . Two coach houses were later used as garages . The stables building was marketed in 1997 for approximately £ 70 @,@ 000 . Charles McKean describes the stables as " straddling the skyline like a palace " . The stables are listed by Historic Scotland as being at very high risk , and were described in 1997 sale literature as unused and dilapidated . 
 An indoor riding school slightly to the north @-@ west of the stables measured 98 feet ( 30 metres ) by 49 feet ( 15 metres ) . It was used to entertain guests when the facilities at the mansion house were not large enough . More than two hundred local farmers and other landowners celebrated the wedding of George Arthur , the sixth laird , in the riding school in 1861 . In 1883 it was again used to entertain ; on that occasion it was decorated with flags and Chinese lanterns , and pine flooring was laid . Later , it was used as indoor tennis courts before being demolished . 
 = = Canal and lake = = 
 James Ferguson , the third laird , owned the estate during the Industrial Revolution in Britain . He began work on a canal between Pitfour and Peterhead in 1797 , despite fierce opposition from adjoining landowners . The canal was proposed to cover about ten miles following the course of the River Ugie . Pitfour 's canal is sometimes called the St Fergus and River Ugie Canal . Ferguson had thought about building the canal since 1793 , but it was never completed because of " difficulties in effecting the necessary arrangements with neighbouring heritors . " Objections were raised by the Merchant Maiden Hospital , which owned the land on the south side of the Ugie . Despite being advised to take out an interdict to prevent the work , in January 1797 the hospital thought its case was not strong enough . The hospital applied for an interdict four months later however , when two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of the canal had been dug to the point where the north and south Ugie joined ; it was granted in July 1797 . 
 A few years after starting work on the canal , Ferguson had a lake built on flat land to the front of the mansion house . The landscape gardener William S. Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at about the same time , and it is assumed he helped with the work at Pitfour . The lake extends to almost 50 acres ( 20 hectares ) and is 174 feet ( 53 metres ) above sea level . Designed in the same style as the lake in Windsor Great Park , the lake was stocked with trout , both rainbow and brown ; there were three bridges and four islands . The siting of the lake meant the driveway had to be moved , and ornate bridges were constructed to cross the water . Built from granite , the northern bridge has three arches with ashlar starlings , the southern bridge has a single arch and the third , smaller bridge crosses a large stream that drains into the lake . 
 The neighbouring Russell family of Aden were concerned their land would be flooded when the lake was built , and their animosity was fully demonstrated when a bridge had to be jointly constructed by the two landowners over the River Ugie . It was wide enough for carriages on the Pitfour side but too narrow on the Russell 's half . 
 = = Theseus temple = = 
 Alongside the lake was a six @-@ bay Greek Doric temple , a small replica styled after the Temple of Theseus . Its exact date of construction is unknown ; it may have been built during the time of James Ferguson , the third laird , or under the instruction of George Ferguson , the fifth laird . The local historian Alex Buchan attributes it to James , the third laird ; according to Historic Scotland , it was built " probably circa 1835 " . Like the mansion house , the temple is credited to the architect John Smith . Measuring 8 metres ( 26 ft ) by 16 metres ( 52 ft ) , it has six columns at both ends and thirteen columns down each side . It had a flat roof with an ornate wooden entablature and contained a cold @-@ water bath in which George , the fifth laird was believed to have kept alligators . As of 2013 the temple is in a ruinous state ; it has been held up by scaffolding since 1992 and is listed by Historic Scotland as being in critical condition . 
 = = Racecourse and observatory = = 
 George Ferguson ( the Admiral ) had a racecourse about 2 @.@ 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 5 kilometres ) long and 52 feet ( 16 metres ) wide built near White Cow Woods , an area which is quite flat . This led to the estate being called the " Ascot of the North " . 
 In 1845 the Admiral had an observatory built , again designed by the architect John Smith . It is an octagonal tower with a crenellated parapet and is symmetrical in design . The observatory stands at the top of a hill 396 feet ( 121 m ) above sea level . The tower is 50 feet ( 15 m ) high and is more than half a mile ( 1 kilometre ) from the racecourse . It has three storeys with square windows on the upper floor , and was fully renovated by Banff & Buchan District Council ( now Aberdeenshire Council ) in 1983 . 
 = = Twentieth century = = 
 Sales of country estates became common around the 1920s . The annual tax payable had spiralled and was twenty times greater than in 1870 resulting in the break @-@ up of many larger land @-@ holdings . Pitfour was no exception and the dispersal of the estate continued piecemeal after the sequestration of George Arthur , the sixth laird . The main estate policies including the lake and other land were purchased by Bernard Drake in November 1926 when he bought Saplinbrae , the former minister 's house . Drake was a partner in the electrical engineering company , Drake and Gorham . 
 Sixty years later , in 1986 the BBC Domesday Project does not give any ownership details but indicates many of the buildings are in poor condition . Other surviving structures are used for storage by a farmer who also " manages the land " . 
 = = Recent times = = 
 At the end of 2012 Aberdeenshire Council gave the go @-@ ahead for the present owner 's planned restoration work on the temple and bridges , which he hoped would enhance existing facilities at nearby <unk> Wood surrounding the Observatory , White Cow Woods and Aden Country Park . The lake is used regularly by local fishermen , and a fishing club with about 120 members was established in 2011 . The rest of the estate is seldom used by local residents , many of whom are completely unaware of it .

 Kuznetsova received training at the Sanchez @-@ Casal Academy in Barcelona , Spain from the age of 14 and was coached under direction of club president Emilio Sánchez and Sergio Casal . Her major coaching relationship was with Stefan Ortega who was a regular guest in her player 's box and helped advance her game . 
 After a series of poor finals ' results Kuznetsova ended her relationship with the Sanchez @-@ Casal academy in 2009 and moved to Moscow on the advice of Roger Federer to start training with experienced Russian coach Olga Morozova . They ended their relationship after the BNP Paribas Open in March 2009 , after which Kuznetsova was without a coach . As of May 2009 her coach was former Russian tennis player and Fed Cup coach Larisa <unk> . She was coached for a short period by Loïc Courteau after trying unsuccessfully to convince Mauresmo to coach her . Her next coach was for a short time the former Spanish tennis player Carlos Cuadrado , until he was replaced with her former coach <unk> . After the loss in the Italian Open , Kuznetsova has switched to Morozova , then to Amos <unk> and finally in May 2012 to Argentine Hernán <unk> , former coach of Marat Safin . She said in an interview , that she likes working with him and understands with him well . With his help she won three matches in straight sets at the 2012 French Open , including claiming the scalp of then @-@ world No. 3 Agnieszka Radwańska .

 Rosalie Slaughter Morton , M.D. ( October 28 , 1876 – May 5 , 1968 ) , born Rosalie Slaughter , was an American physician and surgeon . Besides running her own medical practices , she co @-@ founded the American Women 's Hospitals Service , worked as a medic during the First World War , and was the first chairperson of the Public Health Education Committee . Morton was one of the first female members of faculty at the Polyclinic Hospital of New York , and the first at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University . 
 Born in Lynchburg , Virginia , Morton studied at the Woman 's Medical College of Pennsylvania despite her family 's expectation that she would only aim to find a husband who could provide for her . She went on to further study and research across Europe and Asia before returning to the United States to open her own medical practices . 
 Morton received a number of awards during her career , including the Joan of Arc medal , and a park in Belgrade is named in her honor . In 1937 she published an autobiography - A Woman Surgeon : The Life and Work of Rosalie Slaughter Morton - to positive reception , and in 1940 released a second book titled A Doctor 's Holiday in Iran . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Rosalie Slaughter was born in 1876 in Lynchburg , Virginia to Mary Harker and John <unk> Slaughter . She had five brothers and one sister ( three other siblings died in childhood ) , and was educated in Lynchburg before travelling to a finishing school in Baltimore . From here she chose to follow in the steps of her grandfather and two older brothers by becoming a doctor , joining the Woman 's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1893 . In her autobiography Morton remarked that her upbringing and education had " been designed ... to make me a capable wife — not to imbue me with a desire for a career , " noting that her father had left her no money – expecting her to find a husband who could provide for her – and that many in her family did not want her to pursue a career in medicine . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 Slaughter married George B. Morton Jr . , an attorney who had previously studied medicine , in 1905 at St. Paul 's Church , Lynchburg . In 1910 it was reported that she was filing for divorce , and he died in 1912 of an aneurism . In the early 1930s Morton suffered a bout of pneumonia , prompting her to move to Winter Park , Florida , where she died in 1968 . 
 = = Career = = 
 After graduating from college in Pennsylvania with two of the three honors available to her , Morton was appointed as resident physician at the Alumnae Hospital and Dispensary , where she worked until 1899 . She then began further studies in Europe , travelling to Berlin , Vienna , Paris , and London . During this time Morton took courses , observed surgeries , and wrote a number of scientific papers including several comparing the health of women and men . Following the advice of her instructor in London , Victor Horsley , she then travelled to the British Government Laboratory in Mumbai for six months to work on <unk> against the bubonic plague as well as a period in Sri Lanka . 
 Having finished her studies , Morton returned to the United States in 1902 and opened a medical practice specialising in gynecology in Washington D.C. After marrying George Morton Jr . , she opened a new medical practice in New York , where he was an attorney . In 1909 the American Medical Association created a Public Health Education Committee with the aim of educating the public on subjects including health , hygiene , child care , and other medical topics ; they made Morton its first chairperson . Morton was appointed as a clinical assistant and instructor at the Polyclinic Hospital of New York ( where she was one of the first female faculty members ) , and later became a professor of gynecology . During this time she lectured at a number of other universities including a summer at the University of Vermont . 
 After the breakout of the First World War , Morton travelled to Labrador to work in the Mission Hospitals there , before being made a special commissioner of the Red Cross to take supplies from Paris to the Macedonian Front and work at the field hospitals in Macedonia . After returning to New York Morton , alongside Mary M. Crawford , led the American Women 's Hospitals Service from 1917 after it was founded by the Medical Women 's National Association with the aim of establishing American hospitals in Europe . After her request to send one thousand medical women who had volunteered for foreign service was opposed by the General Medical Board in Washington , she raised over $ 300 @,@ 000 in 10 days through a national fundraising drive to send them . At the recommendation of William C. Gorgas , Morton was made chairman of the committee of women physicians on the United States Council of National Defense , where she represented over 7000 female doctors . 
 Morton continued running her New York practice while attempting to aid young people in Yugoslavia and Serbia who had been disrupted during the war into education . In March 1919 she established the international Serbian Committee , through which she facilitated the placing of dozens of young Serbian people in American places of education . 
 After moving to Florida in the early 1930s Morton established a small clinical practice where she carried out research into arthritis and endocrinology . 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 By 1937 Morton had been awarded 9 decorations by home and foreign Governments . During her career Morton 's awards included the Cross of Czar Nicholas II , the Joan of Arc medal , and the Conspicuous Service Cross , and in 1934 she was presented a special award by the American Medical Association for her work establishing the American Women 's Hospitals . A tree was planted in Central Park in her honor , commemorating her " distinguished patriotic service " , and both a street and park in Belgrade are named after her . 
 = = Books = = 
 Morton wrote an autobiography titled A Woman Surgeon : The Life and Work of Rosalie Slaughter Morton which was published in 1937 by Frederick A. Stokes . The book was reviewed well , with praise given to both the writing and the breadth of experiences chronicled in it . 
 Writing for The Pittsburgh Press , Harry Hansen described Morton 's autobiography as an " excellent book on a woman 's accomplishments " commending both the descriptions of medical topics as well as political ones . In The Brooklyn Daily Eagle , George Currie wrote that " at no time is her book boring " , calling it an important book for documenting the contributions of " a woman crusader " . The Salt Lake Tribune described the book as " informative , thrilling and colorful " , and The Sydney Morning Herald called it " particularly interesting " . In their review , the Indiana Gazette rated the book as one of the best medical autobiographies of recent times . 
 After finishing her autobiography , Morton travelled to Iran , and in 1940 published a book on the country and her time there titled A Doctor 's Holiday in Iran .

He scored his first NHL goal on November 19 , 1996 against the Los Angeles Kings , and was named the NHL 's rookie of the month for February 1997 . He fell to 22 points in 1997 – 98 and ended the season in a dispute with the Lightning when he refused a demotion to the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League . The Lightning suspended him indefinitely , but told the media they were not interested in trading him .

He was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers along with Mikael <unk> on December 12 , 1998 in exchange for Chris Gratton and Mike <unk> . 
 While he was considered a throw @-@ in for the Flyers who made the trade to re @-@ acquire <unk> , Langkow flourished in Philadelphia .

 The acquisition of Jeremy Roenick and Jiri <unk> by the Flyers in the summer of 2001 left Langkow , a restricted free agent , as the odd man out in Philadelphia . He was dealt to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for a second round draft pick in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft ( Dan Sprang ) and a first round pick in 2003 ( Jeff Carter ) . Unable to agree on a contract , Langkow and the Coyotes went to arbitration where he was awarded a two @-@ year contract worth $ 4 @.@ 2 million .

 The Coyotes signed Langkow to a one @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 95 million contract in August 2004 , but dealt him to the Calgary Flames less than two weeks later for Oleg <unk> and Denis Gauthier . The season , and the contract , were wiped out by the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout ; Langkow did not play anywhere during the lost season . The Flames signed Langkow to a new contract prior to the 2005 – 06 season amidst high expectations as he was placed on the top line with Jarome Iginla . He finished the season second on the Flames in both goals ( 25 ) and points ( 59 ) and recorded his sixth consecutive season with 50 + points . 
 Langkow emerged as a top scorer for the Flames in 2006 – 07 , becoming the team 's offensive leader while Iginla was sidelined for several weeks by a mid @-@ season knee injury . He reached the 30 @-@ goal mark ( 33 ) for the first time in his career , finished with a career high 77 points and was the Flames nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and sportsmanship . His teammates and coaches also praised his defensive ability , suggesting that he deserved a nomination for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL 's top defensive forward . Langkow remained a top two @-@ way forward for the Flames in 2007 – 08 , recording his second consecutive 30 @-@ goal season and finishing third on the team with 65 points . The Flames re @-@ signed him to a four @-@ year , $ 18 @-@ million contract extension though the 2011 – 12 NHL season . 
 Langkow scored only 49 points in 2008 – 09 and missed ten games as result of a hand injury . It was the first time in nine seasons that he failed to reach the 50 @-@ point mark . He suffered another hand injury in the 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs , though he still played all six games against the Chicago Blackhawks . He played his 1,000th game , against the Lightning , on February 6 , 2010 , one night after teammate Jarome Iginla reached the same mark . His offensive numbers continued to decline , as he finished the year with 14 goals and 37 points , his lowest totals in a decade . 
 He missed the final ten games of the season after he was struck in the back of the neck by a slapshot during a game in Minnesota . The injury resulted in spinal cord damage that kept Langkow out of the lineup for the first 78 games of the 2010 – 11 NHL season . His efforts to return to the Flames lineup suffered a setback in late October , after which a Flames official stated it was a " 50 / 50 proposition " on whether he would ever play another NHL game . 
 Following several months of rehabilitation , Langkow was cleared for light skating by a neck specialist , allowing him to begin practicing with his Flames teammates at the end of February 2011 , though he was still considered 2 – 3 months away from being able to continue his career . He joined the Flames for full practices a couple weeks later , and by mid March – nearly one year to the day of his injury – Langkow expressed hope that he would be able to return to action prior to the end of the season . That hope became reality late in the year as he was activated off injured reserve by the Flames , who announced he would return to the lineup for an April 1 game against the St. Louis Blues , 376 days and 88 games after he suffered the injury . 
 For his efforts at coming back from injury , Langkow was a finalist for the 2011 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy that was ultimately won by Ian Laperriere .

 = Collared brown lemur = 
 The collared brown lemur ( Eulemur collaris ) , also known as the red @-@ collared brown lemur or red @-@ collared lemur , is a medium @-@ sized strepsirrhine primate and one of twelve species of brown lemur in the family Lemuridae . It is only found in south @-@ eastern Madagascar . Like most species of lemur , it is arboreal , moving quadrupedally and occasionally leaping from tree to tree . Like other brown lemurs , it lives in social groups , primarily eats fruit , is active both day and night , exhibits sexual dichromatism , and does not demonstrate female dominance . The species is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and is threatened primarily by habitat loss . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Together with the twelve other true lemurs ( genus Eulemur ) , the collared brown lemur ( E. collaris ) is a type of lemur belonging to the family Lemuridae . Collectively , lemurs ( infraorder Lemuriformes ) are classified as strepsirrhine primates . Originally listed as a subspecies of the common brown lemur ( E. fulvus ) , the collared brown lemur was promoted to full species status in 2001 by biological anthropologist Colin Groves . 
 = = Anatomy and physiology = = 
 An adult collared brown lemur can reach a head @-@ body length of 39 and 40 cm ( 15 and 16 in ) and have a tail length of 50 and 55 cm ( 20 and 22 in ) for an overall length of 89 and 95 cm ( 35 and 37 in ) . It has an average body weight of 2 @.@ 25 and 2 @.@ 5 kg ( 5 @.@ 0 and 5 @.@ 5 lb ) , making it a medium @-@ sized lemur . The only form of sexual dimorphism exhibited by the collared brown lemur is dichromatism . The following table illustrates the coloration differences between the sexes : 
 In the wild , the collared brown lemur 's range does not overlap with other brown lemurs , so it is rarely confused with other species . However , in captivity it can be easily confused with the gray @-@ headed lemur ( Eulemur <unk> ) due to similar coloration . The male collared brown lemur can be distinguished by their cream @-@ colored or rufous beards , whereas the male gray @-@ headed lemur has a white beard . Females of these two species are nearly indistinguishable , even though genetic analyses support full species status for both taxa . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Found in tropical moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar , the collared brown lemur occurs west to the forests of Kalambatritra and in the south from Tôlanaro north to the Mananara River . The Mananara River is the boundary between the ranges of the collared brown lemur and the Gray @-@ headed Lemur to the north . The collared brown lemur can be seen in the Mandena Conservation Zone , Saint Luce Private Reserve , and Andohahela National Park . 
 In its environment , the collared brown lemur acts as a seed disperser , and is especially critical for the dispersal of large @-@ seeded fruiting trees within its range . However , there is no evidence that these relationships are coevolutionary and instead these lemurs may be the last remaining seed dispersers for these tree species following the extinction of larger frugivorous birds and subfossil lemurs . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Very little is known about this species . It is thought to primarily eat fruit , like most other true lemurs . It is also cathemeral ( active both day and night throughout the year ) , a trait seen in some other members of its genus . Research has suggested that metabolic dietary @-@ related needs are the leading factor behind this behavior , although the specific hours of this activity pattern can shift based on lunar luminosity and seasonal changes in the photoperiod ( day length ) . Previous studies had ruled out effects of predators on the expression of this trait , and instead pointed to fruit availability and fiber intake as more important factors . 
 The collared brown lemur tends to live in social groups that are multi @-@ male / multi @-@ female , with groups ranging in size from three to seven . Population densities are estimated at 14 individuals / km2 , and it appears to be common within its range . Females give birth to one offspring between October and December , and male involvement with the young has been observed . Female dominance , a common behavioral trait in many lemur species but uncommon in most true lemurs , has not been observed in this species . 
 Brown lemurs at Berenty ( hybrid E. fulvus x collaris ) show linear hierarchy , adult female dominance , and the presence of conciliatory behavior after aggressions . Additionally , stress levels ( measured via self @-@ directed behaviors ) decrease at the increase of the hierarchical position of individuals within the social group and reconciliation is able to bring stress down to the baseline levels .

 The collared brown lemur was listed as Vulnerable ( VU <unk> ) in the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment . Its greatest threat is habitat loss from slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture and charcoal production . It is also hunted for food and captured for the local pet trade . Populations of the collared brown lemur have been successfully sustained in captivity as a safeguard against their extinction . 
 A small group of collared brown lemurs was introduced in the 1980s into the Berenty Private Reserve and has since hybridized with introduced red @-@ fronted lemurs . 
 = Oceania ( song ) = 
 " Oceania " is a song recorded by Icelandic singer Björk for her sixth studio album Medúlla . It was written and produced by Björk , with additional writing by Sjón and production by Mark Bell . The song was written by the singer specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony , after a request by the International Olympic Committee . " Oceania " was released as a promotional single in 2004 , by One Little Indian Records . The song was written at the ocean 's point of view , from which the singer believes all life emerged , and details the human 's evolution , whilst accompanied by a choir . " Oceania " was generally well received by music critics , who believed it was the best track from Medúlla , although some thought it was not the best choice for a promotional release . 
 The accompanying music video for the song , directed by Lynn Fox , features Björk as " Mother Oceania " , whilst being jewel @-@ encrusted in dark watery depths , with a colourful sunset and swirling floral creatures above her . A remix of the song , featuring additional lyrics and vocals by Kelis on her point of view of the continents , was featured as a B @-@ side to the " Who Is It " single . A piano version also appeared on the DVD single , and was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly . The song was premiered during Björk 's performance on the Summer Olympics ceremony , and was later included on the setlist of the Volta Tour ( 2007 – 08 ) . At the 47th Grammy Awards in 2005 , it was nominated in the category of Best Female Pop Vocal Performance . Cover versions of " Oceania " were done six times , while it was sampled once . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 The International Olympic Committee commissioned a song by Björk specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony . The singer revealed that the committee asked her to do a kind of " Ebony and Ivory " or " We Are the World " type of song , which are " smashing tunes " according to her , but she thought , " ' Maybe there 's another angle to this ' . When I tried to write an Olympic lyric , though , it was full of sports socks and ribbons . I ended up pissing myself laughing " . Then , she called Sjón , an Icelandic poet who had previously collaborated with her on songs such as " Bachelorette " from her fourth studio album Homogenic ( 1997 ) . When she said to him that they would need something " suitably epic " for the Olympics , the poet even took a short course about Greek mythology at Reykjavík University . " Oceania " was the last song recorded for Medúlla . Björk said about the song : " I am incredibly honoured to have been asked to write a song and sing it at the Olympics . The song is written from the point of view of the ocean that surrounds all the land and watches over the humans to see how they are doing after millions of years of evolution . It sees no borders , different races or religion which has always been at the core of these [ games ] " . 
 During an interview with British radio station XFM , Björk explained its recording process , saying work on " Oceania " was kept being delayed because she wanted to do it especially for the Olympics . During the last day of mixing , she thought she needed " <unk> " , like in Greek mythology . She called up an English choir to record these sounds . The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play , and she got them to sing it . Then , she also called up <unk> Shlomo , who was recommended to her as " the new bright hope of the hip hop scene " . He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat , which he did . Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing , she commented , " That was the most fun part , in the end . Sometimes it 's good for you to work with a gun against your head and just go for it , because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas . Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing . " 
 The song was written at the ocean 's point of view , detailing the human 's evolution . According to Jason Killingsworth from Paste magazine , it calls listeners ' attention to " Mother Oceania " from which the singer believes all life emerged , whilst she sings : " You have done well for yourselves / Since you left my wet embrace / And crawled ashore [ … ] " . The song anchors the midsection of Medúlla , " jubilantly punctuated with bubbling synth and propelled by the rolling , spitfire cadence of <unk> 's beatbox " , according to the reviewer . The last line from the song , " Your sweat is salty / And I am why / Your sweat is salty / And I am why " , is about how " we were all little jellyfish or whatever before we made it on to land " , according to the singer . <unk> Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as " frank sensuality " . " Oceania " also features The London Choir . Entertainment Weekly 's writer Chris Willman commented that " the computer @-@ enhanced choir behind Björk [ suggests ] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins . Here she imagines herself as the sea itself , proud of all the <unk> creatures she 's spit out onto land over the last hundred million years . It 's the nearest evolutionists have come to having their own gospel tune " . 
 = = Remixes = = 
 A remix version of " Oceania " featuring additional lyrics and vocals by American singer Kelis was recorded . She explained they were set to perform on Fashion Rocks concert in London the previous year , and their dressing rooms were right next to each other . Björk had an album by Canadian singer Peaches that was skipping , then Kelis gave her the copy of the album she had . They started talking and eventually hung out and exchanged numbers after the show , and later Björk contacted Kelis to work together , which she agreed . Then , Kelis recorded her vocals at Electric Lady Studios in New York City , and wrote her own words in the song , from the point of view of the continents . Originally not intended to be commercially released , the remix leaked after being played on BBC Radio 1 's The <unk> , but was then included on the " Who Is It " single as a B @-@ side . According to The Guardian , " it 's a brilliant fusing together of two distinct voices , Kelis handling the breathy first verse , as layers of her chopped @-@ up vocals form the rhythm track , while Björk at first comes across as restrained , allowing Kelis ' ad @-@ libs to soar before unleashing a song @-@ stopping , wordless roar that heralds the song 's dramatic final coda " . 
 A piano version also appeared on the DVD single , which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly . During an interview he stated , " When Björk asked me to play piano on Oceania , she sent me the music , and it was as complicated and layered as any piece of classical music I 've played . I spent a few days figuring out how to make her vision of ' dueling lounge @-@ lizard pianists ' physically possible , and in the session , we ran through those quickly . Then , she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big , <unk> blocks - as well as the ending , for which we tried diaphanous , Debussy @-@ like arpeggios " . Björk decided to stick with the album 's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices . Before some last @-@ minute polishing by Mark Bell , this version of " Oceania " was the last track to be worked for Medúlla . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Oceania " received generally positive reviews from music critics . Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News called the song " one of those polarizing songs , with its Ethel Merman @-@ like synchronized vocal sweeps that do suggest the aquatic , in a 1950s sort of way " . Entertainment Weekly 's Chris Willman labeled the track as a " strikingly beautiful " song . Alex Ross , reporter writing for The New Yorker stated that with " Oceania " , Björk " confirmed her status as the ultimate musical cosmopolitan " , acquainted with Karlheinz Stockhausen and the Wu @-@ Tang Clan . Matthew Gasteier from Prefix magazine called the track " the best song on the album " , whilst complimenting " its swooping chorus [ which ] recalls the migration of birds or the time @-@ elapsed drifting of icebergs , a swirl of beauty and power crashing down onto and then rising above the mix . It culminates in the near screech that leads into the sexy @-@ spooky coda " . According to Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club , in a positive review , " the electronic flourish strays from her organic vocal focus , but Björk summons the same kind of tingle with choral language " in the song , " which finds The London Choir reacting to what sounds like a thrilling slow @-@ motion circus act " . 
 " Oceania " was " spoilt by some overenthusiastic vocal <unk> " , according to David Hooper from BBC Music . The Guardian 's writer David Peschek said that when the singer sings in the song , " choral swoops [ explodes ] like fireworks behind her " . AllMusic 's Heather Phares noted that the song , along with Medúlla 's lead single " Who Is It " , " have an alien quality that is all the stranger considering that nearly all of their source material is human ( except for the odd keyboard or two ) " . Dominique Leone of Pitchfork thought " Oceania " was hardly the most obvious choice for a promotional single release , despite its " bizarre , swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples " . Jeremy D. Larson from Time magazine provided a mixed review to the song , stating that it was the best Olympic theme song , but during the Olympics performance , " when she sang ' Every pearl is a lynx is a girl ' we think you could hear the world collectively sigh , ' Where 's Celine Dion ? ' " . In 2005 , the song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 47th Grammy Awards but lost out to Norah Jones ' " Sunrise " . 
 = = Music video = = 
 The accompanying music video for " Oceania " was directed by Lynn Fox , and was premiered on August 13 , 2004 through Björk 's official site . According to Lynn Fox , Björk gave the team the initial sketch of the track in January 2004 . Whilst they were doing scribbles for it , they had several phone conversations with the singer and emailed her images to keep her up to date with the progress of the work . For " Oceania " , initial animations took six weeks , then had couple of days preparing for the shoot in Iceland and a few more days after to put all the shots together . Like in the song , in the music video Björk is depicted as " Mother Oceania " . The video opens with the surface of a body of water appearing yellowish and bright . Camera pans down to darker , deeper waters . Björk appears out of the dark background , singing and covered with sparkling jewels . As the second verse begins , images of sea anemones , representing the continents ( her children ) are thrown from Björk 's hands . 
 During the third verse they swim around and away from their mother , carried by the currents , which move in time with the song . In the bridge section , new sea flowers , with brilliant colors , emerge from the background , in contrast to the muted and darker colors of previous scenes . As the fifth verse continues , the camera pans back up to the much lighter surface , not seen since the beginning of the video . All sorts of marine life are swimming about the surface . Shortly after the sixth verse begins , Bjork is shown in deep , dark water . Several seconds later , the lighter surface of the water is shown without her . When she begins to sing " Your sweat is salty " , a somewhat rapid alternation of images ensues : the light surface is shown for one second , followed by Björk singing in the deep water ; these scenes alternate until she stops singing during the coda . Björk 's vocal repetition ceases at the same time the visual alternation stops . The surface scene recedes , and Björk in the deep water comes to the fore , slowing . At the end of the video , she stands and smiles .

 At the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony , where Björk premiered the song , she wore a very large dress which unfolded during her performance of " Oceania " to eventually occupy the entire stadium , and showed a map of the world in sign of union . Additionally , Björk wore " bluish @-@ purple glittery eye shadow across her lids . Her dark hair dangled in tiny twists that framed her <unk> , freckled face " . Immediately after the performance at the Olympics opening ceremony , the song was downloaded more than 11 @,@ 000 times on the iTunes Store . Jake Coyle from Today commented that her dress was " reminiscent in its uniqueness to the infamous swan dress she wore to the Oscars in 2001 " . According to Jeremy D. Larson from Time , if it weren 't for the fireworks at the end of the song , he was legitimately unsure if people in the audience would have cheered . Dominique Leone of Pitchfork was surprised by the committee 's choice of bringing Björk to perform at the ceremony , and stated : " They could have had <unk> say , a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal <unk> but they chose a prickly , decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman . On aesthetic grounds , I can 't argue with their choice , but I continue to wonder about Björk 's significance " . " Oceania " was also performed during the Volta Tour ( 2007 – 08 ) .

 = Effects of Hurricane Floyd in New York = 
 The effects of Hurricane Floyd in New York included two deaths and millions of dollars in damage . Hurricane Floyd , once a large and powerful Category 4 hurricane , made landfall in North Carolina and moved northward along the East Coast , making landfall on Long Island as a tropical storm . The threat of the hurricane prompted schools in New York City to close for the first time since 1996 , and 20 shelters were opened . Floyd produced flooding rainfall and gusty winds throughout the state , from the southern Hudson Valley to the Lake Champlain area . The flood waters damaged multiple roads and forced residents to evacuate from certain locations . Strong winds left as many as 100 @,@ 000 people without power and brought down a high number of trees due to the saturated ground . In the aftermath of the storm , 15 counties in eastern New York were declared eligible for state or federal assistance . 
 = = Background and preparations = = 
 Floyd 's origins are traced back to a westward @-@ moving tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression on September 7 , 1999 , while centered 1 @,@ 000 mi ( 1 @,@ 600 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . The system moved west @-@ northwestward , and intensified into a tropical storm on September 8 . Continuing to intensify , Floyd attained hurricane strength on September 10 . The hurricane ultimately peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale as it struck the Bahamas . The storm turned northwestward and soon northward , brushing the coast of Florida and the southeast United States . On September 16 , Floyd made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane in North Carolina , and moved northeastward along the Eastern Seaboard . It passed through the Mid @-@ Atlantic States as it deteriorated into a tropical storm , and lost its tropical identity over southern Maine . 
 In advance of the storm , starting on September 15 , tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for much of the Eastern Seaboard , including portions of New York . These warnings were discontinued by September 19 . New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged private businesses to close early and ordered non @-@ emergency city workers to return home between 12 pm and 3 pm on September 17 . For the first time since 1996 , in an " almost unprecedented " decision , schools in the city were closed due to the hurricane 's threat . On September 16 , 20 shelters were opened , able to accommodate as many as 70 @,@ 000 people . Lawrence Reuter , president of New York City Transit , reported that in an effort to prevent flooding , storm drains were cleared and other precautions were taken . People were urged to remove loose objects that could be blown around by high winds . By September 16 , city officials had distributed 50 @,@ 000 brochures on preparing for the storm . Suffolk County Executive Robert J. Gaffney advised residents of Fire Island to evacuate before the storm made leaving by ferry impossible , and in Long Beach , officials readied emergency vehicles . Also , 4 @,@ 000 sandbags were given out there in anticipation of high storm tides . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall on western Long Island as it moved northward . The heaviest rainfall associated with the storm was concentrated in the southeastern section of the state . Several meteorological elements worked to enhance the moisture from the cyclone . Rainfall totals exceeding 6 in ( 150 mm ) were common , with as much as 12 in ( 300 mm ) reported locally in the Catskills . At Cairo , 12 @.@ 21 in ( 310 mm ) of rain fell . The precipitation , combined with that of Hurricane Dennis earlier in the month , helped to alleviate persistent drought conditions . Floyd also produced gusty winds , reaching 54 mph ( 87 km / h ) at Stewart International Airport , worsened by a pressure gradient between the storm and an area of high pressure over the Ohio Valley . 
 Floyd 's rainfall resulted in deadly and extensive flooding that killed two people in New York . Heavy flooding was reported along numerous creeks , including the Esopus , Catskill , and Schoharie . In the Albany area , the <unk> rose to extremely high levels , and the resultant flood waters damaged nearby buildings . The <unk> Creek in Selkirk overflowed and forced 20 families to leave their homes . The main rivers typically remained within their banks . Many roads , including U.S. Route 20 in Guilderland , were flooded or washed out , and seven families had to be evacuated along NY 32 in Menands . Further south , the Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed , and caused urban flooding . A dam on a mill pond broke near Lake Placid , leading to flooding along the Chubb River . 
 The strong winds , combined with saturated ground from the rainfall , brought down trees in widespread areas of the Hudson Valley and Capital District . Many of the trees would not have otherwise fallen in drier conditions . Some of the downed trees fell on structures . In a narrow swath in the Wolf Pond Valley of Warren County , where wind gusts are estimated to have reached 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , hundreds of trees were blown down . At the storm 's worst , power outages affected over 100 @,@ 000 people region @-@ wide , and some individuals remained without power for a week . At the Albany International Airport , the storm forced the cancellation of flights , and throughout the region schools were closed . Several boats sustained damage along the shore of Lake Champlain . Throughout Orange , Putnam , Rockland , and Westchester counties , initial cost estimates were $ 14 @.@ 6 million , although that figure represents only a portion of the actual monetary damage . The storm also caused about $ 2 million in property damage in Essex County . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the storm , three New York counties were declared eligible for individual assistance , eight for individual and public assistance , and four for public assistance . The initial deadline to apply for state or federal assistance was set for November 17 , although it was extended a month due to a steady flow of applications . Three disaster recovery centers were opened to provide information to residents affected by the storm . The three centers , located in Rockland , Putnam , and Westchester counties , closed in late October . 
 = Jack Stivetts = 
 John Elmer " Jack " Stivetts ( March 31 , 1868 – April 18 , 1930 ) , was a professional baseball pitcher who played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) spanning from 1889 to 1899 . He played in the American Association ( AA ) with the St. Louis Browns , and in the National League ( NL ) with the Boston Beaneaters and Cleveland Spiders . " Happy Jack " ( nicknamed due to his pleasant demeanor ) was born to German immigrants and raised in Ashland , Pennsylvania . He initially followed his father into the coal mining industry before playing professional baseball . After playing two and half seasons in minor league baseball , he was signed by the Browns . Over the next few seasons , he was regarded as one of the best pitchers in baseball . 
 He led the AA in earned run average ( ERA ) in his first MLB season , and then in strikeouts two seasons later . In the years spanning from 1890 through 1896 , he posted 20 or more victories in a season six times ; two in which he won more than 30 . In 1892 , he won a career @-@ high 35 games , and on August 6 , he threw a no @-@ hitter . During his seven seasons with the Beaneaters , he was part of four NL championships , and pitched alongside future Hall of Fame members John Clarkson and Kid Nichols . He was among the best hitting pitchers of his era , and was often used at other positions when he was not pitching . His season total of seven home runs in 1890 stood as the record for pitchers until 1931 . He compiled a .298 lifetime batting average , hit 35 home runs , and delivered 357 runs batted in ( RBIs ) . 
 In his last season in the major leagues , he played for the Spiders , widely considered to be one of the worst teams in MLB history . After his baseball career , he returned to his hometown of Ashland . He worked for the area coal mines as a brewery wagon driver and carpenter , and died there at 62 years of age . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Elmer Stivetts was born on March 31 , 1868 in Ashland , Pennsylvania . His father , Adam , a coal worker , and mother , Amelia ( née Cooper ) , were both German immigrants . He was raised in a family of Lutherans , receiving his baptism one month after his birth , and his confirmation on April 2 , 1882 at the age of 14 from Christ 's United Lutheran Church in Ashland . He attended public schools for eight years , before following his father in the coal trade . He married Margaret Ann " Maggie " Thomas in June 1896 , and together they had one son , John , and five daughters , Ida , Mary , Leona , Margaret , and Gladys . 
 In June 1897 , at the age of 19 , Stivetts began his professional baseball career with the Ashland representative of the Central Pennsylvania League . He compiled a 9 – 5 win – loss record ( W – L ) that season with a 1 @.@ 35 ERA . He returned to the Ashland team in 1888 , though he later joined the Allentown Peanuts of the Central League . He began the 1889 season with the York representative of the Middle States League . It was there when an umpire named Tim Hurst noticed Stivetts ' talent ; who then recommended him to Charles Comiskey , the manager of the St. Louis Browns of the AA . Comiskey was impressed by the velocity of Stivetts ' pitches , and offered him a contract . The Philadelphia Athletics soon made an offer of their own , but he accepted the Browns ' salary offer of $ 275 a month , with a $ 200 signing bonus .

 When Stivetts joined the Browns , he became their third starting pitcher in the rotation behind Silver King and Ice Box Chamberlain . He made his major league debut on June 26 , 1889 against the Cincinnati Reds . He pitched a complete game and struck out nine batters , but lost the game by the score of 6 – 1 behind several errors made by his teammates . His performance was noted in the press to have " made a good impression . " 
 In his 26 games pitched that season , he had a W – L record of 12 – 7 and had a league @-@ leading 2 @.@ 25 ERA while St. Louis finished two games behind the Brooklyn Bridegrooms for the AA championship . He started 20 games , completed 18 , struck out 143 , and pitched 1912 ⁄ 3 innings . It was reported on November 13 , 1889 that he had re @-@ signed with the Browns for the 1890 season . 
 = = = = 1890 season = = = = 
 During the off @-@ season , an up @-@ start league was created , the Players ' League ( PL ) , which drew many players away from teams from both the AA and NL teams . The Browns lost a few of their best players as well , including Comiskey , their player @-@ manager , and King , the team 's top pitcher . Chamberlain re @-@ signed with the team , but he was sold to the Columbus Solons after pitching in just five games . These movements left Stivetts and Toad Ramsey as the franchise 's top two starters , with rookie Billy Hart cast as the occasional relief starter . 
 The Browns opened the regular season on April 18 with a four @-@ game series on the road versus the Louisville Colonels , and Stivetts started games two and four . In game two , he recorded 13 strikeouts , but lost the game 5 – 3 on a tenth @-@ inning , two run double by Tim <unk> . In game four on April 21 , Stivetts was again credited with the loss by allowing 17 runs to score , seven of which were earned . He fared better in his third start however , allowing just one run as the Browns defeated the Solons by a 14 – 1 score . He struck out 12 batters , including the first seven he faced , and hit the first home run of his career . 
 On June 10 , against Fred Smith and the Toledo <unk> , he hit two home runs in one game , the first of three times in his career he accomplished the feat . The first was a two @-@ run home run in the fifth inning , and the second came with his team down by three runs in the bottom half of ninth inning and the bases loaded . It was the first , and only , grand slam of his career , and the second " ultimate grand slam " in history . In a game versus the Brooklyn Gladiators on July 6 , manager Chris von der Ahe removed the Browns ' starting pitcher Ramsey in the third inning and replaced him with Stivetts . Though the crowd momentarily interrupted the game in protest , the move proved successful . Stivetts hit a home run in the fifth inning to give the Browns a 3 runs to 1 advantage , leading the team to an eventual 7 – 2 victory . The home run was his sixth of the season , and he added another on August 9 for number seven : his final season total . His seven home runs in a season by a pitcher was neither broken nor tied until 1931 , when Wes Ferrell hit nine for the Cleveland Indians . St. Louis finished in third @-@ place among the nine AA teams , 12 games behind the Colonels . Stivetts had a W – L record of 27 – 21 , a 3 @.@ 52 ERA , and 289 strikeouts in 4191 ⁄ 3 innings pitched , along with three shutouts .

 On January 25 , 1891 , it was reported that he had re @-@ signed with the Browns for the up @-@ coming season . The season opened April 8 , and the Browns faced the Cincinnati Kelly 's Killers at home . Stivetts was the team 's opening day starting pitcher . The game ended in the bottom of ninth inning when the umpire , former player and St. Louis native Bill Gleason , determined that Cincinnati was intentionally allowing St. Louis to score in an effort to delay the game . St. Louis was awarded the forfeit when Cincinnati refused to play . AA president , Louis Kramer , declared the forfeit illegal a short time later , and the game was re @-@ played on April 12 . St. Louis won the re @-@ match behind the pitching of Stivetts . This was Gleason 's second and last career game as an umpire . Over the course of the season , Stivetts was the Browns ' ace , pitching mostly every second or third game the team played . When not pitching , or when he occasionally played in right field , the Browns used Joe Neale , Willie McGill , and future Hall of Fame executive Clark Griffith as part of the starting rotation . On May 30 , Stivetts started both games of a doubleheader in a home series versus the Philadelphia Athletics . Due to large leads by the Browns , he was pulled from each game ; lasting two innings in the first and six in the second . 
 Stivetts won each of his next three starts , hitting a home run in the third game , on June 6 , against the Boston Reds . He hit two more in a game on August 6 , against Gus Weyhing of the Athletics , the second two @-@ homer game of his career . He connected for another off of Weyhing in a game on September 16 , during a four @-@ run ninth inning that gave the Browns a 10 – 7 victory . This was his seventh home run of the season , fourth as a pitcher , adding to three that he hit while playing right field . Again , he was among the best pitchers in the AA , and among the league leaders in many pitching categories . His 259 strikeouts led the league , while his 33 victories were third , and his 2 @.@ 86 ERA ranked fifth . St. Louis completed the season second in the AA among the nine teams , 8 @.@ 5 games behind the champion Reds .

 Though Stivetts initially denied it , it was reported on September 28 , 1891 that he signed with the Boston Beaneaters of the National League ( NL ) for the 1892 season . Stivetts joined a pitching rotation that already included future Baseball Hall of Fame members John Clarkson and Kid Nichols , as well as veteran Harry Staley . With Boston 's solid pitching staff , and their potent mix of position players consisting of future Hall of Fame members and established veterans , the team was expected to compete for a second consecutive NL championship . When analyzing the 12 National League teams , New York Giants captain , Buck Ewing , remarked about Boston 's roster , " I think Clarkson has seen his better days . Jack Stivetts will strengthen them wonderfully . He is one of the best pitchers in the country to @-@ day . " In Stivetts ' first start of the season on April 23 , his pitching was described as " wild " , as he issued six bases on balls . He prevailed , however , and Boston won by the score of 11 – 7 . Four days later , he was victorious again , and Boston 's W – L record stood at 10 – 1 after their first 11 games . On June 23 , he hit his first home run of the season , along with a double , in a 13 – 6 victory over the Baltimore Orioles . The Pittsburg Dispatch reported on July 1 that Stivetts was leading Boston hitters in batting at that point in the season . 
 With Stivetts now established , Clarkson became expendable and was released from the team on June 30 , leaving Boston with a solid three @-@ man pitching rotation for the remainder of the season . On August 6 , 1892 , Stivetts pitched a no @-@ hitter against the Brooklyn Bridegrooms , an 11 – 0 victory . Later , on September 5 , he started , completed , and defeated Louisville in both games of a doubleheader . The following day , the press credited the victories to his ability to work well with runners on the bases . The regular season for the Beaneaters closed on October 15 with a doubleheader against the Washington Senators . Stivetts pitched the second game , and delivered a complete game shutout , his third shutout of the season , and his 35th victory . Although he finished within the top @-@ ten in several pitching statistical categories , his strikeout total dropped to 180 in 1892 . His 3 @.@ 9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched ( K / 9 ) was significantly lower from the 5 @.@ 3 the previous season . 
 The AA had dissolved following the 1891 season , with several teams merging with the NL , re @-@ establishing itself as the lone " major league " . The NL devised a post @-@ season series to determine a champion between the two half @-@ season victors . This series pitted the Beaneaters ( the first @-@ half champions ) against the Cleveland Spiders ( the second @-@ half champions ) . The first game occurred on October 17 ; Stivetts started for Boston , and future Hall of Famer Cy Young pitched for Cleveland . The pitching duel lasted eleven scoreless innings before the game was brought to end by darkness . After Boston won game two behind Staley on October 18 , Stivetts started and gained the victory in the game on October 19 . The Beaneaters were declared the NL champion after winning five straight after the opening tie game ; Stivetts gained victories in three . This playoff scheme was abandoned after the season .

 On January 21 , 1893 , it was reported that Stivetts re @-@ signed with Boston for the up @-@ coming season . In March , Stivetts ' name was tied to an " imminent " trade between Boston and Brooklyn that involved pitcher Tom Lovett transferring to Boston . Ultimately , the deal did not transpire , however , and each pitcher reported to their respective teams . Several rule changes were implemented before the 1893 season that intended to even the competitive balance between the pitchers and hitters . One lengthened the distance between the pitching mound and home plate from 50 feet to 60 feet 6 inches , and another required pitchers were to pitch from a rubber slab instead of being allowed to take a running start before they delivered the ball to the batter . 
 Stivetts struggled with the new distance initially ; his first four starts of the season were largely ineffective . On April 29 , with the weather cold and rainy , he issued bases on balls to ten New York Giants batters , and surrendered 15 runs . The next two starts were against Baltimore and he allowed seven runs to score the first game despite gaining the victory , and another 16 runs in a loss in the second game . Another ten runs scored on May 10 , in a loss versus the Washington Senators . 
 His troubles adjusting to the new rules , and his athletic conditioning during June and July , prompted the team to sign Hank <unk> for added pitching strength . He struck out just 61 batters in <unk> ⁄ 3 for a 1 @.@ 6 K / 9 , and his ERA increased from 3 @.@ 03 in 1892 to 4 @.@ 41 . Despite this , he helped Boston claim their third consecutive NL championship with a 20 – 12 W – L record . 
 = = = = 1894 season = = = = 
 With the previous season 's inconsistencies behind him , Stivetts was re @-@ signed and was the team 's starting pitcher for Boston 's season @-@ opening game on April 19 ; a 13 – 2 victory versus the Bridegrooms of Brooklyn . He then lost his next eight starts , however , before beginning a ten @-@ game winning streak that lasted into mid @-@ July . On August 21 , he started and gained complete game victories in both ends of a doubleheader versus the Cincinnati Reds . Two days later , on August 23 , he pitched Boston to a 12 – 10 victory against the Spiders . That same day in Ashland , his father was killed in a coal mining accident when a load of coal fell on top on him . 
 Boston finished in third place among the 12 NL teams in 1894 , and Stivetts won 26 games , though most of his numbers in important statistical categories failed to improve or became worse . His ERA rose to 4 @.@ 90 , and his K / 9 moved up slightly to 2 @.@ 0 when he struck out 76 in 338 innings pitched . He issued 127 bases on balls , and surrendered a league @-@ leading 27 home runs . His biggest success in 1894 was his skill as a hitter . Beginning on July 5 , Boston played a three @-@ game series against Cleveland . While alternating game to game from pitching and playing in right field , Stivetts hit one home run in each game , the last one coming in the sixth inning off of Cy Young , completing the sweep . He hit a career @-@ high season total of eight home runs . He also achieved career @-@ highs with 64 RBIs , seven triples , and 55 runs scored , while batting .328 in 68 games played . 
 = = = = 1895 season = = = = 
 In early November , due to the threat that a new American Association was near formation , the National League clubs were quick to sign their players without much negotiating . Many of the players ' salary demands were met , including Stivetts ' . In March , shortly before the 1895 season began , Stivetts claimed he was in " excellent <unk> condition " , and that he was " many pounds lighter than he was at this period last year . " The season opener was on April 19 against Brooklyn , and Stivetts got the start over Nichols for the second consecutive season . Despite being down early in the game , Boston won the game 11 – 6 behind a seven @-@ run seventh inning . Stivetts scored thrice and gathered two hits in the game , including a double . 
 During the 1893 season , Stivetts involved himself in a dispute between two catholic players , Tommy Tucker and Hugh Duffy , and their manager Frank Selee . The resulting rift occasionally caused strife among team members . Factions formed , with Duffy , Tucker , and Tommy McCarthy on one side ; Herman Long , Bobby Lowe , and Stivetts on the other . These disagreements , in part , led to an incident in a Louisville , Kentucky hotel dining room between Stivetts and McCarthy . In response to something Stivetts had said , McCarthy retaliated by punching him once in the face and then calmly left the restaurant . 
 His W – L record slid to 17 – 17 , while his ERA improved slightly to 4 @.@ 64 in 291 innings pitched , as Boston fell to fifth place , 16 @.@ 5 games behind the NL champions from Baltimore . His hitting suffered as well ; his batting average dropped to a career @-@ low .190 , and he failed to hit a home run for the first time since his rookie season . Shortly after Boston completed its schedule , Stivetts re @-@ signed for the 1896 season . 
 = = = = 1896 season = = = = 
 During the off @-@ season , trade talks were conducted , but not completed , between the Beaneaters and the Philadelphia Quakers . The deal likely involved Stivetts and Tucker , two players involved in Boston 's religious quarrel from the previous season . As the season progressed , the press noted that his season had begun better than the previous season . Stivetts claimed that it was his weight loss ( now just over 200 lbs ) , that was the main reason why he had been more of an asset to the team than in past years . 
 Though he lost his first start of season , he rebounded to win six starts in succession from April 25 though May 20 , including a 7 – 0 shutout victory on May 8 versus Louisville . On June 12 , he pitched Boston to a 15 – 3 victory over the Reds at home , and connected for two home runs against Chauncey Fisher . This was the third , and last , time he hit two home runs in a single game . He hit three home runs total for the season and improved his batting average to .347 in 222 at bats . He increased his win total to 22 , and his 4 @.@ 10 ERA was the lowest since 1892 . 
 On October 3 , it was reported that he was retained by Boston under the reserve clause . When interviewed during the off @-@ season , Stivetts claimed that he would like to quit pitching and play first , that is if a team would give him the opportunity . Selee , Boston 's manager , disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts in the pitching rotation instead . It was also likely that he would have received less salary playing at first . 
 = = = = 1897 season = = = = 
 Boston re @-@ signed Stivetts for $ 2 @,@ 100 despite the view of some in the press who believed Boston would continue to sink in the standings if they didn 't rid themselves of him and the team 's manager . Shortly after Stivetts ' first start of the season , a 10 – 5 loss on April 23 in Baltimore , Selee commented that Stivetts will not be pitching much into the future , saying that " he is growing rather stiff , and will not let himself out as he did when he was at his best , some years ago . " His weight was now at 217 lbs , so as the team departed on May 10 for a western road trip , Selee sent him back to Ashland to get back into proper game condition . Although he was told not to report back to the team until his weight was below 200 lbs , he had re @-@ joined the team and played right field in the second game of a doubleheader on May 15 . His place in the rotation fell behind Nichols , Fred Klobedanz , and Ted Lewis . He made a relief appearance on May 18 , before having to take some time off for a sore arm . His next start occurred on May 31 , when Boston defeated St. Louis by a 25 – 5 score . He earned his second consecutive victory on June 11 , a 12 – 4 win over Louisville . 
 While he only pitched 129 1 / 3 innings in 18 games during the season , he fared well , and helped Boston re @-@ claim the NL championship , with an 11 – 4 W – L record , and 3 @.@ 41 ERA . As a hitter , he continued to flourish , with a .367 batting average , hit a career @-@ high nine triples , and added two more home runs . At the conclusion of the regular season , Boston faced the second place Orioles in a post @-@ season series , the Temple Cup . Created after the 1893 season by Pittsburgh Pirates owner William Chase Temple , the winner of the best @-@ of @-@ seven game <unk> was awarded possession of a silver ornate cup , and 65 % of the proceeds to be distributed to the players . Boston players were fatigued by their championship run , especially their games against second @-@ place Baltimore , and now were facing the Orioles again , in the Temple Cup . Because of the fatigue , and an agreed upon even @-@ split of the proceeds , the series was played without much enthusiasm from either team . Boston won game one , but then lost the next four games , giving Baltimore the cup . Stivetts pitched in game four , losing 12 – 11 to Jerry <unk> . Due to McCarthy 's sloppy play in center field throughout the series , he was benched in the final game in favor of Stivetts . After four seasons , the series lacked popular support and was discontinued . 
 = = = = 1898 season = = = = 
 Stivetts was again reserved by Boston , and later re @-@ signed for $ 2000 . Due to the Beaneaters ' solid , four @-@ man starting pitching rotation of Nichols , Klobedanz , Lewis , and rookie Vic Willis , his role with the team was expected to be as an extra outfielder . Stivetts claimed that he had never felt better in his life and his outlook on the up @-@ coming season was positive . 
 In a game versus the Reds on June 9 , the score was tied 5 – 5 in the bottom of the ninth inning when Stivetts connected for a pinch @-@ hit , walk @-@ off solo home run . This was his second career walk off home run , his third as a pinch hitter , and the last home run of his career . It was reported on July 22 that a deal had been agreed upon to trade Stivetts to the St. Louis Browns of the NL for Kid Carsey and cash . The deal was contingent upon the acceptance of Stivetts . In early August , the Boston manager Selee sent Stivetts home , commenting that the team did not have use of his services any longer . Tim Hurst , now managing St. Louis , planned on using Stivetts in center field . Stivetts refused to accept the move to St. Louis , and a sale was officially conducted on August 14 that sent him to St. Louis for $ 2000 and an unnamed player . True to his word , Stivetts did not report , or play a single game for St. Louis that season . Due to his objection to being sold to St. Louis , he claimed that he would remain in Ashland and return to coal mining . 
 = = = St. Louis / Cleveland = = = 
 = = = = 1899 season = = = = 
 During the off @-@ season , the owners of the Cleveland Spiders purchased the St. Louis Browns from Chris von der Ahe . They changed the team name to Perfectos , and inherited their players . In early 1899 , Stivetts claimed interest in playing for the St. Louis franchise if his salary were equal to what he was paid with Boston . The new owners , to maximize their assets , transferred all the best players to St. Louis , while sending the rest , including Stivetts , to Cleveland . The Spiders released Stivetts on June 13 , and he subsequently retired from playing baseball . In 18 games for the Spiders , Stivetts had a .205 batting average and a 0 – 4 W – L record . He was claimed by St. Paul of the Western League a few days later , but did not play a game for the team . In his 11 @-@ season career , Stivetts won 203 games against 132 losses , a 3 @.@ 74 ERA , and 1223 strikeouts in <unk> ⁄ 3 innings pitched . In addition to his 35 career home runs as a hitter , he collected 593 hits in 1992 at bats for a .298 batting average , and had 357 RBIs . 
 = = Post @-@ baseball / Legacy = = 
 After his retirement from professional baseball , he worked for the coal industry in various capacities . He was listed as a carpenter in both the 1910 and 1920 Federal Census . He operated a brewery wagon for a coal company in his hometown of Ashland . In April 1912 , he was working as a carpenter for the Black Ridge mine in Conyngham , Pennsylvania . He occasionally played on small clubs around the Ashland area , and in May 1902 , he survived a bout of smallpox . By 1930 , he was no longer working . He died on April 18 , 1930 , at the age of 62 in Ashland , and is interred at Brock Cemetery . 
 He was described by sportswriters of the time as one of the fastest pitchers in the league , comparable to Amos Rusie and Ted Breitenstein . Kid Nichols remarked in 1902 that Stivetts ' speed was as fast as Rusie , and could have extended his career much longer had he taken better care of his body . Baseball writer O. P. Caylor wrote that Stivetts ' issues were entirely his own , blaming his hard @-@ drinking lifestyle and his inability to remain in good condition . 
 = Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia = 
 Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia ( i.e. , the federal parliament ) from making laws for establishing any religion , imposing any religious observance , or prohibiting the free exercise of any religion . Section 116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth . The product of a compromise in the pre @-@ Federation constitutional conventions , Section 116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution . However , Section 116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart , and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws . 
 Section 116 has been interpreted narrowly by the High Court of Australia : while the definition of " religion " adopted by the court is broad and flexible , the scope of the protection of religions is circumscribed . The result of the court 's approach has been that no court has ever ruled a law to be in contravention of Section 116 , and the provision has played only a minor role in Australian constitutional history . Among the laws that the High Court has ruled not to be in contravention of Section 116 are laws that provided government funding to religious schools , that authorised the dissolution of a branch of the Jehovah 's Witnesses , and that enabled the forcible removal of Indigenous Australian children from their families . 
 Federal Governments have twice proposed the amendment of Section 116 , principally to apply its provisions to laws made by the states . On each occasion — in 1944 and 1988 — the proposal failed in a referendum . 
 = = Text of the provision and location in the Constitution = = 
 Section 116 states : 
 The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion , or for imposing any religious observance , or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion , and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth . 
 Section 116 has four limbs . The first three limbs prohibit the Commonwealth from making certain laws : laws " for establishing any religion " ; laws " for imposing any religious observance " ; and laws " for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion " . The fourth limb proscribes the imposition of religious tests to qualify for any Commonwealth office or public trust . Only the " establishing religion " and " prohibiting free exercise " limbs have been the subject of cases before the High Court . 
 The section sits in Chapter V of the Constitution , which deals with the states of Australia . However , Section 116 does not apply to the states . Each state has its own constitution , and only Tasmania 's has a provision similar to Section 116 . Commentators attribute the erroneous location of Section 116 to a drafting oversight caused by the weariness of the committee charged with finalising the draft Constitution . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The Constitution was the product of a series of constitutional conventions in the 1890s . The issues of religious freedom and secularism were not prominent in the convention debates , which focused on the economic and legislative powers of the proposed Commonwealth parliament . The first draft of Section 116 , approved by the Melbourne Convention of 1891 , would have prohibited the states from passing laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion . The Commonwealth was not mentioned because it was assumed that the Commonwealth parliament would have no power to make such laws . At the Melbourne Convention of 1897 , Victorian delegate H. B. Higgins expressed concern about this assumption and moved to expand the provision to cover the Commonwealth as well as the states . The amendment was initially defeated , but Higgins later succeeded in having the eventual version of Section 116 adopted by the convention in a 25 – 16 vote . Higgins feared opposition to the provision from convention delegates concerned that the provision would impede the states ' legislative powers , so the version passed by the convention did not mention the states . 
 The proposed inclusion of Section 116 in the Constitution was the subject of some dissent in the 1897 Melbourne Convention and the final convention in 1898 . Protestant churches in New South Wales argued that the Constitution should state that divine providence is the " ultimate source of law " , while convention delegates John Quick and Patrick Glynn moved to have God explicitly recognised in the Constitution . The Seventh @-@ day Adventist Church campaigned for a strict separation of church and state , being concerned that the Commonwealth might prohibit its members from working on Sundays . Both sides to some extent achieved their objectives : Section 116 was approved by the final convention , while Glynn successfully moved for the symbolic mention of " Almighty God " in the preamble to the British statute that was to contain the Constitution . The Constitution was then approved by popular referendums in each of the six colonies and took effect on 1 January 1901 ( the colonies thus became the states of Australia ) . 
 Section 116 reflects two provisions of the United States Constitution : the First Amendment , which prohibits the making of laws for the establishment of religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion ; and Article VI , Section 3 , which prohibits the imposition of religious tests for public offices . Academic Clifford L. Pannam , writing in 1963 , called Section 116 a " fairly blatant piece of transcription " of its US counterparts . However , in practice , Section 116 has been interpreted more narrowly than the US provisions . 
 = = Judicial consideration = = 
 The High Court 's consideration of Section 116 has generally been limited to three areas : the definition of " religion " ; the meaning of " law for establishing any religion " ; and the meaning of " law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion " . The two other elements of the provision — the clauses prohibiting the Commonwealth from imposing of religious observance and from prescribing religious tests for public offices — have not been the subject of any cases before the court . The court has never ruled a legislative provision to be in contravention of Section 116 . As a result of the court 's narrow and literal interpretation of Section 116 , the provision has played a minor role in Australian constitutional history . 
 = = = Meaning of " religion " = = = 
 A threshold test considered by courts applying Section 116 is whether a belief seeking constitutional protection is a " religion " . The leading authority on the question is the 1983 judgment of the High Court in Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay @-@ Roll Tax ( Vic ) . The court found that Scientology was a religion , despite some justices commenting that its practices were " <unk> obscure " . In reaching this finding , the court argued that the definition of religion needed to be flexible but should recognise the need to be sceptical of <unk> claims of religious practice . Justices Anthony Mason and Gerard Brennan held : 
 ... the criteria of religion [ are ] twofold : first , belief in a supernatural , Being , Thing or Principle ; and second , the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief . 
 Justices Ronald Wilson and William Deane were less prescriptive , setting out five " indicia " of a religion : a belief in the supernatural ; a belief in ideas relating to " man 's nature and place in the universe " ; the adherence to particular standards , codes of conduct or practices by those who hold the ideas ; the existence of an identifiable group of believers , even if not a formal organisation ; and the opinion of the believers that what they believe in constitutes a religion . 
 = = = " Establishing any religion " = = = 
 The courts have taken a narrow approach to the interpretation of the prohibition against " establishing any religion " , deriving from the 1981 case of Attorney @-@ General ( Vic ) ( Ex rel Black ) v Commonwealth ( the <unk> case ) , in which the High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not contravene Section 116 . Chief Justice Garfield Barwick held that a law would only contravene the provision if establishing a religion was its " express and single purpose " , while Justice Harry Gibbs argued that the section only prohibits the establishment of an official state religion . Each justice in the majority contrasted Section 116 with its equivalent in the US Constitution to find that Section 116 is narrower . The court noted that the US Constitution prohibits laws respecting " establishment of religion " generally , whereas the prohibition in Section 116 is against the establishment of " any religion " : this meant that Section 116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally ; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion . The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of Section 116 thus largely reflects the views expressed by Constitutional scholars John Quick and Robert Garran in 1901 , that establishment means " the erection and recognition of a State Church , or the concession of special favours , titles , and advantages to one church which are denied to others . " 
 = = = " Prohibiting the free exercise of any religion " = = = 
 The protection of the free exercise of religion was also interpreted narrowly in early High Court judgments . In 1912 , the court in <unk> v Williams held that a person could not object to compulsory military service on the ground of religious belief . The court considered that Section 116 would only protect religious observance from government interference ; it would not permit a person to be excused from a legal obligation merely because the obligation conflicted with his or her religious beliefs . In a 1929 case , Higgins , then a Justice of the High Court , suggested ( as obiter dictum ) that a person could lawfully object to compulsory voting on the grounds of religious belief . However , in 1943 , the court continued the narrow approach it took in <unk> v Williams , upholding war @-@ time regulations that caused the Adelaide branch of the Jehovah 's Witnesses to be dissolved and have its property acquired by the Commonwealth government . The government had declared the branch to be an organisation whose activities were " prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth " : one of the branch 's professed beliefs was that the government was an " organ of Satan " . Chief Justice John Latham held that the Constitution permitted the court to " reconcile religious freedom with ordered government " . 
 In a 1997 case known as the Stolen Generations Case , the court upheld an ordinance issued in 1918 that enabled the forcible removal of Indigenous Australian children from their families . The court reasoned that the purpose of the ordinance was not to prohibit the free exercise of religion even though the ordinance may have had that effect . Peter Edge , an academic specialising in religion and the law , thus concludes that Section 116 will only " prevent legislation that has a prohibited purpose , rather than a prohibited effect " . Delivering her judgment , Justice Mary Gaudron denied that the provision confers rights upon individuals , commenting that it : 
 ... does no more than effect a restriction or limitation on the legislative power of the Commonwealth . It is not , ' in form , a constitutional guarantee of the rights of individuals ' ... It makes no sense to speak of a constitutional right to religious freedom in a context in which the Constitution clearly postulates that the States may enact laws in derogation of that right . 
 = = Commentary = = 
 When the Constitution took effect in 1901 , Quick and Garran argued that Section 116 was redundant as the Commonwealth had not been given the legislative power under Section 51 to establish a religion or prohibit its free exercise . In 1963 , Pannam wrote that the provision was regarded " by all as having little practical value " . Pannam considered the provision would only become significant if the High Court held that it applied to laws made by governments of the territories . 
 Contemporary constitutional scholar George Williams criticises the court 's literal interpretation of the provision and others in the Constitution , saying the court has " transformed the Constitution into a wasteland of civil liberties " . Williams argues that as an " express guarantee of personal freedom " , the provision should be interpreted broadly and promote " individual liberty over the arbitrary exercise of legislative and executive power " . Academics Gonzalo Villalta Puig and Steven Tudor have called for the court to broaden Section 116 by finding in it an implied right to the freedom of thought and conscience . In their view most Australians correctly " believe that the Constitution protects the right to freedom of thought and conscience just like it protects other civil and political freedoms " , and that the court should give effect to that belief . They argue there is precedent for the court finding implied constitutional rights , such as the 1992 case of Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth , where the court found that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of political communication . 
 In defence of Section 116 and the High Court 's interpretation of it , Joshua Puls argues that the provision is appropriately limited , suggesting that a rigid " wall of separation " between religion and the state is undesirable , and that the stronger Constitutional protection of religion in the United States has become overly politicised . Fellow academics Jennifer Clarke , Patrick Keyzer and James <unk> argue that the court 's narrow interpretation of the provision is consistent with the intention of the Constitution 's drafters , who never intended for it to be a protection of individual rights , while Kevin Booker and Arthur Glass say the provision has " symbolic value " . Booker and Glass defend the court 's interpretation of the provision and other Constitutional rights , saying " the High Court can only work with the constitutional provisions before it " . 
 = = Referendums = = 
 Federal governments have twice proposed referendums to expand the scope of Section 116 : in 1944 and in 1988 . In 1944 , John Curtin 's Labor government put a package of measures , known as the " Fourteen Powers referendum " , to the Australian public . The purpose of the package was mainly to widen the Commonwealth 's legislative powers for the purposes of post @-@ war reconstruction . The widening of powers would sunset after five years . One of the measures in the package was to extend Section 116 so that it prohibited the states , not merely the Commonwealth , from making the laws proscribed by the section . The package 's 14 measures — which included diverse matters such as powers to provide family allowances and legislate for " national health " — were bound together in a single question . H. V. Evatt , the Labor Attorney @-@ General , argued that freedom of religion was " fundamental to the whole idea of democracy " and that the suppression of civil rights by dictatorships in Europe demonstrated the need for Australia to have a strong Constitutional guarantee of the freedom . The conservative Coalition , then in opposition and led by Robert Menzies , campaigned against the package . Arthur Fadden , leader of the Country Party ( the junior member of the Coalition ) , claimed a " yes " vote would permit the government to implement a " policy of socialisation " . The package was rejected : the national " yes " vote was less than 46 per cent , and there was majority support for the package only in South Australia and Western Australia . One reason for the rejection was the bundling of multiple controversial proposals into one question : voters could not vote in favour of the measures they supported and against those they opposed , giving them reason to vote against the entire package . 
 A similar proposal to amend Section 116 was put to the Australian people in a referendum in 1988 . The referendum contained four questions , the last of which sought to amend Section 116 and other constitutional " rights and freedoms " . Again , the proposal was initiated by a Labor government ( under Bob Hawke ) ; again , the proposal was opposed by the Coalition ; and again , multiple controversial proposals were bound into one question , being " to alter the Constitution to extend the right to trial by jury , to extend freedom of religion , and to ensure fair terms for persons whose property is acquired by any government . " The proposal in respect of Section 116 was to extend its operation to the states , and expand the protection to cover any government act ( not just legislation ) that established a religion or prohibited its free exercise . Some church officials objected to the proposal , fearing that funding of religious schools by the states could become unlawful . The question failed to pass , being opposed by a majority of voters in each of the states . The 70 to 30 per cent nationwide vote against the proposal was the largest margin by which a proposal to amend the Constitution had ever been defeated at a referendum . Williams attributes the failure of the proposal mainly to the absence of bipartisan support for it , highlighting the " determined and effective " opposition of senior Coalition politician Peter Reith . Williams also points to the " notorious reluctance " of Australians to support Constitutional referendums : of the 44 proposals to amend the Constitution , only eight have succeeded .

 = Appalachian Trail = 
 The Appalachian National Scenic Trail , generally known as the Appalachian Trail or simply the A.T. , is a marked hiking trail in the eastern United States extending between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine . The trail is about 2 @,@ 200 miles ( 3 @,@ 500 km ) long , though the precise length changes over time as parts are modified or rerouted . The trail passes through the states of Georgia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Virginia , West Virginia , Maryland , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York , Connecticut , Massachusetts , Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine . 
 The Appalachian Trail was completed in 1937 after more than a decade of work , although improvements and changes continue . It is maintained by 31 trail clubs and multiple partnerships , and managed by the National Park Service , United States Forest Service , and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy . The majority of the trail is in forest or wild lands , although some portions traverse towns , roads and farms . The trail conservancy claims that the Appalachian Trail is the longest hiking @-@ only trail in the world . 
 At least 2 million people are said to do at least one day @-@ hike on the trail each year . Thru @-@ hikers attempt to hike it in its entirety in a single season — more than 2 @,@ 700 people thru @-@ hiked the trail in 2014 — and some hike from one end to the other , then turn around and thru @-@ hike the trail the other way , known as a " yo @-@ yo " . Many books , memoirs , web sites , and fan organizations are dedicated to these pursuits . 
 An extension known as the International Appalachian Trail continues northeast , crossing Maine and cutting through Canada to Newfoundland , with sections continuing in Greenland , through Europe , and into Morocco . Other separate extensions continue the southern end of the Appalachian range in Alabama and continue south into Florida , creating what is known as the Eastern Continental Trail . 
 The Appalachian Trail , the Continental Divide Trail , and the Pacific Crest Trail form what is known as the Triple Crown of long – distance hiking in the United States . 
 = = History = = 
 The trail was conceived by Benton MacKaye , a forester who wrote his original plan — called “ An Appalachian Trail , A Project in Regional Planning ” — shortly after the death of his wife in 1921 . MacKaye 's idea detailed a grand trail that would connect a series of farms and wilderness work / study camps for city @-@ dwellers . In 1922 , at the suggestion of Major William A. Welch , director of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission , his idea was publicized by Raymond H. Torrey with a story in the New York Evening Post under a full @-@ page banner headline reading " A Great Trail from Maine to Georgia ! " The idea was quickly adopted by the new Palisades Interstate Park Trail Conference as their main project . 
 On October 7 , 1923 , the first section of the trail , from Bear Mountain west through Harriman State Park to Arden , New York , was opened . MacKaye then called for a two @-@ day Appalachian Trail conference to be held in March 1925 in Washington , D.C. This meeting inspired the formation of the Appalachian Trail Conference ( now called the Appalachian Trail Conservancy ) . 
 A retired judge named Arthur Perkins and his younger associate Myron Avery took up the cause . In 1929 , Perkins , who was also a member of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association and its Blue Blazed Trails committee , found Ned Anderson , a farmer in Sherman , Connecticut , who took on the task of mapping and blazing the Connecticut leg of the trail ( 1929 – 1933 ) . It ran from Dog Tail Corners in Webatuck , New York , which borders Kent , Connecticut , at Ashley Falls , 50 miles ( 80 km ) through the northwest corner of the state , up to Bear Mountain at the Massachusetts border . ( A portion of the Connecticut trail has since been rerouted ( 1979 – 1983 ) to be more scenic , adhering less to highways and more to wilderness , and includes a Ned K. Anderson Memorial Bridge . ) 
 Anderson 's efforts helped spark renewed interest in the trail , and Avery ( who led the charge after Perkins ’ death in 1932 ) was able to bring other states on board . Upon taking over the ATC , Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail . He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC 's response to a major commercial development along the trail 's path ; MacKaye left the organization , while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail . Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 ( he died that same year ) . 
 Avery became the first to walk the trail end @-@ to @-@ end , though not as a thru @-@ hike , in 1936 . In August 1937 , the trail was completed to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine , and the ATC shifted its focus toward protecting the trail lands and mapping the trail for hikers . 
 In 1948 , Earl Shaffer of York , Pennsylvania , brought a great deal of attention to the project by completing the first documented thru @-@ hike . Shaffer later completed the first north @-@ to @-@ south thru @-@ hike , making him the first to do so in each direction . In 1998 , Shaffer , nearly 80 years old , again hiked the entirety of the trail , making him the oldest person to complete a thru @-@ hike . 
 In 1994 , a story appeared in the Appalachian Trailway News describing a 121 @-@ day Maine to Georgia thru @-@ hike in 1936 by six Boy Scouts from the Bronx . Although the story has been accepted by some members of <unk> , a great deal of doubt has also been expressed and this earlier thru @-@ hike has never been verified . Shaffer 's 1948 journey is still generally recognized as the first A.T. thru @-@ hike . 
 In the 1960s , the ATC made progress toward protecting the trail from development , thanks to efforts of politicians and officials . The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and paved the way for a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems . Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail , and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked ( though minor changes continue to this day ) . By the close of the 20th century , the Park Service had completed the purchase of all but a few miles of the trail 's span . 
 = = Extensions = = 
 The International Appalachian Trail is a 1 @,@ 900 @-@ mile ( 3 @,@ 100 km ) extension running northeast from Maine into New Brunswick and Quebec 's Gaspé Peninsula , where it ends at <unk> National Park . It is a separate trail and not an official extension of the Appalachian Trail . Other branches are designated in parts of Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island , and along the western shore of Newfoundland , to the northern end of the Appalachian Mountain range , where it enters the Atlantic Ocean , near L 'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site . The route has since been extended to Greenland , Europe , and Morocco . 
 Although the Appalachian Trail ends in Georgia , the Appalachian Mountains continue south to Flagg Mountain in Alabama . In 2008 , the Pinhoti National Recreation Trail in Alabama and Georgia , which terminates at Flagg Mountain , was connected to the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail via the Benton MacKaye Trail . Promoters of the Southern extension refer to MacKaye 's statement at the 1925 conference that the Georgia to New Hampshire trail should , in the future , extend to Katahdin , and " then to Birmingham , Alabama " . As of March 2015 , The Pinhoti Trail terminates at the base of Flagg Mountain , near <unk> in Coosa County , 50 miles ( 80 km ) east of Birmingham . In 2010 , the Alabama state legislature formed the Alabama Appalachian Mountain Trail Commission to provide state resources for trail improvements , although officially designating Pinhoti as part of the Appalachian Trail would require an act of the United States Congress . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The Appalachian Trail is home to thousands of species of plants and animals , including 2 @,@ 000 rare , threatened , endangered , and sensitive plant and animal species . 
 = = = Animals = = = 
 The American black bear ( Ursus americanus ) , among the largest animals along the Appalachian Trail , rarely confronts people . The black bear is the largest omnivore that may be encountered on the trail , and it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians . Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon , except in certain sections , especially Shenandoah National Park and portions of New Jersey , New York , Connecticut , and Massachusetts sections , where bear populations have increased steadily since 1980 ; confrontations are rarer still . Other hazards include venomous snakes , including the Eastern timber rattlesnake and copperhead , which are common along the trail . Both snakes are generally found in drier , rockier sections of the trail ; the copperhead 's range extends north to around the New Jersey – New York state line , while rattlesnakes are commonly found along the trail in Connecticut and have been reported , although rarely , as far north as New Hampshire . Other large mammals commonly sighted include deer ; elk , reintroduced in the Smoky Mountains ; and moose , which may be found in the vicinity of Massachusetts and northward . 
 For most hikers , the most persistent pests along the trail are ticks , mosquitos , and black flies along with the mice that inhabit shelters . 
 = = = Plants = = = 
 Plant life along the trail is varied . The trail passes through several different biomes from south to north , and the climate changes significantly , particularly dependent upon elevation . In the south , lowland forests consist mainly of second @-@ growth ; nearly the entire trail has been logged at one time or another . There are , however , a few old growth locations along the trail , such as Sages Ravine straddling the Massachusetts @-@ Connecticut border and atop higher peaks along the trail on either side of the same border , the Hopper ( a glacial cirque westward of the trail as it traverses Mt . Greylock in Massachusetts ) , and " The Hermitage " , near Gulf <unk> in Maine . In the south , the forest is dominated by hardwoods , including oak and tulip trees , also known as yellow poplar . Farther north , tulip trees are gradually replaced by maples and birches . Oaks begin to disappear in Massachusetts . By Vermont , the lowland forest is made up of maples , birch and beech , which provide spectacular foliage displays for hikers in September and October . While the vast majority of lowland forest south of the White Mountains is hardwood , many areas have some coniferous trees as well , and in Maine , these often grow at low elevations . 
 There is a drastic change between the lowland and subalpine , evergreen forest , as well as another , higher break , at tree line , above which only hardy alpine plants grow . The sub @-@ alpine region is far more prevalent along the trail than true alpine conditions . While it mainly exists in the north , a few mountains in the south have subalpine environments , which are typically coated in an ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce @-@ fir forest . Southern ranges and mountains where sub @-@ alpine environments occur include the Great Smoky Mountains , where sub @-@ alpine environments only begin around 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) in elevation , Roan Highlands on the North Carolina @-@ Tennessee border , where sub @-@ alpine growth descends below 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) , and Mount Rogers and the Grayson Highlands in Virginia , where there is some alpine growth above 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) . Appalachian balds are also found in the Southern highlands , and are believed to occur due to fires or grazing in recent centuries , or in some cases due to thin , sandy soils . Several balds are sprouting trees , and on some , the National Forest service actually <unk> the grasses periodically in order to keep the balds free of trees . 
 = = Topography = = 
 No sub @-@ alpine regions exist between Mount Rogers in Virginia and Mount Greylock in Massachusetts , mainly because the trail stays below 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia to Mount Greylock . Mount Greylock , however , has a large subalpine region , the only such forest in Massachusetts , extending down to 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) , which in the south would be far from the sub @-@ alpine cutoff . This is especially low because Greylock is exposed to prevailing westerly winds , as the summits along its ridgeline rise approximately 200 to 650 feet ( 61 to 198 m ) higher than any other peak in Massachusetts . Farther north , several peaks in Vermont reach into the sub @-@ alpine zone , the bottom of which steadily descends as one proceeds northward , so that by the White Mountains in New Hampshire , it often occurs well below 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) . At Mount Moosilauke , which summits at 4 @,@ 802 feet ( 1 @,@ 464 m ) , the first alpine environment on the trail is reached , where only thin , sporadic flora is interspersed with bare rocks . Between the two regions is the krummholz region , where stunted trees grow with their branches oriented away from the winter 's prevailing northwest wind , thus giving the appearance of flags ( they are often called " flag trees " ) . This region resembles lowland terrain hundreds of miles north in Canada . It also contains many endangered and threatened species . The trail has been rerouted over New Hampshire 's Presidential Range so the Appalachian Mountain Club can protect certain plant life . The alpine cutoff in the Whites is generally between 4 @,@ 200 and 4 @,@ 800 feet ( 1 @,@ 300 and 1 @,@ 500 m ) . Mountains traversed by the A.T. above treeline include Mount Moosilauke , several miles along the Franconia Range and along the Presidential Range . In the Presidentials , the trail climbs as high as 6 @,@ 288 feet ( 1 @,@ 917 m ) on Mount Washington and spends about 13 miles ( 21 km ) continuously above treeline , in the largest alpine environment in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains . 
 The segments of the trail through Pennsylvania are so rocky that hikers refer to the region as " <unk> " . These small rocks — the result of erosion that has worn away the dirt along the trails — can be tough to walk on for extended periods of time without proper hard @-@ soled shoes . 
 In Maine , the trail extends into even harsher environments , and sub @-@ alpine and alpine growth descends to lower elevations . Alpine growth in the state ranges from around 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 760 m ) in the Mahoosuc Range to below 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) in parts of the Hundred @-@ Mile Wilderness , where nearly every area higher than 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) is evergreen forest . These forests include more species of evergreen , as well . In addition to the white pine , spruce and hemlock prevalent further south , Maine has many cedar trees along the trail . Near the northern terminus , there are even some tamarack ( larch ) , a coniferous , pine @-@ needled deciduous tree , which provides displays of yellow in the late fall after the birches and maples have gone bare . The hemlocks in Maine are also notable , as the woolly adelgid , which has ravaged populations further south , has not come into the state yet , and may be unable to make it so far north due to the cold climate . 
 Maine also has several alpine regions . In addition to several areas of the Mahoosuc Range , the <unk> and Old Blue in southern Maine have alpine characteristics despite elevations below 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) . Saddleback Mountain and Mount Bigelow , further north , each only extend a bit above 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) , but have long alpine areas , with no tree growth on the summits and unobstructed views on clear days . From Mount Bigelow , the trail extends for 150 miles ( 240 km ) with only a small area of alpine growth around 3 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) on the summit of White Cap Mountain . Mount Katahdin , the second largest alpine environment in the eastern United States , has several square miles of alpine area on the flat " table land " summit as well as the cliffs and <unk> leading up to it . <unk> on Mount Katahdin is only around 3 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . This elevation in Massachusetts would barely be a sub @-@ alpine region , and , south of Virginia , consists of lowland forest . This illustrates the drastic change in climate over 2 @,@ 000 miles ( 3 @,@ 200 km ) . 
 Despite the alpine environments well below 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) in New Hampshire and Maine , some higher places farther south are not alpine . Examples include <unk> Bald in North Carolina 5 @,@ 342 feet ( 1 @,@ 628 m ) and <unk> Dome in Great Smoky Mountains National Park 6 @,@ 643 feet ( 2 @,@ 025 m ) . 
 = = Hiking the trail = = 
 The Appalachian Trail is much more frequently hiked south to north ( that is , Georgia to Maine ) than vice versa . Hikers typically begin in March or April and finish in late summer or early to late fall of that particular year . Bicycles are prohibited from the trail except for the sections which follow the C & O Canal in Maryland and the Virginia Creeper Trail in Virginia . Horses and pack animals are prohibited except horses on the C & O Canal and in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park . Several short segments of the trail , in towns and scenic natural areas , were built to ADA accessibly standards for wheelchair use . 
 = = = Navigation = = = 
 Throughout its length , the AT is marked by 2 by 6 inches ( 5 by 15 cm ) white paint blazes . Side trails to shelters , viewpoints and parking areas use similarly shaped blue blazes . In past years , some sections of the trail also used metal diamond markers with the AT logo , few of which survive . 
 = = = Lodging and camping = = = 
 Most hikers carry a lightweight tent , tent hammock or tarp . The trail has more than 250 shelters and campsites available for hikers . The shelters , sometimes called lean @-@ tos ( in Maine , Massachusetts , and Connecticut ) , huts ( in Shenandoah National Park ) , or Adirondack shelters , are generally open , three @-@ walled structures with a wooden floor , although some shelters are much more complex in structure . Shelters are usually spaced a day 's hike or less apart , most often near a water source ( which may be dry ) and with a privy . They generally have spaces for tent sites in the vicinity as the shelters may be full . The Appalachian Mountain Club ( AMC ) operates a system of eight huts along 56 miles ( 90 km ) of New Hampshire 's White Mountains . These huts are significantly larger than standard trail shelters and offer full @-@ service lodging and meals during the summer months . The Fontana Dam Shelter in North Carolina is more commonly referred to as the Fontana Hilton because of amenities ( e.g. flush toilets ) and its proximity to an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet and post office . Several AMC huts have an extended self @-@ service season during the fall , with two extending self @-@ service seasons through the winter and spring . The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club maintains trail cabins , shelters , and huts throughout the Shenandoah region of Virginia . 
 Shelters are generally maintained by local volunteers . Almost all shelters have one or more pre @-@ hung food hangers ( generally consisting of a short nylon cord with an upside @-@ down tuna can suspended halfway down its length ) where hikers can hang their food bags to keep them out of the reach of rodents . In hiker lingo , these are sometimes called " mouse trapezes . " 
 In addition to official shelters , many people offer their homes , places of business , or inns to accommodate AT hikers . One example is the Little <unk> Pond camps maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club . Inns are more common in sections of the trail that coincide with national parks , most notably Virginia 's Shenandoah National Park . 
 = = = Trail towns = = = 
 The trail crosses many roads , thus providing ample opportunity for hikers to hitchhike into town for food and other supplies . Many trail towns are accustomed to hikers passing through , and thus many have hotels and hiker @-@ oriented accommodations . Some of the most well @-@ known trail towns are Hot Springs , North Carolina ; Erwin , Tennessee ; Damascus , Virginia ; Harpers Ferry , West Virginia ; Duncannon , Pennsylvania ; Port Clinton , Pennsylvania ; Hanover , New Hampshire ; and Monson , Maine . In the areas of the trail closer to trail towns , many hikers have experienced what is sometimes called " trail magic , " or assistance from strangers through kind actions , gifts , and other forms of encouragement . Trail magic is sometimes done anonymously . In other instances , persons have provided food and cooked for hikers at a campsite . 
 = = = Hazards = = = 
 The Appalachian Trail is relatively safe . Most injuries or incidents are consistent with comparable outdoor activities . Most hazards are related to weather conditions , human error , plants , animals , diseases , and fellow humans encountered along the trail . 
 Many animals live around the trail , with bears , snakes , and wild boars posing the greatest threat to human safety . Several <unk> and bug @-@ borne illnesses are also a potential hazard . In scattered instances , foxes , raccoons , and other small animals may bite hikers , posing risk of rabies and other diseases . There has been one reported case ( in 1993 ) of hantavirus ( <unk> ) , a rare but dangerous rodent @-@ borne disease affecting the lungs . The afflicted hiker recovered and hiked the trail the following year . The section of the trail that runs through the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England states has a very high population of deer ticks carrying Lyme and other tick @-@ borne diseases , and corresponds to the highest density of reported Lyme Disease in the country . 
 Poison ivy is common the length of the trail , and more plentiful in the South . 
 The weather is another major consideration of hikers on the trail . Hiking season of the trail generally starts in mid @-@ to @-@ late spring , when conditions are much more favorable in the South . However , this time may also be characterized by extreme heat , sometimes in excess of 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) . Under such conditions , hydration is imperative . Light clothing and sunscreens are a must at high elevations and areas without foliage , even in relatively cool weather . Farther north and at higher elevations , the weather can be cold , characterized by low temperatures , strong winds , hail or snow storms and reduced visibility . Prolonged rain , though not typically life @-@ threatening , can undermine stamina and ruin supplies . In March 2015 , a hiker was killed on the trail in Maryland when a large tree blew over and fell onto him . 
 Violent crime , including murder , has occurred on the trail in a few instances . Most have been crimes by non @-@ hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker @-@ victims . The official website of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy points out that the number of violent crimes is extremely low when compared against the number of people ( 3 to 4 million ) who hike on the trail every year . 
 The first reported homicide on the trail was in 1974 in Georgia . In 1981 , the issue of violence on the Appalachian Trail received national attention when Robert Mountford , Jr. and Laura Susan Ramsay , both social workers in Ellsworth , Maine , were murdered by Randall Lee Smith . Another homicide occurred in May 1996 , when two women were abducted , bound and murdered near the trail in Shenandoah National Park . The primary suspect was later discovered harassing a female <unk> in the vicinity , but charges against him were dropped , and the case remains unsolved . 
 Human error can lead to casualties as well . In July 2013 , 66 @-@ year @-@ old lone hiker Geraldine <unk> disappeared on the trail in Maine . She got very lost and survived 26 days before dying . Her remains were found 2 years later in October 2015 . In October 2015 , a hiker visiting from England was killed on the trail by falling while taking photos at the Annapolis Rocks overlook in Maryland . 
 = = = Trail completion = = = 
 Trail hikers who attempt to complete the entire trail in a single season are called " thru @-@ hikers " ; those who traverse the trail during a series of separate trips are known as " section @-@ hikers " . Rugged terrain , weather extremes , illness , injury , and the time and effort required make thru @-@ hiking difficult to accomplish . Per 2014 estimates around 2700 hikers attempted to thru @-@ hike the trail . 
 Historically , only about 10 % to 15 % of those who make the attempt report to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy that they completed it . However , since 2001 , the number of people starting out in Georgia to do a thru @-@ hike ( or at least registering to do so ) has dropped considerably , yet the number of people reporting that they have completed a thru @-@ hike has remained approximately the same . This has resulted in an apparent increase in the completion rate to 29 % ( as of 2006 ) . 
 A thru @-@ hike generally requires five to seven months , although some have done it in three months , and several trail runners have completed the trail in less time . Trail runners typically tackle the AT with automobile support teams , without backpacks , and without camping in the woods . 
 The current speed record for a supported thru @-@ hike of the AT was set by Scott Jurek in 2015 , at 46 days , 8 hours , and 7 minutes . Jurek made the trip northbound , from late May to mid @-@ July , breaking the previous ( 2011 ) record by Jennifer <unk> Davis by just 3 hours . The current speed record for a self @-@ supported ( meaning no vehicle or crew support , implying carrying a heavy backpack ) thru @-@ hike was set by Heather " Anish " Anderson . She completed the trail , southbound , on September 24 , 2015 , in 54 days 7 hours and 48 minutes . She broke the previous ( 2013 ) record by Matthew Kirk by 4 days and 2 hours . 
 Thru @-@ hikers are classified into many informal groups . " Purists " are hikers who stick to the official AT trail , follow the white blazes , except for side trips to shelters and camp sites . " Blue Blazers " cut miles from the full route by taking side trails marked by blue blazes . The generally pejorative name " Yellow Blazers , " a reference to yellow road stripes , is given to those who hitchhike to move either down or up the trail . 
 Most thru @-@ hikers walk northward from Georgia to Maine , and generally start out in early spring and follow the warm weather as it moves north . These " north @-@ bounders " are also called <unk> ( <unk> ) or GAME ( Georgia ( GA ) -to @-@ Maine ( ME ) ) , while those heading in the opposite direction are termed " south @-@ bounders " ( also <unk> or MEGA ) . 
 Part of hiker subculture includes making colorful entries in logbooks at trail shelters , signed using pseudonyms called " trail names " . 
 The Appalachian Trail Conservancy gives the name " 2000 Miler " to anyone who completes the entire trail . The ATC 's recognition policy for " 2000 <unk> " gives equal recognition to thru @-@ hikers and section @-@ hikers , operates on the honor system , and recognizes blue @-@ blazed trails or officially required <unk> as substitutes for the official , white @-@ blazed route during an emergency such as a flood , forest fire , or impending storm on an exposed , high @-@ elevation stretch . As of 2010 , more than 11 @,@ 000 people had reported completing the entire trail . About three @-@ quarters of these are thru @-@ hikers . 
 The Appalachian Trail , the Continental Divide Trail , and the Pacific Crest Trail form what is known as the Triple Crown of long @-@ distance hiking in the United States . In 2001 , Brian Robinson became the first one to complete all three trails in a year . In 2015 , Heather Anderson ( trail name " Anish " ) became the first woman to hold the unsupported record on the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail simultaneously .

 The trail is currently protected along more than 99 % of its course by federal or state ownership of the land or by right @-@ of @-@ way . The trail is maintained by a variety of citizen organizations , environmental advocacy groups , governmental agencies and individuals . Annually , more than 4 @,@ 000 volunteers contribute over 175 @,@ 000 hours of effort on the Appalachian Trail , an effort coordinated largely by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy ( ATC ) organization . In total , the AT passes through eight national forests and two national parks . 
 In the course of its journey , the trail follows the ridge line of the Appalachian Mountains , crossing many of its highest peaks , and running , with only a few exceptions , almost continuously through wilderness . The trail used to traverse many hundreds of miles of private property ; currently 99 % of the trail is on public land .

 Virginia has 550 miles ( 890 km ) of the trail , by far the longest of any state , including about 20 miles ( 32 km ) along the West Virginia border . With the climate , and the timing of northbound hikers , this section is wet and challenging because of the spring thaw and heavy spring rainfall . Substantial portions closely parallel the Blue Ridge Parkway and , in Shenandoah National Park , Skyline Drive . Parts of the trail near the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Skyline Drive are often considered the best for beginner hikers .

 Maryland has 41 miles ( 66 km ) of the trail , with elevations ranging from 230 to 1 @,@ 880 feet ( 70 to 573 m ) . Most of the trail runs along the ridgeline of South Mountain in South Mountain State Park . Hikers are required to stay at designated shelters and campsites . The trail runs through the eastern edge of Greenbrier State Park . This can serve as a luxurious stop point for a hot shower and a visit to the camp store . The trail runs along the C & O Canal <unk> route for 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) . Hikers will also pass High Rock , which offers spectacular views and is a popular hang @-@ gliding site .

 Pennsylvania has 229 @.@ 6 miles ( 369 @.@ 5 km ) of the trail . The trail extends from the Pennsylvania – Maryland line at Pen Mar , a tiny town straddling the state line , to the Delaware Water Gap , at the Pennsylvania – New Jersey border . The Susquehanna River is generally considered the dividing line between the northern and southern sections of the Pennsylvania AT . South of the Susquehanna , the trail passes through Pine Grove Furnace State Park . The Pennsylvania section of the trail north of the Susquehanna , from Duncannon until the Delaware Water Gap , is noted for its eroded and rocky terrain which can slow hiking . 
 = = = New Jersey = = = 
 New Jersey is home to 72 @.@ 2 miles ( 116 @.@ 2 km ) of the trail . The trail enters New Jersey from the south on a pedestrian walkway along the Interstate 80 bridge over the Delaware River , ascends from the Delaware Water Gap to the top of Kittatinny Mountain in Worthington State Forest , passes Sunfish Pond ( right ) , continues north through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and Stokes State Forest and eventually reaches High Point State Park , the highest peak in New Jersey ( a side trail is required to reach the actual peak ) . It then turns in a southeastern direction along the New York border for about 30 miles ( 48 km ) , passing over long sections of boardwalk bridges over marshy land , then entering Wawayanda State Park and then the Abram S. Hewitt State Forest just before entering New York near Greenwood Lake . In New Jersey the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference maintains and updates the Appalachian Trail . 
 Black bear activity along the trail in New Jersey increased rapidly starting in 2001 . Hence , metal bear @-@ proof trash boxes are in place at all New Jersey shelters . 
 = = = New York = = = 
 New York 's 88 @.@ 4 miles ( 142 @.@ 3 km ) of trail contain very little elevation change compared to other states . From south to north , the trail summits many small mountains under 1 @,@ 400 feet ( 430 m ) in elevation , its highest point in New York being Prospect Rock at 1 @,@ 433 feet ( 437 m ) , and only 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) from the border with New Jersey . The trail continues north , climbing near Fitzgerald Falls , passing through Sterling Forest , and then entering Harriman State Park and Bear Mountain State Park . The lowest point on the entire Appalachian Trail is in the Bear Mountain Zoo 124 feet ( 38 m ) . It crosses the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge . It then passes through Fahnestock State Park , and continues northeast and crosses the Metro @-@ North Railroad 's Harlem Line . This track crossing is the site of the only train station along the trail 's length . It enters Connecticut via the Pawling Nature Reserve . The section of the trail that passes through Harriman and Bear Mountain State Parks is the oldest section of the trail , completed in 1923 . A portion of this section was paved by 700 volunteers with 800 granite @-@ slab steps followed by over a mile of walkway supported by stone crib walls with boulders lining the path . The project took four years , cost roughly $ 1 million , and was officially opened in June 2010 . The project was done by the New York – New Jersey Trail Conference . The New York – New Jersey Trail Conference maintains and updates the Appalachian Trail in New York . 
 = = = Connecticut = = = 
 Connecticut 's 52 miles ( 84 km ) of trail lie almost entirely along the ridges to the west above the Housatonic River valley . 
 The state line is also the western boundary of a 480 acres ( 190 ha ) Connecticut reservation inhabited by Schaghticoke Indians . Inside it , the AT roughly parallels its northern boundary , crossing back outside it after 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) .
